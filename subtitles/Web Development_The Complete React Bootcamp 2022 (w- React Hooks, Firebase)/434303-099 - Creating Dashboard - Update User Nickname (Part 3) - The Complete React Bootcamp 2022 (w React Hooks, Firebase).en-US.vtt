00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
Hey,

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.190
welcome in this video.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.540
We're going to continue built our dashboard edible update our real nickname inside riel

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.610
Time database.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.520
Let's go.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.580
In the last video,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.850
we created creditable input.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.480
And we define this on safe function that we passed down to edit herbal input.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.520
So this callback function is going to receive our final input when we click on save button

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.350
So let's now use this data and update our database.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.520
.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.900
So,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.770
as before,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.220
we're gonna use our database,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.260
object to access database.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.760
Then we need to choose pacify reference to the database.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.040
So we're gonna put profiles slash We're gonna use string of their police in here.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.410
We will put profile.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.480
Don't user,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.000
I d.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.400
Now we need to update only nickname.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.070
We don't want to have created that.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.390
So we need to be more precise when it comes to referencing something inside real time

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.980
database.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.870
So we need to reference this name over here.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.960
What we can do,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.940
we can actually reference it in two ways.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.890
We can put your slash over here and put the name or I prefer another way just to make it,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.090
you know,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.480
more user friendly.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.090
I would put child over here and here.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.100
I also need to specify path,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.520
but this path will be a relative to the path that we specified inside first reference.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.590
So let's push this name.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.430
So we gonna specified child off this path inside database,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.070
all right.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.750
Or actually,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.540
let's put it in a valuable let's put it,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.420
let's say,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.810
user Nick name,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.610
ref.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.520
Then we're gonna define a try catch block because we're going to work with asynchronous

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.870
data and promises.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.400
So here we're gonna pour,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.950
await,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.760
and then we simply call user name nickname ralf dot sat,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.230
which will write data to the database.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.330
And here we're gonna put new data that we receive as an argument.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.310
After that,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:06.410
we will not If I user with success message and we will say nickname has Bean updated and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.860
again for seconds and for any other we're gonna put at her message where we will put our

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.730
message as its text and also four seconds.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.590
All right,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.780
Seems nice.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.860
Let's check it out.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.480
Let's navigate back to the app when I click on edit let me change my nickname to enter Be

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.660
than I click safe and nickname has been updated And if we go back to later base.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.870
You can see that the actual data is changed.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.570
Let's try one more time.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.990
Let's put just I do know nd I click safe.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.900
Nickname has been updated.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.490
Database is updated.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.630
Everything seemed nice away.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.150
If you still have a question.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.310
Why exactly this?

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.860
Hey,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.340
Andy being updated when we update the actual data inside the database.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.860
Okay,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.690
One more time for explanation.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.530
Inside our provider context,

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.940
we used subscriptions,

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.450
real time listeners for our data.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.610
So for use a reference,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.430
which is our database path under profiles,

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.980
user I d.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.260
We put real time listener these call back.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.360
So this cold back fired every time something changes under these path inside database.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.660
So if let's say name changes under user I d than these call back will be fired and we will

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.780
update profile state with this data object,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.550
which will be new at the time when these Colback is fired.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.360
So the same applies for created at or for any other filled.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.580
So if we had something like age over here,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.680
and if age has been changed than these Colback will be fired and so one all right,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.270
I guess that's fine.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.070
And you get it.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.650
Now let's commit our changes and finish the video.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.690
So let's good get at everything.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.730
Then let's put Pete commit,

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.190
Let's say updated nickname inside the database.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.590
All right.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.360
Looks good.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.750
See you in the next one.
