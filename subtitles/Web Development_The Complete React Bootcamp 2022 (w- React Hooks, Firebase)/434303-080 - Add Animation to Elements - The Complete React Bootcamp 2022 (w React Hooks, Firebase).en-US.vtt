00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.030
Hey there.

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.230
I know it must be the deployment video,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.150
but right before that part,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.690
I want to add one more extra step.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.610
Wouldn't it be nice if we had an animation on our cards elements as they appear?

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.980
So now when we click on the search bottom,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.350
they just pop up.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.590
Wouldn't it be nice if we had a simple fading?

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.450
So it looks more smooth?

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.350
Well,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.740
we can get used an external library for this purpose.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.060
Let's open and PM registry,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.060
and here we can type,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.750
react,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.550
fade in.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.840
And as our first search is going to be reactivating library,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.990
let's open it.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.460
And from the preview,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.950
we can see that it's at this simple animation,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.590
and from the user's part we can see that we simply need to import an element.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.900
And then every element that goes insight will be animated.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.280
So let's first install it.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.930
I'll just copy the command and then I will execute it inside my terminal.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.930
So while it is installing,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.420
let's take a look how we can integrate it.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.750
So let's take a look inside the great component.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.450
Here we have this flex grid element that wraps every card.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.170
So what we can do and what I proposed to do.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.650
Instead of using directly fade in,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.780
we can extend its styles and overwrite it with flex grit.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.320
So let's open styled GS,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.100
the place where we have flags.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.460
Grit.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.270
So instead of creating styled dif,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.030
we can do styled fade in to override styles and put our own flex on top of it.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.930
So let's take a look.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.390
If our library has been installed,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.080
it is.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.350
Let's run the APP,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:55.850
and then let's copy the import part from here and put it inside our app.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.750
And right now,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.690
when we save it,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.620
let's take a look at our cart.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.060
If I refresh the page by attention to the cards,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.980
when I will click on the search button and I click and now we have this simple Faden pretty

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.410
cool,

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.780
and the same will apply for actor cars because they are also part of it.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.570
So when I click on the search right now,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.560
our cards are animated,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.160
all right.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.660
Good.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.000
So this is it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.250
Let's commit our changes and next video will be definitely about deployment.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.510
So we're gonna put get at everything and then get commit and let's say edit animation,

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.050
Teoh cards using react frayed in.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.180
All right,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.550
see you in the next one
