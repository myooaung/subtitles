Hi, In this video,

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:05.040
I will show you how to install VS code on MacOS,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.709
go to Google search and type fiasco,

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.200
then click on the Download button

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.585
and it will bring you to the download page.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:14.745
Click on MacOS installer.

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:17.520
It will automatically started download for you,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.020
wait until it's done.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
And that opened the file inside you will see the VS code.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.340
I can shortcut, just drag and drop

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.255
the icon on applications right after that,

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:31.280
VS Code is considered to be

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.220
installed and you can access it by going into lunch,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.935
but then search for VS Code,

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:40.430
open and verify that everything is okay.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.585
And that's all.

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:43.980
