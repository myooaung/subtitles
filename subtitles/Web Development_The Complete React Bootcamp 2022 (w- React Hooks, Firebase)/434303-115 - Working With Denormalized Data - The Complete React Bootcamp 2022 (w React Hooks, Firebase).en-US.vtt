00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.050
Hey,

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.170
now we have lust message inside shattering list.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.760
But here is the problem because we duplicate data now.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.700
If let's say I go to my dashboard and I update my nickname to something else,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.050
let's save to show look 16.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.350
Then they also update my avatar.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.250
If I upload it,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.000
it is being uploaded.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.330
But last message is not being updated because these data is duplicated inside database.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.860
So we need to take care of that when we update the actual data.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.260
If we do some changes,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.120
we'll make sure that we also update all references that we duplicated.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.370
Let's not get back to code and let's navigate to dashboard,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.510
Let's go to Dashboard Togo and then go to dashboard.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.290
And here,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.270
instead of this user nickname rough set new data.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.820
We need to find a way to update all references.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.780
So what I proposed to do,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.780
I want to propose to create a helper function that will get all the references inside our

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.500
database,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.720
and then we can update our database with old that reference.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.450
Actually,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.860
it will be the same as we did inside Chad bottom when we created this updates object and we

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.670
specified multiple passed to perform an atomic operation,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.020
so it will be basically the same.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.350
So we can call this function like this.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.050
Let's define how we will do it.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.300
So instead of a weight user nickname Raff set,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.560
we're gonna call,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.690
Let's say we will receive updates and because we will access our database,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.390
it will be in a sentence operation.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.040
We will name it.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.000
Let's say get user updates inside.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.650
We will pass User I d which is going to be profile adore your i d.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.620
Then we will pass the key that we need to update.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.630
So in our case,

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.310
it will be name and then we will pass the actual value,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.120
which is going to be new data like this.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.300
So now we need to create dysfunction.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.350
Let's navigate two helpers,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.220
she s and here at the bottom,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.210
let's export function de trouble name get user updates.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.210
So it is going to be anything function and it will receive user i d.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.120
Then it will receive key to update and also it will receive value.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.310
And maybe let's also pass the database object along with our function.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.110
So here we're gonna pass also this database object that we have inside misc fireplace just

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.620
for convenience like this.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.870
So now inside of helpers,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.050
we can also have database over here.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.840
Now we're going to create an empty object.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.860
Indefinable coal updates than our first update will be the actual value that we're trying

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.060
to update so updates.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:03.270
Then will go profiles slash user i d than slash key to update,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.000
and it will be set to value.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.490
Now we need to get the actual references.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.480
So our references are Let's take a look messages message I D.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.470
Than author than avatar created at in Also rooms.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.570
Last message.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.350
So what we will do?

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.050
We will define a few promises because there are multiple promises.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.700
We don't want to make them one by one.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.650
We want to execute them at once.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.980
That's why we will define our promises.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.500
And then we will await all of them with promise dot All our first promise is going to be

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.350
get messages and it is going to be db dot Ralf dar messages,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.310
then to get messages where Let's say this author,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.420
I d equals you our user,

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.950
I d.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.140
We need to first full order by child.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.200
Then we need to specify what child.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200
We went to reference.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.870
So in our case reference messages So we have the message object.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.690
Then we have author slash user i D.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.650
So let's put order by author slash user i d.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.330
And then this key will be equal to user i d.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:22.690
That we receive as an argument and then we're gonna put one's value to get the actual value

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.690
.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.260
Then our second promise is going to be get user rooms,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.170
which is going to be DB reference slash rooms.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.840
Then again,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.870
we need to put order by child.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.140
And this time,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.510
if we open the rooms,

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.290
we have less message slash author slash user i d.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.510
So let's boy last message Author,

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.670
user I d.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.940
And then equal to user i d.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.270
And again once value.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.150
Now that we have these two promises in unresolved state,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.860
we need to resolve them.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.880
For this reason,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.280
we're gonna create a weight promise that all inside we need to pass an array of promises

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.830
which is going to be get messages and get rooms like this and get messages will return us

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.270
snapshot off messages and get rooms will return us a snapshot off rooms.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.390
So here we're gonna d structure them.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.080
First element is get messages.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.040
So we're gonna first receive message,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.370
snapshot or messages.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.960
Snap shirt.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.120
A second is going to be rooms,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.860
snap shirt,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.720
which we will name corresponding Klay am snatcher and Air Snapshot.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.740
Then for every message that we have with user idea,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.860
we're gonna call for each so message snapshot for each message that we receive,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.650
we will get message snapshot,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.050
and here we're gonna call updates.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.090
Then we're gonna poor messages slash message snapshot dot key,

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.920
which represents the message i d.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.920
So we will have an object with all of these messages,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.430
and key is going to be this idee off message.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.890
All right,

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.020
so message key slash author slash key to update.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.180
So in that way,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.480
we reference messages author and the kid that we want to update,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.170
whether it is Allah car name your I d or created at.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.590
And then for this key to update,

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.490
we're gonna put value and exactly the same we will do for our snapshot.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.610
So let's actually copy it.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.360
And instead of m snapshot,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.870
let's poor air snapshot,

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.370
which is room,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.560
snap shirt and then for updates,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.150
we're gonna put rooms,

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.040
then we will get room snapshot dot key,

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.060
which will be the room i d.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.620
Then here we will have last message.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.900
Then we will have author and then key to update with value.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.520
All right.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.820
And right after that we're gonna return the updates object that we've created.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.160
Now let's say what Let's navigate to you dashboard lets and commented,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.600
and let's actually important this object from helpers,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.820
but it seems like it can be automatically imported.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:12.390
So let's import get user updates from Let's reference our helpers misc helpers and it seems

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.170
like not found right,

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.410
so get you there.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.000
Update.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.340
All right,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.790
get you there.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.380
Updates like that.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.660
Okay,

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.190
Perfect.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.460
Now that we have updates,

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:27.120
instead of calling this function over here and instead of referencing the actual data,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:34.740
we can actually call just database dot ref door update with updates.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.950
Then we will awaited and we will remove all of that and also all of that.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.230
Now let's save it and let's actually also open.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.680
Applaud Bt,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.350
in which uploads our avatar and let's find the logic.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.760
So here again,

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.020
as so we did hear inside dashboard lets copy it and instead,

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.450
off again the referencing the child element and then updating like this.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:07.620
Let's put updates would get your updates than for profile i d.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:14.250
We're gonna update avatar this time and Avatar is going to be Don't load euro like that.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.660
Now let's remove this reference.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.040
Let's remove this user avatar set.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.350
Let's caught be this logic.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.960
Let's put it here and now let's take a look.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.260
If it actually worked,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.080
let's navigate back to code.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.420
Let me the fresh just in case if I go to dashboard,

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.450
if I click on change,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.680
my nickname Okay,

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.640
maybe I'm going to say hello.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.770
New name.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:45.350
If I click safe nickname has been updated and I still have and to be over here.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.080
Okay,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.850
maybe you let me check Dashboard one.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.590
My time.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.190
I have name over here.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.370
Let's consul log updates and let's take a look.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.960
What's wrong over here?

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.550
If I inspect,

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.690
I go to console I update my nickname.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.650
I received this type of updates,

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.360
messages,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.370
profiles,

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:03.970
all right,

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.930
but I don't update my last message.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.790
So that's weird.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.380
Let's navigate Teoh helpers.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.660
And here let's take a look.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.870
Author key to update.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.690
Okay,

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.080
snap shirt lost.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.580
Author,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.050
your I D Let's check our database.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:20.960
Last message.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.350
Author,

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.690
Your I D Which is user I d that we pass.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.110
Oh,

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.860
excuse me.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.740
Here must be not last here.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.120
Must be less message.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.090
Let's save it.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.990
And now one more time.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.460
Let's change our nickname.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:33.890
Tiu.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.710
Let's say she looks 22.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.820
If I update my nickname,

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.700
it is being updated over here.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.300
Perfect.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:46.200
Now let's check for Al Atar If I upload a new image again,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.140
Avatar has been obviated.
