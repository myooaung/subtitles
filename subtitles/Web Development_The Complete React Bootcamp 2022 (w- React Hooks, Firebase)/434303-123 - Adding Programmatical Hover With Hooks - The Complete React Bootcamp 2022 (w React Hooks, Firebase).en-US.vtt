00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
Hello.

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.060
In this video,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.260
we will add pro grammatical hover to chart elements,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.220
and it will serve as a foundation for upcoming videos.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.210
Let's get started.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.560
Our pro grammatical,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.080
however,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.350
will be managed by a custom hook,

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.800
and we confined this hook on the Internet.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.480
So let's opening Google and let's just type use hooks and then use hover.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.830
Then let's open the first link that lets get the code snippet and let's copy this hook.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.710
I'm going to copy all that function.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.830
Then I'm gonna get back to the code than inside custom hooks at the end.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.920
I'm gonna upend this function,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.500
and I'm going to export it from here.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.450
And also I need to use use draft for that one.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.090
So let me imported.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.650
And as I can see,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.040
I have this unnecessary dependency.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.000
But that's not exactly true.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.980
So let's add Yes,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.220
Lind,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.430
warning for this line.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.750
And also let's modify this hook a little bit instead off conditionally returning the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.850
cleanup function.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.980
Let's move this return here to the very end.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.330
All right,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.580
now we're ready with the hook.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.940
Let's navigate to message item and here we are going to use that hook.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.160
So at the top.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.260
We're going to create a new valuable,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.270
and we're gonna call use,

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.690
however,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.180
Hook.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.140
So this use Howard Hook.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.520
It returns us an array off exactly two elements where first element is the reference that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.210
we need to assign to the element.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.260
So let's name itself reference and then actually the bullet valued that indicates whether

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.690
this element is currently hovered or not.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.180
So let's call it the the self ref and let's pass it to this L I element.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.650
So reference is going to be self ref.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.180
Now we can actually use this bullion value and we can do something,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.670
but that so for now what I propose to do,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.120
I just want Teoh change the background color whenever we are hovered.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.900
So let's poor dynamic clustering for this ally element.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.070
So let's rob this shrink in brackets and let's use Rincon trip elation.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.750
And first I'm gonna add cars are a pointer to this ally element.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.870
So we know that whenever we hover,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.250
something is going to happen.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.970
And then I'm gonna ask if our ally is Howard,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.970
Let me change it to Harvard.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.700
Then I'm gonna display background black off 0.2% each.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.330
Otherwise,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.650
no class name at all.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.130
Now,

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.990
if I navigate back to code,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.200
I can see that whenever I however,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.570
I can get my background.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.930
So this is it.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.890
And that's the end of this video.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.650
Let's commit our changes.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.410
Let's put everything to the stage stayed.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.010
Then let's commit with the edit pro grammatical hover.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.030
All right,

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.390
see you in the next one.
