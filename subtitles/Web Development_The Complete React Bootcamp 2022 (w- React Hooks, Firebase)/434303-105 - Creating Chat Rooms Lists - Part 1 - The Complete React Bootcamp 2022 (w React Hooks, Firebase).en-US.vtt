00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.810
Hey,

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.590
In this video,

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.720
we will start creating Chatham List Inside sidebar Here at the bottom.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.760
Let's go.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.830
Let's hope inside Bardo GS in the first place.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.450
And here,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.510
right after a creature on Bt and Moto,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.000
we're gonna put divider component from our suit and inside bubble past.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.350
Join conversation text.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.460
And also,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.720
let's move this import to the top to avoid excellent warning.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.130
Let's check it out.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.240
It looks good.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.450
Now we need to actually define components.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.400
So under Components folder,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.910
let's create new folder that people name rooms here.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.560
We're gonna put two new files chat room list dot GS and room item.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.390
Don't Yes,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.280
so room item is going to be empty by now.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.550
And actually the same applies for chatroom list inside side Bardo Gs Here at the bottom.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.620
Instead of this text that we used as a placeholder,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.870
let's use chat room list.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.370
All right,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.100
let's save it.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.170
Let's take a look.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.680
We can actually see the Hello text so it worked.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.470
Perfect.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.970
Now let's define the market.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.010
Let's hope in Chatham List and here we're gonna put enough component from our suit for the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.190
props will pass appearance Satel.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.150
Then it is going to be vertical and reversed.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.230
And for class name,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.430
we will pass the next.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.480
So we need to make this component this elements crawl a ble.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.220
So we're gonna pass overflow on Why?

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.640
Access scroll.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.110
So we will see the scroll bar always.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.900
And also we're gonna pass customs Crow to make it styled.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.500
All right,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.690
And then inside bubble past enough dot itim and then room item like that.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.430
All right,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.490
let's take a look.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.270
Okay.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.070
Looks perfect.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.540
We can seize crowbar,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.170
and we can see that it is styled a little bit.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.750
Okay,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.110
good.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.300
Now let's define our markup for room item.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.890
So we will split it into two.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.590
Dave's inside top,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.720
part and bottom,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.790
part inside.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.650
Bottom part,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.120
we're going to define our text.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.150
So we're gonna put spun element,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.370
and we're gonna put no messages yet for now and for the class name.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.310
We're going to specify that it is going to be display flex align items center,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.480
and we will apply text black off 70% capacity.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.300
Okay.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.630
For the top part,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.030
we're gonna put here room name and how much time ago?

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.000
The last message has been published.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.540
So let's define class.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.510
Name off display flex,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:47.690
then justify content between two ad space between our elements and then align items center

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.690
.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.780
All right,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.450
so our first element is going to be aged three title with the room name inside.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.530
So first we're gonna define static text,

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.210
and when we will have the actual dynamic values,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.420
we will swab them.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.920
So for H three,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.250
we're gonna specify text disappear to prevent overflow.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.000
And second Element is actually going to be a new component that people install.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.880
So for now,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.460
let's put span and let's take a look at the browser first.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.090
Let's check it out.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.600
How it looks like Okay,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.350
it looks good.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.240
But instead of this x X,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.560
we're gonna use time ago React to show a relative time like this has been published five

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.380
minutes ago.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.830
Two hours ago.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.980
One day go.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.270
So let's install it.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.290
I'm gonna open dogs and just copy this Commend.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.860
Then I'm gonna stop my app and installed this package.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.950
Let's wait and then we will continue.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.630
Okay,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.160
Package has been installed.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.790
Let's start the up again and let's use these package.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.400
So from documentation,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400
I'm going to copy this import.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.730
Then I'm gonna imported to room item and let's copy d company itself.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.800
And let's place it instead of this span so we don't need to localize it.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.850
Then we gonna use new date for now.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.400
Instead,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.900
off this dates drink to just show the current time.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.500
All right,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.880
so let's refresh the app and let's take a look.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.240
Okay,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.400
so now we have just now perfect.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.990
And they will think about this library that it will update this timer,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.620
Let's say in real time,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.620
but I don't like the appearance off this text.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.060
So I'm gonna change class name off time ago,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.500
component a little bit.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.150
So it is going to be formed normal.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.340
And also text black.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.690
Let's say 45 opacity.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.500
Let's take a look right now.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.060
All right.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.370
Looks much better.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.730
Okay,

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.530
let's move on.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.190
And our final think here will be to actually make this component make this chatroom list

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.350
full height.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.290
So for this,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.480
we need to calculate it because our chat is full page.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.820
So how can we do this?

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.050
How can we approach this?

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.060
We know that our full page is 100%.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.970
We can get the height off top part off sidebar,

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.720
and then we can subtract this top part from 100 then we will get to know the rest height,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.550
which is our chat room list.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.450
Let's go.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.390
So let's not big age to slide Bardoczky s And our top part is this Def element.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.850
To get the actual height off this,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.200
def,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.760
we need to use references.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.040
So let's create new reference,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.410
which we will name topside,

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.880
Bar Arraf and we're gonna use use ref hook.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.790
Then we're gonna pass this topside bereft to this def breath is going to be topside by ref

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.790
,

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.090
and we're gonna put height to state so we will keep track of it.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.770
So let's define you stage,

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.950
which will name height and sat tight for now,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.980
by default,

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.700
it will be such to now or 20 it actually doesn't matter inside use effect.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.140
We're going to get the actual height off this def and then said it to state.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.350
So let's put use effect.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.660
And inside this use effect,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.530
let's ask the next.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:17.610
So if we have topside by ref dot current because it can be undefined at some moments,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.140
So we're gonna check if it actually defined,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.940
then we're gonna set height to topside by Ralf,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.050
not current dot scroll height.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.100
So when we try to access topside bereft of current,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.780
it's like we try to access element when we get it with document.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.380
Get element by i t.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.360
So it is very useful in some cases like this.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.730
We also want to run this effect callback function whenever our were topside.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.060
Bar F changes.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.650
All right,

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:54.850
Now let's pass this state this height to Chatham list so we can calculate the actual height

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.850
.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:03.050
So let's pass above element height as height and inside jet room list will d structure

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.250
above element height and then what we will do.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.390
We're gonna apply style in Lyons style,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.700
which is going to be height,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.700
incurable,

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.250
use CSS calculate function.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.710
So let's pork alc.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:24.050
Then we're gonna use 100% age minus above element above element height and at the end,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.000
we're gonna put pixels because this height calms in pixels.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.450
Now let's take a look.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.140
If the app refreshes,

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.810
nothing actually happens.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.250
That's because we didn't cascade were full page height.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.290
So what is happening that inside home dodgy s here?

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.700
Who said h 100 on Lee to the great component,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.500
but to make it work for a nested components as well.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:54.110
We need to set height off 104 all Children for all nested components.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.890
So for row,

00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.120
we're going to specify age 100 and for column will do the same Now.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.470
Inside side wire,

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.380
we already apply H 100 to their upbringing element,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.600
so it will work.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.670
Now let's take a look and let's inspect the component.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:10.220
As you can see,

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:15.820
we already have full height and it is automatically calculated and we will not have any

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.470
overflow.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.790
It will always fit full page height.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.510
So if we inspect this element,

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.980
we can see that height is automatically calculated for us.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.620
So we have 138 pixels,

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.720
which is height off the top part.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.880
Off sidebar.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.500
All right,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.980
so it looks nice.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.230
And I guess this is it for this video and the next one we will continue.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:46.750
So let's add everything to the stage state and let's commit started to work with chat room

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.490
list.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.990
See you in the next one
