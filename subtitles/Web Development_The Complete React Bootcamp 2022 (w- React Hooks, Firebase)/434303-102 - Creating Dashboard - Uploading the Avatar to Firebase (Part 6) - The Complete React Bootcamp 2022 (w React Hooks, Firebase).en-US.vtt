00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
Hey,

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.800
in this video,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.200
we will continue to work on avatar upload between component,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.240
and we will finish off uploading que sera waters.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.070
Let's go.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.860
The first thing quibbled you were going to define a handler for one click event for applaud

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.890
your avatar button.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.500
So let's pacify on click event and let's create a new function that we will name on upload

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.500
.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.350
Click.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.400
Then we're going to put this handler right after on file import change,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.600
and now we need to somehow get access to the actual image.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.380
This time this image is edited.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.710
So we need to get access to this converse element.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.310
So if we inspect it,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.470
it is a converse inside Dom because it is about our editor component that we use from the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.000
package.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.390
All right,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.900
So in order to understand what is actually happening,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.030
how we can get the image we need to navigate to their documentation than if we scroll down

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.030
,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.950
we confined an example off accessing the resulting image.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.370
Here we confined this method get image scaled to converse.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.980
But as we can see from this example,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.970
it uses class based component,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.760
and also it uses something called references.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:27.010
So references in react is the way to access Dom elements directly or react elements

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.870
directly where more appropriately would be to say programmatically.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.210
So let's find out how we can actually put a reference on our avatar editor component inside

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.950
a function based component.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.720
So first,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.360
we need to import a hook that we haven't seen before from react,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.850
which is used ref,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.410
which stands for use reference.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.680
Now we need to create a new reference,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.000
and we will name this reference avatar editor graph,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.020
and we will call this hook like this.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.430
Now,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.320
we need to pass this reference to this component.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.250
So we're going to specify Raph,

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.380
and then we will pour avatar editor rough.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.140
So now we're able to access this,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.800
Let's say,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.340
avatar,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.300
editor component using this reference,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.000
which is our water I did too rough.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.640
So on upload click.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.910
We gonna put Let's take a look.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.630
We need to access this editor.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.980
Get image skill to canvass to access the actual value off this reference.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.290
We need to put the next so let's put converse,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.280
and we're gonna say we will access avatar edita ralf dot current.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.260
So it is current element off this reference because it also can be undefined.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.150
So we make sure that we access the current element.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.410
So next we can access the actual method,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.700
which is going to be get image scaled,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.510
two cameras.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.490
So let's call it.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.280
And now we can actually have our converse element.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.480
But the thing is that we can't work with the converse.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.640
We can't upload it.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.360
We can't actually do anything with that.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.560
So first we need to convert it to some former that we can applaud to fire base so we can

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.660
actually convert Converse to a blob file.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.250
And a bloke file is just a piece off file represented in binary format.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.860
So using this format,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.680
we can applaud.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.020
So,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.680
on every converse element,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.370
we have this method which is called to block,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.960
and the thing with this to block method that it only accept callbacks.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.530
We can't actually use any promises.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.920
So for this I want to convert this Colback based method to a promise.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.050
So to do that,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.750
we will do the next here at the top.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.290
We're going to define a new function that we will name get block,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:02.480
and this function will receive a converse like this and this function is going to return

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.220
and you promise object.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.660
So let's put return new,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.900
I promise.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.760
So we haven't seen it before.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.620
So to create an actual promise,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.050
we need to put a callback insight that receives two arguments,

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.150
result and reject.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.280
So we will call this method to actually resolve or reject the promise.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.210
So here,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.870
inside,

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.380
what we gonna do?

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.520
We're gonna call Converse to Bluff.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.210
Then we're going to specify this call back with the with the result which will be the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.090
actual bluff.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.100
And inside this cold back,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.860
we're going to check.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.620
If our blood exists and everything is fine,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.920
then we're gonna result from this promise we're gonna resolve it.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.640
So result and value is going to be the actual blow up advice.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.360
If we don't have any block elements were going to reject with new error and for error

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.930
message,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.760
we're gonna say of something like file protests ever.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.610
All right,

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.440
so using this way now,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.960
we converted a cold,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.010
back based method to a promise.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.320
So now we can use this get blow up and what we can do,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.410
we're gonna put to try catch block over here and now what we will do we will call this get

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.300
blow up like this.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.650
Then we're gonna put canvas inside.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.000
And because it is a promise,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.360
now we need to awaited.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.710
And in case if we have any error,

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.900
it will be catched by these block over here.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.460
So because we use awaits,

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.910
Index,

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.880
we need to convert this function to anything function.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.500
All right,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:52.080
So result is going to be our blow up that we can applaud to file storage now about storage

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.080
.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.990
How we can do this.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.230
We haven't uploaded anything yet.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.770
Well,

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.990
let's navigate back to Firebase Doggy s.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.680
And here,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.510
let's import another library from Firebase.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:09.870
This time it is going to be firebase slash storage now to actually access storage in

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.690
exactly the same manner we're going to export,

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.030
const storage app dot storage all right.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.380
And the storage A pie is very similar to database storage.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.650
We need to specify the reference which is actually the path to file,

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.130
and then we need to applaud it.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.550
So now here.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.070
First,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.510
we are going to specify the path under which we will store our image.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.720
It is going to be,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.210
let's say,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:45.230
avatar file reference like this so that we were gonna access our storage object from misc

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.120
firebase.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.180
Then we're gonna put dot and then we're gonna call reference.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.930
So we're gonna store our files on their past,

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.960
which s slash profile slash user i d.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.440
So we need to get you there.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.710
I d So let's use use profile hook,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.230
So const profile,

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.780
we will get from use profile.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:15.660
Then we're gonna specify profile dot your i d and let's convert it to string interpolation

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.660
.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.160
And then,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.790
actually,

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.490
let's access child and child is going to be avatar.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.400
All right,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.940
so what we're doing here,

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.180
we actually specify these path inside our storage,

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:36.660
so it will represent our folder and this child it is going to be a file named Avatar.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:42.020
We will not put any extension because it will be automatically picked up by the fire base.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.620
All right,

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.290
now,

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.380
next thing quibbled,

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.060
you will actually upload the file.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.550
So let's put const upload avatar result.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:56.530
Then we're gonna put a weight avatar file Arraf dot put.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.820
And then if we call it,

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.060
we can see that we can actually put either blob or array buffer array.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.790
So let's actually put our blub over here,

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.510
and then Let's also second argument.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.310
We can specify meta data.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.680
So for matter data,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.610
let's specify cash control header.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.420
So we can actually cash our images inside the browser.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.340
So let's put a cash control.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.040
And for cash control,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.350
we're going to specify public than Marx Age.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:33.580
We're going to port 3600 which represents one hour in seconds.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:39.170
Then we're gonna multiplied by 24 to get the actual one day value,

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.360
and then we will multiplied by three.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.250
So now we have marks age off.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.900
Three days specified in seconds.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.500
All right,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.510
so now that we have ah,

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:49.960
Petar,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.550
upload result let me remove this Sammy column from here.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.850
Now that we have a Plourde avatar result,

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:02.260
we need to get the Don't load your l off our file so we can save it to our database.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.450
So here we're gonna put constant download,

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:06.240
Ural.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.750
So we're gonna call upload our water result dot reference.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.420
Do not fool yourself,

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.270
and do not directly call download your l Because,

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.300
as you can see,

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.790
it is deprecate ID to use reference that get don't load euro.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.550
So we're gonna call Ralf,

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.030
and then only then we're gonna call.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.760
Get don't load euro.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.040
It returns a promise.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.350
So let's await it.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.350
And now we can actually store it inside.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:42.140
Our database lets poor user avatar Raff which will represent our reference inside real time

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:42.790
database.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:48.660
So which is going to be database Daut Ralf than it is going to be?

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:56.640
Profiles slash profile dot your i d And then we're gonna put child of a car.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.480
And now we're gonna call user Avatar Raff,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.640
set,

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.190
don't load euro.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.800
And right after that,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:12.720
we're gonna call alert dot info of a car has bean applauded.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.860
And let's put four seconds.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.510
And in case off any editor,

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:23.420
we're going to alert whatever and we will say our message with four seconds as well.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.390
And also right before we save this file,

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.580
let's actually specify the loading state as well.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:36.620
So here we're gonna simply create is loading and set is loading which by default,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.180
will be set your false.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.690
So when we perform all operations right before that,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:47.030
we call set is loading to true.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.250
And then when we are finished,

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.750
we call set is loading to false And in case if we failed,

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.950
we also call Set is loading to false now when we actually use it,

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.420
we actually use it for this button to make it disabled.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:09.240
So disabled is going to be only when we have his loading state enabled.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.170
All right,

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.510
so it was a lot.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:11.830
Now,

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.150
let's actually test it.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.290
So let me refresh the page.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.060
Let me open,

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:16.730
dashboard.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.400
Let me select New Avatar.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.020
Now I'm gonna click on this car.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.520
I'm going to click on Applaud new Avatar,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.400
and I can see Avatar has been applauded.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.200
All right,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.780
now let's first check inside our database.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.030
So it seems like now we have avatar here.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.120
As you can see now,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.950
we have this public who are ill,

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.550
which leads to firebase storage.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.410
Let's check it out.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.750
Our storage.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.860
And here we can see a folder.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.060
Let's click on it.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.910
Then we have user I d.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.350
And inside we have avatar file.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.760
So when we click on it,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.530
you can see we have this your l that we can click,

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.430
and it will open us the image in in you tap.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:03.760
But the thing is that now we successfully uploaded file to fire base storage.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.300
All right,

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.370
so now how can we actually display this image?

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:08.030
Well,

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.920
I guess this is topic for our next video,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.950
because right now it is getting too long.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:14.820
All right,

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.030
so let's save everything to get system.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:24.540
Let's come it our changes and let's say uploaded User Avatar.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.370
All right,

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.650
see you in the next one.
