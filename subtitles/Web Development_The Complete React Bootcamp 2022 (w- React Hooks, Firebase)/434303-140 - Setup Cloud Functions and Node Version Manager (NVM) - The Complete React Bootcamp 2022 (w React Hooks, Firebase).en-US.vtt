00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
Hey there.

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.830
In this video,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.640
we will set up cloud functions inside our firebase project.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.560
Let's go.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.820
Let's navigate back to V s code.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.150
Let's open terminal.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.000
And here we only need to type fire base.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.930
You need functions.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.220
Then it will prompt us with a few questions.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.960
Let's hit.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.450
Yes.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.170
Then let's choose Javascript.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.040
Then four years Lind,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.820
let's select.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.330
Yes,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.890
and let's install all the dependencies.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.380
Okay,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.800
good.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.740
If we look inside functions,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.320
a few files have been created for us.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.770
Yes,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.970
Lynn RC with already pre defined conflict.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.790
Let's not mortify it.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.250
Then we have get ignore Index Dodgy s and packaged Jason,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.360
So index dot gs in cloud functions is an entry point from index togs.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.850
File RealAge to export separate cloud functions that will be deployed separately.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.510
Okay,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.200
inside bike.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.930
It's Jason.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.980
Here we can find a few dependencies.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.830
So yes,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.530
Lind and also firebase admin and functions.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.160
These two packages allow us to access fire base from backend and also we can find a few

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.510
scripts.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:19.260
Define over here serve to actually Ron functions emulator in local environment than we have

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.020
something called Shell and it is firebase shell to actually test our functions and also

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.110
then we have logs and other things such as deploy and start for start script.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.190
Since we're going to test our functions locally,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.680
I proposed to Ron serve instead off Shell.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.830
So let's put it serve and let's save our file.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.390
And also because we are going to access our database locally and by fire base.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.750
It is recognized as an untrusted environment.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.150
We need to provide some sort off authentication or credential in order to make it work.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.890
So for that we need to navigate back to our dashboard.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.280
Then we need to go to project settings and go to service accounts from here.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.040
We need to don't lower new private key.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.650
So let's create one.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.850
It will give us a Jason file.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.590
Let's open it and let's copied the content.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.850
Let's navigate back to the code.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.890
And here inside functions,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.650
let's create new file service account,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.180
does Jason and let's put everything that we've Koppett.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.810
Now,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.860
please make sure that you add this file to get ignore.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.770
This is very important.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.480
So here we add service account that Jason,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.050
so this file must not be publicly available.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.430
This is only for us,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.720
for local development.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.370
Okay,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.760
good.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.370
Now if we open again the service accounts here we can find a small snippet of code,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.210
so let's copy it and let's open index dot Js.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.400
So here we have functions at the top and firebase functions.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.100
Let's place it like this.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.240
And let's also caught the admin and replace VARS with constant Good.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.610
Now we need to specify a service account path which is this one and then put it inside,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.740
admin initialize at when we use cloud functions.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.410
Before we can do anything,

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.090
we need to initialize firebase admin as decayed and for local development,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.760
we need to initialize it like that in order to access the real data in order to access riel

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.520
database.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.860
This is basically it.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.500
However,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.700
there is one important thing to cloud functions.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.300
If we open package of the Jason here we confined engines.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.380
Node eight specify.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.940
The thing is that firebase cloud functions are supported in on Lee two no GS versions,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:58.040
either eight or 10 and recently they dropped support for node version eight completely.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.770
So now firebase cloud functions are basically available with no GIS version.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.120
Ted,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.840
this might be a little small problem right now.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.390
We use no Js version 12 and we need to somehow manage our cloud functions with note version

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.750
10.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.480
For that,

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.300
we need to switch between different know Jess versions.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.920
For that,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.440
we need to don't lower additional software,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.620
which is called No Version manager.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.260
This is software that allows us to switch between different versions off.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.910
No GS in one command.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:29.360
All right,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.090
let's go to Google.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.950
And then let's just type and VM that Let's go to note version manager on the get hop.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.590
And this repository is on lee for Linux and Mac OS users.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.560
Please follow this tutorial and install and VM on your machine.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.600
If you come from windows down,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.540
scroll down to two windows part And here we confine envy M for windows and then click on

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.360
download.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.850
Now you will end up on this page,

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.820
then click on N V M.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.680
Set up zip file and then install envy M.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.240
Okay,

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.640
After you have envy M installed on your machine,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.130
go to your terminal and then just call envy M version or envy em.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.000
Dash version.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.400
Okay.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.130
And VM version after that in order to install No,

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.290
just version 10.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.540
Let me run my command and the M list.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.700
It will list all of my no GS versions installed locally.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.990
So for cloud functions,

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.590
we need some off 10th version.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.700
So let's call envy M install and then 10.20 point one.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.260
After that note version,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.120
Manager will install and mainly everything for you.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.240
You don't need to worry about anything,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.210
then to switch between different versions off.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.370
No GS weaken,

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.560
simply type and VM used.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.240
Let's say 8 16 to.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.690
And now I'm using this version off note.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.690
And if I type and VM use 10.20 point one now I'm using this version.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.520
This is it.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.900
This is how we can manage different versions off.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.650
No Gs,

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.460
please make sure you have this one installed because otherwise,

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.150
if you don't have no version 10 locally installed,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.280
we will not be able to run your functions locally.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.870
All right,

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.450
now,

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.700
to finish this video,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.340
let's commit our changes.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.380
So let's forget everything.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.350
Then get commit and let's say,

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.530
set up cloud functions with envy.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.830
M perfect.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.250
See you in the next one
