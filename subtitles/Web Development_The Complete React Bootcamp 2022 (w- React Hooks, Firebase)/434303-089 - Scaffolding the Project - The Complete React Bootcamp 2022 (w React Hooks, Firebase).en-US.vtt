00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
Hey,

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.060
welcome.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.550
Right now we're going to use scuffled our protect as before,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.230
we're going to use create reactor app and to create in your project,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.140
we need to open folder of everyone to to put our project in in the terminal.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.740
So from my terminal,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.620
I'm gonna execute and p x create react up,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.810
and then the name of folder,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.500
which is going to be Chad app.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.910
And then I'm gonna put use NPM because I have yarn installed on my system.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.570
And now the EU project will be created for us.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.250
Let's just wait until everything is done.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.070
All right?

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.510
Seems like we are done.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.250
Now let's open V s code.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.420
And from here,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.760
let's open our new folder.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.040
So what do we have inside as before?

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.020
Under source,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.130
we have our initial files for package Jason.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.650
We have our scripts and so on.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.450
So let's perform our initial clean up so we don't need ap CSS.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.250
Then we also don't need all of this inside our app component.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.190
So let's clean it up like this leads to delete this class name,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.920
we will put just Hello.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.810
We will Tillett logo and import for us.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.000
Yes.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.270
Has filed then we don't need AP Test GS than four index CSS.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.740
Well,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.610
we actually don't need it as well,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.250
then for index?

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.750
Yes,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.340
let's remove street mode because we will receive errors when we will use other libraries.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.580
It is totally normal.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.410
Then let's remove Index CSS and let's comment Service worker for now,

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.870
just like this,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.960
then we don't need logo SVG.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.980
We don't need set up tests and we are done here.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.950
Now what do we do?

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.140
We will install other dependencies,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.880
and we will get them from the Assets folder.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.050
So let's open this folder and let's open scaffolding.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.860
Doug Jason.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.050
So from here we are going to copy comments to install dependencies.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.430
So let's copy the first line and let's put it inside our integrated terminal just like that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.430
.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.210
Now,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.800
while it is installing,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.140
let's create preacher and excellent configuration files.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.660
So for excellent,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.680
it is going to be,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.980
yes,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.880
land RC.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.050
And for preacher,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.130
it is going to be prettier,

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.850
RC,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.490
and also let's copied them from our scaffolding to Jason file.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.690
So for yes,

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.580
leaned we have that one.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.870
Let's put it here and save it.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.300
And for per year we have that one All right.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.060
So,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.410
yes,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.450
lint and preacher are Don,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.580
let's adjust our NPM script.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.530
So let's copy all of that and put it inside.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.620
Package Jason,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.650
inside this script section at the bottom,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.810
just like that.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.330
And also we have the clear script to clear the bill folder.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.530
So right before we produce our built let's run and PM,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.750
Ron Clear like a died.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.720
All right,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.790
so we are done with scripts.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.690
What else do we have inside disc unfolding file?

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.840
We have other line for installation dependencies,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.990
which is notes.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.410
Ass are suit react router and reactor for dumb.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.660
Let's copy it.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.850
And let me explain what is going to happen.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.500
So for our style system,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.810
we will use SAS with you.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.700
I library named are here,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.510
and we can take a look at our suit if we not gauge to its official documentation.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.600
So what is a Y library?

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.400
It is a library that gives us already pretty find components that we can use.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.950
And that's basically it.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.950
We will see that when we will start using it is pretty simple,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.520
and it boosts our development speed.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.350
You will see that.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.830
All right.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:07.070
And whenever we see that our suit is not enough for our cases we will use says Okay.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.500
Also,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.040
we install,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.420
react router and react Rotterdam All right,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.830
so that's basically it.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:19.300
But one thing to do is also to copy this styles folder for our project.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.200
So what is this Styles folder?

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.270
So it comes with Assad off pre defined classes.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.950
So let's actually copy this folder.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.840
So I'm going to copy this folder.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.270
Then I will open that file in ah,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.960
reveal in File Explorer,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.540
then inside sores.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.130
I'm gonna paste this styles folder and let's take a look.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.130
What do we have inside?

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.590
So we have our main file,

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:50.290
which is basically our index CSS or just our main file for styles here would define,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.230
Let's say,

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.270
really a few off classes that we will use.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.440
It will take you look and them They're really simple.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.650
Nothing too complicated.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.510
Then we have utility and you facility colors that we import into Maine CSS.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.880
So now we can manage our files.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.290
So,

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:13.880
for utility here we have classes that are kind of similar to bootstrap utility classes,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.070
so we will use them a lot in our code.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.430
So please take a look at them.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.210
They're not that hard to manage.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.750
I don't have utility colors.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.530
These are basically classes for colors.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.990
Nothing too special over here.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.660
And then we have override as he SS.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.260
So this year I library are sure it is intended for desktop applications.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:43.360
So some off their components are not really good to displayed on mobile devices and to

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.190
adjust them for mobile screens.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.250
I a little bit modified their CSS I override their classes a little bit.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.370
So now they look good on mobile devices as well.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.480
This is just to make everything good.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.280
Police take a look on all of that.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.390
It is very simple.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.300
Just make sure that you know what is happening.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.040
So inside Abdel Gs,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.780
what we need to do,

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.430
we need to import it.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.850
So let's import.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.220
Ah,

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.090
we're styles main CSS just like that.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.990
And also we need to configure our suit and advance.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.620
So if we navigate to their official website and if we go to getting started and if we click

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.960
on use in Crete,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.850
react app from here,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:34.000
we can see that we need to also import their default CSS solutions copy this line of code

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.350
and put it before we import our main styles just like that.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.600
So now we are ready to go with our conflict for you.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.620
I One thing to do here is to actually connect our project to get help.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.590
So let's open integrated terminal and commit all off our files.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.270
So first,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.790
we're gonna add everything to the stage state,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.900
and then we're gonna get commit.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.570
Let's say scaffold the up something like that.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.450
Right now we are going Teoh open.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.850
We're get him account.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.380
Then we're going to create a repository.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.850
Then we will name its chat app.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.070
Let's make it private,

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.590
and we will create a new repository Right after that,

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.870
we can copy this command at the bottom.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.630
Get remote at origin.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.000
Let's copy that one and pacer in our terminal.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.660
Now our local files will be associate it with this remote repository and we need to push

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.110
our local changes online to get her.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.900
Let's use get push origin mustard.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.210
And now let's take look so everything is deployed.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.610
If we refresh the page,

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.430
our project will be online.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.980
So we have everything.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.730
Chraidi.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.160
And in the next video we will start building.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160
See you there
