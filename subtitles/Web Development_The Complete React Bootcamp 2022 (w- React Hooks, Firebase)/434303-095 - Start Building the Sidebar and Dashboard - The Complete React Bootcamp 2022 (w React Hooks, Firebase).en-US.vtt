X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
Hey,

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.760
welcome.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.810
Now that we have full signing flow,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.630
let's finally start building our homepage.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.940
We will start from the left site.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.650
So first we're going to build our buttons than chatroom list and then we will go to Maine.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.550
Shatt Window.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.260
Let's go So inside pages instead of this def.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.250
Let's define our grit.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.950
So it is going to be great component,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:31.140
which is going to be fluid and class Name is going to be a Chuan 100.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.150
We will make it full height.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.880
Then inside we're going to control element and then we're going to pour column element from

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.110
our suit.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.480
So for small devices,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.540
it will take all columns,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.700
which are 24 columns and starting from middle devices.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.020
We're going to put it something like eight.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.870
Not health,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.550
but eight.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.660
And inside this column we're going to use sidebar component,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.420
but not the one that comes from our suit.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.290
The one that we will create ourselves.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.460
Let's save it.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.040
And under components,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.430
let's create new file,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.430
which we will name Sidebar doggy s.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.220
Let's open it and let's ask a folder for a rapping.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.530
Dave,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.840
I'm gonna put class name off full height and then a little bit off patting at the top.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.370
So inside we're gonna split it into two elements.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.030
So we will have the top part with our buttons and at the bottom we will have a chat room

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.530
list.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.970
So let's first create def for our top part and at the bottom because we don't have any

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.380
chatter on the list yet.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.010
Let's just would bottom text like this.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.880
So inside this different will pour dashboard juggle that will create in a moment and save

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.090
it.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.590
So other components.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.910
Let's create new folder,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.920
which we will name the report here.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.460
Bubble defined two files.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.840
First is going to be indexed togs,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.290
which is going to be our dashboard component,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.750
but we will manage everything,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.850
but for now we will keep it empty.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.050
So let's name it,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.350
Dad report and just put hello insight and second element is going to be dashboard juggle.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.030
So here we will define our button and the drover itself.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.700
So first we want to get rid off the wrapping Div.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.770
Then I will define a button over here,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.550
which is going to be our Tobler.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.600
Let's say it is going to be a block element.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.170
It will have blue collar and inside were going to put Aiken that we import from our suit.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.620
Aiken is going to be that word.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.220
And then text is going to be dashboard like this.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.500
Now let's actually say with and let's see,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.320
what do we have?

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.860
So if we refresh the page inside sidebar,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.720
we don't have dashboard till go,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.430
Let's imported.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.460
And also inside home We don't have sidebar.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.190
Let's imported as well.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.970
All right,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:59.900
let's check it out.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.430
Right.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.450
So we have button.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.550
But when we click,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.850
nothing happens.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.840
So let's define our Drover component on or Drover,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.960
element here next to Button.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:17.140
I'm gonna put Drover that comes from our suit package and it is not so closing element

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.540
inside.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.000
We actually need to pour drover elements,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.150
but we are going to define them inside this index adult NGS file.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.210
So for this struggle,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.760
we only need to define this show property and it is going to be It must be a bowline value

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.130
that will indicate when this drover is opened.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.320
Then we need to define on height event and then we also need to define placement.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.620
In our case,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.280
it is going to be on the left or right now we need to actually define our handlers or state

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.290
for our drover.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.470
We need to keep track over its state on our own.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.080
And since we're going to have a lot off motels or drovers in our application,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.590
and we're going to re use a lot of the same logic,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.600
I proposed to create a custom hope that we will name use model state and it will expose

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.310
only three elements is open on height and on show.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.460
So under MISC,

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.910
let's create new file custom hooks GS.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.070
Here we're gonna define a new function,

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.040
which is going to be our hook,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.470
which we will name use model state.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.680
It will receive default value.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.980
Let's say default value,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.250
which will be set to false if it is undefined.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.380
Inside,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.100
we're going to define state,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.980
and by default this state will be our default value that we pass as an argument and also

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.150
here we will define a few helper functions.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.760
Let's say so.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.700
First function is going to be open and it will be a wrapped around use cold back in advance

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.040
to make it optimize,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.650
and he will call,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.850
said ST,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.820
and we will set it to true and the same we will apply to close.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.340
But instead of true,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.750
we will pour false over here and from this hook,

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.780
we're going to return our state.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.590
Maybe let's rename it too is open,

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.980
and the here set is open.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.010
So from this hook,

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.870
we're going to return is open,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.620
open and close helper functions.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.530
And don't forget to export this year's model state from custom hooks.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.080
All right,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.060
so inside Arab or toggle,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.950
we're going to use this use model state which returns us is open.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.460
Then it returns us close and open.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.030
So now we can use it.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.100
So on height,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.240
we're going to specify with our own clothes function that we define in the hook show.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.410
It is a bull in value,

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.160
so little specify is open and also for our button.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.190
When we click on it,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.890
we want to show the Drover.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.700
So for this button for on click event,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.650
we will specify Just open.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:14.250
All right.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.330
And now we actually need to put something inside Rover.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.140
It is going to be this element.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:27.440
So let's define dashboard and you will see that it will be imported from dot It means that

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.560
it will be imported from our current folder.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.790
So why we put Index Gs like this?

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.710
So if we use it in any other component,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.830
let's say inside pages and the way we import it,

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.180
it is going to be like that.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.850
We're going to import from components.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:51.880
That report will not specify Dashboard Index GS because it is named as index.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.220
Yes,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:59.110
we can specify only the folder name where this index dot gs re sites and it will work.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.700
All right,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.210
so now let's save everything and let's take a look.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.350
Now if I click on dashboard,

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.550
it worked perfectly.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.010
So I guess that's it for this video.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.950
In the next video,

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.950
we will continue and make our mortal a little bit more responsive.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.650
Because if I'm gonna just click on it,

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.600
if I'm gonna,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.040
you know,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.470
just resize the window,

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.950
you can see that it stays static.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.290
This is not user friendly behavior,

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.830
so we will fix it later.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.960
But for now,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.550
let's commit our changes,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.160
and we will say,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.760
starting or started building the sidebar component.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.420
All right.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.140
Perfect.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.500
See you in the next one.
