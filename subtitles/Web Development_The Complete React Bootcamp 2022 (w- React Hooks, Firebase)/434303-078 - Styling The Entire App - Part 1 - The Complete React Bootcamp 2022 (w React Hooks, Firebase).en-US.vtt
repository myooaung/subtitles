00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.070
Hey there in this video but will finally start styling our application to the final version

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.070
.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.720
Let's go to get all of our styles.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.620
Bubble reference.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.210
The Assets folder Inside we confined finishing old styles Part one and part two you Let's

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.670
open part one and,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.270
as always,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.750
we will go one by one.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.470
So first we have the theme object.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.240
Let's copy it and let's find out how we can use it.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.480
Let's open abductee Yes,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.890
and we will put it right above function.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.210
So two under sent What is going to happen?

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.100
Let's open style GS and let's remember how we're able.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.820
Teoh put dynamic styles for styled components so we would pass custom props to the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.130
component that then become available as function arguments inside string and manipulation.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.480
And if you remember,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.910
when we tried to counsel log these arguments,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.430
one of them was the theme object.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.450
And for now,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.750
this theme object is going to be the one that we will provide to styled components.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.760
So in this way we are able to create some sort of a global theme or global variables that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.970
become accessible inside the CSS markup that we put over here and It is very similar to CSS

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.750
parables or to cess variables,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.080
but we're not limited only two colors.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.500
We can put numbers for indentation or maybe even bulling values.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.250
All right,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.370
Do you provide this theme for Styled components?

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.560
We need to import something from Styled components.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.940
It is going to be theme provider and thin provider is related to context.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.940
AP I our topic for the next project.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.600
But in a few words,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.940
everything that goes inside this thing provider component will receive some sort of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.200
underlying value or context that we pass along with this provider.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.960
So it is going to be thin,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.940
prop and for a thing prob with pacify the object.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.070
From now on,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.540
all off our style,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.540
components are able to access props dot theme dot main colors blue,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.720
great and dark.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.420
All right,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.940
now,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.670
let's open assets file and let's start first,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.770
we have enough style two Gs.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.870
Let's copy all of that and then under components,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.210
let's create this file.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.300
It is going to be knaves styled GS here.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.820
We will put all of that,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.030
and also we will import a few thinks first it is going to be styled from styles,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.640
components And then,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.370
if you look closely here,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.030
we use styled link and in this way weaken style,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.820
any component we want.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:05.080
We are not limited to style and override styles off components that were created only using

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.150
styled components,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.810
library we can style link that comes from react router.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.710
In this way,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:19.420
we can said the active class or any other markup we want so less import link from react

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.220
router dump.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.390
And let's take a look inside the markup,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.070
as you can see here with reference our theme object that main colors gray,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.540
blue and so on.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.680
So it is very simple and really,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.880
really convenient.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.750
All right,

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.160
now let's open enough's don't Yes,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.010
and here let's use our styled components.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.650
So instead of fue el,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:51.990
we are going to put enough list that we will import at the top enough list from nerves

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.750
styled and then in advance,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.110
but will also import link styled from nerves stuff all right.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.750
Instead,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.820
off link that come from react rotor.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:12.550
We will use our own link styled and now let's remove this import for react rotor Dom and we

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.590
are ready to go.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.520
But there is one more step to this because if we look inside the markup,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.870
we have this dot active class.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.010
So we have some sort of a mixture off dynamic classes and styled components.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.750
All right,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.910
so this active class becomes available or we have active class when we are currently on

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.260
these or that page.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.970
What I mean is that if we open our bark up,

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.900
but we'll see that now.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.050
Bar has great color for now,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.270
but we want to underline home page when we're on the home page.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.780
And if we want to go to the start,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.550
which we will see this underlined.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.600
So how were able to achieve that?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.940
Well,

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.780
we will use another hook that comes from reactor Dom to understand our current location.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:07.270
So we're gonna put const location use location that we will import from react Rotterdam.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.390
We will do it at the top.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.260
So we're gonna import use location from react router done just like that.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.720
Now,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.900
let's Consul luck this location and take a look inside the council.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.100
If we inspect,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.340
go to council here we confined the object with path name,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.310
state search,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.140
key and key.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.700
But we're interested only in path name.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.400
It will navigate to start page,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.810
we can see that it has been changed to start,

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.360
so it actually works.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.460
And what we can do.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:47.000
We can compare this path name to our two key that we define inside our array item.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.620
And if they match,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.430
then we have our link active.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.110
All right,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:03.280
so here we will define class name and we're going to ask if our item 0.2 is equal to

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.580
location dot path the name,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.060
then we will apply active class.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.280
Otherwise it will be nothing.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.250
All right,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.350
let's save it and let's take Philip.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.350
Now if we are currently on the start page,

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.960
we have dynamic styles.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.770
If we go to home page,

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.990
it becomes active.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.250
Everything works.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.550
Everything perfect.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.320
All right,

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.020
now let's move on and less style our last file inside this video.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.970
So we gonna copy that one than under components?

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.590
We're gonna create title styled GS.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:47.320
We gotta put title rapper Insight and then we will import styled from styled components.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.060
All right,

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.950
let's open title gs and here Wible Reference title rapper.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.090
And also we will import it like that.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.980
Let's safe,

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.570
Let's get back to the app.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:06.000
And now we have styled title and we have styled enough bar that has dynamic classes.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.750
All right,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.530
Perfect.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:08.990
Seems pretty awesome.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.850
Now let's and this video by committing our changes.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.530
So we gonna put get at everything,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:27.270
then get commit defined theme for styled components and create it.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.060
Have few styled components.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.270
All right,

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.410
same school.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.950
See you in the next one.
