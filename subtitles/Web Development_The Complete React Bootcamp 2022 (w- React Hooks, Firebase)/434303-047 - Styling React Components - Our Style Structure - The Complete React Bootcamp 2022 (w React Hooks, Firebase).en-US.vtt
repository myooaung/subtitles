00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.030
Hey,

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.330
welcome in this video,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.740
we will get to know how.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.610
Weaken style,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.650
react elements.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.710
Let's go.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.980
In the previous video,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.870
we've added two more components border gs and squared O.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.380
G s.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.400
Now let's say we want it Teoh style,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.790
this square component,

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.050
especially this button over here.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.500
So what do they do under components?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.950
We can create a new file,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.920
which we will name square,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.620
dark style,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.680
dot CSS and inside this file will put all CSS related to this square component.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.770
So we have button over here,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.890
So let's reference it button and let's put it phone size off,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.390
maybe 50 pixels for now.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.010
And if we go back to our Web browser,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.740
even though we refresh the page,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.590
there will be no changes.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.880
That's because in our project,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.620
every file is emotional.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.550
Even though it is a CSS will still need to imported to a component where we want to see it

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.550
.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.670
So inside square togs we will put import and then just passed to this CSS file,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.430
so dot slash for current fuller and dance square style dot CSS.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.330
If I say with and I get back to my browser,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.710
I will see the changes And if I inspect this element on the right,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.350
indeed,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.390
I can see the markup and the phone size has been changed.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.080
Okay,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.170
that's awesome.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.590
But what about classist?

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.050
Let's get back to APP.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.420
And here let's edit class.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630
But here we at classes,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.810
not just with the class keyboard.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.520
We use class name,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.360
and this is only react specific because just class can be a custom prop to a component or

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.950
element.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.980
That's why we need to put class names over here,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.450
and it's just take some time to get used to it.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.270
So let's board Bt N for bottom and inside square style.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.680
We will define this class and mobile port,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.140
maybe color set to read something like that if we go back to app.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.160
If I had a fresh,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.850
I can see that indeed,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.500
the class has been applied and this element has the BTM class,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.940
and that's basically it.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.400
That's how we can style all of our components.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.130
We can create separate chunks off CSS files and then include them one by one to related

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.850
component.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.780
So if we wanted to to style,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.850
let's say this board component we would create aboard the dot style dot CSS and then

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.250
included in Borg es.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.390
But there is one caveat to all of this.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.200
If we look closely in our application,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.100
these classes are applied globally.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.750
It means that if inside other file I pour the beauty in class to other element,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.570
it will still be there.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:03.650
It means that we can even import this CSS file not directly to this square component.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.250
We can remove it from here and let's see if we have no markup.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.530
We can put it even in Bordeaux GS over here,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.580
and it will still work because our classes are global.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.480
It means it really doesn't matter in what component we exactly import them.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.390
We can even import them in index togs.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.750
For Abdul Gs,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.090
it really doesn't matter.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.400
Since their old global they will be available across the entire application.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.800
So why would we separate them in different files?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.040
Different chunks?

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.630
Well,

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.020
it's on Lee to make our application more structure It personally,

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.790
I prefer when I have a belatedly small application,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.190
I prefer to create just a separate folder,

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.980
four styles and put everything there and then just import one file in APP component,

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.690
and that's what we will do in this project.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.450
So on their source I will create a new folder styles.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:14.620
And here I will put this file named wrote dot CSS And here we will put all off our styles.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.090
So now let's get rid off this square file.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:27.940
I will remove it and I will remove import and also these class over here as it was before.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.550
Okay,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.920
Good.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.410
Everything seems fine.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.130
And now what should I define in this route dot CSS?

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.900
Well,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.040
we will go even more advance.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.180
And instead of just using CSS,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.740
we will use SAS an extension for CSS,

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.620
a language that is built on top of CSS that allows us to use more advanced CSS features.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.530
Let's install it.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.430
But there will be one problem.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.020
We will try to do so because we have this parcel version in the Alfa stage.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.450
And that's bad because the package that will install is not compatible with this version.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.010
And we got this version because we use this template and this template installed us the

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.470
latest available version.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.350
But we want the latest stable abortion.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.010
That's why I opened the official get half webpage.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.850
And here I can see that the final stable version is 1.12 point four.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.970
So inside package Jason,

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.680
let's simply rename it to 1.12 24.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.650
And to install this specific version,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.300
we will just meet to Ron NPM.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.610
Install and NPM will reinstall this parcel tool with this version specified.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.830
So let's wait until it's done.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.620
Awesome.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.830
Now the parcel is installed.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.710
Let's install one more package.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:06:00.360
It is going to be NPM install node sask and everything else will be managed by the partials

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.080
who show will simply need to add this one more dependency.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.180
And now we can use SAS in our project.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:17.490
So let's rename this route dot CSS to ask CSS and also inside Abla GS less importance root

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.970
file.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:24.980
So import from styles hurled CSS like so?

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.000
So what styles should we put in the Assets folder?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.130
We can find this initial styling dot txt.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.250
Let's open it.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.490
And inside we can find a really simple market.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.770
So let's copy it and let's based it all here.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:49.720
And let's run the app and PM Bronze Star and maybe let me explain what they do.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.860
So basically,

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.750
in SAS,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.060
we can nest different selectors just like so,

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.780
so instead of writing dot board dartboard Row,

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.380
which is very boring.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.020
We can simply mess them,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.660
which even makes more sense,

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.390
I guess.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.650
And by using this and sign over here,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.560
we can refer to apparent.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.680
So basically this sign,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:24.520
Colin hover means button Holler the parent where this component is nested and everything

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.510
else should be easy and comprehensive.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.320
So let's see what classes do we have here.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:37.990
So first we have the AP class and this AP classes for this dif so less pork lust name and

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.950
give it to app.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.810
Then we have deport class.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:51.060
So let's open our board component and for the rapper element less port aboard Inside board

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.060
,

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.800
we have board row,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:59.430
so let's give these classic to each off our rose so bored row.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:07.150
Then I will copy this and put it to you each off the rose and in the end we have this

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.330
square class.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:14.350
So let's open our button over here and let's give it the square class.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:19.560
Now if we save and if we go back to our application right now,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.010
when I refresh the page,

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.930
we will see the style supply and if we look inside markup,

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:30.970
we will see all classes and all styles that we have insight root dot CSS.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.950
So that's basically it.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:38.670
That's how we are going to style our application inside this route file Bubble port,

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:44.110
our CSS and then just style our components as simple as that.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.620
I guess it was clear.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.740
And if you still have a question,

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.410
something like Which approach should you choose to style your components,

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:58.660
either creating one single CSS file and put everything in it and then just important in

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:04.160
after GS or create separate CSS files for every component?

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:04.920
Well,

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.240
it actually depends,

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.590
and it's really up to you.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.580
So in our application,

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:17.710
I think just creating one CSS file will be more effective than just separate them with the

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.400
different files.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:25.940
So let's commit our changes and finish the video so less poor to get ad,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:35.080
then get commits and let's put edit sass and get to know styles.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.570
Okay,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.330
perfect.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.950
See you in the next one
