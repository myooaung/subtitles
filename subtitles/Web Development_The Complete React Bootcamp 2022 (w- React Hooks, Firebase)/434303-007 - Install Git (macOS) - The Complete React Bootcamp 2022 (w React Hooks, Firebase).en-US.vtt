Hey, in this video,

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:06.195
I'm going to show you how to install Git on Mac OS.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:09.795
First, navigates to Google and type git.

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:11.655
Go to the first URL.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:13.260
This is the official website.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.935
Click on downloads, then select macOS.

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:20.190
You will see a few ways how to install Git.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.920
We're going to choose the one with Homebrew.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.110
Homebrew is a package manager.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.520
It allows us to download

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.860
distributed software with a single terminal command.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.295
Install Homebrew,

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:33.905
copy the installation command from the website,

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:37.085
then go to Launchpad and run the terminal,

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:40.340
paste the command, and wait for it to install.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.249
It might also prompt you for your password.

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:45.199
Now that we have Homebrew,

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.165
we can easily install Git,

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:49.700
navigate back to get website and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.745
copy homebrew installed Git,

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:55.370
open the terminal and paste the command.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.560
It will take a few seconds until

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.709
homebrew will install get into your system.

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:03.500
If it says that get is already installed,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.835
then you are just fine.

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:07.220
It is probably because of Xcode.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.320
And that's it. Bye bye.
