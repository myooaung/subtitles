00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
Hello.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.910
In this video,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.510
we will add a new model window.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.700
So when we click on someone's user name,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.410
we can observe user profile.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.990
Let's not get back to code.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.100
And here under Messages folder,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.510
let's greet your file.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.400
Vegetable name Profile Info.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.650
BT and Moto GS.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.320
Let's create a new component.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.270
And for now,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.520
let's keep it empty.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.270
Let's open message item.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.800
And here instead of the span element where we display author name,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.230
Let's display profile in for BT and Moto and for this component because we need to get user

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.590
data,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.150
we need to display it inside.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.690
We will pass profile prop and we gonna pass.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.400
Just author and everything else will be managed from inside the component.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.810
So from here,

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.600
we gonna destruct your profile for now and let's define the market.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.460
So first of all,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.050
we're going to put button and this button will say short name off our user.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.290
So let's create new viable here that we will name short name and it will just play on Lee

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.560
the first ward off nickname.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.150
So if it is a full name like first name second name,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.870
we will display only first name.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.530
So let's put profile job name.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.890
Then we're gonna split it with empty spaces and then we will grab the first element.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.760
Now we will display only the first name because it is going to be model.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.710
We also needs to get mortal state.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.650
So let's use our hook,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.610
which is used model state.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.360
Here we will receive is open,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.120
close and open.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.740
All right,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.270
now next to this body and we will pour model.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.160
And inside this model,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.960
let's first define show property which is going to be is open and on hide is going to be

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.810
clothes than inside this moto.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660
We will have mortal daughter,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.080
Heather as always.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.280
Then we will have body and we will have footer like this.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.020
So inside Heather we will have mortal door title and inside moral title we're going to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.400
display short name profile,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.760
then inside body or maybe inside footer,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.610
bubble display bottom which is going to be a block element on click It will close our moto

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.510
and it will be just about on just to close this this mortal than inside body.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.210
First we're going to put it class Name off text center So inside a bubble poor exactly the

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.110
same avatar image as we do in Avatar.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.520
A blood Bt in which is yes,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.920
this profile avatar.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.350
So let's copy it and let's put it here.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.640
Now let's import profile Avatar.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.540
And next to it,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.000
we're gonna display H four where we will display the full name off this user.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.010
So let's first grab it.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.940
CONST.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.470
Name is going to be grabbed from profile.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:58.450
And maybe let's also grab Avatar and let's say created at So now we don't need Teoh the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.540
structure or we don't need to specify profile over here.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.990
So for this age,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.270
for we will pour margin talk to to add some margin at the top.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.260
And then we will display member since and then we're going to pour member since variable

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.280
that we will create.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.700
So let's poor const member since and we're gonna put new date created at and then we will

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.370
simply just call to local day string to former our date.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.550
No.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.140
So we didn't use open.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.410
So let's put it for this on click.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.830
Okay,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.280
Good.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.840
Now let's open message item.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.750
It looks fine.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.610
It looks fine.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.760
Now let's take a look.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.340
So,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.020
as you can see now,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.860
we have the button.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.960
When we click on it,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.850
we can see she looks 22.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.890
Profile our image,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.900
full name,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.080
member scenes and close Perfect.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.200
But I don't want to be displayed it like this.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.690
So we're gonna just a few things.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.050
So everything else that will be passed to this component as a prop will be redirected to

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.150
button props.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.210
And also,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.130
let's get rid of this def as a rapping element.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.630
Let it be just a button at the end,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.500
so all of that props will be passed to this button.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.400
So let's spread Bt and props object over this component like that.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.940
So for this profile in four beat and model,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.550
we can pass appearance,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.470
which is going to be link.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.410
And also we can pass Class name.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.760
Let's add padding.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.830
Zito Dan.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.290
Let's add margin left one and also text black.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.100
Let's save it and let's take a look right now.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.800
It looks good.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.300
If I have or I can see that it is something that clickable.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.710
If I click on it,

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.150
I can get user data.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.720
Okay,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.220
Perfect.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.410
So this is it.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.010
Now let's commit our changes.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.140
Get everything,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.280
get commits.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.110
Let's say displayed user data with maro window.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.440
All right,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.680
see you in the next one
