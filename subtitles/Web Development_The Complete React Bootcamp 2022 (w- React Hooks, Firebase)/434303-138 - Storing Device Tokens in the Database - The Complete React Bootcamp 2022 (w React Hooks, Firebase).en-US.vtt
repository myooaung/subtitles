00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540
Hey there in this video,

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.130
we're going to get users device token and store it in the database.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.540
But before we do that in the previous video,

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.720
when we deployed our application,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.490
we get this hosting cash and also we modified fire based of Jesus.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.470
So first of all,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.740
let's open and get ignored.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.770
And let's add dot firebase fuller to get ignore to ensure that we do not track this folder

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.770
.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.270
All right,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.590
Good.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.170
Now let's commit our changes and let's say,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.130
get commit,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.430
Deploy the app Perfect Now I already opened documentation for firebase cloud messaging,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.050
and from here we need to get Web credentials.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.550
And these are voluntary application server identification key.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.570
So this is the vapid key that we need to get to set up Firebase Cloud domestic in the first

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.950
place.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.770
So let's go to dashboard than let's go to approach it settings and then to cloud messaging

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.840
from here.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.560
Under Web configuration,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.850
we need to generate new key pair.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.490
So let's click on this bottom and this is our vapid key that we will use.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.770
It is public so we can share it.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.320
I mean,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.200
do not share it,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.580
but it is publicly available Now let's go to our application.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.100
Let's actually run it.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.710
And then let's Oakland Firebase Doggy s in the first place.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.260
So here we're gonna import firebase messaging,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.830
then here at the bottom.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.850
We're going to check if it is supported by the browser,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.850
so we can anti export const.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.030
Messaging.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.130
Then we're gonna ask if Firebase died.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.330
Messaging is supported.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.360
So if it is,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.640
then we're gonna call app dot messaging to get the instance.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.720
Otherwise,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.340
it will be said to not then at the bottom.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.380
We need to set it up to use this vapid key that we generated.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.030
So let's ask if we have messaging supported.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.890
So if we have the instance,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.650
then we're gonna call messaging,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.660
use public vapid key.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.830
You can find this in their documentation.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.410
All right,

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.610
so let's copy this key and let's paste it here.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.970
Okay,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.380
good.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.850
And I we need to set up a handler for our messages.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.250
So let me explain.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.620
Messages or notifications are available in two types,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.270
foreground messages and background messages.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.330
Background messages are those messages that are handled when our tab or browser is closed

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.020
and foreground messages are those that are visible when we are scrolling the website,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.150
so foreground messages must be handled inside the app.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.290
Background messages are handled by service worker.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.790
So here we're gonna call messaging on message and for knowledge is keep it as it is.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.980
Consulate data.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.010
So these subscription,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.610
let's say,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.170
will handle our foreground messages.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.560
Okay,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.650
let's say with and now let's get to decode to save user device to the database.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.750
So let's open profile context.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.570
So this isn't the place when we look in our user.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.240
So here,

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.470
we need to manage it.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.490
And if I open again documentation,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.200
I can see that I can copy this piece of code to get current registration token.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.630
So,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.410
actually,

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.960
you know what?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.140
Let me copy this and let's pasted somewhere over here at the bottom.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.740
But first,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.020
we need to ensure if messaging exists.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.660
So we're gonna check if messaging exists,

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.240
which I imported from MISC firebase.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.280
So if this is the case,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.050
then I'm gonna pace this code,

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.460
and maybe you let me convert it to a sink awaits index.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.670
So let me put a try catch block over here.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.970
Then I'm gonna pour messaging,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.970
get token.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.870
So it will be const Tokcan.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.930
Let's say current token equals await messaging.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.380
Get token and let's converted to facing function.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.750
Okay,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.570
Perfect.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.670
Then we're gonna check if current token exists.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.230
Let copy all of that.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.830
So if this current token exists,

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.580
then we're gonna do some things.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:26.360
We don't even need it than in case off error we're gonna display inside the console and at

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.270
our occurred.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.820
Okay,

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.370
Good.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.290
Now let's do it.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.060
All of that.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.240
And here we go.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.550
Now we need to store this token inside the database.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.200
For that,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:43.430
we can call away data ways Dar graph and the place or the path that we will start our

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:51.300
tokens equals two FC m tokens slash token I d and then slash user i d.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.430
So with these approach,

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.380
we can easily query choke ins on the back.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.310
And okay,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.250
so it is going to be FC m tokens.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.830
Then we're gonna for current token,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.550
and as a child,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.630
we're gonna pour off object door user.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.710
I d I d.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.640
Off current user.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.070
Okay.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.740
Perfect.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.080
Now scrolling the documentation down,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.920
I can see the token can be also refreshed,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.360
so we also need to handle that for this.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.490
Let's copy this piece of code and put it next to this strike Hedge block like this and this

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.130
own token refresh it is a subscription.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.190
So it means we need to unsubscribe from it in the future for that again.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.650
Here,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:42.360
Anti chop inside you the fact Let's poor Joe can refresh I'm sub,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.450
okay?

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.720
And we're gonna pour on token or fresh to that terrible.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.640
And here at the bottom when we log off,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.200
we're going to check if joke and refresh on sub,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.850
Then we're gonna call this function two months up from it and the same mobile do in the

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.980
cleanup function.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.550
Okay,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.040
good.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.990
Now what we need to do here,

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.110
let's also converted to anything.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.690
Function.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.300
So here,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.670
we're gonna put a sing,

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.720
and actually,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.580
the logic will be kind of the same,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.970
so we can easily copy it and place it over here like this.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.600
Okay,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.140
good.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.230
Now we are ready to go,

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:27.150
but because we right to the database to the path that we didn't add to security rules,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.200
we need to slightly modify them.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.200
So let's go to database,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.870
then let's go to rules.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.260
And here,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.720
let's add a new entry.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.910
So let me copy disc status like this,

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.210
then I'm going to replace status with FC M tokens.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.880
Then we will get a joke.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.670
And I D and mobile allow Read never.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.090
Because we don't want to allow anyone to access our tokens.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.750
And for right Onley the user,

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.870
that is currently Sinan is able to store his own token.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.240
Right,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.000
So we're gonna check if new data dot value.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.440
So if the user i d that we write to this token,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.440
I t equals two off you.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.890
I d.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.440
Okay.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.790
Good.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.940
Now let's savor and it looks good.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.290
Now let's go to our application.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.720
Let's refresh.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.160
Okay,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.120
now perfect.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.340
Let's open council to see if we have no warnings.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.740
Okay,

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.030
We get editor True.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.890
Been toking,

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.860
were unable to register the default service worker.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.220
Okay,

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.540
so this is good.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.050
And because we don't have any service worker yet,

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.570
we get this enter.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.540
This is good,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.950
but this error says that it works.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.710
Now let's commit our changes.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.800
And in the next video,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.540
we will set up service worker.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.230
So let's pour,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.030
get at everything and let's check what kind of others to be received.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.150
Unexpected council statement.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.680
Okay,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.510
this is good.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.550
Let's get commit.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:04.590
And let's say edit firebase messaging and store choking user token in the db.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.420
Perfect.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.730
See you in the next one
