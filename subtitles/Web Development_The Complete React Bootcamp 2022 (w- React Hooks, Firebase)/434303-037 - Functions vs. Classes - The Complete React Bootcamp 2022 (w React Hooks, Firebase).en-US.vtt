00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.815
Hi, In React.

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:04.695
There are two types of components available for us,

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.690
class-based and function waste.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.970
They differ in syntax and the way we

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.370
manipulate data inside them.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.985
Before React Hooks, we had no other option but

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:18.795
to create competence using classes in the present,

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:20.895
the situation is slightly different.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:24.585
With React Hooks, we use functions to create components.

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.264
React hooks are available

00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:28.290
only in function based components,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.175
and this is the reason why functions simplify components.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:35.654
The syntax is more lightweight and easier to comprehend.

00:00:35.654 --> 00:00:38.485
In our projects, we will use React Hooks,

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:39.830
which means we're going to work

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.495
with function based components.

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:41.975
Only.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:46.130
Class-based components become more and more seldom used.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.889
It is however possible that sometimes

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:51.754
out there you will see class-based components,

00:00:51.754 --> 00:00:53.180
but that's totally fine.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.775
The React team have their stakes on

00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:57.410
React Hooks and they do

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.555
believe that hooks are the future.

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:01.445
After finishing the last project,

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:02.540
you will be able to read

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.745
class-based components and you will not have

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:06.724
any troubles in transitioning

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:09.095
between functions and classes.

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:10.805
I hope it makes sense.

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:13.170
See you in the next one.
