00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.245
Hey, in this video I would like to talk about VS code,

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:06.120
how we configure VS Code,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.740
and what we need to do to

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.200
feel comfortable during development.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.115
Let's go.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:12.900
The first thing I would like to

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.735
introduce is VS Code Search bar,

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:19.140
because it is amazing to open search bar.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.225
I press Control P.

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:24.150
And it brings me here.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.370
I can type anything I want here,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.250
but it will give no matching results because it

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.550
tries to look up defiles in current project.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.600
But since we don't have

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.505
any project at the moment I opened,

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:37.335
it gives no matching results.

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:42.085
What I want to type instead is right arrow.

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:45.725
By typing right arrow at the very beginning.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:48.560
It signifies that I want to use

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.540
VS Code built-in commands or

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.660
VS code options maybe to navigate somber.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.665
For example, if I type arrow and then settings JSON,

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:04.145
it gives me preferences open settings chasten.

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:06.290
Let me click on that one and it

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.510
brings me to settings JSON file.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.490
So settings JSON file

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.660
is basically be as code user configuration file.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.580
Here we just need to type

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.570
different commands to configure extensions,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.945
to configure some tools or whatever.

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:26.960
First thing I wanted to put here,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.850
let me open browser.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.270
And here I have that file, this code configuration.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.065
You will have that URL and maybe already how it's shared.

00:01:36.065 --> 00:01:37.685
So just open it.

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:39.650
And from here, first thing I will

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.275
take IS security trust window.

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:47.105
And I'm just going to place it here like that.

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:48.830
And what it does,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.835
it disables security Window, but don't panic.

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:54.440
What is security window?

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.665
Well, VS code will ask you a lot of times,

00:01:57.665 --> 00:02:00.065
do you trust this environment

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:03.020
or do you trust this folder?

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.030
And trust me, this is very

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.520
annoying to disable this window.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.800
Just copy paste this option

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.435
and you will never see that window.

00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:11.930
Again.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.600
If you're curious, you can always comment

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.590
out this line of code and see it yourself.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.470
But I'm going to keep it as it is.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.435
Now for a second.

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:25.970
I'm going to leave the second option and I will

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.120
just take the very last option from here,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.370
which is about preacher.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.650
What is preacher?

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.540
Pre-clear is a tool that we will

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.030
cover in details in the upcoming video.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.310
Preacher will form it our code when we save files,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.969
that line ensures that when we hit save,

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.505
our code is going to be formatted.

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:53.510
At this step VS Code is basically already

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.280
configured and you can

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.560
start development tries straight away.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.840
But one thing I want to

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.065
mention is VSCode integrated terminal.

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:07.460
So if I hit terminal and click on new terminal,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.030
it opens PowerShell for me because I'm on Windows.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.219
If you're on Linux or macOS,

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.260
you will see Bash for Linux and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.045
macOS users, this is fine.

00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:18.605
But for Windows users,

00:03:18.605 --> 00:03:20.540
since we installed Git Bash,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.915
let's use Git Bash and not PowerShell or

00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:26.690
Cmd because by default VS Code

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.595
and Windows uses PowerShell.

00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:30.860
So what do we need to do? We need to go back to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.740
that file and copy

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.640
this configuration and let me place it here at the end.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.515
So what it will do,

00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:44.540
it will instruct VSCode to use

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.065
Git Bash as integrated terminal.

00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:50.690
It's not different as if you would

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.539
open it outside of VSCode.

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:57.245
It does just convenient to use everything in one place,

00:03:57.245 --> 00:04:00.335
especially tool like terminal.

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:02.300
I copied all of these options

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.445
if path is different for you,

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:07.535
just replace it following the same pattern.

00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:11.330
And let's close it and then let's open it again.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.870
And let's verify that now we are using Git Bash.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.540
That said, Windows users congrats,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.890
we're using Git Bash.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.610
Now, last thing I want to talk about at this video,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.920
and I would say the most important one

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.290
is VS Code extensions.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.920
Alright? So what is VS Code extensions?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.220
These are all optional tools that extent

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.015
VS Code with really great functionality.

00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:39.380
To go to Extensions,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.020
we hit on this icon on the left panel.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.130
And here I already have 33 extensions installed.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.020
That's a lot I know, but don't panic.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.660
We dont have to install all of them.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.010
What I will do right now,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.295
I will quickly go through the extensions that I

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.970
think are required for our course.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.130
And it will be up to

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.545
you whether you want to install them or not.

00:05:03.545 --> 00:05:05.240
To sell and extension in

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.550
the search bar you just type extension name.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.245
For example, better C Plus Plus syntax.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.879
You click on extension,

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.505
for example, that one and hit Install.

00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:18.365
After that it will be installed.

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:21.905
And it might ask you to reboot VS code,

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.675
but it's very rare.

00:05:23.675 --> 00:05:26.810
And by the way, I don't need that extension,

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.910
so I'm just going to uninstall it.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.150
So I go back to Installed Extensions

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.005
and let's quickly look for them.

00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:37.550
First extension that I want to

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.695
mention is out to the name tag.

00:05:39.695 --> 00:05:43.655
What it will do. It will just out to rename HTML,

00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:47.660
opening and closing tag as we type HTML.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.085
This is very useful.

00:05:49.085 --> 00:05:50.525
I recommend this one,

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:52.625
bracket pear color riser.

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:53.780
I think this is one of

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.970
the extensions that it should install

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.370
because it simply highlights

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.145
opening and closing bracket and decode.

00:06:01.145 --> 00:06:03.365
This is useful because it makes

00:06:03.365 --> 00:06:07.115
our code more readable and distinguishable.

00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:09.830
I highly recommend this extension.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.124
Next we have

00:06:12.124 --> 00:06:16.264
ES 7 React redux GraphQL React Native snippets.

00:06:16.264 --> 00:06:18.170
This is an important extension.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.670
We're going to utilize it a

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.445
lot when we're going to write React code.

00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:23.780
So install it.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.860
I'm going to mention

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.085
that extension in the future one more time.

00:06:28.085 --> 00:06:30.065
Then we have ES lint.

00:06:30.065 --> 00:06:31.670
We're going to cover ES lint in

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.965
more details in the upcoming video.

00:06:33.965 --> 00:06:38.525
But make sure you have this extension installed upfront.

00:06:38.525 --> 00:06:42.680
Next we have highlight matching tag.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.075
Just like it says,

00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:46.985
it will highlight matching HTML tag,

00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:48.815
just like you see on that.

00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:50.030
Preview.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.050
Pretty cool.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.435
I think it's, it's, it's useful.

00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:56.690
Now we have IntelliSense for CSS class names.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.060
Well, yeah, it is useful.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.120
So what it will do, it will add auto-completion for

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.200
CSS class names defined in our project,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.285
totally up to you.

00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:11.825
Next we have Material Icon Theme.

00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:16.100
It will just add this set of icons to the files

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.705
that we will see in File Explorer here on the left panel.

00:07:20.705 --> 00:07:23.690
I use it and I recommend it to everybody.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.895
Npm intelligence.

00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:27.815
This one is important.

00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:29.885
What it will do, it will add

00:07:29.885 --> 00:07:32.645
outer completion for packages and

00:07:32.645 --> 00:07:34.955
libraries that we're going to import

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:37.850
into code, highly recommended.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.145
Next we have path intelligence.

00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:41.600
Basically the same thing,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.175
but for local files.

00:07:43.175 --> 00:07:47.015
So auto-completion for local files import.

00:07:47.015 --> 00:07:49.265
Then we have preacher,

00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:52.700
preachers, a tool that will format our files.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.580
So again, we're going to cover that in detail,

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.800
so just make sure it is installed.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.429
And last extension is going to be toggled quotes.

00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:03.439
Toggle quote is very simple.

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:06.650
It basically just toggle quotes.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.750
For example, if read here,

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.270
we need to press this depending on

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.690
your OS to toggle quotes from single to double,

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.775
from double to backticks.

00:08:16.775 --> 00:08:18.545
Let me demonstrate it to you.

00:08:18.545 --> 00:08:24.410
If you just going to press these buttons anywhere,

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.920
you will have This message

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.110
that running contributed Command failed.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.880
The thing is that you have to use

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.100
this command only inside quotes.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.910
I have to put my cursor over here inside a text with

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:42.920
quotes and then use the combination to triple quotes.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.825
I use it a lot personally

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.565
and I highly recommend to everybody.

00:08:46.565 --> 00:08:50.420
I think that's it. I covered everything that I wanted.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.460
I mentioned all the extensions

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.380
that I think are important.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.040
I gave you everything about settings,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.149
JSON, you know, about integrated terminal.

00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:05.105
I personally open it with control plus

00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:09.335
J key binding, not from here.

00:09:09.335 --> 00:09:11.480
And yeah, that's it.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.425
Maybe one more thing to mention is VSCode theme.

00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:17.870
If you want VS Code to look cool,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.934
look for an extension theme,

00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:24.815
okay, and pick something that you like.

00:09:24.815 --> 00:09:29.030
I personally like Firefox theme.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.700
And I already have it installed.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.044
So I'm just going to click on Set Color Theme,

00:09:35.044 --> 00:09:37.910
Firefox, dark, and boom.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.285
Now I have different colors in my VS code.

00:09:41.285 --> 00:09:43.040
Pretty nice.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.190
It also have light theme if you're interested.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.875
Okay, I think that's all.

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:51.660
See you in the next one.
