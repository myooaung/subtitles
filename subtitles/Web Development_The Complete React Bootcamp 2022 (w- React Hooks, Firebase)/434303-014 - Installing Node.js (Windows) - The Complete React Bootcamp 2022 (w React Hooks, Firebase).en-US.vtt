00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.565
Hi, In this video we're about

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:04.935
to install Node.js on Windows.

00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:06.870
What is NodeJS and why do we need

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.315
it is explained in the next video.

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:11.025
What we need to do is to open

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.755
any browser and go to Google.

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:17.310
And Google will look for no GS.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.270
The first link is going to be the official website.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.155
Here we have two versions to be downloaded,

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:27.585
LTS and current version.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:29.085
Current version is

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:32.309
the very latest version available for download,

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.775
and LTS is the latest stable version.

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:37.935
We don't need to over-complicate.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:40.260
That's why we get LTS.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.130
Click on that one,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.960
and then open the installer.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.260
Wait a bit and hit Next.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.989
Yes, I accept Next,

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.420
change the path if you need to.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.944
Next, at this step we need no GS,

00:00:56.944 --> 00:00:59.540
NPM and attitude path.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.320
Next, at this step we have tools for

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.325
native modules and we want to select this option.

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:09.470
What is that and why do we need it?

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.610
Just like it says,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.260
some npm modules need to be

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.395
compiled from CC plus plus when installing.

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:16.265
What does it mean?

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:18.620
It means that there are some libraries, modules,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.025
or packages that we will install during

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:24.220
our development that requires

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.950
some native binaries specific to the OS,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.810
in our case, windows.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.900
So the tools that will compile

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.265
those smooth muscles are

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:36.620
Python and Visual Studio build tools.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.870
So this option will just install

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.480
them if they are missing now, right?

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.910
Hit Next and hit Install.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.470
I'm not going to click Install because I

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.510
already have no GS installed.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.135
But for you, this is what is going to happen.

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:51.725
When you click on that button,

00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:56.030
you will see a new CMD window will pop up.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.440
And it will see something

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.720
like we're going to do and install

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.860
this order that we will require this number of space.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.335
Just close that window and after that,

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:09.380
you will see another window will be opened,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.210
which is PowerShell window.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.315
And there will be all installation log.

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:16.580
So just wait some time until it's

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.010
done and then you're good.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.190
No JS is considered to be installed.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.250
Now let's verify that. How to do that.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.569
Click on Start panel and look for cmd.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.655
Then we open that.

00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:38.375
And in CMT we type node space, dash, dash version.

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:41.255
Hit Enter and you should see

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:44.345
the version that you've just installed.

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:46.430
It might be possible that when you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.129
type node dash, dash version,

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.500
you will see something like node is not

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.650
recognized as an internal or external command.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.630
So we have to find

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.225
another way to verify our installation.

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:02.330
To do that, we need to again go to

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.690
start Panel than to control panel.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.250
And then we'll look for programs and features, okay?

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.255
Here we need to verify that we have no GS in the list.

00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:20.510
So if you have no GS in the list by here,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.010
it gives you notice not

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.590
recognized as an internal extra command.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.840
Then you need to do a small tweak

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.580
in system configuration.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.720
So what you need to do is again click on Start panel in

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.420
the search type ENV

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.260
and select edit the system environment variables.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.410
Then click on the environment variables.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.560
And here, under system variables,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.205
you must find the path variable.

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:51.125
Double-click on that one.

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:55.880
And in the list you will not see C Program Files.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.320
No JS, which is my installation path for no jazz.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.710
So because you don't have it here in the list,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.815
you see node is not recognized, okay?

00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:08.330
So what you need to do,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.715
you need to click on New and

00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:14.180
add your installation path for no GS.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.635
So if you didn't modify the option in the installation,

00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:21.530
it would be C Program Files, NodeJS as well.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.270
So hit New, paste the path over here, okay?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.020
Okay, okay, then just restart the terminal.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.945
Then try node dash, dash version. Again.

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:35.270
After that, you should see the version.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.800
And that's basically it.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.715
Congrats, You've just install NodeJS on Windows.

00:04:40.715 --> 00:04:43.170
See you in the next one.
