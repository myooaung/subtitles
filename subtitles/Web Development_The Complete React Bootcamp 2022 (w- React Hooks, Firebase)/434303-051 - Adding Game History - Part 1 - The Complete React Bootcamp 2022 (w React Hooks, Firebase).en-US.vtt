00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910
Hey,

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.290
welcome in this video will start building the game history,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.390
which will be visible at the bottom.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.010
And also we will be able to travelers this game history.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.120
When we click on it,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.060
Let's go,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.790
Let's get back to decode and let's inspect how we currently manage our state.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.550
So right now it is an array off nine elements where every element represented the square

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.490
and that's fine.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.900
We will keep it.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.450
But we will transform a state a little bit because in order to implement the game history,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.950
we need to keep track off every game move.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.280
So when we click on it,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.420
we know that at this particular step,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.250
the state was equal to this game in report something like that.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.570
So that's why I created this image to show you how we're going to transform this state.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.170
So at the top,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.040
we can see our current state,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.320
but at the bottom.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.230
This is how we will transform it.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.900
So we will also create an array.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.480
But this time it is going to be an array off objects where every object will represent our

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.850
game state at this particular moment.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.030
So this object will have two keys board and is X next.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.630
So board will be equal to exactly the same as before,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.650
but will represent the board state at this moment and is X.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.120
Next.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.230
We will combine it just in one object,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.550
and it will also represent This is X next at this particular step.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.540
So let's go to decode and let's integrated.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.870
So we will remove.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.320
This is X next state and instead of board verbal use history.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.550
So we will rename it simply history and set history.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.470
So as before,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.330
it is going to be an array.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.390
But this time we will not use it like that.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.450
We will initialize a new array,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.900
and it will have one object insight.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.980
And this object will have board which will be equal as before to this array off nine empty

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.540
elements.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.330
And second key is going to be is X next,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.530
and by default,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.520
it is set to,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.670
let's say true.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.220
Now we need to also keep track off our current step.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.880
Let's say so when we click on it,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.400
we know that.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.860
All right,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.820
this step has number five.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.350
This step has number two.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.560
So we need to create another state for these most So we're going to create Const.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.950
Let's a current move and then sought current move,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.790
and by default it will be set to zero.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.240
It will be just an index inside this history away in simple terms.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.320
And also we need to know our current game state at this particular move.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.470
That's why we will create a shortcut.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.390
Mobile Name it,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.810
Let's say just current and it is going to be history with index off current move something

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.380
like that.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.960
Now,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.040
in places where we have errors,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.180
let's adjust everything to our new shape.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:13.780
So instead of just bored double reference current and then dot board to get this keep from

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.130
our object.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.900
Okay,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.740
So instead of just his ex next,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.010
we will pour current dot is eggs next here inside handles Query,

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.520
click.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.020
Also current Dodge board position and here,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.590
we don't need said,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.350
is next.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.900
And instead of said board,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.660
we now will use set history,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.000
and we need to change it slightly.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.680
So instead of returning this new area,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.650
we first need to get the latest board state,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.950
so we will create a new valuable inside public name at last,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.580
and it is going to be previous previous dot length minus one,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.410
and it will give us the last element in this previous airway.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.850
So it is going to be this object,

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.910
but the latest one,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.700
all right,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.150
and here instead off mapping the previous dot map,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:23.100
Google map lust dot board dot map and what we will do inside instead of just his ex.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.470
Next we will do last dot is aches next and now we return our new board.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.940
But from this set history,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.440
we need to richer the new state with the shape that would define here as otherwise.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.550
The application will be simply broken.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.900
So OK,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.260
let's put it instead of just returning it,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.420
let's put it in available.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:53.170
So it is going to be constant new board when it is going to be in you are a perfect and

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.690
from this set history,

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.520
we will return the next thing.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.860
We will return previous come cat to add mute valleys to the previous state array.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.050
So it is going to be an object,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.430
and this object will have board and this board will be equal to the new board.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:20.070
The new value that we have all right and then for is X next mobile port last is X next and

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.080
negation in front of it to reverse the value.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.380
So now if we say with,

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.950
we still have one more error over here,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.850
so we will port current.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.420
I thought board to fix it.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.760
Now if we save it,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.690
we don't have any warning or right.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.210
Let's get back to the app.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.400
And if we play the game,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.520
nothing changes because our current move we don't update it.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.520
It is always set to zero.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.050
So after we said the history,

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.690
we will also update our current move.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.190
We will increase it by one every time.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.130
So we will call said current move will say previous,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:08.560
previous plus one to incriminate de calendar if we save it and go back to our app now if we

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.480
play the game,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.350
everything is fine.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.750
Everything works and let's actually consul,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.230
look our history to see what do we have?

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.640
So I'm gonna put history And if I will see my council log,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.650
let's play the game and see how it is being changed with every next move.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.330
All right,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.960
Perfect.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:38.560
So now you can see we keep track off our moves and we have the full control over our state

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.560
.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.980
So perfect.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.260
That's how we will manage it in the next video.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.350
We'll continue building this history,

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.350
and we will actually displayed on the weapons.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.720
But before we finish,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.370
let's commit our changes.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.550
So I'm gonna put get at dot and then get commit.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.080
Transform state to game history.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.430
Something like that.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.270
All right,

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.850
see you in the next part.
