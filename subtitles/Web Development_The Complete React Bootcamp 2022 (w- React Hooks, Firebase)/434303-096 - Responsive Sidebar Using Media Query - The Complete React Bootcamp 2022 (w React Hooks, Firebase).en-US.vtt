00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
Hey,

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.890
welcome in this.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.130
We're we're going to make our job,

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.320
er,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.360
that we created in the previous video responsive.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.900
What I mean is that now,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.550
if we try and inspect our element and if we open Drover,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.780
if we resize the window,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.600
it stays static.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.130
Well,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.490
it is not responsive at all what we can do to fix this for Drover.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.330
There is this probe available,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.360
which is full,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.370
which means that Drover will be available for full screen.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.590
Let's check this full property and let's see,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.330
what do we have?

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.910
So right now when we open it when we are on desktop devices,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.660
we can see it is full screen.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.440
However,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.670
if we are on mobile devices,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.870
it looks good.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.820
So what?

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.500
Weaken Dio?

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.360
We would ideally want to enable this full screen property only when we are on mobile

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.950
devices.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.750
So we need to some have determine it programmatically well,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.950
we can actually use media queries,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.590
but they're only available and CSS But with hooks,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.280
we can achieve the same result programmatically.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.630
So let's open the assets file the assets folder and here confined use media query gs.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:19.220
Let's open it and let's copy this hook now Let's pace this hook to our custom hogs dgs and

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.650
let's import use a fact from react.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:30.010
So now what this hook does it hooks into window much media a p I,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.840
and it allows us to manipulate media queries.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.700
Programmatically I will not dive into details here.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.560
Let's just see how it works.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.260
So I'm going to save the file.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.100
Then let's come back to Dashboard Tuggle.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.930
And here we gonna call this use media query hook and inside we need to pass a media break

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.430
point.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:00.650
So let's say we will open our parent eases and we're gonna pass Max with 1992 pixels.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.830
And now this hook returns at Bullen that will indicate whether it is true or false.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.400
So,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.120
using this,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.540
we can check if we're currently on device with 992 pixels.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.420
So let's poor is mobile And this Bullen we're going to pass toothy,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.290
full prop.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.690
So when we are on mobile devices,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.810
we will have full property enabled.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.100
When we are on desktop devices,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.930
this will be set to falls and we will don't have this full property if we save it.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.550
Let's get back to the app now if we are on mobile devices.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.960
If our screen size it's less than 992 pixels,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.770
we have our full Drover and it works perfectly.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.310
And if we are on desktop devices,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.110
we have this static Drover that is not changed.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.720
Well,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.750
this is exactly the behavior we wanted.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.990
So here we're done with our responsiveness.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.150
Let's finish this video and commit our changes.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:09.940
Let's put everything to the get and we will name our commit as edit use media query hook

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.630
and made Drover responsive.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.570
Okay,

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.200
Perfect.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.650
See you in the next one.
