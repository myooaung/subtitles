00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
Hi, In this video,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.945
we will install VS Code and

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:07.020
editor that we will use throughout the course.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.775
First of all, why VS Code or Visual Studio code?

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:15.030
I think I personally think that this is one of

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.995
the best editors and

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.175
IDE available for JavaScript projects.

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:24.345
If you're comfortable with any other editor, for example,

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:27.855
atom for development, if you have any prior experience,

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:29.130
feel free to use it.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.565
But into training, I advise to his missiles pseudocode

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:36.240
due to its plug-in system and is just comfortable.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.550
Okay, So let's install it.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.325
What we have to do is to go to Google as always,

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:43.355
and type VS Code.

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:46.910
And it brings us to the official website.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.055
So I suggest to open docs page and don't look page.

00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:54.710
So on the download page we have

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.590
installers for three different OS,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.900
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.930
So for Windows it is pretty straight forward, right?

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.940
You click on the installer

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.720
and it starts the download, okay,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.555
for Linux and macOS,

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:13.610
I advise to go to

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.930
the docs page and then depending on your OS,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.240
go to appropriate section.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.690
So for Linux, it is also pretty straightforward.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.930
Depending on your Linux distribution,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.275
there are dogs that you can read

00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:33.770
and see how you have to install NodeJS.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.420
I mean, how exactly you're

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.490
going to do that because the commands

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.405
will be different based on your distribution.

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.370
Okay, so just treat the Dogs.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.690
Trust me, this is pretty

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.140
simple and basically the same for Mac OS.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.730
That is one easy way.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.115
You get the installer and you just

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:55.430
drag it into your launchpad.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.285
That's it.

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:59.225
And VS Code is considered to be installed.

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:02.255
Okay, so for Windows we got the installer.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.965
We'll launch it.

00:02:03.965 --> 00:02:08.180
This user meant to run to ground us and said, Oh pay.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.355
So in So yes,

00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:13.490
I want to continue running.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.110
Okay. I close it.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.145
You will not see that. Okay.

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:20.510
So I'm here.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.024
I went to accept.

00:02:22.024 --> 00:02:24.290
You can change the path if you

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.210
want to this as default installation.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.715
This is also written into dogs.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.280
You can read about it here.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.260
So where is it?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.255
Okay, it's here.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.790
Now we click Next.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.345
Next. Now here we

00:02:41.345 --> 00:02:44.990
need to select at two path that is selected by default,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.090
but make sure it is there.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.820
Register code as an additive for supportive file types.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.180
Yes, this is advised to be selected.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.005
This is optional and if you need to create desktop item,

00:02:57.005 --> 00:02:59.720
okay, then hit install.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.110
After that, it will take some time and boom,

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.440
you will see VS code on your desktop.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.020
After that, you launch it and

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.465
you end up in a window like that,

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:13.310
the theme will be different,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.230
but it doesn't matter.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.509
Vscode is now installed.

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:18.860
How to configure with

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.320
SQL code and how to install plugins.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.020
Everything will be covered in the next video.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.980
See you there.
