00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
Hello.

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.890
In this video,

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.970
we will start building.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.440
The project will install all dependence is and will also connect to get and get up.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.240
Let's go.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.220
As a template,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.220
we will use create react app,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.170
which is the official template that is maintained by the react team.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.250
In the future,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.270
when you will start building in your project yourself,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.850
most probably you will peak,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.640
create react app and it is indeed an amazing tool.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.450
It has a lot off tools around it and it is actively maintained by the community and by the

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.810
team.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.930
So I already opened the official web page.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.490
And from the quick start,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.370
I need to rub this command to use this template.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.570
But since in my case,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.430
I'm using cured as my package manager,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.660
I have it installed.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.110
I need to extend this command with use and PM.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.360
But if you don't know what is yarn or if you did it,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.080
install it.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.630
Just use that command and you will be fine.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.150
So I'm going to copy it.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.240
And from the folder where I want to put my project,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.170
I will run terminal and inside this terminal I will paste this command and instead of my

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.700
app.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.400
I will put the name off Fuller.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.750
So it is going to be box office and let's see what is going to happen.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.890
So basically it will create a new folder.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.300
It will put everything inside this folder,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.480
and also it will automatically install old dependencies.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.650
So let's wait and then we will inspect the project.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.380
All right,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.480
now that all of our files are installed,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.160
let's go to RIAS Code and let's open this folder over here.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.120
So it is this box office.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.450
I'm gonna open it and then we will inspect all files that we have inside.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.840
So as you can see,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.020
we have source folder as before.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.720
And now we have public folder over here.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.490
Let's open all of them and let's again go one by one with files.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.800
So first to read me with the documentation and it is basic.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.730
So nothing here that might have package Eason.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.030
So here we have a few dependence is already installed.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.920
So as before,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.120
we have react,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.240
react dumb.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.770
And also we have react scripts and this react scripts Is this that package that comes from

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.740
this template and it is all these tools that are already available for us with these

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.250
templates.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.260
So basically,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.380
like local server,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.750
the bill script,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.820
the automatic testing and all of these things.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.040
And also we have,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.280
Ah,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.540
a few dependencies defied for testing than inside scripts.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.120
We have this start script as before the bill script test and reject.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.780
So what is this test in Egypt?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.930
So obviously test is something related to testing and reject.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.090
Is this script that will eject all our files?

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.030
Let's say to raw configuration.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.200
So as you can see,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.670
we don't have any conflict file to customize the behaviour off this template so we can run

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.390
this eject command that will reject all off our configuration toothy profiles.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.520
So we have access to everything because under the hood,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.050
it uses another module and project bundler rap back,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.250
and we don't have access to it directly.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.060
So we need to eject it to get access to those files.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.310
But most of the time,

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.110
we don't need this ejected command over here that also we have,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.520
Yes,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.090
Lincoln pick that comes with this package.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.460
But it doesn't matter for us because we will create our own yes,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.940
link and we will override it.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.520
And also browser list that customizes how well is our support will before the browsers,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.690
but this means that it will basically run in the old latest browsers.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.390
All right,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.620
then we have get ignore to ignore all cash files and other things like E N v files,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.000
and we will talk about them than under sores.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.810
As before,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.220
we have Index GS.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.320
We have Abdul GS and some other files that we will talk about,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.690
but also we have the public fuller.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.610
And in the previous project we had Index HTML defined in the root folder.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.730
But now we have this public fuller,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.120
and these public folder will be not protest by these,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.890
Let's say wept back bundler and inside.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.640
What report?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.890
This public folder will be just moved to the production built without any processing.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.220
So these are our static files,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.990
like images or whatever,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.460
like files that we use a zoo.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.980
Other third party files inside index HTML.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.700
As before,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.060
we have pretty simple set up nothing too special.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.970
A few Met attacks defined some Aikens that are provided by this template.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.390
The no script attack,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.450
which will say this message If javascript is not available inside the browser and again the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.350
mounting point,

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.090
which is I d with wrote and also this manifest file.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.730
But we will talk about this manifest file in the future and also father bacon and logo

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.350
icons.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.970
All right,

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.890
maybe let's run this app.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.470
So from package Jason,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.960
I'm going to run NPM Run start.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.740
And before I run this command,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.570
what I will do I will do is next thing to prevent one unwanted behavior.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.410
So when I run this comment,

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.690
it will automatically open my default browser with the local server.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.520
If you are fine with that,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.850
then just want this comet.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.580
But if you don't want to automatically open the browser for you,

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.020
you need to create a new file called E n v dot local too,

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.890
said the environment wearables.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.500
And here we can pour.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.750
We can override the environment variables that come from this template,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:01.230
which is just browser and it must be all upper cased and I will pour just equals none to

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.370
prevent its be here.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.470
And now when I will start this comment,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.490
it will not open the browser for me.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.740
So I need to manually go to the browser and then go to local host and then open it by

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.360
myself.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.950
All right.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.550
Now,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.740
as we can see,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.830
we have this basic template that comes from this package,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.910
and we can see it inside this source folder.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.620
But we don't need this file,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.280
So let's clean up a little bit inside Abdul Gs.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.260
We don't need all of that.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.590
Let's remove that this class name,

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.180
Let's put high then we don't need this CSS and logo.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.900
So let's from of all of that,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.620
then we don't need this app.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.470
CSS so we will just remove it than tests.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.230
We don't need them for now.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.530
Then we will leave Index CSS.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.990
And if we look inside index gs here we have a few things defined that we haven't seen

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.550
before,

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.760
such as react,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.280
strict mode and service.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.420
Worker street mode gives us more.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.980
Let's say safety and control over errors in react.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:15.070
But in these app we don't need it because it will lead to warnings that we don't want to

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.390
see.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.200
That's fine not to use it,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.690
because if I'm not drunk,

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.230
it's still experimental,

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.830
and then we have service worker,

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:27.440
and this is something that we will talk about in the end off this section and it will allow

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.870
us to turn our application into at progressive Web app.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.500
Then we have logo SPG.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.210
We don't need it as well,

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.930
then service workers.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.280
So this is for the future use and also set top tests.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.450
So we will not do any tests in this project.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:49.830
So let's just remove it all right now we have everything clean and if we go back to page,

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.400
it is empty.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.500
And as before,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.690
we have this local Sorber with automatic reload for us.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.950
All right then,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:03.590
the next thing I want to do here is I want to install dependencies.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.210
And if we go to the Assets folder here,

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.620
we confined installed preacher in the ESL it.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:17.630
So let's run this file and let's install these dependencies from top in the same way that

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.330
we did in the previous project.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.890
So let me install all of them.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.770
And while they are installing,

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.100
let's create two new files here,

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:32.610
not preacher RC and then dot es Lind RC.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.150
And as before,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.070
let's just copy this convicts from that file.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.090
So for preacher bubble,

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:44.410
use that one and we will put it here and then for yes,

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:44.860
Lynch,

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.900
we will use this conflict.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:53.520
It is slightly different from the one that we used before because it has one more plug in

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:53.940
here,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.490
which is a reactor hooks,

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.700
and it will give us warnings.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.110
If we use react hooks in the wrong manner.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.570
That's basically it.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:08.340
And also inside this file we confined NPM scripts that we will just copy.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:14.420
So let's go to package Jason and let's put them at the end here.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.780
And also,

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.830
since we have this clear command right before we run to build commanded,

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.740
we need to ensure that we received the fresh built.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.920
So we gonna Ron and PM run clear.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.540
And only after that we will use react scripts built.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.000
So by default it will produce the production built,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.850
toothy built folder.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.060
So maybe let's run this builds group and let's see what to do.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.450
We have So NPM run built,

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.150
creating an optimized production bill,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.450
so everything's fine.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.260
As you can see,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.960
we have a new folder over here.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.000
Let's check it out.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.190

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.620
We will use this built folder when we will come to the deployment part.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.270
Okay,

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.710
