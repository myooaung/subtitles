00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
Hey there in this video,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.660
we're going to turn our website into a progressive Web app.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.920
Let's go first.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.070
Let's define what is a progressive Web app from Mozilla Web dogs.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.970
We can see that a progressive app,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.980
app is this type of Web application that brings a native app like user experience.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.780
It means that the website that we use can be installed as if it was a really native

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.540
application and also it becomes accessible off line.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.300
And for a website to become a progressive up app,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.920
it must follow a specific list off conditions or requirements and when all of them are

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.850
satisfied,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.950
then the website becomes a progressive Web app.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.520
A few off those conditions are already listed over here,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.580
so first the website must be served over https.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.760
Then it must include a service worker and a manifest file.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.570
What is a service worker?

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.660
A servers worker is a script that comes along with the website,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.880
and it acts like a middleman or a proxy between us declined and the server.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.160
So next time.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.010
But we will try a sent a request to the server.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.170
The Web browser will look inside the service worker in the first place,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.880
and only then it will send the actual request.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.980
Then we have the manifest file,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.630
which is a Jason file that describes how our application will look like when it is being

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.130
installed on the device.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.760
So,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.430
for example,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.550
inside this file,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.240
we can specify what application name we will see on the screen or what Aikens it will use.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.130
And so one.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.750
All right.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.250
Now let's take a look how we can enable our website to become a progressive Web app.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.300
So first of all,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.150
under our source scored other public folder we can find Manifest Jason file.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.600
So this is the file that describes our application when it is being installed on the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.220
machine.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.330
So we have short name and name,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.880
so this is what we will see on the shortcut.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.440
Then we have icons that will be used on different devices and other parameters,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.830
such as colors,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.380
display mode and start euro.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.400
We will not change anything here,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.310
but if you really want to do so,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.830
just generate your own icons and then just use your own name.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.040
But now we are going Teoh Service Worker.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.950
Let's open index dot gs and if you remember for the first time when we inspected that file

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.950
,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.580
we saw this service worker dot unregistered the let's first switch it to register and then

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.010
what it does It simply registers a service worker on our website If we open service worker

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.410
Dodgy,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.780
yes,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.870
we confined this logic that does all the magic in the background.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.740
But this code is not the service worker itself.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.970
It is just a code that registers the service worker The script.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.070
The service worker itself is somewhere inside create reacted template and we can't get

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.030
access to it.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.630
And we can't modify it.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.050
So what it does Basically it cashes all off our app.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.810
Pull off our files so our app and the end becomes available offline.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.440
All right,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.770
now that we have enabled option for service worker,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.570
let's try and redeploy our website by running NPM Run deploy.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.560
After that,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.300
we will see changes online.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.000
All right,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.980
Seems like our application has been published.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.760
Let's navigate your browser.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.550
Let's open our website.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.400
Let's click,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.160
inspect,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.910
then go to application service workers And let's refresh the app so it might take a while

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.930
until changes are propagated.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.990
But just keep refreshing.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.200
And in a while,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.920
you will see a service worker being registered here under service workers.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.950
So I'm gonna wait until mine is registered.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:59.400
Well,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.560
right after one minute when I refreshed the website,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.590
I saw this service worker over here.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.190
And you should see it too.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.220
Now let's click on this source and we will see the service worker file itself.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.470
So it was automatically generated for us by Crete React app template.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.940
What?

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.460
We don't go too much into details because this is not our topic now how we can see if we

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.080
actually use this service worker.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.550
Now,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.700
if we go under network tap and if we refresh the page if we extend this window here,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.880
we can see that our wrote your Elle is being served over service worker instead of just

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.950
sending the request.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.820
So what is happening that when we try to access our website,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.050
we actually get all of the files from service worker not from the server,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.110
not from Geeta,

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.740
but from service worker.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.810
So this is basically it.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.380
Now,

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.290
one more thing about all of that is that we can use this lighthouse tool that is built in

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.750
inside Google home.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.300
And it will allow us to analyze our website and see what we have run.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.550
So let's click on Generate report and then it will analyze our website and it will generate

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.710
a report for us.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.150
And from here we can see what kind of problems do we experience for each of the category.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.800
It will suggest us a few solutions and that we can apply to improve it.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.300
But in our case,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.030
for example,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.480
for performance,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.600
we can't use efficient cash policy because we don't have access to the server configuration

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.770
because we use get help as a server.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.490
But we can definitely use accessibility.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.150
Weaken definitely improve it.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.130
We can improve contrast off our colors.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.350
We can improve accessibility,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.490
off form elements and so one.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.890
But the most important part here that we have progressive web app optimized.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.480
It means that from now on,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.230
our application is install a ble and it is progressive wrap up optimized.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.350
So how we can actually install it.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.240
So if we are on desktop,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.450
if we are using Google from here,

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.350
you will find this plus sign.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.800
And if you are on mobile devices,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.280
when next time you will try to navigate to this website.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.270
It will propose you to install this on your home screen.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.390
But for desktop users,

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.070
let's click on this plus sign and let's click Install.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.070
So as you can see now,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.680
it was opened in a separate window,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.660
and if I close it now,

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.000
I can exit from my desktop.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.760
So now I have the shortcut.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.820
Let's open it.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.440
And as you can see now,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.710
it behaves as if it was a really application.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.020
And it is inside a standalone window.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.850
And if we're quick on three dotes,

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:50.340
weaken,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.410
even uninstall it as if it was an application.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.270
All right,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.170
so this is basically it.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.480
This is how we can use progressive web,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.500
perhaps on our website.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.910
If you have any questions,

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.340
you are always welcome down in the commentary section.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.830
But this is the end of this video and end off this project.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.570
Well done.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.450
I'm glad that you made it up to this point,

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.270
and I'm going to see you in the next section.
