00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
Hey there.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.090
In this video,

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.770
we're gonna work with clients and we will create a model window from which we're gonna send

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.090
a request to our cloud function and then send a notification to Absi.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.200
Um,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.790
users.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.740
Let's go,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.860
Let's navigate back to B s code.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.700
And first,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.550
let's open fire Base Duchy s and let's import functions package.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.180
So at the top,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.320
I'm gonna pour import firebase slash functions.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.460
Now let's greet a new instance.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.840
So export const functions app dar functions.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.450
And when he opened,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.820
Parenti says you can see a region over here.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.550
The thing with cloud functions that they are available in multiple regions by default.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.970
They are available on the U.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.030
S East region.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.650
For Europe users,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.680
this is not great.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.050
That's why we need to change the region off our function.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.920
For that,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.390
let's navigate to FC M Dodgy s at the place where we create this function.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.560
And inside this definition,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.770
let's add another chain off a region and inside bubble specified that this function will

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.670
run on Europe West three region.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.040
You can specify whatever region you like.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.580
OK,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.020
so Europe West three And now when we initialize this instance,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.720
we need to pass Europe West three in order for it to work.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.150
And also when we will use this functions instance inside our client,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.850
it will try and access the rial cloud function that is already deployed.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.140
But for local development,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.120
this is not good.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.550
That's why we need to here at the bottom check If we currently inside local development

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.920
then we will use functions.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.760
Amma later that we run with MP Enron,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.780
start inside Functions folder.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.630
So here,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.760
if we're going to check if is local host and is local host previously in videos We exported

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.540
it from here we extracted This is local host valuable from service worker file created by

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.650
Creek React app and now we're gonna use it.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.110
Okay,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.730
so is local host.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.060
Let's import it.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.680
So if this is the case,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.670
then we're gonna say functions,

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.930
use functions.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.320
EmLeader and we need to specify the Europe for that.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.030
Let's go to Functions folder inside our terminal.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.080
And here we're gonna jive and PM Ron start and let's see the output.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.870
All right.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.890
As you can see,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.640
our functions emulator is running on local host 5001.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.580
So we need to specify here http than local host and 5001.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.680
All right now,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.000
we are all set with our s decayed.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.060
Now let's create the actual Moto.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.640
So let's go to chat window Top.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.340
And inside this folder we're gonna create any file that we will name sent FC M Bt in Moto

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.120
gs.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.380
And actually we're gonna copy and paste code from Let's navigate to create room Beat and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.110
Moto So we're gonna call be all of that and place it here.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.410
Now let's start replacing things.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.630
So first of all,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:18.340
we will rename it to send FC M Bt and model and let's actually use this component inside

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.560
index togs inside top folder.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.250
So here,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.820
instead of this to do,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.120
we're gonna ask if our user is admin,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.670
then please show us.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.430
Send FC M Bt and Moto.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.930
All right,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.360
Good.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.520
Now let's start replacing component.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.040
First,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.420
we're gonna check our motile for our form,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.920
so we will not have name and description.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.520
We will have title and message that we will send to our cloud function so title and message

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.940
and is required.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.960
We're gonna say title is required and message body is required.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.330
Okay,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.710
Good.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:04.660
Now let's delete this import than our initial form is going to be titled and message now

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.020
let's import use motile State again.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.590
All right,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.770
so we have form.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.360
Value is loading for him.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.780
Rough on submit.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.410
Okay,

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.250
we're gonna change it slightly.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.970
So,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:17.460
actually,

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.720
let's delete this part and keep it like that.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.170
Now,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.680
here,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.390
inside Js six.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.610
We're gonna remove this,

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.820
Steve completely.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.550
We're gonna remove this class name,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.050
and we will leave it as react fragment.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.330
So for button,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:39.920
we're gonna specify appearance off primary and size is going to be extra small than it's

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.650
not going to be a block component and color.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.690
Let's keep it the default color.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.170
So for I can we're gonna specify I complied.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:55.120
Cast and we will say broadcast message instead of sent FC M.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.380
Let's be a little bit more creative.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.270
So for model,

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.070
that's fine.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.890
Let's change title to send notification Teoh room users than for this form.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.890
It looks fine for form group.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.240
We're gonna change it.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.200
Teoh Title form control name is going to be title and placeholders going to be enter

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.500
message title than four description.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.000
We're going to change it to message again.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.750
It is going to be a text area component of our name is going to be message.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.810
This name must match our state key,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.490
which is title and message.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.030
All right,

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.950
so please,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.370
holder must be something like and the notification message.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.640
Okay,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.020
good.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.200
And for this button at the bottom.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.190
So appearance,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.170
primary on click on submit block.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.540
Okay,

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.460
it looks good.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.720
Now,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.130
let's only change the text to publish message like that.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.630
Okay,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.050
Good.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.890
Now let's take a look at the top.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.800
We have unneeded alert and also a needed firebase import.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.330
Let's say with Let's navigate back to Chad.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.570
And now we have this moral window,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.550
so enter a title and message.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.030
All right,

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.630
now let's define the functionality.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.840
So what is going to happen on Submit?

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.920
We need to send a request to our cloud function.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.880
And as you remember,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.780
our cloud function is a callable function,

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.300
and we use functions as decayed.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.240
That's why it is going to be so easy to do.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.050
So let's put try kitsch block over here.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.130
Let's put aside is loading to the top like this so inside trite kitsch block,

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.160
we're gonna do the next thing First,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.770
we're going to create any valuable sent FC M and then we're gonna call functions as decayed

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.520
that we import from Firebase Dodgy s.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.100
Then we're gonna call https gullible.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.580
And here we need to specify function name that we want to call,

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.540
so this is very important.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.850
So inside index togs we export send FC M cloud function.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.030
This is its name.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.530
All right,

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.780
so let's copy it.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.290
And here we're going to specify that we will call sent FC M Cloud function.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.900
This method https gullible,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:17.680
returns us and you function that we need to call in order to actually send a request to

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.580
cloud function.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.050
All right,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.290
this is not the request itself.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:28.940
So right now we need to call or invoke ate sand FC M with data that we want to pass to

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.940
cloud function.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.080
And then this data will be available here under this data available.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.800
So what we will do,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.530
we will call a weight than sent FC M.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.580
And inside we will past chat I d.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.710
As you remember,

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.780
we need to receive Chad I d title and message.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.250
So,

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.070
chet idea,

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.660
we need to first get it.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.400
So let's put here and the top char i.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.960
D.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.450
Hughes programs.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.280
OK,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:57.740
Good.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.420
So we have checked I d and also we need to send title and message,

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.730
which is our form value.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.950
So we can simply spread it like this inside this object,

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.710
and now it will send the request.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.760
So at the end,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.850
we will have said is loading such trifles.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:18.570
Then we will call sat form value to initial value.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:23.700
So initial for and also we're gonna close this motor window.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.140
So in case off any alert or in case of any other,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:35.310
we're gonna call alert than at our and then ever dock message with the idea No.

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:36.830
Seven seconds.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.960
And also in case of success,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:45.560
we're gonna specify alert info and we will say notification.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.240
Has bean sent good?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.130
Looks pretty awesome.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.680
Now let's take a look at,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.120
as I can see here,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.170
I must move it to the top.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:55.920
All right,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.050
let's navigate.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.990
Let's go to broadcast message.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.740
Let's specify something super and publish.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.210
Message and notification has been sent.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.520
Now let's take a look.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.350
If we open our terminal,

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:14.020
we can see that inside our right terminal where we run cloud function,

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.910
we can see that beginning execution finished execution,

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.940
so it actually works.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.550
Now let's take a look inside our council.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.610
We don't see anything.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:29.390
And also maybe let's try to send it one more time to see what is going to happen.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.290
And let's open network tap.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.100
So I said the message.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.580
Then you can see that request is being sent to local Host Chat.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.560
Web up Europe was three Sand FC um,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.620
have ever I see that the result is false.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.060
And this is because as you remember,

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.770
inside our cloud function,

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.880
we check against room data FC M users.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.680
But right now,

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.120
inside our database,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.870
if we open our rooms,

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.220
we don't have any FC M users yet.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.760
We need to change it.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:08.120
So lets navigate to create room Bt and Moto and hear what we're gonna specify.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.340
So for admits,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.500
we will use also current user your i d.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.220
But also,

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.550
we're gonna specify FC um users.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.470
The first admin.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.390
The creator off this room will also receive notification by default.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.550
So let's copy it like that.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.360
Let's say we're and now we need to modify the existing group,

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.360
but that let's actually first copy our user i d.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.350
From here.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:37.580
Then let's click on this plus sign and let's say FC M users.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.120
Then again,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.060
plus sign.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.090
Let's add our own user.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.010
I d And then for value.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.300
Let's for truth.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.950
Then we add this value.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:46.580
Now,

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.050
let's try and sand broadcast message one more time,

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.650
so I will say something silly.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.260
Okay?

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.140
Notification has been sent.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:00.400
If I opened my consul now I can see that I receive a new consul log,

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.690
which comes from Firebase Dodgy s.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.650
And if I open this file,

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.770
I can see that it comes from this messaging on message.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.800
So I have from notification,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.700
I have body and title.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:14.920
Now,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:21.340
the only thing that I need to do here is to actually display this notification in more user

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.050
friendly.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.570
Wait.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.030
Well,

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:30.210
this will be pretty easy to do with toast or notification component that comes from our

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:30.640
suit.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.830
What we will do,

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:37.650
we're gonna import notification as toast from our suit.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.290
Why?

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.240
I'm using here.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:47.230
Notification has toast on not notification because notification also available as global

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.890
valuable inside window object inside the browser.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:56.290
So it might be confusing and we might just do something on.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.910
So just to make sure that we use a custom component,

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.300
we named it dosed.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.150
So here inside on message.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.470
We gonna pour something like,

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.180
As you remember,

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.230
we have notification.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.350
Object inside,

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.060
so we can destructor it from here.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.860
Notification.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:21.170
And then we're gonna call We again will destruct chur this time from notification title and

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.890
body.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:28.150
So now we have these two keys and we're gonna call toast door in four.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:34.490
Then we will pour title description and description is going to be body and old,

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.730
so duration zero.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.460
So what it will do,

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:43.510
it will court and you component a notification component from our seared with this title

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.180
with this body,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.510
which is the description.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.760
Keep that we need to pass through this info and then duration is set to zero,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.180
so it will never close by itself.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.560
We need to manually go and close this notification.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:57.990
All right,

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.610
so now let's savor and let's take a look.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:09.000
So if I put something like a low and then this is body and published new message Now I have

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.350
this notification and this is it.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.980
However,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.170
there is one more cool thing to that.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:20.550
If I click on something like this published message and when I click on this button and

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.440
then quickly switch between taps.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.410
Now I will receive this notification.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.090
Pretty cool,

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:27.540
right?

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.050
So this is it.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.540
And this is how it is going to work.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:38.610
And all users that are subscribed to this broadcast messages will receive them on their

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.450
devices.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:44.280
Either it is PC or mobile device or whatever device to use.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.050
But this is what we're going to manage in the next video.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.900
For now,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.060
we're done here.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.000
Let's commit our changes.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.640
Let's open our terminal.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.860
Here is a good thing.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.530
It gives us firebase warning saying that using an unspecified index.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.830
So let's actually add,

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.190
and you index to our database rules.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.340
So let's open it.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:06.540
And,

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.810
as you can see,

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:12.150
consider adding index on the value at FC M tokens.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.190
So let's go to FC M tokens.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.120
Then we're gonna add index on.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:25.680
So let's copy from somewhere and put it over here and Index on is going to be dot value.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.430
OK,

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.640
so now let's publish these changes.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.650
Let's copy all of them.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.110
Let's navigate to database rules,

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.840
Jason,

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.980
and let's replace them like this.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:37.670
Okay,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:38.000
look,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.500
scored.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.470
Now let's commit our changes.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.050
Finally.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.390
So let me stop everything,

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:49.180
then I'm gonna put get at everything and then get commit.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.850
And then I will say,

00:14:50.850 --> 00:15:00.050
manage FC M from plant called cloud Function and sent FC M Perfect.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.530
See you in the next one.
