00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.090
Hey,

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.740
welcome in this video.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.450
I would like to talk about layout on our website and also how we are able to manage it.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.690
Let's go.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.770
In the previous video,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.860
when we talked about reacted alter,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.100
we also created the Nachbar component.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.780
So eventually inside Abdel G s,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.980
we have the lee out for our website.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.510
So we have switch,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.570
where would render our outs and on top we have knocks.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.570
This is why when we navigate between pages,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.490
we can still have the Knopper being displayed.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.050
And there is nothing wrong with this approach,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.650
but it will not work for every possible use case.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.700
What if we had multiple pages on our website that don't follow this exactly out pages that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.960
don't have no part on top of it.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.470
So this approach will not work and we need to find other solution because from now on,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.100
if we add new route to this switch,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.880
we will still end up with the knob are on top of it.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.200
So what do we do?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.420
And if we look into our final version off the website on home and start pages,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.430
we have title and also we have enough bar.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.490
But when we go to the show page,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.350
we don't have it.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.890
So it has.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.750
It's only out.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.090
So what do we do then?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.780
Well,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.990
we can use components to manage that.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.550
And for every page where we want to use these or that lay out,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.720
we need to manually specified.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.320
So under components,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.510
we're going to create a new component that we will name.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:42.880
Let's say Maine page layout and in sight will pour the same thing that we have insight

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.940
Abdel Gs.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:51.520
But we will replace our switch with something that we will pass.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.420
So all right,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.800
so now we import now.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.330
And do you remember the Children prop that we touched a little bit in the previous section

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.330
?

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.130
So this is the perfect use case for the Children.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.220
Prop inside.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.200
Our pages will use this component as that instead of dif bought up all the content around

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.960
main page layout.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.060
If I imported and whatever goes inside,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.720
this layout will be a part of it.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.150
So here we will receive whatever goes in sight as the Children prop,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.430
and we simply put it below the not bar component.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.910
Now,

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.860
if I say what,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.760
it will be broken because we need to get rid off this lee out inside Abdo Gs.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.650
Here we can simply poor switch and it will be enough.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.650
Let's also remove now Let's save,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.000
Let's get back to the APP And on the home page,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.640
we have it.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.810
But if we go to the start page,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.720
we don't have it.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.950
So it means that now we can have control over our templates over our layout.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.780
So inside start page,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.410
we need to do the same thing that we did inside home togs.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.080
We need to wrap it around this layout component.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.840
So here,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.860
instead of Deve Mobile,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.420
put it,

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.280
Let's save it.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.990
And if we navigate,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.870
we still have the same behavior as we had before.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.560
But now we have more control over it.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.270
All right,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.060
that's it.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.470
This is how you should and you will manage Lee outs in your future react projects.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.180
But in this Wieder I also wanted to create this title with the box office.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.660
And I are looking for a movie,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.310
an actor.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.950
So for this one,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.470
I will put you file over here,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.870
which we will name title and insight.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.880
I will create a Chuan tech and also I will create P tech.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.150
And for those I will put props.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.850
So for this component,

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:07.050
I will pass title as our main text and subtitle like that for H one,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.450
we will go with title and for the Pitak level.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.630
Poor subtitle All right,

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:22.900
now inside Hourly Out component Right before now Swivel displayed it title and as a props

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:32.850
we will pass four title It is going to be box office and for subtitle Are you looking for

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.530
looking for a movie or an actor?

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.820
Okay,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.320
perfect.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.430
Let's check it out.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.580
And yeah,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.420
no,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.860
I have it over here.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.290
All right.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.770
Perfect.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.150
Now let's commit our changes and finish the video.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.830
So get ads.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.970
Everything.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.870
Get commit.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:04.870
Let's put something like edit layout management and created title.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.950
All right?

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.650
For fact,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.730
everything seems clean now.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.960
See you in that excellent
