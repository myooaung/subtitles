00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.969
Welcome to the complete react bootcamp.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.300
Hi, my name is Andrew and I'm React developer.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.930
Hi, my name is our Ash and I may UI UX designer.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.325
Have you ever wanted to create an app similar to Twitter or Facebook?

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:16.635
Do you prefer practice over theory?

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:19.545
If so, you're in the right place together,

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:24.374
we are going to build three separate projects of different complexity from scratch,

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:27.030
a tic-tac-toe game and movie Search app,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.740
and finally, a chatter.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.580
These course is aimed at people who are eager to develop web apps.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.315
We technologies that become more and more popular nowadays.

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:41.660
First, we'll discuss all the basics you need to know before jumping into react.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.895
Here we will talk about no GS,

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:48.110
good client-side and server-side rendering APIs and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.255
essential tools to make you feel comfortable at any stage of the development approaches.

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:56.645
Right after that, we have a dedicated JavaScript section,

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:00.095
but we discovered the latest and up-to-date features of the language.

00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:03.740
Then we slightly move to react with the small portion of theory.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.135
At this point, you will get to know once Riak is made of and how it works.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:12.335
From here, we will start with our first project, that tic-tac-toe game.

00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:17.555
It has a modern UI with cool animations and seamless functionality in this project,

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:19.670
get to know first react.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.980
You will learn how to create components,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.485
dynamic styles in user interfaces.

00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:29.375
But we'll talk about state management and component lifecycle events using Hooke's.

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:30.725
By the end of this project,

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:35.735
you will be able to create a simple web app that shows off your strong react basic,

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:38.720
and you will experience the development flow in general.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.555
The second project is called box-office.

00:01:41.555 --> 00:01:44.765
It acts as a search engine for TV movies and shows.

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:47.630
You can get information about any movie or AG.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.935
And on top of that,

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:53.435
you can add them to favorites to review them in the future, we these project,

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:56.870
you move towards a more complex React app or you're working with

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.795
external APIs and managing non-primitive scenarios using costume 3i hooks.

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:08.225
Moreover, you will learn about CSS and JS as an alternative for styling and application,

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:12.845
we're going to explore the concept of dynamic routes and remote data fetching.

00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:15.380
You will also understand how to optimize and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.040
analyze React components using built-in react tools.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.615
At the end of these projects,

00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:24.755
we will even turn our app into a progressive web app that works offline.

00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:26.945
After the completion of the box office,

00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:30.380
you will be able to create a typical React application that

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.980
requires more comprehensive and advanced react knowledge.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.310
Our final project is going to be a chat up with

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.480
the most popular features required by any chat application.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.865
These include social media logins,

00:02:43.865 --> 00:02:46.745
account management, role-based permissions,

00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:51.200
real-time data, and lots of other cool features in this project,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.095
you will get to know Firebase in the first place.

00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:58.280
Here you will master user authentication and global state management.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.390
At this stage, react hooks is going to be your main weapon to develop

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.535
a production ready React app managing styles yourself isn't always desirable.

00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:13.715
That's why here we will use a UI components library to utilize a pre-built design system.

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:18.230
Finally, we will develop our own backend using Cloud Functions,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.180
and we will add the real-time notifications feature to our chat application.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.935
Wait, you're not done.

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:27.380
You're ready to help you out at any stage of

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.845
the course and answer your questions as quickly as possible.

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:33.110
Are you ready to explore, react together.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.490
See you in class.
