00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
Hey, finally we start talking about react.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.250
These short upcoming videos going to

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.650
touch on the React theory and concepts.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.525
Feel free to reference these series

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:11.025
anytime in the future.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:15.105
Let's go React is a library for building user interfaces.

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:16.830
It can be used to build websites,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.485
mobile apps, and even desktop apps.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:22.380
The easiest way to learn react is probably to

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.530
start from react on the web to build websites.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.790
In this video, I'm going to

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.725
speak from the web point of view,

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.870
reacts goal is to create

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.260
user interfaces with something called components.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.485
For websites, it is just react or React for the web.

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:40.295
For mobile apps, it is

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:44.465
React Native for desktop apps it is called electron.

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:47.315
React operates only on the view layer.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:49.010
It means that react does not

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.635
force on how you should build your app.

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:54.335
React just forces its own logic and

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:56.419
dictates how you should manipulate

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:58.580
the underlying HTML elements.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.055
The rest is on you in the past.

00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:03.545
In here, around 20 and 10,

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:05.660
JQuery was used a lot to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.434
manipulate HTML through JavaScript.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:11.555
But there is no need to use jQuery nowadays.

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:13.610
Since react is just to library,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.500
it can be integrated into

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.890
any existing app to build a user interface.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.254
Examples of React websites are Facebook and Netflix.

00:01:23.254 --> 00:01:27.110
Discord uses React for everything to build their website,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.660
mobile app, and even their desktop app

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.770
is built with React.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.375
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.640
React is not a framework that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.965
is by other parts of the application,

00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:39.649
must be built with other tools and libraries.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.500
And you will see that once we get into coding,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.145
at first, react was used to build single page apps,

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:48.920
only, websites that are fully managed by

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.760
JavaScript and intended to fill a more like mobile apps.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.100
But as for now, React community,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.690
it has created a lot of tools

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.445
and frameworks around react.

00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:00.920
Therefore, nowadays we are able to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.770
create any type of a website with React.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.065
But there it is, server-side rendering,

00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:08.540
single-page app, static web pages,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.475
or maybe a hybrid application.

00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:13.670
And you probably saw other solutions out there like Vue,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.745
JS, svelte, or maybe even Angler.

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:18.500
They all are based around

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.575
components and eventually achieve the same result.

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:24.305
It is really hard to tell which one to choose.

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:25.955
Something is more easier.

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:27.500
Something is more harder.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.405
If you still struggled with the choice,

00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:31.550
I would recommend to pick the one with

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.040
more appealing name or logo,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.510
as simple as that.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.874
But in our projects,

00:02:36.874 --> 00:02:38.840
we will get to know React.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.425
Stay tuned because only a few more theory videos left

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:47.220
before we get into the coding part until the next one.
