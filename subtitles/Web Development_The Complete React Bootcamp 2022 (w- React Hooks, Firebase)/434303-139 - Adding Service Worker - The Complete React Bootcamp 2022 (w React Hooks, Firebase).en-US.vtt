00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
Hey there.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.700
In this video,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.450
we will continue setting up firebase cloud messaging and we're gonna set up a service

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:06.950
worker.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.210
So I already navigated to firebase documentation and then I choose received messages.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.750
So in this section,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.270
I can read and you can read more about foreground and background messages,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.750
but we're interested in service worker file.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.950
So let's not forget to our code and the first thing we will do but will actually caught the

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.040
rules that we created in the previous video with FC M tokens.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.750
So let's copy all of that,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.670
then go to database fools Jason and Paste all of them here now about service worker.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.210
So,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.360
as you can see,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.650
this is actually the service worker code.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.950
Let's call be it.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.980
And inside Public folder,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.860
let's create new file firebase messaging service Worker doggy s.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.260
So it must match this file name.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.820
It is very important because this is the name that will be recognized by fire base as decay

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.820
.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.070
Now let's paste everything that we have here and we can actually do it.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.750
All of these comments like that,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.640
then we don't need the message.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.580
Incredible.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.130
And also,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.230
let's disable es lint for the entire file.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.590
Okay,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.000
good.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.850
Now for these conflict here,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.010
we need to initialize our conflict that we initialize inside our application.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.490
So let's open fire base Dodgy.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.950
Yes.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:44.080
And let's just copy this object and put it here so it will initialize firebase sdk inside

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.170
service worker.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:53.150
And also we must ensure that the version that we import here must match our sdk version

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.680
inside package Jason.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.900
So let's open it.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.460
And here we have 7.15 now let's hope in service worker,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.140
it has 7.15.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.240
That's OK Now let's save it.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.950
And I already run the ab.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.020
Now let's get back to the APP.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.730
Let me refresh it Now,

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.150
As you can see inside the council,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.940
I have no warnings at all,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.810
So lets navigate to our database.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.960
And as you can see now I have FC m tokens here.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.070
If I open it,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.830
I have this pretty along user I d token and that I have my user i d and this is actually it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.980
before we commit our changes because we use a new service worker with firebase cloud

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.010
messaging inside.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.370
We actually don't need service worker by create react app.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.260
So what I proposed to do in the future,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.070
we will need this.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.620
Is local host valuable?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.150
So let's copy it from here and put it inside helpers like this and let's exported from here

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.150
.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.620
Now let's save it And let's delete service,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.550
worker file and inside after GS or inside index togs.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.530
Let's delete these comments.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.260
We don't need them anymore,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.710
and now we can commit our changes.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.490
So again,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.050
let's board get at everything and then get commit.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.490
And let's say at it,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.410
service worker on that said Perfect,

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.700
See you in the next one.
