00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.190
Hey there.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:01.850
In this video,

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.710
we will talk about her bun trees.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.760
Let's navigate back to the court and let's open sign in page here.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.290
What is going to happen if we let's say,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.900
throw an error inside this component?

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.430
Let's poor throw new error.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.090
Something bad happened.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.250
Now let's say what and let's take a look.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.910
If I refresh the paint,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.590
we can see that we have a never and something bad happened.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.740
And the thing is that these enter is on caught.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.260
It means that it is called by react,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.330
but not by us,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.270
and eventually react will amount the whole competent tree,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.410
which is really bad if we have a production ready by application to prevent that we have

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.580
better bun trees that are boundaries are components that catch all of these kind of letters

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.550
and the display at fullback You I,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.500
for example,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.150
a message that these paged crashed.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.540
Please refresh it.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.950
So if we open the documentation,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.690
we confined an official example how to create a simple answer bun tree component.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.780
And for most cases this is enough.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.950
Unless you have a really sophisticated error logging or I don't know anything what I

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.320
proposed to do I want to go to a live demo?

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.960
Then I want you open this example and from here I will copy this.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.430
Enter Bunge re class.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.720
So let me copy all of that.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.100
Then I'm gonna open decode and then inside components,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.930
I will create you file ever Bun gery.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.000
And inside I will put this class based component.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.350
And don't be scary about this component that it is class based.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.330
I will explain everything that takes place here.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.450
So let me import,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.540
react from react.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.500
And also we have a lot of yes length warnings.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.100
Let's disable all of them.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.100
I will just click on quick fix and disabled for the entire file.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.440
The same I will do here.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.400
Now let's save it.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.450
And what is going on here inside the constructor we define in you state,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.670
which is an object with ever and error info than using a competent deed Catch,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.560
lifecycle hook or lifecycle event.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.780
We catch any error that is happening inside this component,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.410
okay?

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.930
Or to its Children.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.500
When we have any error,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.000
we update this state,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.630
then inside the render method.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.710
If we have any error inside our state,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.160
which is played the fullback ey.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.550
And otherwise,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.050
if everything is OK,

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.500
we simply render all over its Children.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.180
Okay,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.210
Pretty simple.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.880
Now,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.950
in order to use this editor,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.070
we need to wrap our entire tree inside this letter.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.650
Bunbury.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.720
So let's open Abdel Gs.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.990
And here I'm gonna for ever bunch we component that we created.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.880
Let me save all of that.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.960
Then I will navigate back to my app.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.550
I'm gonna refresh the amp and now I still have this react warning.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.160
That's because we are in development boat.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.820
However,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.610
if I close it now,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.180
instead of signing page,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.980
I have this something one wrong message with the details inside.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.070
And if I open my other bun tree,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.220
I can see that in case off any error,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.800
this is exactly what I'm rendering and it can be customized bias.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.820
This is how we're able to catch any other inside the Y in every production ready

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.760
application.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.150
This is a must.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.870
The cool thing about our boundaries that we can create multiple components.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.680
For example,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.700
right now we put the global Herman tree.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.400
If any error inside the competent tree will be produced than it will be captured by this

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.150
letter boundary and instead off any component.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.910
It will display this message with something when drunk.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.850
Let's say we have a lot of components and knob or crushed,

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.080
if not bar crashed.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.400
We don't want to remove everything right for these situations.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.790
We can put multiple other boundaries,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.440
for example,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.440
per component or per page.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.470
So for signing page,

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.550
I can pull its own enter bun tree like that.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.590
Then I can create another component with another market forever.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.810
And then I can rub another page around another at her bun tree.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.080
So in this way,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.220
if error will be produced inside the home page,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.280
it will be catched by these other bun DRI and then the U Y.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.550
That is listed inside this letter bun tree will be displayed.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.160
The question is why?

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.560
And went well.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.550
Evers can be produced by anything.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.570
It can be any error inside the code that we didn't control or we just simply avoid it.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.580
Or maybe it can be a network ever,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.470
for example,

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.690
if something need to be access online.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.140
But out of nowhere,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:01.250
Internet went down and the component failed to render in this way it will be caged by enter

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.950
bun tree and it is very important to understand that these kind of errors will not be

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.380
catched by ever.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.250
Bun trees at her bun trees catch others Onley related Teoh rendering.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.510
Now I guess we needed this some sort of better Bunbury inside our chat application.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.910
So I guess this is a good time to commit our changes.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.730
So let's pour away this throne.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:33.570
You airline inside signing and let's put one global ever bun tree for our chat application

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.790
and let's commit our changes.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.290
So I'm gonna pour.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.740
All right,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.950
let me restart the terminal.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.800
I'm gonna put,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.260
get at everything and then get commit and then added Better bun tree.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.540
Perfect.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.220
I hope it was comprehensive and not too complicated.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.470
See you in the next one.
