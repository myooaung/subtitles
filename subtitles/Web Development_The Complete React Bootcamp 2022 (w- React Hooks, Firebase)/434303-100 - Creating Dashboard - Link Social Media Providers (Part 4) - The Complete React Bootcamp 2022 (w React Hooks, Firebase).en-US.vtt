00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
Hey,

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.740
in this video,

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.370
we're going to continue built the airport component and we will associate user account with

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.430
multiple signing providers or multiple Sinan methods.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.880
So,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.620
for example,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.020
if I connect or if I look in with Facebook and then if I look out and look in with Google,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.450
I end up on the same account.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.580
I will not have two different separate accounts.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.300
All right,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.140
so let's do this.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.870
First,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.490
let's navigate back to our code.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.480
And here under dashboard,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.990
let's create your file,

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.550
which we will name Provider Block for now.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.790
Let it be an empty component and let's edit to our dashboard inside Index GS right after

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.540
Hey Profile Name provider Block.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.240
Perfect.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.010
Now to continue,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.700
we need to know how we can actually access our current user data where user object data to

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.150
be more specific.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.850
So instead of using our use profile hook to get the data,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.810
we can actually use off object,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.840
and then we can access current user.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.970
So let's come slug it and see what do you receive?

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.060
So if I now go to that board,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.250
if I look inside Consul now,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.870
I have the user object off currently signed in user,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.780
so it is managed by fire base.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.710
Here we confine different access tokens,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.090
refresh tokens,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.300
display name,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.130
email and other data.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.380
But we are interested right now in provider data that we have over here.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.010
So it is basically an array off providers or array off Simon methods that we are using

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.750
right now.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.190
So,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.770
as you can see,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.170
right now,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.770
we have only one element,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.530
which is google dot com.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.620
So we will use that information to display that we're currently connected were not to this

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.930
specific provider.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.020
And the thing is that if you remember,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.150
we put real time listeners for our profile data.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.000
So whenever we update something,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.910
it updates in all places with the providers.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.710
It doesn't work in real time,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.290
so we need to manage it using react state.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.690
So all right,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.970
let's get back to provider block.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.720
And here we're going to define a new state,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.740
which we will name is connected,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.800
and it is not going to be a bowling value.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.170
It is going to be an object that will indicate whether we are connected to Facebook or

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.730
Google.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.610
So we will have an object with two keys,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.450
google dot com and facebook dot com,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.870
which is Provider i d can be found that inside this array,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.560
so as you can see for Google,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.800
it is google dot com.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.570
All right,

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.250
so for google dot com,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.380
we're going to check if we are connected.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.230
So we're gonna access us current user dot provider data.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.620
So it is an array,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.640
and on the rain,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.480
we can apply some to check if some element is actually justifies the condition.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.450
So we're gonna have here our data,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.300
and we're going to check if some off our where array elements has provider I D or google

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.970
dot com.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:24.000
If data provider I d equals google dot com and the same we will do for Facebook.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.290
So let's copy it.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.700
And let's replace google dot com with facebook dot com.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.340
All right,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.730
good.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.640
In this way,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.370
now we will have available is connected.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.200
That will indicate what we're connected to Google or Facebook.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.320
Now let's actually define our marker.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.250
So inside this def,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.350
we are going to pour our buttons or attacks that will indicate it.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.430
And here we will have a load off conditional rendering.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.110
But for now,

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.470
listen.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.040
Defiance,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.010
aesthetic markup.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.540
So first is going to be tacked element.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.060
So the stack element will be close,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.530
herbal,

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.980
and it will have color green because it is going to be four Google inside,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.240
we will have Aiken.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.260
And this I can will have I can off Google and it will say connected.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.720
All right.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.320
And also now we have this morning.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.380
Let's put it here at the top the same.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.060
We will apply for Facebook.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.320
So let's copy it.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.740
And let's replace color with the blue and I can with Facebook.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.560
All right.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.430
Seems good.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.850
Now let's check it out.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.370
If we go to dashboard now,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.650
we are connected.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.170
So this will be displayed when we are actually connected to our providers.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.000
All right,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.080
then we're gonna define other things which will be our buttons to actually connect to these

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.240
or that provider.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.220
So let's put a little bit off,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.050
merge into this block,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.450
and then we're gonna define our bottoms.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.890
So first button is going to be for Google.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.520
So it is going to be a block element.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.440
It will have color green and inside again.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.200
We will see and I come and I can will be,

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.320
Let's say,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.270
also Google and we will name X linked to Google.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.770
The same will be for Facebook.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.910
Let's copy it.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.350
And let's replace color with the blue Lynn to Facebook.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.490
And I can is going to be Facebook.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.920
All right,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.990
let's check it out.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.470
All right.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.080
Looks good.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.660
So we will have this to bottom buttons to actually connect to provider.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.010
And these two at the tell people have when we are connected.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.860
All right.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.440
So let's first pour our conditional rendering for the case when we are already connected.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.120
So for these tags,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.740
we're gonna put if is connected,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.710
then because it is an object we can access its properties.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.560
So if I am connected to google dot com on Lee,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.320
then I'm gonna render this tag element and the same actually,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.500
we will do for Facebook.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.940
So now we will have a displayed on Lee when we are connected.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.950
All right.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:11.950
Looks good.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.520
And for this buttons,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.970
we'll applied the next.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.080
So if we are not connected to Google that come,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.510
then we gonna display this button and the same will do four facebook.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.050
So if we are not connected to your Facebook,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.830
then we will display this type of button.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.510
All right,

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.750
let's check it out.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.270
If I open my dashboard,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.140
I'm connected to Google and I'm not connected to Facebook.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.720
All right,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.260
so now the thing is actually to do some functionality to apply everything with a state.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.090
All right,

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.320
so first we need to define were handlers.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.760
So we will have in total for handlers,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.580
to handlers to UNL Inc from Google and Facebook,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.310
and two handlers to a link to Facebook and Google.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:08.650
So let's define them first is going to be on a link on link Facebook like this.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.960
Then we will have unlinked Google.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:20.900
Then we will have linked Facebook and LinkedIn Google and link Google like this.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.520
All right,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.030
First,

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.040
let's maybe do unlinked functionality,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.360
so it will be kind of the same,

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.280
and it is very actually easy to do.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.750
So we're gonna create another,

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.060
like,

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.530
a common function that we will call inside on link Facebook and allowing Google that we

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.330
will call,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:37.700
you know,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.760
just on link,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.500
and then we're gonna receive here provider I d provider.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.790
I d like this.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.970
All right,

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:51.610
so we gonna call this unlinked from unlinked Facebook like this,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:58.230
and then we're gonna put facebook dot com and the same we will do for Gogol.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.470
We're gonna put on link google dot com like this.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.190
All right,

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.810
so do you unlinked the actual provider.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.750
We're gonna do the next thing we're gonna put first try,

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.540
catch block,

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.880
and we're gonna ask in the first place if only one sign in method is left for the user.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.520
So it is possible that we unlinked from Google,

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.170
and then we end up with no sign in providers at all in this way,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.770
account will be abandoned and it will not have any sign in method,

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.940
so it means it will be kind of that.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.480
So we want to avoid that.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:42.080
And we're going to check if off dot current user dot provider data dot length is equal to

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.650
one.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.770
And we wanted to and link it.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.260
So we have only one sign in method and we click on unlinked.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.710
We will receive a warning.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.590
We will throw new editor,

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:58.390
and we're gonna say you can not disconnect for,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.970
um provider I d.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.940
That we receive as an argument over here.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.170
And now we will catch this matter that we throw over here,

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.540
and we're gonna put it alert and art editor,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.300
we will say better message for four seconds.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:15.950
All right,

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:22.710
So if everything is cool here And if we have let's say to providers connected and we want

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.730
to disconnect from one of them,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.900
it is safe.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:32.220
So we're gonna call off dot current user dot unlinked this method,

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.770
if I call it,

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:39.350
you can see on links a provider from user account and I need to pass provider I D,

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.870
which is going to be provider I d from our arguments.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.550
So it is a promise what we gonna do,

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.780
we gonna awaited.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.430
And because it is a think awaits index,

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.030
we need to put a sing in front of the function.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.010
So after we awaited,

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.610
we need to update our set is connected.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.860
We need to update our local state.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.490
So what we can do?

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:08.220
We can actually create another function just to update our state so we can call it

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.230
something like this update is connected,

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:18.720
and inside we can pass provider I d and then just value whether it is true or falls.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.500
So here,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.100
report provider i d.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.010
And when we unlinked,

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.050
we want to set it to force.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:30.690
So let's create this update is connected we're gonna receive provider I d.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:31.750
As an argument.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.180
And then we will receive actually,

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.450
the value,

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.760
something like this.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.930
So inside this function we're going to call set is connected here,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.450
we're gonna receive previous value inside the callback.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.290
And here we need to return and you value because it is an object.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.180
We want to make sure that we maintain the structure.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.290
So we're gonna return.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.800
All right,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.970
let's maybe put it more explicitly from this callback week in return And Alba jet here,

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:07.720
we're gonna merge the previous state like this and then to update the actual provider i d.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.630
We need to open this type of brackets.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:15.770
Then we need to quote provider I d as a key and then reveals pacify the value.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:16.370
All right,

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.710
so in this way,

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.570
it will update the object with the specified from either i d and value.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.190
All right.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.580
Good.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.430
It looks just fine.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.830
Let's maybe also,

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.280
and another alert over here with alert,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.720
maybe just info,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.620
and we will say,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:42.650
disconnected from provider disconnected from provider I d like this unless put four seconds

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.380
over here.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.120
All right.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.380
Now,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:49.110
let's actually link this handlers to our buttons,

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.870
so we need to unlinked Facebook.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.020
We need to put it to here to the sack element.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.950
So here we can have this on close event.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.040
So for this unclos event,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.130
chewable specify on link Google,

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.800
actually,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.760
and the same for Facebook.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:12.890
So here we're gonna put on clothes and we're gonna put on link Facebook this time.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:13.590
All right.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.650
Now it has sufficient functionality to test it out.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.450
So let's open dashboard.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.830
Let's click on this close element.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.130
So when we click on it,

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:30.970
you cannot disconnect from google dot com that because we only have Google signing method

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.160
only one of it.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.830
So if we disconnect from it,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:41.410
we will make our account that all right to go now it's actually and our link functionality

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:41.410
.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.500
So again,

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.830
it will be the same almost the same.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.170
So we're going to create a common function as UNL Inc.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.670
So let's put it,

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.570
maybe over here and we will name it.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.880
Let's link.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.490
All right,

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.860
So it is going to receive not a provider i d.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.270
But the provider object the same as we used inside.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.790
Sign in page.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.440
Let's see this new firebase Auth firebase provider.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.340
All right,

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.740
so I copied it.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.530
So let me comment it.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.250
And here we're gonna call this link and then signed.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.170
We need to pass provider object that we will receive as an argument.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.290
So for Facebook,

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:26.050
we gonna call new firebase off Facebook off provider.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:31.750
Let's first import fire base from firebase up.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.730
All right,

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:33.980
look,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.820
the coach and the same will do for Link Google.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.550
So let's copy it.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.250
And here we gonna call Google Auth provider.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:43.860
All right,

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:44.510
Looks good.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:49.300
Now let's associate this handlers in advance with our buttons.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.540
So on click,

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:56.850
we gonna link Google And for this button on click click on a link Facebook.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:57.330
All right.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:57.890
Looks good.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:01.400
So now what will be our strategy?

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.300
So it is actually very,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.690
very simple with fire base again,

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.050
we need to use our auth object.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:15.270
And here we're gonna call our current user and then link with pop up link with pop up.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:20.680
We need to specify just the provider object that we receive as an argument which is going

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.290
to be one of those,

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.080
all right.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.800
So,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.320
again,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.580
it is a promise we need to awaited.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.840
And after it is successfully is updated,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.160
what's converted to you racing function after it is successfully updated,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.750
we will notify users with alert in four.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.220
Let's say connected or maybe linked two.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.000
Provider.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.990
Let's use Rincon preparation.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.660
And because it is at provider object.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:54.270
This time this provider object has provider I d as its key.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.770
And again we will specify four seconds in case of any other.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:05.430
We're gonna put alert at her message and we will put our message here like this.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.380
And at the end of the day,

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.290
we need to also update our local state.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:14.710
So we're gonna call the same as before update is connected.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:19.280
And this time we will pull provider dot provider I D.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.450
And then we're gonna put true because we link our account.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.950
All right now it seems fine.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.470
Let's check it out.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.500
It seems like we have all functionality.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.960
Let me double check.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.300
Okay,

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:32.980
look good.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.090
Now let's go to dashboard.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.980
If I click on link to Facebook,

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.360
let's see what is going to happen now.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:45.450
I will be asked to look into my Facebook bust because I already signed in.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.950
Now I have linked to Facebook.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.500
If I go to authentication and if I had a fresh,

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:57.230
I can see that I have to sign in providers associated with this user.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.570
So it actually worked.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.050
Now,

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:04.060
if I Let's a click on Disconnect from Facebook Now,

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.420
I have disconnected from facebook dot com.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.930
If I click on Google,

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:11.630
you cannot disconnect from Google because it is the only one left.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.130
And if I refresh again,

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.170
you can see Facebook disappear.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.060
So actually,

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.050
everything work.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:17.950
All right,

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.920
so it was a lot,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.700
actually,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.950
I guess that's the good time to finish this video.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:28.210
So we're gonna add everything to the stage state,

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:38.470
and then we're gonna get commit linked Facebook and Google to one account created provider

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.570
Block Who?

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.300
All right,

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.740
see you in the next one.
