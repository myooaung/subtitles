00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
Hey,

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.000
welcome In this video we will create the show page for our website.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.770
So when we navigated you the show page by click and read more But we'll get the actual data

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:19.850
instead of saying not found Let's go So the first thing we will dio inside Abdel Gs we will

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:28.040
define in your route It is going to be the exact route and the path will be the next.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.070
So it is going to be show slash something What is this?

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.000
Something is going to be If we look closely,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.450
we will have dynamic Europe but will have show I d changed based on the show.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.050
So we will have a dynamic para meter inside our Europe.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.170
And to specify this dynamic para meter inside react router We need to put a column and the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.020
name that we want to choose for this part Mature.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.170
So let it be just I d.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.940
Now that pretty find their out Let's create a component for our page under pages,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.750
we will create new file showed the G s.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.040
And as for now,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.540
it is going to be just This is show page now inside this route Let's port nearly created

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.720
component on Let's take a look.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.310
What do we have now?

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.920
When we navigate through the page,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.350
we will see this is show page instead of not found.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.150
And if I change the i d.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.840
It will be there but will still have the text.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.620
So it works now.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.350
What will be our strategy to display the results when we now engaged to this page but will

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.630
grab the show i d from your l Then move will use this show i d Teoh fudged data from the A

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.700
p I and then we will displayed on the page.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.180
So the question is,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.510
how can we access that show idea from mural inside our component?

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:08.080
We will use custom hooks for that and custom hoax are hoax that are built on top off

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.450
standard react hooks and that come from react package such as used state and react Router

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.850
Dom comes with a set off custom hooks for us It don't worry.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.390
In upcoming videos we will create our own custom hooks.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.580
Let's go.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:35.000
So I will import something from react rooter job and it is going to be used and from

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
intelligence we can see that there are four different hooks available for us.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.870
But for now,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.860
we're only interested in use Haram's.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.290
So I'm gonna define a new valuable Let's say Haram's.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.260
Then I'm gonna put use programs and then I will Consul log to see What do I received.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.770
So if I inspect the page looking to the council,

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.160
I will see an object.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.570
And here it is going to be I d said to one.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.310
So the key is going to match perimeter name that we specified over here.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.850
So if I change it,

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.070
it will be a deflected over here and then the value for this parameter from the Europe.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.570
So if we put something random but will still get the value So this is it.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.240
This is how we are going to work now.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.680
How can we fetch data from the A.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.330
P I on only one component mounts on Lee when we navigate to the page.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.790
Well,

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:42.380
the first thing we will do capable d structure this Ural and then little get used off use

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.800
effect hook that comes from react package this time,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.400
so use effect and we've never used it before.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.200
And let's actually take a look at this hokum by examples,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.170
but not inside Shoji s inside homes Orgs.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.490
So here I will also import Use a fact and I will use it inside this component.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:13.230
So what it basically does use the fact allows us to hook into different components.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:20.110
Life cycle events such as component did mound component will amount or component did update

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.110
.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.330
So this use effect Hook expects two arguments.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.970
It expects the callback function and it expects array of dependencies.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.700
So the way it works it will rerun this callback function whenever something inside this

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.000
array of dependency changes.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.880
What I mean is that let's try and put console dot lock use effect Run over here and let's

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.360
take a look.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.870
What is going to happen now Let's navigate toothy home page.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.510
And here we will find our consular use effect Run.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.580
But when I will update the state,

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.430
if I update the input component will be rendered.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.270
Let's take a look.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.850
What is going to happen if I type something?

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:15.090
Nothing will be consul locked because we specified zero dependencies inside our array off

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.930
dependencies.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.500
So the way it works this callback function will be run on Lee.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.350
When something inside this airway changes So if our array is empty,

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.890
then these callback function on Lee will be run once when the component mount.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.310
So this is how can we access Lifecycle event component did mount.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.390
Now let's try and change this array of dependencies and let's put input over here.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.340
So if I put input,

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.990
save it,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.950
let's get back and let's try and change in court.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.170
As you can see,

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.150
whenever input changes,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.990
we can see consul locks.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.890
So every time these callback function being rerun now instead of input,

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.450
let's try and put search option,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.060
so I will save it.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.500
Let's get back the first use of fact run If I changed input right now,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.350
I will see no Consul Oaks but only when they change the search option.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.340
Only then use effect will be run.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.290
So this is how it works.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:27.360
Only when something inside this away changes these callback function will be run.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.440
Now this you defect,

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.040
hook comes with a cleanup function on top of it.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.560
What is cleanup function?

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.680
It is dysfunction that we return from the call back.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.750
So I'm gonna put a return,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.650
another function,

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:51.700
and let's put consul dot lock exit over here and it will run this return function will be

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.300
run right before the next call back will be fired.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.370
So let's check it out.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.660
We don't have any exit over here,

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.940
but when I change the state,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.250
when When I changed the search option,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.180
we will see exit and only then we will see Use effect.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.560
Run.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.860
So these runs right before the next call back will be fired.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.080
And by using this approach,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.450
we can access component will amount lifecycle event.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.370
So let me remove search option from here.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.180
So this will run only once.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.940
And if I save it now,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.870
if I change the state,

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.840
nothing happens.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:41.680
But when I navigate to another page when the component will be amounted when our home page

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.870
will be amounted,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:50.190
we will see exit because these return function will be fired right before the component

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.860
amounts.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.340
So this way we can access component will amount event.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:55.960
All right,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.130
so this is what it actually use Affect us.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:04.030
And this is how we are going to get our data from the A P I.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.400
All right now let's remove it from home page.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.850
Let's navigate back to the show page And here What we will do,

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.550
we will type use effect.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:20.950
Then we are going to specify the call back and then array of dependencies.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.100
So what we will do,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.520
we will put a P I get the same as before and for query String,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.030
what should report here?

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.650
So let's get back to our A p I.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.400
And let's take a look.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.650
How can we retrieve show main information?

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:38.540
So,

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.510
as you can see,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.890
we can use show I d to get the data.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.980
So this is what we're going to do.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.890
And if you look at second example,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.400
we can combat data to our request.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.050
And if we scroll down to the embedding part,

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.850
we can open the latest example.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.060
And from here we embed episodes and cast.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.670
And if we scroll down to the embedded object,

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.130
we now can have episodes and cast.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.720
But instead of episodes,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.870
we will use seasons for our page.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.130
So let's replace it with seasons.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.000
And now our query string is ready.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.500
Let's copy it from here.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:19.820
Well,

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.420
let's get back to our code,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.370
and here we will put it,

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.160
and instead,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.520
off this i d.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.370
We will put our own dynamic.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.110
I d that we get from perimeters,

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.680
So I will switch quote and I will pour idea over here.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.590
But when I put this I d.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:42.860
I will have this warning inside this array of dependencies saying that react hook has a

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.190
missing dependency.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:52.290
And whenever we use something inside this cold back that is a part off react component or

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.810
lets a parent components,

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.470
then we will have this warning.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.050
But it is fine to put idee over here too.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:05.640
Get rid of this warning because this i d is something that will not be changed.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.770
It is going to be static,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.220
so it is safe to put it inside this array of dependencies.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:12.930
All right,

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:20.310
now that we have our data from 80 I get as a promise we need to await this promise.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:26.650
Then we will get our results and we need to put them inside this state in order to access

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.890
it inside markup.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.610
So we will create a new state with use state hook.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.140
So we will import used state first.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:40.210
And here we will pour Let's a show and set show.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.270
Then default value will be set,

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:43.940
you know,

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.480
And when we get our results,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.000
we will call such show and put results inside.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.910
Now let's try and console log show state to see if it actually worked.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:02.100
Now let's navigate to any showed that we can find Read more as you can see,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.470
initial status now.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:08.160
But then we get state populated with data from the A P I.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
So it actually worked.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.880
All right,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.100
So this is it for this video.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.380
In the next video,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.000
we will display spinners.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.030
And if there is any error message when our data is being loaded so you can see this time

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:30.400
span before our state is now and when our state is populated with the data.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.960
So while data is being loaded from the A P I,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.530
we wanted to display a spinner or a loading message to our user.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.290
So this is the topic for our next video.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.010
All right,

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:42.540
now,

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.950
let's commit our changes,

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:52.030
and we will name our commit A something like edited show page,

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.750
and yeah,
