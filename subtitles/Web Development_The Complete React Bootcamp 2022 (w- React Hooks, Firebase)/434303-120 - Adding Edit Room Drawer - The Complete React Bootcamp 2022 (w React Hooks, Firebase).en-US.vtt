00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250
Hello.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.950
In this video,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:08.700
we will add Drover to chat to up where we will be able to add it room information such as

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.880
room,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.390
name and description.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.330
Let's go.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.160
Let's not get back to code and let's find our top folder.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.680
And here inside index togs was Just open it next to that file.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:29.400
Let's create anyone that we will name Edit Room BTM Drover Inside we will put the next

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.870
market.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.350
So first of all,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.030
we will use button element and inside we're gonna put just a letter that stands for admin.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:47.630
Then class name is going to be border radios circle than size is going to be small color

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.710
red and on click.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.140
We're gonna put open handler that people grab from use model State Hook that we used a lot

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.760
of times.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.510
As for now,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750
So let's grub is open,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.660
open and close.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.680
Now we need to create the moral window.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.100
So let's greet from Drover.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.150
Let's imported from RC or so inside this rover,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.270
we're gonna pour show property which is going to be is open than on.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.930
Hyde is going to be clothes and placement is going to be right and the same as for models.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.270
Drover has Drover Header body and for so let's create those components.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.940
Inside footer we will pour another button that will be just to close the Drover so it will

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.780
be a block elements and on click we're going to close our Drover inside Heather,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.080
we're going to pour,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.760
drove or title and for Drover title,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.750
we will pour the Edit Room All right now,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.400
actually,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.450
for Drover Body before we define it.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.180
Let's actually use this component inside top components.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.830
So let's open index cogs inside top folder and here inside.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.980
But in toolbar Let's use at it room VT and Drover,

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.570
that's it.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.670
Now inside our body were going to define to import elements one for room name and 14 room

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.480
description And we're going to use our edita ble input that we use earlier.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.490
So let's open this component and then let's important.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.070
So for Ed Izabal input,

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.550
we need to pass the initial value.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.860
So we're gonna grab that one from our current room context.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.560
So here at the top Blacks board,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.050
name equals use current room and we gonna select value dot name and the same we will do for

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.050
description.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.480
So let's grab it.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.240
And also,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.670
let's wrap this component around,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.260
mammal.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.530
So let me put memo over here and let me import it like this.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.110
All right?

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.010
Now we need to actually set our components.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.790
So for edit Herbal import for the first input,

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.050
which is going to be about name,

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.880
we're gonna pass initial value name than we must provide on safe function and let it be on

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.850
name safe.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.420
As for now,

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.040
then we're gonna put label and label is going to be Ahh,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.290
six element with class.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.290
Name off margin,

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.280
bottom two.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.030
Then it is going to be name.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.810
And also empty message is going to be named Can be empty.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.060
All right.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.550
Our second in poor is going to be a text area in port.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.100
So let's pacify competent class.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.730
It is going to be text area rose by default will be five.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.240
Then we're gonna pour also initial value as description than we're gonna put unsafe,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:59.350
which is going to be on description safe and also empty message is going to be description

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.640
cannot be empty.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.420
All right,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.660
now,

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.610
let's save it and let's define those functions.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.080
So first of all,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.830
we're gonna create on name safe,

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.970
and then we will create own description safe.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.330
And because our functionality is very similar,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.440
we're gonna create a one common function that will be called inside each off these

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.140
functions.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.800
So it is going to be,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.430
let's say,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.450
update data of day data,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.710
and it will receive key.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.990
Or let's say field what we need to update and also the value actual value that will be sad

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.250
to this key.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.760
All right,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.180
now,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.760
inside own name Save.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.790
We're gonna call update data with the name as a key and also new name,

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:54.150
which is going to be passed as an argument to this function because we passed this handler

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.390
to creditable input.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.570
And as you remember,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.950
if we open it,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.250
it gives us the final value.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.910
All right,

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.310
so the same we will do for on description safe here,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.120
we're gonna put description and new.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.990
Let's say desk is going to be new desk.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.490
So inside of the data,

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.470
we're gonna call database object.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.050
Then we're going to specify reference to rooms slash room I D or chat i d.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.520
So we will grab that one from use Haram's.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.320
So let's grab share i d from use programs.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.790
Let's poor import to the top.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.870
And then for this reference,

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.530
we're going to specify Child is going to be key set is going to be value.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.690
After that.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.490
When we are done with writing data to the database,

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.170
we're gonna call alert,

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:53.770
and we're going to specify success successfully updated and let's put it for four seconds.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.050
And in case if we have any error,

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.800
we're gonna also said alert,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.200
but this time better.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.460
And we're gonna put our message like that.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.150
All right,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.100
looks good.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.450
Let's delete this empty space.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.330
Let's save and let's take a look.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.630
Now we have this A button at the top on the right.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.930
Let's click on it.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.890
We have Drover,

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.580
and the first problem.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.790
I can see that we don't have any margin here,

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.390
So if we inspected,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.700
we can see that if we open import group and we have to,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.110
Dave's over here and they basically don't have any margin.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.990
So let's open our creditable import.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.650
So we need to pour some space for this def,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.260
or it can be an option.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.730
So what I proposed to do,

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.210
we can pass another argument to creditable input,

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.780
which is going to be robber class name and by default it will be empty.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:54.730
So then we're gonna pass this rapper class name to that thief class name and what we will

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.250
do It will say with damnable navigate,

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.030
you are were creditable input.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:06.960
And for text area began a specify rapper close name is going to be margin top three to add

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.220
some space on top of that,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.550
let's take a look.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.990
Now I can see that it looks good.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.430
Now let's actually edit some data.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.710
May be new Rome name.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.180
And if I say where I can see successful,

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.050
updated and room name has been updated.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.750
Indeed.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.090
Okay,

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.420
cold.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.230
But there is one problem us.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.710
Remember,

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.500
with robbers,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.350
they are not exactly responsive.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.970
So what we need to do?

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:38.390
We need to pass the full property to this robur when we are on mobile devices.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.270
So we're gonna use use Media Query hook here at the top.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.660
We gonna specify his mobile is going to be used.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.590
Media Query.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.250
And here we're going to specify marks with off 99 2 pixels.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.300
Then we're gonna pass.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:58.120
This is more bile to full property and it will be activated only when we are on mobile

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.830
devices.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.880
So now if we open it and we precise the window,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.470
it still looks good.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:03.830
Okay,

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.230
so this is it,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.800
I guess.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.050
Now let's commit our changes.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.470
Let people everything to the stage.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.610
State is always and then get committed.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.160
Added edit room.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.700
Drover.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.790
All right.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.670
In the next video,

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.040
we will add more security to our room because,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.890
as you can see,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:22.460
for now,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.830
we are able to add it.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.400
This room,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.050
even though we are not admits because we don't have any user permissions.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.140
So this is our topic for the next video.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.010
See you there.
