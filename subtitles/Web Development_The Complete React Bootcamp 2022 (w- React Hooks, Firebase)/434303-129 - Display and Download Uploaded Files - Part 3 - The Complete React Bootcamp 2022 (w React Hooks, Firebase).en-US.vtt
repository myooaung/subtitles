00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
Hey there,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.680
in this video,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.040
we're going to display all off our uploaded files.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.950
Let's go,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.180
Let's navigate back to the code and let's open message Bytom component the place where our

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.360
elements are rendered.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.450
And here at the bottom instead of this pan with just text inside,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.070
we're gonna put conditional rendering.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.780
But first,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.930
let's grab not only text for message,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.690
but also,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.540
let's say file Now,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.210
inside this different,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.870
we are able to do conditional rendering.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.810
So if we have text inside our message on Lee,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.520
then we will display tax message.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.640
For if we have file inside our message,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.130
then we're gonna create a custom function to render files.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.220
So let's name it,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.690
render file message and inside,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.000
we're gonna pass our file,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.240
then here at the top out of this component,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.850
we're gonna define this function,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.140
render filed message so it will receive file,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.390
and this function,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.590
by default will return us just a link.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.290
And inside this link,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.860
we will pour download file dot name.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.410
If our file is not an image and for a treff,

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.850
we're going to pour file door europe.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.140
Okay,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.470
Good.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.980
Now,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.280
if our file is an image,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.920
we store content type inside database so we can check against this property.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.600
So if file content type includes image,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.750
then we're going to return dif element Inside this def,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.880
we will pour an image as a button.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.010
So when we click on it,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.990
we open Moto window.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.870
And also we will have this bottom view original to get us to the other tap and view the

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.670
full size.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.340
So for this day,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.440
if we're gonna specify class name off height to any 20 and then inside,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.200
we're gonna create image Bt in Moto And for this in major between model,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.900
we're gonna pass sores,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.260
which is going to be filed.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.010
Your l and also file name is going to be filed.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.830
Duck name.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.080
Now we actually need to create this image,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.880
beauty and Moto.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.210
So inside messages.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.290
Let's create new file image VT in Moto Don't Yes.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.640
And as always,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.530
we're gonna pour a model.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.220
But we're gonna wrap it around react fragment than inside.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.510
Instead of button,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.510
we will put in port off type image.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.350
It makes this import act as a button even though it is an image.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.140
So for alternative,

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.470
begin a specify this file and for properties,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.640
we're gonna specify source and file name.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.280
So let's poor source and file name.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.650
And as I can see,

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.780
I got the wrong file name.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.970
So let me replace it with Image Bt in mortal.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.140
And let me rename it with image Bt and Moto.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.630
Okay,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.540
so import off type image for source.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.880
We're gonna specify source for on click.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:18.550
We're gonna specify open debt will grab from use model state use mortal state so is open,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.930
open and close.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.390
And also we're gonna specify if you class names over here,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.610
which is Max with off 100 max,

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.050
hide off 100.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.400
And with is going to be alpha.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.830
Okay,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.620
good is so for input.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.150
This is it.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.290
Now let's actually define motile.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.930
So let's poor mortal component than Mortal Door Heather,

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.360
body and footer,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.890
body and footer.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.500
So inside Heather,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.180
we're gonna display mortal title model door title and we're gonna pour file name inside and

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.500
let's also deal it deaths.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.680
And this now inside food er we're going to specify just a link to an external tap.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.040
So we're gonna put a and a treff is going to be source and we're going to specify tar,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.730
get blank for the new tab.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.470
And also we need to specify relationship.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.740
No opener,

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.690
No rap Ferrer.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.300
Yes,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.900
like this,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.520
I guess.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.160
And this component is not self closing.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.480
We're gonna put view original inside and inside view Model body were going to display the

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.750
actual image.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.940
So let's put an image tag Dan,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.850
for sores.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.100
We're going to specify sores.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.760
And for height,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.390
let's say,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.690
104 with,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.020
Let's say,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.990
also 100 out is going to be lets it file.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.580
Okay,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:55.990
now let's use This is open for show property on height is going to be close and it looks OK

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.970
now let's move this import to the top and inside message item.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.030
Let's import this component.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.680
All right,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.070
now let's take a look.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.850
If I refresh the app,

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.660
I can see don't load file,

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.050
name,

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.530
download,

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.720
file name and I can see images.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.120
So let's quickly fix said Instead of these brackets,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.590
let's both curly brackets.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.040
And now let's take a look so that we have doing load this file.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.140
Don't know this file.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.180
If we click on it,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.050
we will actually start to download,

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.550
and I always see that we have images and when we click on it.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.160
We have this view original,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.490
and when we click on it,

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.950
we get to the new tap.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:31.640
Okay,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.840
it looks pretty good.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.470
However,

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.000
in lust messages,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.540
we have empty space,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.790
so let's quickly fix it.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:44.040
Let's navigate to you room item and here inside last message text.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.210
Let's put the next.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.560
So if we don't have last message text,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.290
then we're going to specify last message dot file dot name and that's it.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.620
Now let's take a look.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.200
We have file name,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.530
Okay,

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.480
Pretty cool.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.340
And this is basically it.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.680
Now let's finish this video and commit our changes.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.900
Let's forget at everything.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.220
Get commit and let's say display uploaded files for fact.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.440
See you in the next one.
