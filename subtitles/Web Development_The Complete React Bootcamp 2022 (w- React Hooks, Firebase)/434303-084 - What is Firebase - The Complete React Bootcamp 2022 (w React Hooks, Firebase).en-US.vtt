00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170
Hey,

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.500
welcome to the new section here.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.240
We're gonna talk about back in solution for our final project.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.840
Whenever we built a single page app in order to communicate with the database,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.250
we would normally create our own AP I server or use an existing one.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.190
Modern,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.620
small or middle sized applications do not necessarily right back and from bare bones on

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.520
their own most of the time they do,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.480
but it depends on type of the application.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.720
Wouldn't it be nice if we had some sort off an obstruction layer around back?

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.230
And so we don't need to set it up ourselves and focus more on the application?

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.850
Well,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.450
firebase can help us to achieve that.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.050
It is beckoned as service solution that gives us the abstraction layer around back and and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.430
it does.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.960
Even more Firebase is Emma Bile and Web Platform,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.970
which is built on top of Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.750
It means that it can be used along with any Google cloud service.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.110
From now on,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.810
we don't need to worry about creating our own AP I database maintenance file hosting

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.920
everything is already there and waiting for us.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.720
So in our code,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.850
instead of sending a request to an A P I to retrieve data.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.830
We would just use a library that has functions already pretty fine for us.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.440
Like get this document by I t.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.770
And this function will interact with the database.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.440
It has really time sing support and faster queries.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.230
And it is also well documented,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.080
which is really important to understand.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.640
Bachir.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.330
What Fire base is in the next video but will go through fire base services and we will try

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.720
and evaluate them.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.570
See you there.
