00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
Hey there.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.570
In this video,

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.080
we will continue working on Chatham List.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.090
Last time we defined Mark up.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.700
This time we're going to create and manage the state.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.470
Let's go before we get into code.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.830
I want to define how we're going to access this state.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.590
So chat rooms.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.280
It is something debt we will access globally inside home page.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.950
So we're going to use context a p I to be able to access it from inside sidebar component,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.680
but also from inside chat window that we haven't created yet.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.400
Let's navigate to Contacts Folder and here let's create you file rooms context.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.150
The G s.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.630
Here we will create new context undateable dame rooms context with create context function

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.990
that comes from react.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.490
Then we need to define a component,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.010
a provider that will provide all its Children with the context.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.140
So let's export const rooms provider as an argument.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.400
It will receive Children and it is going to return rooms context dot provider,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.570
and we will put Children inside as a value.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.400
For now,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.860
let's just put a string.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.920
And if we have her on this component,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.560
it says,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.150
react must be in scope.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.070
So let's import react from react.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.460
All right.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.760
Good.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.450
Now let's define the state.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.440
So it is going to be simple.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.340
That's why we can use use state.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.300
So let's define rooms and sat rooms by default.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.510
It will be set to mount,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.330
and we will get our data inside use effect when component mounts.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.290
So let's for use effect and inside first,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.210
we will store our reference to the data ways.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.430
So if we open database,

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.070
we remember that we store our data under rooms,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.400
slash room I d.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.750
And then goes data.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.420
So what we will do,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.470
we will put a real time listener on rooms so we can get real time updates.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.760
Let's create you valuable that we will name room list rough and it is going to be database

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.180
dot ref rooms.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.200
So now we have the reference.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.130
Then we're gonna put a real time listener using dot on method.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.500
So let's call room list.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.690
Ralf thought on value and then for the callback.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.940
As for now,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.660
it receives snap shirt.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.400
As for now,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.520
we're gonna Consul look,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.880
snapshot dot value right.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.990
And because it is a real time listener,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.960
we need to unsubscribe from it because this is a subscription.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.470
So we will do this inside the cleanup function.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.850
Off use effect here.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.530
We're gonna put room list rough dot Off it will detach all real time listeners from this

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.110
reference inside database.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.930
All right,

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.860
let's save it.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.230
And let's actually use this context.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.390
Let's navigate to home page.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.620
And here we will wrap everything around rooms provider.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.650
Okay,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.050
let's say with and let's take a look.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.400
If I go to console,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.530
I can see I have snapshot value,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.710
which is an object where every key is room idea and then goes data.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.800
So we have this foreman because we have Jason based database.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.340
But this is not exactly the four months that we wanted to work with.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.800
We need an airway.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.740
So let's create a helper function that will transform this type of object to an array.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.610
So we're gonna define a new function inside helpers togs that we will name.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.540
Let's a transform two array with I d.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.080
It will receive snapshot value as an argument and it will return.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.330
The next thing first is going to check if snapshot value exists.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.080
If our data is not now,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.450
if we have any data.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.680
So if this is the case,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.110
then we're gonna put the logic.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.050
Otherwise we will return and empty.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.330
Right.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.240
So what will be our strategy?

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.150
We're gonna call object the kiss method to pour all room ideas into an array.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.310
And then we will map every value,

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.120
every room I d to this data.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.950
Let's go.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.210
So let's put object dot keys off snapshot value to get all kids as an array.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.990
Then we're gonna map every value off this area where every element is room I d to an object

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.930
that will be all data from our room.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.050
We can access it with snapshot value off room I D.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.570
And then we're gonna attach i d another property,

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.150
which is going to be room I d.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.890
All right,

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.520
let's navigate two rooms context and here instead,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.560
off using snapshot dot value,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.280
let's actually transform it less great new valuable data here.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.690
We're gonna put transform to array with i d.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.550
And we will pass snapshot dot value insight.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.380
All right.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.280
And let's consular CTA's later to see what we actually receive.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.710
Now,

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.650
As I can see,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.210
I have an array off rooms and I have data and also I have I d as a property.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.800
All right,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.720
so this is what I want it.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.300
Now,

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.010
let's actually update the state.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.210
Let's call set rooms and put data inside.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.580
And then let's pass this state to context as our value of which is rooms.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.100
All right,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.100
this is it for now.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.540
I guess in the next video,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.040
we will finish this up and we will display our rooms from the database.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.750
But for now,

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.890
let's finish this video by committing our changes.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.140
Get commits dash M and for message report created rooms context.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.100
Okay,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.340
See you in the next one.
