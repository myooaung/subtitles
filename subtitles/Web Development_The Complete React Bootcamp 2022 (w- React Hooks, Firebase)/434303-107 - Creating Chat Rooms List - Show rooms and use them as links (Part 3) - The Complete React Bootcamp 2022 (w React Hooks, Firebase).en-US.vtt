00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
Hey there.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.750
In this video,

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.590
we will display chat rooms that we store inside the database,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.980
using the markup and context that we created in the previous videos.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.830
Let's go,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.410
Let's open our code.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.170
And here let's open chat room list component.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.510
Here people consume our context.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.240
And again as before,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.550
instead of using cues context and then specifying the context by importing the file,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.660
we're going to create a helper hook inside rooms,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.290
contacts.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.710
Let's export.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.360
Const.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.210
Will name it.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.150
Use rooms,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.420
and it is going to be a function that returns us the contacts value.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.170
So let's put to use context and pacify rooms context.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.910
In this way,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.760
we will avoid calling cues context with rooms,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.870
context every time but use rooms.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.570
All right,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.050
so inside shattering list components.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.800
Let's call this use rooms hook and now we get the context value.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.850
Now the thing is that this rooms might be null by the time when we try to access it,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.750
because our initial state is dull and only when component mounts we get the actual data.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.800
So we need to put conditional run,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.990
drink and check against it here inside.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.430
Enough.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580
Let's put if we have no rooms.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.620
Then we're gonna display Lauder component that comes from our suit.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.160
It will be centered,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.440
and it will be centered.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.270
Vertical E.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.830
Also,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.290
it will have content,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.420
which will say loading and it will have low speed.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.310
All right.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.790
And also,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.680
let's specify size to medium size.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.140
All right,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.560
quote.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.070
Now,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.130
let's display second conditional rendering to actually show data we're gonna map every

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.050
array element,

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.220
which is rooms that we transform with transform to arrive with I d to a j six element.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.900
So let's ask if we have rooms and rooms dot land is greater than zero Onley.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.200
Then we're gonna call room,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.310
start map inside we will have little my Tim and we got a map.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.640
This room I tempt to love item component like that.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.730
And don't forget,

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.100
when we used this dot map,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.060
we need to specify the key prop.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.980
So let's put room dark.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.630
I d.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.310
And then we're gonna pass the whole room object as a room,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.220
property to room item like this.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.240
All right.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.030
Looks good.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.190
Now let's open room item the next here,

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.640
we gonna destruct chur or own property,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.620
and inside the component,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.210
we're going to get our balance again by de structuring the room object this time.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.720
So we will have created at and also we will have room name.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.020
So instead of this static taxed,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.970
we're gonna display room name that we D structure and also four time ago component.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.610
If we don't have any messages,

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.050
we're gonna display time when this room has been created.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.750
So let's just pass New date created at all right,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.750
Let's save and let's take a look.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.550
Perfect.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.900
Now we can see that room has been created one day ago and room name is Hello,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.140
Maybe let's try and create one more room.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.820
So let's click on our Moto.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.750
Let's pass if I knew Roll name and whatever report for description.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.960
If you click on this,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.190
we can see that the data is being updated in real time,

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.150
so everything works perfectly.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.790
However,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.730
I want to also turn this component into a link.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.070
So when we click on it,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.910
we actually go to chat page.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.520
All right,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.120
so lets navigate back to code and let's go to chat room list here for this snuff item.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.480
First.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.420
Think I want to do,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.910
I want to specify component class so it will render this enough item using this provided

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.730
element for a competent class.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.750
It is going to be linked component that comes from reactor router dumb for this link

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.470
component,

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.640
we're gonna pacify its property,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.840
which is too.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.140
So let's put two.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:07.430
And let's use string interpolation to specify what path there will be if we click on it.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.580
So it is going to be chats slash room I d.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.840
So let's open string contar population and let's put room idea.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.520
All right,

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.010
cool.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.130
Let's check it out.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.460
Now.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.700
If I click on it,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.420
you can see that the Ural changes and we actually have the functionality.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:31.660
But I also want to make this item active whenever we have the correct path corresponding to

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.250
the link.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.480
So what we need to do as before with box office,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.750
we need to get our current location.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.910
So let's use use location hook that comes from react Router down package.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.630
Now for this snuff,

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.100
we're going to pass one more property,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.910
which is going to be active key,

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.760
so active key is going to be location,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.900
not path name.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.830
Then we need to pacify or,

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.520
let's say,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.640
associate every love item with its current.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.850
Let's a key.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.860
So for this,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.690
we need to pass one more property,

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.780
which is going to be event key.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.940
And it must correspond to the active key,

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.810
which is location dot path name.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.130
So it will be slash chats,

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.550
slash room I d.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.930
So for event key,

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.130
we're gonna specify exactly the same as for to property.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.020
And now it will work.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.110
Let's check it out.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.000
And right now,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.870
when our location matches,

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.230
we have the cool animation and we have the active key.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.890
So it works perfectly.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.570
But I want to modify one.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.100
Think instead of chats,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.070
I want to use just chat like this.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.810
All right,

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.650
let's check it out one more time.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.050
If I switch to chat page,

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.090
I have this element active.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.470
All right.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.690
Good.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.020
So this is it.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.630
Let's finish our video.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.900
Let's put everything to the stage state,

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.290
and then let's call,

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.870
get commit with the displayed chat rooms.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.990
All right,

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.420
cool.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.180
This is it for this video.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.770
Next time we're going to build our right part off the website and we're going to start

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.920
building chat window.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.750
See you there
