00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940
Hey there.

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.600
In this video,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.030
we will display chat messages here in the middle inside chat page.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.880
Let's go,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.220
Let's navigate back to code and let's find our folder chat window messages.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.260
And here we have index togs already less great,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.480
and you file that will name message item.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.700
For now,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.870
it will be empty.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.490
So let's put hello inside.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.130
And let's leave it like that inside messages here in the first place,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.660
we will define our state that we will manage with the use state.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.280
So we will name it messages and sat messages.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.600
And by default,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.200
it will be such to know.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.550
Then we also need to grab our chat I d that we currently opened.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.750
So for that we will use use Paramus Hook that comes from react rotor and we're going to get

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.080
child,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.320
I d now inside use effect.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.030
We're gonna make a call to our database.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.490
First,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.970
we're gonna grab our reference to chat path inside database,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.980
which is messages.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.580
So let's poor messages rough.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.300
Then we're gonna call database,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.530
but not the one that comes from Firebase package one that comes from fire based RGs.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.420
So let's import that one.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.900
Then we're going to specify reference slash messages.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.710
Now we will put a real time listener on hold messages that are related to opened chattering

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.710
.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.360
So we're gonna see pacify messages,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.900
Ralf,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.750
Door order by child.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.790
And here we're going to pacify room I D.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.180
And this is a property that we have on every message,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.950
which is room I.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.310
D.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.520
So this from idea will be equal to chat i d that we receive from Paramus.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.900
Now,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.830
it appeared as a dependency,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.900
So let's edit.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.240
And right after that,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.440
let's put a real time listener So we're gonna put on value and honorables pacify callback

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.700
that will receive snapshot.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.360
Now,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.260
as you remember,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.950
this snapshot will be an object where every key is message I d.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.870
And then we get the actual data.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.530
So we need to to transform it.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.010
And we already did it with the transform to array with I d function.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.350
So we will call it one more time.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.850
So let's poor data and then we're gonna put transform to array with i d.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.250
Then we're gonna call snapshot dot value and pass it to this function.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.540
And then we will update the state with data like that and because it is a real time

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.100
listener.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.700
It is a subscription we need to unsubscribe.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.560
So let's use Ah,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.750
we're cleanup function for use effect.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.890
And here we're gonna pour messages,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.450
raft and dog off,

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.320
and we can specify value.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.800
So this way we gonna unsubscribe from all real time listeners on these path.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.330
All right,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.060
now,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.690
our next step is to actually display data.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.240
And first,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.280
we need to get actually a few bullying values that will help us to conditionally render our

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.950
messages.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.900
So our first is going to be is shot empty and charred.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.050
Empty is going to be only when we have messages defined and then messages dot length equals

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.260
20 So we loaded all messages,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.870
but there are no messages at all.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.390
Right,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.200
then we can also have can show messages which will indicate whether we can render our

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.080
message item that we created.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.080
So if we have messages and messages dot length is greater than zero.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.230
So we could actually put this condition directly here inside our markup,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.990
But just to be more neat,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.370
you know,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.630
we put them here.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.370
So inside this def,

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.840
we're gonna put the next logic.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.510
First of all,

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.190
it is not going to be a diff.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.960
It is going to be a u L.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.520
Then class name is going to be message list and also customs grow that inside we're gonna

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.660
pour is charred empty.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.390
Then we're gonna display an ally element because we have you,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.850
l and we're gonna say no messages yet.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.170
And then if we can show messages,

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.490
then we're gonna pour messages,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.380
Doc map and we will map every message to message item.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.570
Let's open it for intelligence message item.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.060
He is going to be message door i d.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.930
And then we will pass message with a message like that Now inside message we need to de

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.380
structure this property.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.780
So let's put messages and here at the bottom level D structure from messages,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.790
but not from messages.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.470
Excuse me from message.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.380
Let's rename it to message.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.730
Let's save what's also changes to message.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:46.000
And from this message we will destructor author trouble D structure created at and we will

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.160
destructor text.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.570
Now it is going to be an l i element and it will have class name off parted and margin

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.530
bottom one.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.010
Then we will put Dave here.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.800
That will be the top part of our message.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.410
And then we will put another def.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:08.310
And inside this different will put span that will display our message itself detects and

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:16.550
class name is going to be Ward break all to prevent text from overflow if it is too long.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.130
So for our top part,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:26.240
we're going to specify class name off display flags align items center font is going to be

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.380
bolder and margin bottom one,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.020
then here we're gonna pour First profile Avatar,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.450
Let's open it.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.210
Profile all Matar.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.330
And now let's use intelligence to imported.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.720
So as a source,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.780
we're going cheaper.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.750
Author dot avatar for name.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.850
We're gonna pour us or doc Name four class name.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.450
It is going to be margin left.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.200
One size is going to be excess.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.500
And then next to this avatar,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.630
we're going to put Spawn Element whether we will display off name and class name is going

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.980
to be margin left to and after that spine will display when this message has been created.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.850
So we're gonna put time ago.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.280
So let's open room item.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.340
Let's caught be this import off time ago.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.860
Let's put it at the chop.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.280
Let's call p the same time ago and put it here instead of this date.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.220
Time we will display.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.950
Just created at and for class name for normal and text black.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.490
We will keep it as it is,

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.050
but we will also display margin left to who?

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.950
It was a lot.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.210
Now let's take a look.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.370
As you can see,

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.940
we have our messages.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.150
And now if I let's say,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.700
executing your message,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.170
let's say hi there.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.670
You can see it is appeared over here.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.810
And also it is appeared here inside last message.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.190
So now we actually have our messages being displayed.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.330
And it will work also for any other chat room.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.650
Let's say hello from here.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.090
Now we have message over here.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.370
Okay.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.980
Perfect.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.910
So this is a let's commit our changes.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.790
Let's forget at everything.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:07.340
Let's put,

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.290
get commit.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:14.650
And people name displayed messages inside chat page.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.650
All right,

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.940
see you in the next one.
