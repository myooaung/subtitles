00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
Hey,

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.070
As for now,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.030
our chat application has all core functionality implemented.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.250
The only thing that is missing is really time notifications.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.870
In order to implement it,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.890
a few things have to be done to fire Ways Project.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.580
We're gonna talk about it in the next section and to finish these section on a good note,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.440
let's deploy our current Chad using firebase hosting open Fire Base that Jason located in

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.850
the road folder to the hosting object.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.490
Let's add pre deployed hook NPM run built bill Script is defined in package Jason.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.750
Now it is as easy as typing Firebase deploy from the terminal.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.730
This command will deploy all parts of the project that were detected in firebase the Jason

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.730
.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.250
These include database rules and hosting.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.710
We could also deploy separate parts by running firebase deploy,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.320
Dash Dash only hosting after the Commander's finished,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.250
we can go to the host in section inside Firebase Dashboard.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.250
Here we can find a euro to access our Bab app.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.440
There will be two of them.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.230
Use the one you like more both will work.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.100
Firebase also keeps track off deployments and we can roll back to any deployment record in

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.130
release history Let's open the app to see that it actually works.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.830
Nice.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.850
Looks good and pretty fast.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.340
However,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.980
Facebook Logan will fail if someone apart from us will try to sign in to fix it.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.790
Let's go to Google and Time.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.110
Facebook for deaths,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.250

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.700

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.880

And that's it.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.160
All right,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.850

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.940
