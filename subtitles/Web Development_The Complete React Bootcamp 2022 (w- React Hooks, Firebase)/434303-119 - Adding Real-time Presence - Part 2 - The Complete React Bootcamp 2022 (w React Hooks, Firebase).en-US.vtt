00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910
Hey there.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.610
In this video,

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.100
we will display real time presence for every user that we see in the chat.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.350
It will be displayed as a dar in front of user Avatar.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.010
Let's go before we get started with this.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.190
I want to point out that in the previous video,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.890
when we managed real time presence for every user here,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.030
we did this comparison.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.600
If snapshot value than triple equality equals false,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.890
so this is not completely right because this value might not be a bowling.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.240
So to prevent that,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.130
let's actually put double negation to convert it to a bowline.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.990
And now everything will be fine.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.510
All right,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.430
now let's start.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.270
So what do we need to go first?

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.610
We're gonna create a custom hook that will give us the presence off particulary users.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.170
So lets navigate to custom hooks.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.570
And here at the bottom,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.150
let's export and you function,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.270
which is going to be use presence.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.330
And this hook will receive user I D.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.690
That we want to get presence off.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.340
So let's create our state for presence.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.310
We're gonna name it presence and said presence.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.250
It is going to be simple use state,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.260
which by default,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.450
will be said to know.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.110
Then inside you the fact we're going to pull our user data.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.190
So first we need to get reference.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:27.840
So let's great const user status graph was going to be database from firebase dot treff

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.270
then began a poor status slash your I d that we get as an argument,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.370
then we need to pour an array of dependencies than we need to pass your i d inside.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.890
Then we're gonna poor user status Rough dar on value.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.400
Then we're gonna pour snap short,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.160
and right after that,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.680
we're going to check if snapshot exists.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.870
So if there is any record inside database for this path,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.220
then we're gonna pour const data equal snapshot dot value.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.400
And then we're gonna set presence to data,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.240
all right.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.700
And inside the cleanup function,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.450
we're going to unsubscribe from user status Raft,

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.330
user start.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.520
It's rough off.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.620
And from this hook,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.670
we're going to return presence,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.230
right?

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.840
Perfect.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.990
It looks good.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.540
Now,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.810
let's create a component that will be a dot where we will display the user presence.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.370
So let's go to components.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.410
And here less great.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.150
You file vegetable name presence dot the g s.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.870
So inside this component We're gonna call our custom cook,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.290
which is use presence.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.430
So let's poor const presence equals use presence.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.330
And we're gonna pass your I d.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.750
That would will receive as a prop to this component like this.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.890
Then inside the markup,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.890
we're gonna put the next let's open our suit documentation.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.750
Then let's look for tool tip.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.760
Let's open it.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.280
Let's find an example off triggering events hover.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.630
So we need exactly this functionality.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.150
Let's go to examples and let's copy that one.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.730
Then inside our court,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.750
we're gonna place it like this.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.990
Let's import whisper from our seer and instead of button,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.160
we will display a batch and tool tip is going to be not this tool tip.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.330
It is going to be this component.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.000
Let's copy it and let's based it like this.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.600
Now we need to also import tool tip and inside tool tip.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.210
We're gonna place nothing.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.890
For now,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.780
however,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.050
it says that empty component ourself closing and you are right inside.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.490
We're gonna put badge also from our suit and inside batch Well,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.780
actually put nothing.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.810
It will be just a dart off some color.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.230
So now we need to get what we will put inside tool tip.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.790
And what we will put inside batch what color will display?

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.420
Well,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.390
we actually need to perform some logic,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.040
and the best place to handle that is actually to create a custom function that we will call

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.680
from here.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.120
So for this badge,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.640
we're going to display class Name off car,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.150
sir.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:15.270
Point her and style background color is going to be get color that we will create in a

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.870
moment and inside we're gonna pass presence like this and for tool tip for our text.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.810
We're gonna pass,

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.970
get text.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.240
And also we gonna call it would presence like this.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.380
So now we need to create these two functions,

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.050
So lets navigate here to the top.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.640
And first,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.130
we're gonna create get color.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.640
We will receive presence.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.410
And first,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.290
if presence is undefined or if it is now.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.200
So if it is not defined,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.280
then we're gonna return great color,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.960
right?

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.660
Then we're gonna put switch statement and then we're going to switch between presence dar.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.200
Let's open our database presence dot state.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.120
Then if we have case online,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.950
then we're going to return green color.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.330
If we have case off lying,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.250
then we're gonna display rad color and by default,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.990
we gonna display also great like this.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.190
So for color,

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.720
we already Now let's create this for text.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.820
So let's define get text with presence as well.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.530
And again we check against no value.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.880
So if we have no presence,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.400
then we're gonna display on no one state.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.900
Then we're gonna return presence the States.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.460
If it equals two online,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.840
then we're going to return online.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.670
Otherwise,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.890
we're going to return lust online than we're gonna open string interpolation than gonna put

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.110
new date presence.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.700
Lust changed.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.430
Two local dates drink like this.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.730
Okay,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.490
Perfect.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.210
Now let's actually use this component.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.870
Let's navigate to message item.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.530
And right before we display profile Avatar,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.460
let's use presence not.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.900
And let's pass you idee as author dot your I d.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.950
Right now let's take a look.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.220
And actually,

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.080
if fresh my app now in front off my profile,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.260
I can see green dot And if I hover,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.420
I can see online.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.420
So how can we now tested against multiple users?

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.860
Well,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.690
let me sign out and let me look in with Facebook so it will create me and you user profile

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.810
and we will see it So now you can see Dad.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.920
It is unknown state And this is because as you remember,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.100
in the previous video,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.400
we set security rules for status slash user I d.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.390
So we can read Onley our current user.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.740
I d equals two user I d that we are trying to access inside eight always.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.550
So now we have permission tonight.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.940
Well,

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.170
to actually fix this for right,

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.600
we're gonna keep it as it is.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.890
But for regionals,

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.560
we're gonna adjusted And we will say,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.430
if off not equal snow on Lee,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.500
then we will be able to read user data.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.220
OK,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.480
now let's copy it and synchronize it with our local data.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.210
Let's say where and now let's take a look.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.290
If I refresh my app now,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.230
it looks all right.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:17.670
And if I hover I can see last online on this date so it actually works.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.850
And if I say hello,

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.240
I can see that currently I'm online and other user is offline.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.020
So this is it and it works pretty awesome.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.710
Let's commit our changes.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.640
Let's pour,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.740
get at everything land,

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:41.610
get commit And let's pour this play for real time presence for a fact.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.880
See you in the next one
