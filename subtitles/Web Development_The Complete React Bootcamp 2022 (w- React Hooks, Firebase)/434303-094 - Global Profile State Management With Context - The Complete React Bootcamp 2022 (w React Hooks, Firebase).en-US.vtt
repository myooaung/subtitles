00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Hey,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.320
welcome in this video.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.490
We're going to manage our signed in firebase user with context.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.800
AP I Let's go In the previous video when we got to know context AP I we created profile

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.500
provider.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.680
So now let's use the actual state instead of just a bull in value.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.660
So let's replace false with null.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.550
And let's also call,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.800
Let's define the set profile update function.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.730
All right,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.960
then we're going to use Yousef act to get user from fire base when the component mounts.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.630
So let's use your the fact and hear what we will do.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.350
We're gonna call on off State changed.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.770
So from firebase gs,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.790
we're going to use our object.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.160
And if we put dot if we type on,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.920
we see that we can use on both state changed.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.150
So this on US state changed.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.670
Allow us to subscribe to currently signed in user inside fire base.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.950
And inside this subscription,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.560
we're able to access off object.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.660
So let's put it like this and for analysis.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.110
Consul,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.470
log off the object.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.120
Now,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.590
if we navigate back to the app if we open our council,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.440
we will see this off object.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.550
And if we expanded it is exactly the same object when we signed in with the either Facebook

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.780
or Google.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.970
So this is how easy it can be managed.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.800
If we were signed off to the app,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.450
we wouldn't see this object.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.390
It would be now.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.820
So the thing is why we're seeing it currently?

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.790
Because firebase managers sessions for us,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.160
we don't need to implement everything.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.150
Once we are signed in,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.650
author,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.220
object will be automatically populated for us and managed for us.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.180
We don't need to do everything we need to only sign in or sign out,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.530
and then user object will be here.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.000
All right,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.840
so using this information,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.390
what we can do so instead of just Consul,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.770
look,

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.420
we're gonna ask if both object exists.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.540
If it is populated with some value,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.310
then we are going to do something.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.430
Otherwise,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.330
if this Earth object is not the object,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.630
if it is still then the user is not signed in.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.570
So this on off state changed,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.150
called at least once when the component mounts and if we are not signed in,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.730
then it is going to be set to know also if we sign out from the application because this is

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.690
the subscription.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.020
It will be picked up by this call.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.920
Back and off object will be such to know.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:51.450
So inside this else we're going to set profile to now and here when we have the object we

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.990
can call,

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.370
set profile and put some profile data that we will define over here.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.780
So our profile data is going to be the next it is going to be first user I d.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.250
That we will get from both object dot your i d Which we can see over here.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.150
And it will reflect our user I d inthe e off many library that we saw on fire base.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.610
And also I were user I d inside real time database.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.260
Then we also want maybe email.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.900
So we gonna pass off object dot email,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.600
and also,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.560
we need our data from real time database,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.060
so we need to actually get it here.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.520
So what we will do as we can see,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.390
profile is already declared.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.870
All right,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.450
maybe less.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.810
Just name it data and said profile data.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.360
Okay,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.120
so here to get actual data from the database for this user,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.350
we need to call again database from MISC Firebase.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.450
Then we're gonna put reference again,

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.060
we're gonna profiles.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.570
Then we gonna pour off object dot your i d Then we switch quotes for string contar

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.890
population and then we want to pour aerial time subscription for our user leader.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.600
So if something changed,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.630
then we want to be notified about it.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.290
We don't want to manually manage everything.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.630
So with real time data base and with actually any database and fire base,

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.740
it is very easy.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:28.760
So to get data only once we call dot once method to put a real time subscription on this

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.240
data we need to put on,

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.430
then we need to call it as a function and first argument.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.040
We need to specify the target,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.570
the event.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.290
Let's say so on value.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.650
We want to execute this Colback.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:49.660
So whenever our data at these path inside database changes like anything,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.180
these Colback will be fired like every time and we will receive a snapshot.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.950
So let's Consul Luck snapshot just like that.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.160
So now we are inside home because we actually get some profile data.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.130
And as you remember,

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.660
inside private route,

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.690
we check against profile so we don't see the sign in page.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.250
Okay,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.730
that's good.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:20.480
So Our data snapshot has key node reference and a few other things and meta data related to

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.410
this snapshot at these path inside data base.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.020
Well,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.700
inside the snapshot we have this method.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.110
It is called snapshot dot value snap shirt,

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.950
dark value.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.660
And it will give us the data from the database,

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.950
Inform off JavaScript object.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.510
So let's put let's say profile data equals snapshot,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.170
not value.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.800
And now let's come Salak profile data like this.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.930
Let's check it out.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.700
Now.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.020
If I refresh the page,

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.270
I can see have an object with created ad and name,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.900
which is she looks 16.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.620
Exactly the same data that we have inside database.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.980
Now what do we need to do?

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.050
We can actually destructor this profile.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.450
Data weaken D structure,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.800
name and created that like this.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.340
And here we can move this data object to this subscription like this,

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.630
and then what we can do.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.250
We can also move this at profile data over here.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.430
And for this data we can put name and created at just like that.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.950
So our profile at the end we'll have named created at your i D email.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:29.450
Right?

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.850
So this is it.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.210
And now we passed this data profile state down the context.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.490
So inside our private out,

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.840
we also need to somehow keep track if we're currently being signed in.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.740
So we need to put the loading state in order to put a spinner or something else.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.650
So let's put another state which we will name is loading and set is loading by default.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.810
It is going to be set to true.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:03.640
And right after we said the profile we're gonna call set is loading and put it to false.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.900
Or if we don't have any profile,

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.370
we're gonna call Set is loading and put falls as well.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.970
All right,

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.490
Now this is loading.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.250
We gonna pass along with our context.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.330
So instead of just passing profile inside,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.900
we gonna pass an object with is loading state and also profile.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.890
So now,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.980
inside our private route,

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.490
when we use use profile,

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.370
we receive an object with his profile and profile objects inside.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:39.440
So we're gonna d structure our profile from it and the same mobile do four use profile.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.210
So now what we can do here,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.480
inside private out we can actually use This is lowering.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.760
So let's d structure is loading and what we're gonna ask.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.860
So we're gonna put another if over here,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:59.740
and we will ask if our data is loading and we still don't have any profile data.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.620
Then we're gonna return container from our suit and inside,

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.820
we're gonna put Law Order.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.220
It is going to be a spinner,

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.100
also a component from our suit,

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.100
and it is going to be centered.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.470
It is going to be centered Vertical e wolf size whoops.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.060
Off size equals M d.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.200
Then content is going to be loading,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.260
and speed is going to be slow.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.740
And let's move it to avoid es lent her.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.160
Let's move it just to the top like that.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:30.680
All right,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.440
so this is our first condition,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.540
and then we need to also modify that one.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.920
We're gonna ask if we have no profile,

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.440
and if we have no is loading state only,

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.730
then we're going to redirect.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.300
All right,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.550
so let's check it out.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.420
Now.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.790
When we refresh the page,

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.360
we can see the spinner Pretty cool,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:50.700
right?

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.580
And only when we get the data,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.060
we actually see the homepage.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.640
All right,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.650
let's do exactly the same thing for public crowd.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:05.050
So let's copy this logic and let's put it over here.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:13.370
Let's Destructor is loading and we gonna ask if we have is loading and we have no profile

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:20.450
then we're gonna put again loading state like this if we have profile and,

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:20.890
well,

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.560
it might be a little bit tricky.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.560
So if we have profile and is loading is set to false,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.950
then we're gonna redirect.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:29.410
All right,

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.770
this is basically it.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:38.960
I only want Teoh do one more important step here because we are working with subscriptions

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.600
in react.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.910
Whenever we work with real time listeners to the data,

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.220
we use a subscription.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.200
So whenever we have a subscription,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.880
we need to unsubscribe from it when we don't need it.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.540
So this on US stage changed.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.070
If you can see it returns fire base unsubscribed.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:03.340
So it returns us a function that we need to call to unsubscribe from this subscription on

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.790
off state changed.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.490
So let's put it,

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:15.320
let's say off on sub and we will call this off on sub and our cleanup function off Yousef

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:15.640
act.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:21.350
So we're gonna return a function and here we're gonna call off on.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:28.360
So just like that and the same actually applies for our database reference over here.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.580
So at these past,

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.320
we put a real time listener which is on value,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.250
and it is our Colback.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.030
So we want to make sure that we unsubscribed from that one as well.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.710
So here,

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.620
let's say,

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.650
inside this use of fact,

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:43.320
we're gonna pour,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.540
lets a user reference.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:53.450
Then we're gonna assign Use a reference to database reference at this path like this and

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.480
then user rough on value.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.970
We will execute this callback whenever we don't have any data.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.960
If our user is not signed in,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.810
If we don't have any other object,

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.890
we're going to ask if user ref is defined.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.760
Then we gonna call,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.200
use rough dot off because if I put dot over here,

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:25.740
I can put on I could put once and also I can put off and this off as you can see detaches A

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.480
callback previously attached with on so we can.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.090
In this way,

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:35.620
we can unsubscribe from these call back from these path inside the database.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.350
Actually,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.440
the same we will do inside our cleanup for use effect.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:47.180
So this one whenever we signed off and this one whenever we amount the component,

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.850
So here we're gonna ask if user Raph,

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:57.660
then we're gonna use a ref dot off unsubscribe from this user reference.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.290
All right,

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.120
so this is basically it.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.740
I hope it wasn't too confusing cause for me.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.000
When?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.920
For the first time.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.780
When I saw it,

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.690
it was,

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.150
but at the end,

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.500
it does make sense.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.150
All right,

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.150
let's commit our changes and finish this video.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.530
We're gonna put get at everything.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.330
Then we're gonna commit everything with the message.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:31.730
Something like man age user with profile context Put riel time subs something like this.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:32.670
All right,

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.550
see you in the next video.
