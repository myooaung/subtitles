00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
Hey, this time I'd like to talk about

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:07.080
how we can start development of a new React Web App.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.610
In this video, I will not

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.935
consider a different online platforms,

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:12.480
such as CodePen for

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.835
developing directly inside the browser.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:18.179
Because these platforms are used only as playgrounds,

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.890
or usually just to quickly

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.915
share the code with basic setup.

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:25.845
To understand how modern JavaScript apps are being built,

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:29.790
we must understand what our project Butler's

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.320
a project Bundler is

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.335
a tool which takes all of the source code,

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:37.350
scripts, styles, images, processes,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.060
all of that, and create a project built.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.400
Project built is a bundled minified version of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.835
the source code optimized for maximum efficiency.

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:49.130
That are tons of project Bundler sound are

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.725
the most common ones are Webpack,

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:53.705
roll up and parcel.

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.805
All modern JavaScript projects

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.920
are covered by these tools.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.740
Great, Let's get back to our main question,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.040
ways to start developing a new React app.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.220
It eventually boils down to three pass.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.860
The first way to create a React app is to

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.575
set up and configure all the build tools,

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:15.365
such as web pack for React from scratch.

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:18.245
Second way is to use a project template.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:19.850
We're built tools already

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.709
configured for React development.

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:23.150
And the third way is to use

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.689
a React framework such as next GS, or Gatsby.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.245
There is no correct answer on which one to choose.

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:33.920
It all depends on what configuration you are looking for,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.685
personal preferences, special features, and so on.

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:40.460
Setting up everything manually and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.620
configuring project Butler's such

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.345
as Webpack from scratch,

00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:46.550
is rarely seen nowadays.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.830
Almost every time You would either

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.409
go with a template or a framework.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.865
Templates, by the way,

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:54.920
are often called boilerplates,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.510
meaning whenever you see where

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.805
the boilerplate do not freak out,

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:02.270
it is just another way of saying word template.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.100
There are lots of different community

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.260
created React project boilerplates,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.120
which is copy a template and start

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.430
developing nothing more needed.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.355
The most widely known React boilerplate

00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:15.860
is probably Create React app,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.950
which is maintained by the React team under the hood,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.875
it uses predefined web back configuration.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:25.175
You might be tempted to use only Create React app.

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:28.700
But it is important to remember that Create React app is

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.600
not the only way to develop React apps in the present,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.670
there are lots of great alternatives.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.190
Currently, pretty popular built tools for

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.295
front-end are VDD and snowpack.

00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:42.170
Another way to deal with React

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.090
is to use a React framework.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.950
Frameworks are super popular

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.155
right now, especially next, yes,

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:50.300
but I would say that it is better to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.625
start learning react without a framework.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:55.100
Because frameworks for CHEs framework

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.399
specific features and roles in our projects,

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.860
we going to use already configured templates

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.215
and built hills. Which ones?

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:08.430
Seat yourself once you get into the projects, see other
