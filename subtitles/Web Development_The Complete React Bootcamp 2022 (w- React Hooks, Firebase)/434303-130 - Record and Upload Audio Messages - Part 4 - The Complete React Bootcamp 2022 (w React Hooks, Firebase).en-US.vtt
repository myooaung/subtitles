00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.270
Hello.

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.140
In this video,

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.970
we will add an option to a Plourde user record ings directly from the browser,

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.950
so we will be able to send audio messages to the chat.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.980
Let's go.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.150
So how they're going to handle that?

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.630
Well,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.790
since we already have the code for file upload,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.750
it is going to be relatively easy.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.480
We need to only find a way how to record user's voice.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.240
For that.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.770
We're gonna use react,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.000
Mike Library.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.750
It is a library that offers to record user voice and then visualize it.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.960
But we're not going to use this visualization option.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.350
We only need the record ing.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.300
So let me install this library.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.070
I'm just gonna copy this commend than inside more terminal.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.600
I'm gonna execute it.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.060
And while it is executing under Bottom folder,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.540
let's create new file vegetable name.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.890
Let's say audio message Bt in doggy esque.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.200
For now it is going to be just an empty Deve.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.420
And let's use this inside index togs in bottom.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.520
So here,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.840
right after attachment,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.470
Beat and Moto Let's use rodeo my said you're TTN and also let's passed after upload because

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.430
we're gonna upload audio messages.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.040
So inside this component,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.140
we will receive after upload.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.090
And now let's define our market well.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.730
It is going to be almost this same as for attachment beating Moto.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.680
So let's copy input group bottom from here and pasted as our market.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.060
So then let's import import group button for unclipped.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.800
We will have our own handler and let's also import icon.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.370
And for I can we gonna use my crow phone?

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.870
Okay,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.280
good.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.950
Now how we're able to use this react my Kleiber Let's go to usage and example.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.140
So let's copy the import part and let's place it here at the top.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.650
Then let's actually use the component.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.280
And let's take a look what kind of props we need to pass.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.090
So first we have this record and if I hover on the property,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.150
said too true to begin record ing.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.910
So we need the state to control.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.080
When we want to start our record ing,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.210
let's create one.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.880
So it is going to be is record in.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.590
Bullen is recording by default,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.590
it will be set to false and we're gonna pass this state to record property that for class

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.100
name,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.710
we're gonna put display none in order to display any react Mike Element,

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.650
but to use their functionality.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.560
So for once,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.180
stop.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.960
This is going to be our handler when we have the record ing and we want to upload it.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.230
So for that,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.450
we're gonna create on a Plourde handler.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.130
So let's put on a Plourde and in advance,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.500
we will put it in use call back.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.530
So for now,

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.520
let's leave it empty like that and on data,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.860
we don't need that one,

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.110
because if we scroll to usage,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.070
we can see that when data it is optional,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.420
called when a channel cough order is available,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.750
we don't need that one.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.030
We don't need throw color and background color because we simply don't display this

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.250
component that also we need to pass.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.720
I mean,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.350
type to that component to ensure that we receive MP three.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.860
Former.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.100
So let's pass mean type and then let's pacify audio MPA three.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.610
Okay,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.430
good now,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.310
ready to go.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.810
So first,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.700
let's define this on click.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.270
So let's put it here at the shop and let's optimize it with use cold back in advance again

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:49.460
because we will simply call Said is loading and we're gonna reverse our Bullen value over

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.910
here.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.280
Okay,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.890
good now for on upload,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.900
we're gonna poured the next logic.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.530
It is going to be correlative Lee the same as inside Attachment BT and Moto.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.500
So we will need to reference storage so we can copy this logic from here than we will put

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.110
it inside.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.730
Try catch block here.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.610
We're gonna receive snap short and away this applaud promise.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.830
So we need to convert it to a sink function.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.530
So storage reference check,

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.330
I d.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.660
Let's also grab chat I d.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.950
From use Paramus Hook than for storage.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.220
We need to import it from ISC firebase than for child for file name we gonna poured.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.460
Not this file name,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.590
but we're gonna pour.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.870
Let's say audio than underline.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.800
And then let's open string interpolation data now and then at the end,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.120
we're gonna put daughter MP three than for blob file.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.660
What do we need to specify for the actual file if we go to react?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.850
Mike on stop property gives us this record of data.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.190
So because we used javascript,

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.590
we don't have any types.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.640
And we can't check what kind of data we receive here.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.630
But what we can do,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.040
we can actually put a function directly over here to get the intelligence.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.160
So we received this data over here.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.990
And if I put data dar,

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.830
I can have blub over here.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.020
So this is developed type off object that we can upload to firebase storage.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.150
So let's put data dog blow cash control.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.960
We will leave it as it is now.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.420
We need to also specify the actual file that we will put inside database,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.730
not inside storage.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.220
So let's grab it from here from attachment,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.090
bt and model.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.630
I'm going to copy this object structure.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.300
Then I'm going to create a veritable file and then I will place it like that.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.280
So snapshot,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.030
media data.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.370
Hugh R L Okay,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.790
good.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:55.090
Now we need to actually Onley call after a Plourde with array of files that we want to

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.920
applaud because we have only one.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.840
We can put just an empty array and then put our file inside.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.850
So now we have some sort of in a rate,

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:03.240
right.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.030
So for any errors,

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.880
we're gonna put alert Dar error error dot message then for area of dependencies.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.700
We're gonna pass after upload and share I d.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.210
All right,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.650
Good.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.070
Also,

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.350
we need to define some sort off a loading state.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.330
So let's create new viable debt.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.920
Will say is uploading Let it be said is applauding.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.910
So by default it will be false And we will call that function right before a Plourde and

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.090
set it to true.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.030
So after applaud or maybe right before it,

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.850
we're gonna said,

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.680
is applauding to false and also in case of any arable also called set is applauding to

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.100
false.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.660
So now to input group Bt and we can pass disabled Onley when is uploading.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:57.350
And also we need to somehow notify our user when we do the record ing so he can understand

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.610
that.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.970
OK,

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.430
your voice is being record for that.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.750
We're gonna pull a conditional class name.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.990
So if we have is record ing,

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.220
then we're going to specify any mate blink.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:15.030
And this is the class name with the CSS animation that I defined in one of the CSS classes

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.030
.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.730
So now it looks okay and everything else looks fine.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.120
Now we can actually test the functionality.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.510
I haven't started it,

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.120
so let me run the AB now we can see starting the development server.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.430
Okay,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.670
let's wait a few seconds until the APP is run.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.960
Okay,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.820
is loading.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.890
Now let's try and record that one.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.900
So if I hit this button,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.350
you can see that Now,

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.360
here I have These tab is using your camera.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.190
We microphone this icon.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.950
And also,

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.090
if I didn't have my permission to use microphone,

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.960
it would have asked me for that.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.700
And now I am notified that okay,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.640
my voice is record it right now.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.120
So when I click on this button one more time,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.710
I can see that I have a new file upload over here.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.710
And if we go to firebase storage than to Chad than to our Chad,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.360
I d.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.040
We can have all of our files.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.390
And also audio message.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.730
Okay,

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.230
so this is it.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.300
In the next video,

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.520
we will talk about how we're able to display this audio message in the former that weaken

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.190
directly.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.890
Listen to this older message inside the browser,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.040
But for now,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.650
let's commit our changes.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.230
Let me call,

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.610
get at everything,

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.780
then who did commit and let's specify,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.440
added option,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.700
an option to record and a poor audio files.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.730
All right,

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.070
see you in the next one.
