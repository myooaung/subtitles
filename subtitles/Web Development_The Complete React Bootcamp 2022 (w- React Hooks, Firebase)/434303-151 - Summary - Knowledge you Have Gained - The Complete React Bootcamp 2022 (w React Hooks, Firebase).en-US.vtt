00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
Hello,

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.210
You did very well.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.870
You build three separate react projects of different complexity.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.170
You can proudly say that you have react development experience.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.400
Now let's summarize what things you've learned on this course.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.650
I'll split everything into its own context.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.310
The courts started with more general things where you looked at different types of website

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.740
rendering.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.220
Can AP eyes given the real world examples your gear,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.460
no GS and modern JavaScript crash courses and then prepared yourself to start working with

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.390
react on our first project.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.950
Tick tack to you get to know first React components,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.450
probes,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.220
styles,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.430
ST Dynamic,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.120
you I and development of Flow.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.740
In general,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.050
you created a simple react project that demonstrates strong basics.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.120
With box office,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.650
you moved towards more complex react app by working with external a P I and managing known

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.820
primitive scenarios.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.250
Using three AC cooks,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.160
you learn the concept of dynamic crowds and remote data fetching you so how to optimize and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.940
analyze react components,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.400
CIA says in GS or styled components are not foreigners for you from now on.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.840
By the end of this project,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.100
you have typical react application that requires more comprehensive re acknowledge In the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.800
last project chat app.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.290
You get to know firebase in the first place.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.850
You did a great job in managing Global state with context.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.790
AP I You experience confusing and non primitive situations that require advanced

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.230
comprehension of react.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.200
Managing styles yourself not always desirable.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.210
That's why now you understand the meaning off you Y components,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.950
libraries,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.430
user,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.650
state and private pages are normal things for you right now.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.890
And react hooks is your main weapon.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.120
Several s backing off course.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.870
Pay less with minimum effort.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.360
At the end of the chat up,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.350
you build a production ready Web application with up to date technologies.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.580
There was also a small room off react concepts where we looked at them separately and apply

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.260
to our final project.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.550
After all of that,

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.590
you should be confident working with react and it's eco system.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.170
There will be always that feeling that your knowledge is not enough.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.190
And that's fine.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.180
Every developer has this sense.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.030
There is no limit to perfection.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.150
These were the things that you've learned in this course.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.630
See you next time
