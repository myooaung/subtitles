00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
Hey there.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.880
In this video,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.510
we will define after upload function that we mentioned in the previous video Let's Navigate

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.620
to Index Togs Inside Bottom Folder and here at the bottom right before we define markup.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.210
Let's create after a Plourde wrapped in use callback function.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.710
And also,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.590
let's specify it up dependencies as empty every So let's pass this after a Plourde in

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.400
advance.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.300
Teoh Attachment Bt and mortal.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.420
And this after upload receives files that we need to pour inside a debates so as to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.370
remember this attachment beating Moto has its own loading state,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.970
and this is Onley inside model.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.320
But inside in exult.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.550
Yes,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.780
we also have loading state this time for the actual input.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.910
So right before we do any operation on the database,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.850
let's also call said,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.470
is applauding to true inside index togs.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.890
Okay,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.380
then,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.110
the same as for on sent click.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.140
We need to define an atomic operation,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.260
so we're gonna create updates as an empty object.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.950
And let's copy this logic for Let's say,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.070
four message data over here and this push key now because we have multiple files that we

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.180
need to upload and this files is in the rate we're gonna call files for each to look over

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.150
Every file inside this right will receive file.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.800
And for every file we get a poor message I d And also,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.480
we're gonna define message data.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.700
So let's caught be this logic from on send Click and put it for every file.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.550
So assemble message.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.090
And instead of text,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.950
we're going to specify file and for file we're going to specify file object that we created

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.060
inside attachment BT model,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.900
which is this object.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.750
Okay,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.830
now we have message I d.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.950
We have updates with message data.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.100
It looks nice.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.010
Now we need to also surpass if I lust message as we do over here,

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.330
so inside on some click it is pretty easy.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.990
However,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.150
now that we have,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.790
let's say this updates object populated with this data,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.420
how can we grab the very last message?

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.450
While it is actually pretty easy,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.740
it just takes some time to understand the logic.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.750
So first we will grab last message idea,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.770
which is going to be object dot keys from updates and then from this array off,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.200
let's say messages idea.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.610
We're gonna pop the very last element which is going to be last message.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.450
I OK,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.350
then we're gonna put updates,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.880
rooms,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.890
chat I d.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.050
Last message.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.850
And instead of message data,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.890
we're gonna call updates last message idee.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.090
And for message I d.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.780
We're gonna specify last message.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.160
I d.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.720
All right,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.160
And then we're gonna copy this.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.950
Try catch block from here,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.080
and we're gonna put it right over here.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.330
And let's convert this function to anything.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.180
Function.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.220
So a database ref updates updates.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.760
Okay,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.500
Said is lowering We don't need in poor and it looks all right now,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.090
let's actually specify array of dependence is with chat I D and profile and now we are

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.380
ready to test it.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.640
Now,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.210
let's not get back to the APP.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.240
Let me click on file upload.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.320
I'm going to select all of these files than open.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.330
Then I'm going to send them to Chad and I can see empty messages.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.030
However,

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.770
if we look inside database,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.750
I can see four new messages and we have filed,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.260
like,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.840
count created at we have author.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.030
And if we open file,

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.900
we can have content,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.320
type,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.080
name and euro reference to our storage.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.690
So this is it.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.350
And it actually worked.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.860
Congrats in the next video.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.420
We're going to display all of the files that we've uploaded.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.190
But for now,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.670
let's come in our changes.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.180
Let's forget everything.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.460
Get commit and,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.690
let's say store applauded files to D Data Maze.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.520
All right,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.850
see you in the next one.
