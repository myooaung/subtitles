00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.730
Hey,

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.500
welcome in this reader will add to radio buttons to our home page.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.180
So we're able Teoh,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.810
search for actors as well.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.690
Let's go.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.810
So let's get back to our code.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.350
And here the first thing people do you we will actually put a placeholder for our input.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.340
So we will put placeholder and little name it.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.770
Search for something.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.450
Let's shake it out.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.590
Yeah,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.170
perfect.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.020
Now let's add our radio buttons.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.110
So here,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.730
right after this input,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.650
Travelport and you Div.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.260
And inside this deep we will poor first label.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.860
And inside this label we will put our radio buttons so label is going to be shows and then

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.080
we will put in port off type Ray deal.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.770
And then we will put our second Dave over here,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.600
which we will name people for.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.550
Let's say actors and that's it.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.950
But now,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.760
if we have er,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.530
we can see that a former label must be associated with the control.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.690
So what?

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.690
We need to sold this.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.560
We need to define a unique I D for inputs So it is going to be shows surge.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.590
Let's say and here it is going to be,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.380
Let's say,

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.370
I d actors search now for this label.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:39.080
We need to pour html four and we need to specify that I d Do you associate this label with

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.910
this input?

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.300
All right,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.980
so,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.960
like that And here also,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.700
we will pour html four and we will put actors search.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.960
Let's check it out.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.140
What do we have now?

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.140
We have shows and we have actors.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.000
All right,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.790
Perfect.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.950
What will be our strategy to use this radio buttons?

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.030
Let's get back to our A p I.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.010
And let's take a look at this example as before,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.390
let's take a look at this.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.550
Euro search shows Query equals girls.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.150
All right,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.920
that's fine.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.680
But how do we search for people?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.820
If we go over this documentation,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.810
we can find it.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.150
But a very quick solution would be to replace this shows with the just people.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.860
So if we put people instead of shows,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.560
we can still look for different actors by their name and we will get results.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.690
So this is our strategy.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.270
We will use this to display our data,

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.220
so we need one more state to manage this radios,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.550
So we need to either put shows or people.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.750
So this is what our state is going to be look like so,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:58.170
const We will name it Search option and then we will pour CET search option and by default

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.690
it is going to be,

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.690
Let's say shows.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.380
So our state is going to be either shows or people reflecting this option over here shows.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.620
And now what do we need to do here?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.610
So when we select shows,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.890
we will select a value.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.250
So let's associate value for this input.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.430
So value is going to be shows for shows and for actors,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.730
value must be people the same that we have over here.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.720
So value will be people.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:44.040
Now we will add a handler for the on change event and we will create our own function for

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.150
this which will name on radio change.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.780
And as always,

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.640
we have the event object.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.740
So we will put this on radio change gender for the on change event for our radio inputs and

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.040
here own change.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.740
We will specify on radio change.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.450
Now we know that we sat value to shows and people.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.250
So from the event object,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.900
we can simply access it by event target and dodge value in the same way as we did with

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.450
input.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.130
All right,

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.910
so here we will set search option to event target,

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.690
Dutch Valley.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.210
Now,

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.500
let's cancel log search option and let's see if it actually works.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.240
All right,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.750
if we opened the consul.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.880
So now it is set to shows.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.620
When I click on actors,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.610
it is people.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.810
When I click on shows,

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.700
it is shows,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.810
but you can see that it doesn't work in the way we want.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.450
All right.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:52.710
So we need to also poor conditions when this or that radio buttons are active.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.320
So what do we need for that?

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.050
We need to use Bullen values to indicate whether it is active or not.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.460
So let's add one more variable over here,

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.240
which we will name.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.540
It is shows search.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.900
Something like that in Cuba will check if our search option equals shows.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.550
So if we set our search for shows,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.210
then it will be such to true.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.840
Otherwise,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.190
it is going to be fools,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.760
and we're looking for people.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.450
So now we can use it.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.830
And here we will specify one more prop.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:37.550
So our radio is being checked so we will put checked equals for shows it is going to be

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.840
active if we have this attitude.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.290
True for actors,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.480
it is other way.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:51.870
So we will need to pour checked and we need to put not is shows search if we save it now If

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.770
we have shows,

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.140
it is being selected.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.760
If I click on actors,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.020
it has been selected.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.070
And now if it works in the way we want it.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.760
Okay,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.350
Perfect.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.050
Now how can we use it to adjust our search?

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.700
So now if we look for shows,

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.870
it works fine and we display some results.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.680
But if we look for actors,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.960
we have nothing because we always search for shows over here.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.980
So let's adjust this shrink.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.270
And instead of shows,

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.630
let's specify our search option,

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.710
which is our state.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.830
So again mobile,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.580
open string interpolation and we will put our search option over here.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.420
And now let's check if it actually works.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.570
So for shows,

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.130
When I look for girls,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.790
I received my results.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.730
But when I click on actors and I click search I received,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.340
can it wait?

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:49.170
Property I d off undefined that because you see inside this render function when we map

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:56.240
elements we reference item that show dot i d But if we look into our a p I when we have

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.850
people we don't have,

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.840
we don't have item dot show We have item that person that I did that name and so one.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.750
So we need to adjust our render function and what we will do.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.590
So from this return,

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.950
we will do it slightly in a different way.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.220
And actually,

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.330
we don't need this wrapping Div.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:25.950
Let's just copy this results map logic here and we will ask if results first element dot

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.910
show,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.750
then wiggle map shows.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.010
Otherwise,

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.150
we are going to map people,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:40.570
so results don't map item and let's replace show with dot What do we have here?

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.270
That person like that,

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.640
and let me remove that one.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.640
And if I say that now,

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.970
it looks fine.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.750
Let me check it out.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.250
So if I look for girls again,

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.810
I received my babies.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:00.840
And if I have actors and let's say if I look for James now,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.440
you can see I received James James handle,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.670
um,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.450
fleet and so one.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.530
So it actually worked.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.130
Okay,

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.600
good and everything seems just fine.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.060
So this is it,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.680
guys,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.150
let's commit our changes.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:26.180
So we will pour to get at everything and get commits ended search option and that's

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:26.950
basically it.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.160
Alright.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.940
Awesome.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.170
See you in the next one.
