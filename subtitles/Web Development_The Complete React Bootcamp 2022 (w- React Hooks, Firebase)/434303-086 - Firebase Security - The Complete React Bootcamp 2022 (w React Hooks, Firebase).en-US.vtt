00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
Hey,

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.550
let's see how secure Firebase iss.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.310
Since we don't have any server side code,

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.860
we're gonna access database from client side.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.570
How we're gonna expose any sensitive data?

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.530
Yes and no.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.160
In fireplace databases are accessed via Public euro.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.250
This is a part of the conflict.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.720
Let's say we have some data inside database.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.420
We have public your el No.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.150
One as well.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.360
And if Random Person tries to access the Ural and we didn't protect the database,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.850
this person can get all the data,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.280
whether it meant to be public or not,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.730
to prevent unauthorized access,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.250
their security rules.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.180
These rules define how data can be accessed and by who.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.250
It means that the level of security depends on how good security rules are written.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.010
It is a good practice to look down the database by default and then it just rules.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.290
As we write code security rules apply on Lee to you clients.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.950
I If we write custom backend with cloud functions,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.070
this rules will not apply when application grows.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.430
Some people find it hard to write seek rituals.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.750
For this reason,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.260
they use cloud functions and perform servers at validation themselves.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.050
The same applies to cloud storage.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.320
We have public who are ill and rules by default.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.750
Storage can be accessed only by signed in users.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.880
For most cases,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.820
it works well.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.020
But it doesn't mean that if we upload an image that we want to share,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.910
this image will be locked down.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.070
Every uploaded file can have public Europe.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.780
All right,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.760
that's it for security.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.310
I hope it was comprehensive and concise.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.950
Now,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.260
what about pricing?

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.750
Is firebase free?

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.650
I'm gonna find out that in the next video.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.450
See you there.
