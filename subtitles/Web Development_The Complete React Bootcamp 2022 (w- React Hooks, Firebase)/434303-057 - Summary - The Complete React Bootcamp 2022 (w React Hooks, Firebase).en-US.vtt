00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
Hi there.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.050
I'm glad you made it up to this point and was successful in finishing the project.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.840
Now you have knowledge off react basics.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.400
You are able to manage simple state with hooks.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.990
You know how to conditionally render elements and apply styles to react.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.280
Application The game were built has the tree of components that you can see on the screen

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.850
right now.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.950
From now on,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.130
you are able to understand what this three exactly means.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.380
And white data flows from top to bottom.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.810
You experienced it yourself.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:41.030
We pass down the state from top level to bottom level components and so component lifecycle

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.950
ourselves.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.790
One piece of advice here,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.550
if you forget these are that concept you can always refer to react official documentation.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.650
It is well written and you will not find any better place than that.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.720
And also,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.860
don't forget to upload your local changes to get help.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.100
Rep.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.380
Oh,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.650
this is the last video in this section.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.810
Thank you for your dedication.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.250
See you in the next one.
