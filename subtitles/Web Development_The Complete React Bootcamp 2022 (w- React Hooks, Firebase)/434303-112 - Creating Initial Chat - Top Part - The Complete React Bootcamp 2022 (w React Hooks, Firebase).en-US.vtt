00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.090
Hello.

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.130
In this video we will start a building chattel page.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.890
Let's go,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.980
Let's navigate back to the code and let's open index togs that represents in the top part

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.460
here.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.830
Instead of this name,

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.250
we will pour another def.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.030
That will be another upper.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.260
So for this difficult quit class name on display flex,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:30.760
justify content between the line items center inside we're gonna pull the age four tack and

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.500
inside rebel display Ah,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.740
were chat name.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.880
So here of a vocal name and class name for this pan will be text disappear and also we're

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.790
going to put and I can over here in front of this text when we are on mobile devices so we

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.670
can not to get back to the home page.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.790
So here,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.290
let's board and I can and competent class is going to be a link that comes from react

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.530
Router dumb than the Eiken itself is going to be Arrow circle.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.040
Left size is going to be double X And because it is a link component,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.090
we also need to provide to property which will lead to homepage,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.590
right?

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.990
And also we will pour conditional class name for this Aiken.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.640
So we're gonna ask if we are on mobile devices.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.910
Then we're gonna put one class names.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.660
And if we are on desktop,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.040
we're gonna put other class names for that.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.570
We're gonna use use media Query hook that we use earlier,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.040
and we're gonna create the Bullen,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.690
which is mobile.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.700
And then we're gonna use Media Query from custom hooks and inside a bubble port marks with

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.640
off 992 pixels.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.300
All right,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.110
so when we are on mobile devices,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.550
we gonna pull the display in line block than batting is going to be zero margin right to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.570
text Blue and Lincoln styled to make our link element fully on styled.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.400
And if we are on desktop devices,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.530
then we just not displaying this Aiken.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.480
So let's save and let's inspect.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.300
What do we have?

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.080
So now we have room name.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.670
If I inspect and resize the window,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.850
I can see this button over here.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.060
When I click on it,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.400
I go back to the home page to see Chatham's.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.960
Alright,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.560
Looks good.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.510
Let's continue.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.180
So here,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.050
next to this h four,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.240
let's put button toolbar that comes from our suit,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.640
and this was going to be our to do So also,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.750
let's put class name off Ws No rap.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.750
All right,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.640
unified a fresh.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.100
All right,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.430
So this is to do next to this day if we're gonna put another def and it is going to be our

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.300
bottom part.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.020
So for this bottom part,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.640
we're gonna put,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.150
display,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.730
flex,

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.720
justify content between and align items center inside.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.100
We're gonna pour as fun element That also will be our to do.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.530
And also,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.580
we're gonna put a button over here,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.930
so when we click on it,

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.330
a model window opens and we can see room description.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.510
So it is going to be another component that we will create and we're gonna name it Groom

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.550
Info,

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.840
BT and Moto Dar g s all right.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.060
For now it is going to be empty.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.620
Let's use it inside.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.570
Index togs here.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.200
We gonna poured from info bt and Moto,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.700
Right?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.800
Let's say with and now let's define our component.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.590
First of all,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.150
here we're gonna display our room description and room name as well.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.850
So for this we gonna use use context,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.400
Elector.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.830
So first of all,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.220
we will poor description over here,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.130
and it is going to be used car and thrown hook.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.900
So we get our value and from value we grow up description.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.360
And do you remember that I told you that it is important not to select objects because they

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.790
are compared referential e So it means if we need to select multiple values from an object

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.790
,

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.650
we need to select them separately.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.020
So they become a primitive value because description is a string.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.830
Hence it is a primitive type.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.190
So we also need to display name.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.820
So we're gonna do exactly the same thing.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.950
Use current room,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.200
and we're gonna peak room dot name.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.790
All right,

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.280
Now,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.820
inside our markup,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.510
we gonna pour a button element from our suit inside.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:30.050
We're gonna pour room information and appearance is going to be blink and class Name is

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.520
going to be patting on X access is zero now,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.750
because we have a motile we will use again our own custom hook,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.360
which is used mortal state.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.570
So let me import it.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.670
And from this hook we gonna grab is open,

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.280
close and open.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.620
Now,

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.740
next to this button elements we can afford a moral component than for show property we're

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.050
gonna set is open for on height.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.720
We're gonna put clothes.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.330
And inside this mortal,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.960
as always,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.680
we will have mortal dot Heather.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.900
Then we're gonna have body and footer.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.320
So let's replace those values,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.050
Littlefoot her.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.550
Okay,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.220
so for Model Heather,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.500
we're gonna pour model dot title and for title,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.060
we will pour about than about this room name than for footer.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.830
We gonna pour another button that will just close the moto.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.740
So let's put clothes then we're going to specify on Click is going to be clothes And also

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.070
it is going to be a block element,

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.770
all right?

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.960
And we're body,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.550
which is gonna specify something simple,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.850
which is going to be a six tack.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.950
And we're gonna put description and class name is going to be margin bottom one on then

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.020
will go the description itself.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.870
So let's put description.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:55.560
And now let's save And let's remove this dropping def and replace it with the react context

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.560
.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.230
Let's also move import to the top.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.760
And also we didn't use this open handler.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.970
Let's put it for days.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.720
Button on click is going to be open.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.330
All right,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.300
let's save it and let's take a look.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.450
Now we have room information button that looks like a link.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.860
And when we click on it,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.100
we have a moral window that says about Hello.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.450
Description description.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.950
Hey,

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.610
close.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.470
Let's test it for in your own name again.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.680
We have this strange description and everything works fine.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.020
So this is it for this video.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.500
Let's commit our changes.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.880
Let people get at everything can then get commit.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.740
Let's say,

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:40.000
started to build Chat Top Created a room description.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.870
Modoff.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.390
All right,

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.110
Perfect.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.350
See you in the next one.
