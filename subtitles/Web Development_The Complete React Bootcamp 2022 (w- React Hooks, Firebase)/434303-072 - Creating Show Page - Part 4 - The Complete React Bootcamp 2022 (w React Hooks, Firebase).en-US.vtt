00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Hey there,

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.440
in this readable continue building the show page and we will create components and also

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.050
populate them with the data from the A P I.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.010
Let's go.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.820
The first thing people do inside our code,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.850
we will create these components.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.450
So under show folder inside components,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.950
we're going to create new files.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.990
So 1st 1 is going to be show main data and it will be empty for now.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.350
Then we will have details.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.440
Then we will have seasons seasons,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.240
and the last one is going to be cast.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.650
All of them are going to be empty components for now.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:53.860
And our next step will be to define our mark up inside shell page.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.780
So here,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.710
instead of this is show page level type.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.260
Next,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.780
first,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.620
we will use show main data,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.970
so I will open it and then poor intelligence.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.060
Then we will end up with Deve inside.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:18.970
We will have hte to that will say that this is details and enviable import details and let

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.200
me open it.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:29.930
And then I will use out to import and almost the same structure for seasons and cast.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.070
So he will have seasons,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.080
and at last we will have cast.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.090
So here,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.260
rubble port seasons.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.590
And then we will pour Cast just like that at the job,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.210
we will end up with all of this imports,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.780
so it looks fine.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's check it out.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.450
Yep.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.760
We have all of our components.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.100
Now,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.920
let's see what kind of data we need to pass to those components.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.850
So for show main data,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.570
we will need image first.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.450
So we're gonna pass image show image.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.910
Then we will need name,

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.840
which is going to be show dot name.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.690
Then we also need rating,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.650
which is going to be just show dot rating.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.260
Then we need summary.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.420
And also we need tags or genres at the top.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.970
All right,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.260
so first,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.170
we need summary show die summary.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.240
And at last,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.730
we need tags,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.190
which will be our show dot genres.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.270
All right,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.830
cool.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.820
Now what?

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.090
Louis need for details for details.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.160
We need first status,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.750
which is going to be show Dodd status.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.930
Then we need network and premiered.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:09.050
So network is going to be show network and premiered show dot prime here all right for

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.440
seasons and forecast it is going to be pretty simple because they are available under

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.820
embedded key so we will specify.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:30.540
Seasons is going to be show dot m vetted dot seasons and the same we will do for a cast

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.780
level poor cast,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.280
shoulder embedded that cast.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.920
But if we have or we will see unexpected dangling underscore,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.240
so that's fine.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:47.550
Let's pour quick fix and let's select for the entire file and at the top will see this

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.350
comments saying that s linked disabled.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.440
So it's normal.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.290
It will disable this rule for just these file.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.130
All right,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.840
so now that we have old data past,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.320
we will actually start creating our components,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.550
and we will get them from the Assets folder.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.380
Here we confined show page components,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.550
the txt Let's open it and let's go one by one.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.550
So first we have show main data.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.370
Let's open show main data and let's replace it.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.220
So the first thing we have here is this image Placeholder is missing,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.390
so let's import our not found image.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:37.280
So image placeholder from images than not found those B and G and also we meet this star

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.940
component.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.730
Let's talk about it in the moment.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.250
I just want to explain this markup.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.070
So first we have image and we handle the undefined case.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.110
Then we have a Chuan one than we also handle undefined case here.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.970
But the important part here is this dangerously sad inner html.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.130
What is that?

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.650
Well in react.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.810
If we have already pre defined html markup,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.960
ineffable try and displayed as it is,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.110
it will be displayed as taxed.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.880
But we don't want it.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.990
So in situations where we need to insert HTML as it is,

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.410
we need to use this dangerously set in their HTML property.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.050
And inside we need to pass an object which is well,

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.490
which will have HTML key and then summary,

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.540
which is going to be the the markup itself.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:39.360
So in this way it will be protest as it is all right now about this start component that we

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.920
have over here if we open assets,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.150
if we scroll to the very bottom,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.200
we can find the start component.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.730
Other styles Gs,

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:55.960
Let's called it Let's get back to the code and let's open styled gs And here at the bottom

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.960
,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.010
we will export it from here.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.010
And what is this star component?

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:09.430
It will basically create a square 18 by 18 and then using clip path property we will add

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.500
shape to this square.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.800
So let's check it out.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.300
What is going to happen?

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:21.690
So let me import this start from styled and let's see now if I opened my page,

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.470
I can see this star component being displayed.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.350
Us start.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.350
So it is basically a square.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.950
But because of clip path,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.840
it has this star shape all right.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.450
Our data is displayed and again,

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.010
if we inspect this dangerously said in their HTML,

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.210
we can see that now.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.760
Html protest as it is because inside the summary,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.110
it has this Pitak inside.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.950
All right,

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.050
let's move on.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.320
And our next component is going to be details.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.660
Let's copy them what's cooperated from here.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.540
Now let's open details.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.610
Let's paste the markup.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.690
And as you can see,

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.410
it is pretty,

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.490
pretty simple or right.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:13.610
Our next component is going to be seasons and let's open seasons.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.410
So here,

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.350
what is going on again?

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.220
Everything that you already know V tax span tax.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.740
Inside this pan tack,

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.110
we use dot reduce method on seasons away,

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.850
and if we inspect data inside seasons,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.120
it is an array off objects,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.870
and every object has episode,

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:37.460
order,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.890
key,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.060
and this episode order.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.570
Key says how many episodes inside this is,

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.130
Um so by using this dot reduce,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.470
we summarize all of these episodes orders and in the end,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.750
but will receive the total number off episodes.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.300
Okay,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.940
so this is accumulating value at the end.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:03.030
We simply map over seasons and display data about each off the seasons.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:03.950
All right.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.390
Next we have our final component,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.200
which is cast the GS.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.250
Let's copy all of that.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.450
Let's open cast a GS and let's replace it.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.150
And here we means image place holders.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.030
So let's also import it.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.310
Or maybe let's actually copy it from show main data.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.250
And now let's check it out.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.600
So what is going on here again?

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.850
We map over,

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.750
cast a rain and simply display data.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:38.930
We handling the image undefined case and then also display some other data.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:39.550
All right,

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.390
now let's check it out.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.730
We have show main data.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.300
We have details.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.670
We have seasons,

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.070
and we have cast.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.310
So everything seems fine.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:51.210
All right,

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.580
now we populated our components with the data.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.920
We also created start styled component.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.540
Everything seems fine.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.130
Now,

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.280
we don't need this consul lock to inspect data anymore,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.780
So let's finish this video by committing our changes.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.350
So I'm gonna put to get at everything and then get commit,

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:21.170
created show page components and populated them with data.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.090
All right.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.050
Seems fine.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.450
See you in the next one.
