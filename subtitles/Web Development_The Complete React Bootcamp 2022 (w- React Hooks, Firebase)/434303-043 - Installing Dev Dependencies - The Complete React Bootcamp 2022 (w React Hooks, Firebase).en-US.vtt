00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
Hey,

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.330
let's continue building the app Last time we created a scaffold.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.550
Now let's extend it by installing a few more depth dependency and also connecting To get at

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.880
the beginning of the section you condone load the Assets folder Wiggle reference this

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.120
folder a few times during the project.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.860
So please get it to your PC inside.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.480
We can find this in Stalin preacher and he s going to Jason.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.600
Let's open it.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.900
And here we can find the conflict files that we will use and also the installation command

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.170
for all off our depth dependencies.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.490
So let's copy this really long line and inside integrated terminal,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.700
let's execute it.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.180
What it will do,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.310
it will install.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.680
Yes,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.050
Lind,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.820
preacher and Ream Ralf.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.890
Other packages are just conflict files for E s land while it is installing.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.650
Let's get back to the file.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.450
And also let's copy this and PM script here.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:04.790
And let's put them at the end off the script section when we have our installation finished

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.790
.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.430
All right,

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.040
so let's put them here.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.350
And what are those scripts?

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.290
So the first crypt which has lent will use yes Lind to check our jobless quit for any

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.200
errors four months Williams,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.170
preacher to former all of our files than four months and lend to use the combined command.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.920
And we can combine NPM scripts by using logical and operator.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.100
And then we have the clear command that will do it dissed and parcel dot cash folders.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.870
Why do we need the clear command?

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.690
Because when we have the production bills,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.480
we want to ensure that we receive the fresh build.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.610
But parcel during development uses the dest folder and generates cash files.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.350
So we want to get rid of them.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.870
So right before the built command here,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:04.850
let's poor NPM Ron clear and combine it by using the end operator Something like that.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.250
And if we execute this command directly in PM are unclear,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.810
I will demonstrate you that it will dilate both off those Fuller's something like that.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.570
All right,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.180
Now that we have everything,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.750
let's use the conflict files.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.810
So first we will start with Yes,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.270
Lind,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.730
I'm gonna create not Yes,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.910
Linda RC And inside I will pour death.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.520
So here we extend a few conflict files.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.230
So we use Airbnb convict for our lending rules than we have preacher to Yvonne conflicts

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.950
and also preacher react to avoid conflicts with preacher in react syntax.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.390
Then we sat environment parse er and here I disabled funerals for us that we will use

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.280
during development to avoid getting warnings.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.820
We just disable them a simple as that.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.980
Now let's get the preacher conflict.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.960
So I'm gonna copy it from here.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.310
And I'm going to create,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.740
not prettier,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.950
RC and put it here.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.970
Okay,

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:11.400
good.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.960
Now we're ready to go.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.100
The only thing that is left for us is to connect to the get system and to get up.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.040
So in our terminal,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.040
let's run.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.780
Get in it right after that.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.280
Let's time GH at dot to add all four files to the get system files and folders that are

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.070
listed inside or get Ignore will not be at it,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.000
and that's good.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.590
Then let's commit our changes.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.190
Let's see,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.690
this is in it.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.730
Commit.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.420
Let's put,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.250
get log to see what we have.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.830
OK,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.440
perfect.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.240
We have everything here.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.250
Now let's go to get up to our profile and here at the top,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.650
right click on new Repository,

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.170
let's create a name it tick tack toe.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.550
Let's make it private and let's click on,

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.810
create repository.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.790
Right after that,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.500
here at the bottom was copied this command and let's executed inside our terminal.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.840
And it will connect our local folder to the remote project that we just created.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.850
So let's execute it now to check.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.590
Weaken type gets remote.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.460
Dash three.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.540
Now we are ready to go with just get portion origin muster.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.990
We deploy our project and once deployed,

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.640
let's check it out if we have it online.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.260
If I refresh the page,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.940
Yes,

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.670
I can clearly see my project over here.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.840
So that's all we are all set in the next video.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.640
We'll finally start building the app and proceed with creating components.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.650
See you that
