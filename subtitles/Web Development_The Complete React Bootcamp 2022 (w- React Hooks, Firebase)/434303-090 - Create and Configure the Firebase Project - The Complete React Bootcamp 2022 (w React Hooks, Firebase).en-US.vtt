00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
Hey,

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.670
in this video,

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.900
we're going to create a new firebase project and edit to our application.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.810
Let's go.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.270
So let's open Google.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.400
And here let's type fire base.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.040
Then let's open first your L and we will end up on fire base.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.410
Official webpage.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.070
Since Fire Base is part off Google Cloud platform,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.790
Google manages everything.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.480
It means that we don't need to create a new account or something.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.250
If we have a Google account,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.460
which I guess everybody does,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.210
then we will associate our Google account with Firebase Project.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.810
So let's click on Get Started and here we click on Add New Project.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.110
Then we're gonna specify new project name,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.580
which is going to be chat Web app.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.690
Let's say then let's click on Continue.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.920
Then let's disable Google Analytics.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.150
We don't actually need it.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.450
And let's wait a few minutes until our project is created.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.340
Okay,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.700
good.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.740
Seems like project is ready.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.950
Let's continue.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.720
Then we end up on fire base dashboard.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.130
So from here we will manage everything.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.180
And as you can see,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.910
we are currently on the spark plan,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.480
so it means we will not get charged for anything.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.990
All right,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.550
now we need to add our Web application to our firebase project.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.580
So let's click on this settings button and then choose project settings.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.130
Then,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.950
here at the bottom,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.600
we will see our APS from here.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.480
Let's click on this lab application,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.770
and then let's enter the name for our app,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.600
which is going to be,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.970
Let's say,

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.880
just chat and let's not set up firebase hosting.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.510
Let's click on Register.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.290
It will also take a few seconds,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.240
and right now our application is ready.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.590
Let's click on,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.130
Continue to counsel.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.650
Now we need to set up services that we will use inside our application.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.350
So first,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.760
let's set up database.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.040
So let's click on it.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.970
And on this page we are able to set up either cloud fire Store or real time data base,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.530
so make sure you don't use cloud Fire Store.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.620
You use a real time database here at the bottom,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.650
so let's click,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.880
create database and let's select start in locked mode so all of our rules will be looked

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.410
down.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.990
OK,

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.350
so let's enable it,

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.390
and it will take a few seconds just to create a new database for us.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.950
All right,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.250
it is done.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.230
Now we need to also set up storage for our app.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.250
So let's click on it and then get started.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.430
It will ask us for rules.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.650
Let's click next.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.430
Then we need to select location for our storage.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.030
It is very important and it really influences this speed,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.780
so just select the nearest one to you.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.220
For me,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.060
it is something,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.670
I guess,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.440
with Europe.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.750
So I select Europe West three.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.030
Then I click Dung and it will take a few seconds to create a new story for us.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.550
Let's wait.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.170
Okay,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.720
Perfect.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.540
Seems like storage is ready.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.110
Our final thing is to set up authentication for our application.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.090
So let's click authentication here.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.100
We don't have any signed up users.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.510
For now,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.560
let's click on Sign and Method,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.340
and from here we can see all signing providers that we can use.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.480
We will not use email,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.250
and password will use only Google and Facebook.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.070
So first,

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.170
let's click on it.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.050
And then let's just click enable just like that.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.840
So let's select support and email and then project public facing name.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.600
Let's maybe said something like chat,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.480
app and let's click safe,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.300
and after that it will configure everything automatically.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.400
We don't need to worry about anything.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.690
Google Sinan is already enabled.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.870
Now what about Facebook?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.000
Log in So let's click on it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.780
And from here we will not have any automatic configuration.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.450
We need to do it manually.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.490
So let's click on enable here.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.870
We need to fill in APP,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.220
idea app secret.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.650
And we need to use this.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.660
Redirect your l So what do we need to do inside Google?

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.350
We need to type Facebook developer.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.580
Then we're gonna go to Facebook for developers.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.230
And here on this page at the top,

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.160
we will click on my APS and from here we're going to click on Create APP,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.970
lets selected.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.740
And this play name is going to be something like charts just shot wept.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.170
All right then let's click on Create app I d.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:45.310
Then let's perform security check submitted and ah were Facebook application will be

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.880
created.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.060
So from here what we need to do we need to go to settings,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.300
then go to basic And here we will find our app I d and up secret.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.150
Let's call p app I d and then pace it over here.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.100
Then we need to also get our app secret.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.750
Let's click on show and let's call it as well and paste it here inside fire base.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.380
And also we need to add this.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.070
Redirect your l here,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.060
let's copy it.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.390
Then let's save our changes.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.190
And here under Prokes,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.450
let's click on plus Sign.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.380
So when we click on it,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.420
we need to to select Facebook.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.890
Look and let's click on Set up.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.310
And then we need to select that we will able to log in on Web,

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.090
then site your l.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.650
I don't know.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.500
Just put something that really doesn't matter.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.290
Actually,

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.710
no,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.720
we don't need this.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.350
Let's click on settings because we already have Facebook.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.360
Logan at it It was just quick start from Facebook team.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.660
So here for these valid Redirect your else we need to add this your l that we have on fire

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.070
base.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.390
So just make sure that it is here.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.390
So now it is edit.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.260
Let's click on save changes.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.540
And now our Facebook application is ready.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.340
So let's save it.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.250
And now our Facebook in configure it and we configure it everything inside firebase website

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.250
.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.210
Now we can actually add it to our code.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.490
So let's get back to V s code and from here.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.580
Let's open our terminal first.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.900
Think we need to do we need to install Global Seelye from fire base.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.760
So for this,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.430
let's type NPM install Dash G firebase tools and install it.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.810
I already have it on my machine,

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.620
so I'm not gonna install it twice after that.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.650
When we have this firebase tools,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.240
we need to type fire base in it and that's all.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.060
After that,

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.380
it will prompt you.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.630
Authorize yourself,

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.450
please complete the instructions.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.660
And after that,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.560
when I run this command,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.640
I will see this see light in work.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.610
So I'm ready to proceed.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.320
Yes.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.970
Then I need to select services that I want to initialize.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.930
So I need only database.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.620
So I navigate with arrows and I select with space and also I need hosting Onley.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.650
Those two don't select storage.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:16.430
So then I hit Enter Then I will choose use an existing project and then I'm going to select

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.450
chat Web app that I just created.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.060
I selected what file should be used for later waste rolls.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.660
Let's hit just enter than what public directory I want to use instead of public.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.800
Let's type built and then I want to configure my app as a single page application.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.520
That's true.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.610
So let's click.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.090
Yes,

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.270
and built index HTML already exists over,

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.710
right?

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.160
Yes.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.200
I want you override.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.030
All right now.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.250
Fire base is associative.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:52.500
Let's say our remote project that we just created that one associated with our local

00:07:52.500 --> 00:08:00.470
project we can see Firebase Jason Fire Besar See which contains our project I d than inside

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.250
database rules.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.050
We have our database rules and inside firebase Jason,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.560
we have our let's say project description.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.070
So for database rules are deployed from that file for hosting,

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.460
we have public folder,

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.450
which is built.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:22.820
Then we have ignore files that we will not deploy to firebase hosting and also rewrites.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.240
So do you remember when we tried to upload our project on hip hop?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.760
So when we refresh the page,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.620
we got not found.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:36.870
So this is because we have single page application and Firebase solves this problem by just

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.090
writing all the routes and configure it for single page rap.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.560
So we will not have any issues with that.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:43.960
All right,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.920
so that's it.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.910
Now we can actually install library into our project.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:49.640
So for that,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.840
let's just type in PM install firebase.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.740
And let's wait until it is done.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.470
All right,

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.040
we have firebase installed as a library.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:06.280
Now what we need to do under source folder let's create in your folder that we will name

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.500
MISC and here we're going to create a new file firebase dot gs.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.950
Here we will configure our fire base inside our app.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.000
So first think we need to do we need to go back to the website,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.040
then again go back to project settings.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.810
And if we scroll down from here,

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.430
we can find this firebase conflict.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.000
So let's copy that.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.960
And here we're going to create a new valuable let's say,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.960
just constant conflict and let's paste it just like that now capable.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.220
Also import firebase libraries.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:48.090
So we're gonna type import fire base from firebase app.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:55.020
It is important not to import from firebase because it will import the the whole library

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.460
and the whole library is really,

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.210
really big,

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.170
and it will add all files from it.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:06.150
So we make sure that we only imported firebase app that what we need to do we need to call

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:14.390
fire base dar initialize app and inside We need to vote our conflict file So let's put come

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:14.730
thick.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:21.490
And now this for initialize app returns as an instance off fire based application.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.630
So let's put it in a valuable let's assign it to,

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.030
let's say,

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.480
just app just like that.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.950
And we are ready to go now.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.890
Using this app valuable,

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.850
we are ready to access firebase services like up off ab native bees,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.350
Fire store function,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.140
messaging all of that.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:45.540
So but this is what we will do in the next video for how we are done.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.920
The one thing I want to do before we end this video,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.650
I want to commit our changes to get help.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.480
So let's forget at dot Then we're gonna put,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:05.760
get commit and we will say that initialized firebase project Something like that.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.780
All right,

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.640
Perfect.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.850
See you in the next one.
