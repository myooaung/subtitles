00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
Hey,

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.720
let's see if we need to pay something to use fire base.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.810
As for out,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.430
there are two plants available.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.040
Spark and blaze sparked plan is completely free and it comes with a few limitations.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.870
Police plan is pay as you go model.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.040
Both of them have very generals freakier And even if you're subscribed to blaze plan unless

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.100
your APP has a lot of active users,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.340
you will not pay anything for us to make sure that we will not get charged Spark plan is

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.950
okay.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.700
However,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.110
with the recent updates to your fire base and Google Cloud in order to use cloud functions

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.110
,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.530
we need to have blaze plan enabled for our project.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.790
But don't worry,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.040
but we'll get into that when we start with cloud functions.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.070
Until then,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.430
sparked plan is our choice For more details,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.750
please navigate to the pricing page to Avala everything yourself.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.790
All right,

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.940
I guess that's all what I wanted to cover for firebase in production.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.080
In the next video,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.460
we'll finalist started building our project.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.250
See you there
