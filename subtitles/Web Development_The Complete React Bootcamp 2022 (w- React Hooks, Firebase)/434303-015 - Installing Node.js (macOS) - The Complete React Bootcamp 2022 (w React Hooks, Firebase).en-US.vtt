00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
Hi, In this video,

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:05.790
I will show you how to install NodeJS on macOS. Let's go.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.990
As always, you go to Google first and type NodeJS,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.505
go to the first URL,

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:13.155
which is the official website,

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:15.615
then navigate to the downloads page

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.255
and click on MacOS installer.

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:20.940
The download will start automatically.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.980
Open the downloaded file.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.955
You will see the installation wizard click on Continue,

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:28.634
then accept the terms,

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:32.310
then verify the installation path and click Install.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.440
It will prompt you for your password and that's fine.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.595
Wait for no GS to install

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:40.085
right after the installation process,

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:42.380
you will have no GS and NPM in

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.575
your system to verify the installation.

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:47.120
Let's go to the terminal,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.740
go to lunch bad.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.440
Then search for terminal to verify

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.695
NodeJS type node dash V,

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:56.570
which stands for version.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.955
It should print the version you've installed.

00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:00.560
And in the same manner,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.930
we also need to verify NPM.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.385
So type npm dash v, and that's it.

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.750
See you in the next one.
