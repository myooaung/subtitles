00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850
Hey,

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.440
welcome In this video,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.630
we will create preview cards for shows and actors on the home page.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.650
Let's go.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.620
The first thing we will do under components,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.400
we're going to create two new south folders,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.550
show and actor.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.620
Inside this folders,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.070
we will put corresponding components and also will split our components into two different

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.490
types.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.220
So the first type is going to be the great component where we put all business logic and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.400
map elements.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.750
And second is the card component where we will display data.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.650
Let's go.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.700
Other components.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.420
I'm going to create two new files show grid,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:49.060
the G s and then show card Dodgy s and they both will be components.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.260
But for now,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.180
they will be just empty components but will define them later and the same procedure for

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.900
actors.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.120
So actor grid the ts it will be empty.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.240
And also actor card,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.260
the G s and also empty.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.970
Okay,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.350
good.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.980
Now that we have components,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.040
we can use them inside our render function inside Honda Gs.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.200
So here,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.340
instead of directly mapping elements over here,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.710
we will use components.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.950
So for show,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.090
we will pour show grid.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.200
And as you can see,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.700
I have this out or import intelligence.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.200
So if I press tap,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
it is being automatically imported at the top.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.250
And by the way,

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.560
if you don't have the intelligence like I do,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.870
that's because you probably didn't open your file that you want to import right now.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.760
So let's try.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.150
And also instead of this mapping,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:58.290
let's try and poor actor grit you can see now I have the intelligence and it is currently

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.720
opened.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.090
So let me close it.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.580
Let's get back to decode.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.300
And if I press control space for intelligence now,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.690
I don't have anything.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.740
I don't have outer import option,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.260
so I need to open it.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.210
So actor grid it is opened.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.290
Now again,

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.540
Control space Foreign Tallis since and I have the outer import option and that's it,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.530
that's how you can use outer importing Tallis,

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.860
since in ves coat.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.510
All right,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.690
so for those elements,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.470
we need to specify props to share data,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.970
so we will put on data and little past results inside.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.430
Then we have data for actors and also data results.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.540
Now let's go one by one.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.900
First,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.230
we have show grit inside show grid.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.750
We d structure data.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.410
And here inside this def bubble.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.810
Simply map this data to card components.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.250
So data dark map.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.700
And inside this call back,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.300
we will put the next logic.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.900
So here we can reference item and then just pour item dot showed up.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.380
Name item don't shoulder I d and so one.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.890
But we can d structure it to avoid repeating ourselves.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.550
So we will put show and what we will do.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.530
We will put our show grid choke hard component and for show card component.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.470
We need to also specify the key prop because we use it for mapping.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.810
And this key prop will not to be passed as a prop directly to this components.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.720
So it is safe to use it.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.500
So key is going to be show dot i d because it is unique than what should we specify.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.230
Here's the first.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.080
We need the idea itself.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.580
So we will put another prop for I d and specify show that idea.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.750
This is because when weekly on read more button,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.740
But we'll need the i d off off a show.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.450
All right,

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.980
then we need show name,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.040
which is going to be show dot Name that What else?

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.910
Doing it we need image.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.460
So image is going to be.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.660
And now let's take a look at our a p I.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.190
So here.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.080
What do we have?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.310
So for image,

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.210
we have medium and original But we need to be prepared that this image can be now so the

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.600
show might not have an image and it's normal.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.740
So what we will do,

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.400
we will ask if show dot image exists.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.780
Then we will use Show that image,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.240
doc medium as otherwise,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.760
we need to define the fallback image and the one that we will use.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.200
We can find it in Asa's folder.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.320
This not found not P and G.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:52.200
So let me copy this and I will open our project in file Explorer and under source,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.210
I will create new folder Oh,

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.770
I already have it images.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.640
And inside this images,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.930
I will put not found dot p and G.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:09.610
So now what we can do We can import this image and whatever is important is going to be the

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.900
path to that image.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.030
So we haven't used images before,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:20.920
So this is the weight how to use them so well the import aim port image.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:28.040
Let's say not found from Let's reference the path to this image.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.530
So we put it under images and then not found P and G.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.950
And now if we had an image tack inside our mark up like that,

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.070
so we need to specify the source.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.350
Prop for image,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.860
for the source prop.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.150
We would put this image not found,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.510
and this is basically what we're going to do.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.630
But inside the show card component,

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.370
all right?

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.980
So instead of show image medium,

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.030
we will poor image not found.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.570
And also at last,

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.550
we need a quick or short summary about this show.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.010
So if we look to our A p,

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.190
I,

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.170
we can see that summary is just summary.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.520
So summary is going to be show dot summary.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.350
All right.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.970
Perfect.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.760
Now let's define our show card component.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.490
Right now it is empty,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:26.450
but let's take a look at the Assets folder and let's open creating preview cars here we

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.280
confined to components,

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.950
show card and actor card.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:36.230
So let's copy show card component and let's put it to show card file.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.330
So what we are doing here?

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.720
So the first thing we did structure our props and then we transform summary a little bit

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.190
and I'll talk about it just in a minute.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.550
And then we have really simple markup.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.710
So we lack only the link component.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.790
Definitely import from react Router Dom.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.440
And now let's take a look.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.940
So first we have simple markup with the DIFC.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:12.230
Inside we have image for source with pacified image that we passed and then alter set to

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.740
show.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.750
Then we display H one,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.100
which is our show name.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.060
And then we have p summary us taxed.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.700
So this is what we're going to talk about in a second And then we have dif with link and

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.260
button elements,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:35.100
so link will lead us to show page Right now it is still undefined and we will take a look

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.200
at it in a moment.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.350
Let's take a look at summary s text.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:46.060
So if we inspect our a p I here we have summary and it is already prepared for us as html

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.460
Marco.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.360
We can see this p tax here so we don't want it.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.820
We only wants to get taxed and also be wants to get Let's a short summary and the summary

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.580
can be really,

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.300
really long.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.400
Let's say we only need 11th works.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.990
So this is why we need to transform it.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.070
So first we check if we have summary,

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.370
then we display this string.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.280
As otherwise we will set no description.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.760
So what we're doing here?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.550
So first we split our summary by empty spaces.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.690
So we end up with an array where every item is award.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.700
So array off words.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.670
Then we slice 1st 10 elements from this array.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.180
So we end up with only 1st 10 words.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:38.570
Then we transform this array back to string by joining this elements,

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.620
using the empty space.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.990
And right after that,

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.050
when we have our final result,

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:49.110
we simply replace all HTML tax with empty string.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.600
We simply remove them from district and we use regular expression for this,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.470
and regular expression is used to set the pattern.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.530
And if this pattern matches,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.910
then we just use whatever we want to use.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.460
In our case,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.200
it is replaced function,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.180
and in the end we append three dots.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.860
Now when we see it,

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.290
let's get back to our app.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:18.570
And if we search for girls now we can see the cards and everything seems called.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.830
We have image.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.650
We have show name and now we have this summary.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.750
As you can see,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.810
every summary has the length off 10 words.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.540
All right.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.500
And also we have this read more button read more element.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.060
And if we click on it,

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:39.970
we can see that we go to show and show I d the same what we specified here.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:40.700
Alright,

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.100
quote.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.470
Now let's finish it with actors.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:50.220
So inside actor grid will do exactly the same thing.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:10:00.500
So we will get data from here and here we will put a data dot map And now this way we d

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:09.580
structure person and we will use actor card and for actor card first think we will do We

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:17.500
will define the key So key is going to be person dot i d Then we don't need the idea itself

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.170
But what kind of data do we need?

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:25.880
So let's check it out in our a p I So let me replace shows with people.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.700
All right,

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.240
so what do we have?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:37.160
First we have name So let's pass Name is going to be person Don't name then we have country

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.400
and country,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:45.410
as you can see set to know But country can be also be an object with the name code and

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.060
times on.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:53.850
So we need to do the check so country is going to be person dot country.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:54.770
If we have it,

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.370
we will.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.850
This play person,

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:07.850
country dot name as otherwise it is going to be no All right then we have birthday and it

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.790
is fine to just path person dot birthday.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:21.840
Then we have Death Day and death is going to be also person Death day and at last we also

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.530
need gender and image.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:34.520
So gender is going to be gender is going to be person dot gender and image as before.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.620
In the same way,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:45.090
we will copy this logic and let's see So we will put this import at top and we will ask if

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.710
person has an image,

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.230
memorable display person image,

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:57.030
medium and the wise we will display image not found.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.670
All right,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.550
so degreed is ready now actor car And as before,

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:07.020
we will use the assets file and we will copy it from here.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.850
So let's paste and let's go one by one.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.320
So first with the structure,

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.600
the props and then we have simple markup with elements that we use.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:16.990
All right,

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.990
So first we have image as before.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.160
Then we have a Chuan where we display name.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.210
Then we display gender if it exists so if gender doesn't exist,

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.450
then we return.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:29.900
No,

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.550
it means that nothing will be rendered.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.570
Then we check if we have country.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.200
We say that comes from that country.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.310
Otherwise no country known and then we check against birthday.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.970
If birthday exists,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.680
then we poor Pitak with the born on that day.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.150
Otherwise we render nothing.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:58.900
And at last we show Death Day and if that they exist as a prop,

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.020
then we display the died on this date.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:02.990
Otherwise,

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.610
this person is a life.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.410
All right.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:05.730
Good.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.830
Everything seems clean.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:13.670
Now Let's get back to our code to our browser and let's check for shows again.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.710
So what's poor man?

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.490
And yet we have shows.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:25.610
Let's check for actors and terra Now we also have people displayed Perfect.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.750
So everything's fine.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.800
We have image.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.960
We have country we have alive or dad.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.250
We have also other things like gender.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.450
I'm born on this or that date.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.110
Okay,

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.440
so everything seems cool and everything works.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.250
Now let's finish this video and let's commit changes.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:52.280
So we will put Get at everything and get commit and,

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.030

00:13:53.030 --> 00:14:01.460
created preview cards for a P I for a P I data.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.870

Perfect.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:05.720
We're finished.
