00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
Hey,

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.800
welcome to the final step at Project Creation.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.620
Right now we are going to deploy our beautiful application online so we can share it with

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.340
our friends.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.060
Let go for deployment.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.170
We will use this service called Search Dog S H.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.980
And it is an amazing tool that allows us to publish our websites online with just one

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.030
single comment.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.060
And it is completely free.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.860
Let's go.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.350
So,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.910
as we can see from Maine documentation,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.560
we just need to install it as a global NPM package.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.650
So let me copy this command,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.650
and then I will paste it in my terminal and let's wait until it is installed in our system

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.650
.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.550
All right,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.710
The next thing we need to do,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.670
we need to do authorize ourselves to this service.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.650
So simply in our tournament,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.250
all we will type surge Le Guin,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.080
Then after that,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.920
if we don't have any account,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.000
it will prompt you for email and password.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.310
So since I already have an account,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.310
I'm gonna enter my credentials.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.150
But if you don't have any than just enter your email password and you will be registered.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.890
So let me enter my password.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.040
After that,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.930
I will be authorized and you will see this success message.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.560
All right,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.880
now we are able to deploy our website.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.440
But before we do that,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.520
let's run the bill script to prepare our deployment folder.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.130
So we gonna Ron mpm run built on.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.790
Let's wait until the build is finished.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.900
Awesome.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.560
Now we have built and everything is ready.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.410
Let's deploy the app.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:53.300
We simply need to type search and then the name of folder that we want to deploy So we will

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.320
type dissed.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.550
And after that,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.560
these seal I will prompt us for our domain that we want to use.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.600
So at the end,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.180
we need to always use search dot Shh because of the service is free.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.270
But for the some domain,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.970
we can use whatever we want.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.400
So let's name it teak talk game and then press enter after that the seal.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.440
I will do its stuff and deploy our website.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.930
So,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.350
as you can see published as Dichter game that search dot shh let's try and access this your

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.610
l on the Internet.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.210
So here I will pour take tag game that surge on doctor s age And as you can see,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.040
everything's fine and our application is online.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.830
Congrats to everyone.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.510
But as you may notice,

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.950
it says that it is not secure.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.440
So to fix that,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.020
simply access this.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.850
Your l with https and everything will be fine.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.170
Just like that.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.980
This service doesn't force to use https instead of http.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.050
That's why we have it.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.730
But still the point here that we have https.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.720
So again,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.180
congrats to everyone.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.270
I'm glad you finish this section.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.770
See you in the next one.
