00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi,

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.010
My name is Andrew.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.370
I'll be your instructor.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.420
Throw Dick Koers.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.810
Let me tell you about the requirements for this court to start working with react.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.420
First off,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.530
all knowledge off HTML and CSS is essential.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.650
I'll not be any extra attention explaining what dif tag is.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.400
The same goes for CSS.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.040
I expect you to know about classes and selectors but will not make any stops on explaining

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.680
HTML and CSS basics.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.410
But you can always ask questions in the Commons.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.680
There are definitely a few key moments off HTML and CSS,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.120
and that will be explained.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.150
But most of the time we will work with JavaScript.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.280
I don't expect you to be good a JavaScript or have some decent experience.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.980
I wanted to know about programming in general,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.430
you must understand basic things like what is available or a war is a four look.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.240
You'll get,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.070
you know up today.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.300
JavaScript syntax.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.270
During the course,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.450
it is quite user friendly heart to understand.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.970
Parts will be explained,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.480
so don't worry about that.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.320
There is also a special section dedicated Onley to JavaScript.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.570
It covers most important aspects off the language to ensure you know enough to start with

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.710
react rush,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.440
and I try to make everything as smooth as possible.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.610
But nevertheless,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.200
I wanted to ask as many questions as you can.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.890
And don't be shy asking silly questions were always there to help you.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.400
Let's quickly summarize.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.470
You must be aware off html CSS and some general programming knowledge.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.330
That's it.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.850
See you in the next video.
