00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.330
hallow.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.080
Our first video is going to be about react.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.210
Portals and portals is just a way Teoh.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.610
Render something with react outside off def with ideal fruit.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.370
What I mean,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.580
if we open our chat application and if we inspect our elements,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.470
we know that all off our elements,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.070
all of our components,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.700
our app goes under this dif with idea wrote right,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.390
However,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.490
let's take a look when we open a model window where it will be rendered.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.700
So if I opened this through eight new chat room,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.390
you can see that here at the bottom.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.810
I have this def role dialogue,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.350
and if I open it and if I inspect,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.910
you can see that actually,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.550
my model new Chatham is being rendered outside off this route.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.160
So this is what portals are used for.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.570
This is useful for something like model windows or tool tips or hovers.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.320
I don't know anything that must be renter it outside off main component treat.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.950
This is very useful when we deal with Z Index CSS property.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.610
So let's never get back to documentation and let's look through examples here you can read

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.540
words that I just told you have ever by looking on this example,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.000
it might be too complicated to understand what is going on.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.730
So instead of copying,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.240
pacing,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.000
thes class motile from documentation,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.550
let's open our code.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.540
I already Iran the application and other components.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.340
Let's create new file model.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.610
Let's create a new component.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.720
And here,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.050
instead of returning this Dave from documentation,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.900
we can see that we're able to use react,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.000
don't create portal method.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.180
So instead of this def,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.200
let's return.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.160
Create portal and it will be automatically imported for us.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
And if I open parties,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.310
as I can see that here I have Children and then element All right,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.970
container.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.870
So for Children,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.220
we will put Children that will will pass to this mortal component.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.760
So here I will destruct your Children.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.710
And then I will pass it to create Porto than our container.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.000
Must be another div that trouble define inside index html.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.880
So here we already have this different with idea Satu Road.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.980
Now let's create another day if that will be a container for our model windows.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.460
All right,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.950
so here we will create Dave and I d will be model route.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.540
Let's save it and inside model togs.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.520
If we open documentation,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.200
we can get it using document.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.320
Get element by i.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.700
D.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.550
So let's copy that one.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.080
Let's put it here at the top and to create portal as a second argument,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.740
we will pass moral route.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.450
Okay,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.150
Perfect.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.210
Now let's save it.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.930
And it says that react is declared.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.640
Never used.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.070
All right,

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.350
so maybe let's remove it.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.370
Now let's open.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.300
Maybe signing page.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.350
And here,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.230
let's render this welcome to chat.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.080
Let's run their visit if inside our model window.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.250
So here we're gonna put model imported from our file that we created,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.290
not from our suit.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.250
So let's remove this import,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.350
and I want to import it from our file.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.770
All right.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.110
Seems like it imports from our suit.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.060
Let's import it manually from components model.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.250
Perfect.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.790
So inside this model,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.760
we will put our def with text center.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.110
Now,

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.120
if we never get back to our app If we sign out now,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.850
you can see that welcome.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:53.080
Chad is located and the bottom And if I go to elements and if I inspect my dumb tree here

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.880
at the bottom,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.430
I can see mortal route.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.880
And inside this model route,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.450
we confined our welcome to chair under text center.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:09.670
So this is a This is used in your eye libraries like our CLR for model windows and for tool

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.090
tips.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.950
For example,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.450
if we had to create,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.570
they react application without using tear I library and we had to implement motile window.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.940
Most likely we would use react portals because they're rendered outside off our main

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.900
confident treat.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.850
You can find it more practical Onley when you get into it on a real world example.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.650
That's fine if you don't completely understand.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.570
But trust me,

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.400
this is the key concept that you must at least know.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.070
Okay.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.930
Thank you.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.250
See you in the next one.
