00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.190
Hey,

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:01.990
in the last video,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.640
when we talked about component properties,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.840
I forgot to mention one important thing.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.670
Let's suppose that we use component in a not self closing manner.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.840
We use it like that.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.080
So let's put square and imagine if we put something inside.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.540
Markup four,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.670
maybe a taxed,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.190
whatever goes inside.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.210
And now the question is,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.780
how can we access this structure from inside the competent definition?

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.400
First,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.750
let me replace de structuring with the just props.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.500
And then instead of value,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.250
I will pour props.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.070
Not well you.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.900
And now let's council lock the props and let's see,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.090
what do we have in our application?

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.350
So right now,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.220
as you can see,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.240
we have value value value.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.740
But for one of the squares,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.920
we have Children and you key in our object.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.850
And this Children key represents this internal structure or whatever we pass inside the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.560
component.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.050
So whatever goes here can be accessed from inside the component with the Children prop.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:22.850
So now we can back again to the d structuring and let's port Children over here to access

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.040
the structure.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.500
So right now it doesn't make any sense that we put it inside.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.650
But we can render this Children by referencing it here.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.820
So now that we have access instead of value,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.750
we can put Children and whatever these Children are will be rendered inside this button.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.150
So let's check it out.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.970
And as you can see,

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.680
for all of our bottoms,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.650
we have nothing.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.070
But we're one where we passed these Children.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.530
We have this market over here,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.290
and if we inspect it and let's look inside.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.430
So inside this button we have exactly the same html that we passed to this component.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.310
And that's it.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.070
Thank you.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.190
And I will see you in the next one.
