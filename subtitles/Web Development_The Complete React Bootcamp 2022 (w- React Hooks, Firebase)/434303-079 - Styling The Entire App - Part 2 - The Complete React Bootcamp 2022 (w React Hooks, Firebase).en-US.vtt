00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
Hey there,

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.700
Right now,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.800
we're going to continue with styles and by the end of this video we will have the complete

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.700
application.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.610
Let's go.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.890
The first thing quibble do We will open finishing all styles Part two and as always,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.340
we will go one by one.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.850
First we have home style GS.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.610
Let's copy all of the content and then let's create this file.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.440
So under pages we will create home styled GS.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.650
And here we will paste everything we've Koppett now at the top,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.200
we're going to import styled from styled components.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.220
And now let's start replacing our elements.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.790
So inside home Gs for this input,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.680
we will put short input.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.650
It is going to be our George Bark.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.460
So let's replace it like that.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.340
And then our second element is going to be radio inputs rapper So it is intended for

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.660
visited that wraps both off the labels.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.050
So radio inputs rapper just like that.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.960
Then if we take a look inside radio inputs rapper,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.210
we have another deep over here.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.570
So for each of the labels,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.250
we will put another rapper which is going to be dear,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.150
just like that for the 1st 1 and the same we will do for second label.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.540
All right,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.350
seems good.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.960
Now.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.970
Our last element here will be short Botton rapper.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.790
So let's put it around this button element search and button dropper.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.760
Then that's safe,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.410
and it seems like it hasn't been important.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.420
Let's use intelligence.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.080
All right,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.550
let's safe and let's get back to the APP.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.570
And right now,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.260
if I refresh everything,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.020
seems style,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.020
everything school,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.050
unlike our radio buttons because it takes extra steps to styles them.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.000
Do you actually create custom radio buttons?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.210
We need to create our own custom component to reuse logic.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.980
So what we're going to do under components,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:18.500
we will put custom radio GS and capable define our styled custom radio.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.080
All right,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.250
so what we will do?

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.580
We will copied this label that we have from here.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.870
Then we will put it here for now.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.050
Let's say with and leave it like that,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.080
what we're going to do right now,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.010
we will define how we're going to use our custom radio.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.490
So let's put custom radio over here and let's take a look.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.610
Have a bill passed our props.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.800
So first of all,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.780
we will pass,

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.320
I devalue,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.950
checked and on change.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.450
We will not pass type radio because all of our radio buttons will share it.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.250
So common props will define inside custom radio component.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.760
So we gonna pass,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.680
I d value checked and own change.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.720
Let's copy it and let's put it inside Custom Radio.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.620
Now what else doing it?

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.400
We need label so less pass it as another prop.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.320
So label is going to be shows for this radio element,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.050
all right,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.120
and it seems like we are done.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.330
Let's remove the old label element and let's save it.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.940
Now let's open our component and let's de structurally props.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.230
So what do we have?

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.330
We have labeled?

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.970
And then we have other props and other props that we pass through these custom radio must

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.500
be,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.160
Let's say,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.350
redirected to this input radio.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.450
So what we're going to do instead of disrupting properties one by one Over here we can use

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.490
arrest operator to group them under one object.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.190
So let's put three dots and then arrest props.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:02.220
And now whatever we pass to this custom radio component will be available under arrest.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.690
Props object that we can spread over the input element.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.790
So what we will do let's call it.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.550
And instead of I d value checked and on change,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.130
we will put spread operator and leave it like that.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.530
So what is going to do?

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.640
So in this case,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.790
it will kind of redirect properties all properties except label to this input element.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.620
And it is important to port type radio after this spread operator,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.100
because if let's say we pass type text,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.810
it will be over written by this type radio because it goes next to it.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.600
So if we pass type radio right before the spread operator on,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.440
then we pass type text.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.050
These type text over here will overwrite type radio,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.550
so it is important to keep the order over here.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.380
All right,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.000
Now,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.580
what else do we need to do?

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.200
Since we pass label,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.210
we actually will put it right before the input element.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.900
And also for HTML four instead of using shows,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.730
search will port rest props dot i d.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.720
Because it is going to be one off our props and that we will bus right.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.580
Seems like it works.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.600
Now let's opened the assets file,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.650
and here we will copy radio Rapper.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:36.630
So let's copy it from here and then inside custom radio right before the components,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:44.450
we will put this styled radio rapper and also we will import styled from styled components

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.450
.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.300
And now what we will do.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.790
We will use this radio rapper instead of this label because it is styled Label over here.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.470
So let's replace it.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.030
And now what we will do if we take a look inside the CSS markup.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.950
We also have this spawn element over here,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.220
and in order for custom radio to work,

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.490
we need to pour just empty a span after input.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.760
Let's save it.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.400
And now let's replace the second label element as well.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.390
So we're gonna put this custom radio just like that,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.330
and we will copy this.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.090
I devalue checked and unchanged from this radio,

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.970
and we will simply replace it just like that.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:38.600
And also we need to put actors label instead of shows label and let's get rid of the old

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.120
label.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.950
Now let's save it and let's take a look at our application.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.490
So,

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.920
as you can see now,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.750
we have styled radio buttons and they work All right,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.540
perfect.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.760
So congrats.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.550
We finished the app.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.650
Everything styled and looks perfect.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.500
Let's commit our changes before we move on to the deployment pile.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.110
So I'm gonna put get at everything and then we will do,

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.400
get,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.160
commit.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.950
And then we will pour styled for the entire AP.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.270
All right?

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.910
Congrats.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.190
Finishing the up in the next video,

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.300
we will talk about deployment.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.350
See you there.
