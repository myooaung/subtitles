00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910
Hey there,

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.620
in this video,

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.100
we're gonna create Lee out for chattering page that we can see on the right instead of this

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.100
.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.570
Hello?

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.360
Let's go.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.040
Let's navigate back to decode.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.020
And here under Components folder,

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.700
let's greet and your folder and that we will name Shatt Window inside.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.670
We're going to create three new more folders and each one will represent every part off

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.310
this page.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.250
So we're gonna have first Folder is going to be messages.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.300
Then we gonna pour top and bottom like that,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.940
an inside a bubble place,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.730
all corresponding components.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.420
So inside bottom,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.470
let's put index togs and it will be empty for now than the same we will do for the rest.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.250
So here we're gonna put index togs,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.510
but a name it messages that we're gonna put messages inside,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.660
Let's save it and close.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.350
And our latest component is going to be this talk.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.710
So let's create another index togs.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.110
And let's put the top with the top text insight.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.910
All right,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.250
let's save it and let's navigate to chat page.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.040
So here,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.250
inside this def,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.350
let's pour another def.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.450
That will be a rapper for Chat Top,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.230
and we will import it just in a second.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.510
Then we're gonna pour another Dave.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.050
And inside we will put messages and the same.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.660
We will apply for Chad bottom,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.660
all rights and for each of these Daves.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.570
If we open main daughter a CSS.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.370
Here we have classes chart top,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.460
Chad bottom and shot middle.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.370
So let's use them for top level Porter chat Top four messages.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.150
We will put a chap middle and for But,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.340
um,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.870
we're gonna put class name Chad bottom.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.820
All right,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.060
now,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.920
let's import these components.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.040
So first,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.410
let's import chat.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.050
Tell up from Let's navigate two components,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.390
chat window and top.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.340
Then I'm gonna copy three times.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.680
Then I'm going to use bottom and messages,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.750
and then I will replace them with the chat bottom and messages.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.210
All right,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.500
Looks good.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.420
Let's take a look.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.630
So now if with a fresh we can see,

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.050
we have top messages and bottom and let's remove this wrapping,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.580
def.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.450
And let's take a look one more time.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.990
Now we have top messages and bottom at the very bottom.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.370
All right,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.660
good.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.650
Now let's define our initial logic for chatroom page.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.900
So first of all,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.210
let's grab this Chad I D.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.320
From our perimeters as you remember inside home page with pacified it as just chat I d.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.380
So let's grab from use programs hook that we can use using react rotor package.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.050
And then we can grab all off our rooms that we have inside the context as you remember.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.090
So let's use use rooms hook that we created earlier.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.050
And now let's actually get our current room data.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.310
So what do we need to do?

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.900
First of all,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.160
we need to check against this room's because it can be no by default,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.980
as you remember.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.400
So let's ask if rooms do not exist or if this value is now,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.150
then we're gonna pour law order component that comes from our suit.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.160
And again it will be centered vertically as before.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.340
It will have medium size.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.800
It will have content loading and speed is going to be slow.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.330
All right.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.850
Our next step is going to get our current room from this room's a rate.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:46.620
So let's port const Current room is going to be rooms dot find we will get room item.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.170
Then we're gonna ask from i d equals chat.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.750
I d.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.350
All right.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.970
And then at the end,

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.750
if we don't have current room.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.500
So if we put a random your l that does not exist inside this room's array,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.590
then we're going to return H six element with the class name,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.560
text center and margin top page.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.730
That will say,

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.490
Chad,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.580
I d not found.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.140
All right.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.860
Looks good.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.910
Let's remove this,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.520
Lauder.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.290
Let's move this import to the top.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.050
Let's save.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.030
Let's take a look.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.340
So charred,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.970
This one not found.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.520
All right,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.610
I'm run here.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.280
Let me put negation in front of it.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.610
So now it will work.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.130
All right,

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.050
So we have talked messages bottom.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.650
And if we put a random shrink over here,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.580
but we'll get shot not found.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.020
Okay,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.670
Perfect.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.280
So this is it for this video in the next video,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.880
I would like to talk about context problems and why it is a bad idea to directly use use

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.160
rooms,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.460
hook.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.940
Let's commit our changes and finish that one.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:59.340
So let's at everything you get system that we're gonna commit our message and we will say

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.590
created Klay,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.510
our four charred page.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.400
All right,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.800
good.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.030
See you in the next one.
