00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940
Hey,

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.150
let's quickly explore Fire Base and its services.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.990
For this video,

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.860
I opened fire based Dashboard off our final project Here.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.640
We can monitor and manage every service that we use inside a firebase project.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.560
We could manage multiple APS.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.540
There can be multiple lap APs,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.850
and that will share the same database.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.270
Or if we had Android,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.580
IOS and Web applications,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.790
we could manage all of them from single dashboard on the left.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.000
Inside sidebar.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.130
Under develop,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.600
you can see a list off Main Firebase services.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.910
Let's go one by one.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.990
A syndication.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.980
With the service,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.050
we are able to log in and authenticate users across our applications.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.950
This is really cool because,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.970
let's say if we look in with Google on website and later on,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.720
we look into the android application with the same account,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.680
data will be the same.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.080
There are lots of different sign and methods available for us,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.790
and the thing is that all of them are configurable.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.650
It was just a few clicks.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.710
This service is complete.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.830
It has built in a mail system that handles all email verifications and recess.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.570
We need you only customize the template off the email.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.120
Also,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.480
it supports SMS verification,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.410
which is also really cool.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.010
Then goes database.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.030
Firebase has to data basis asked for now Fire store and riel time database.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.010
They both are Jason based no sequel databases with support for real time updates.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.810
What's the difference and which one to use?

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.830
It depends on many factors,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.330
but here are there three key differences.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.060
First,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.100
pricing model Fire store is charged per operation.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.460
Read,

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.850
write,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.360
delete or update.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.290
This is no good for high frequency data writes Real time Database has more suited for this

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.680
as it is charged for storage and bandwidth,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.270
which is the perfect use case for something like a child application.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.750
Second Queries.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.530
Fire Story gives us more advanced and compound queries compared to real time database So

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.080
real time data base has really poor query builder,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.520
but it is good enough to manage not to complicated database structures.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.380
Third structure they both are Jason based Fire Store has documents,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.460
collections and sub collections,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.650
which make database more robust.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.520
Real time data base is just one large Jason object.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.390
That's why it has quirk very support and most of the time we need to de normalize a k a

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.210
duplicate data for our project.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.810
We will use real time database because we will have a lot of Faried and write operations.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.410
And we did not require complex queries.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.650
If it wasn't a chat application,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.470
I would have peaked Fire store as it has more sophisticated queries and data base structure

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.470
.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.360
Also,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.480
we are not limited to use on Lee one database.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.120
We can combine both fire store and real time data base in one single application.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.850
Then we have storage.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.190
Nothing too special.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.850
Over here.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.130
Here bubble Porter,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.650
user images and audio files Firebase hosting here.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.660
We're going to deploy our website.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.960
It only supports static files.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.710
So if we have a server side rendering application,

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.200
this hosting will not work.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.750
Cloud functions in our application were also able to write custom back and inform off

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.630
server last cloud functions that can be called from inside the coat.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.200
We're going to deploy only one that will send notifications to users.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.820
We will talk more about server last when we will get into the topic machine.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.160
Lauren,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.990
get amazing tool that provides machine learning utilities such as image recognition and the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.550
others.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.380
But unfortunately it is only available for IOS and Android APS at the bottom.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.010
We have other services.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.820
They all are supplementary and used for monitoring and analyzing deployed applications.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.480
We can manage performance off our website,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.950
how fast it lows and some other metrics.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.750
We can even integrate Firebase Analytics,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.230
which is basically Google Analytics but wrapped as a firebase service and the very bottom

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.570
we confined services to engage users for our project.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.970
We will use only firebase cloud messaging that will allow us to send real time

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.340
notifications to users if browser has support for it.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.340
And that's basically it.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.950
This was high level overview off fireplace.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.810
But what about security?

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.940
Is it secure enough?

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.750
We will find out that in the next media see you there.
