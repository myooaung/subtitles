00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
Hey,

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.470
welcome in this video,

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.690
we will talk about Styled components as an alternative to style.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.780
Our application style components allow us to create components from styles,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.870
and the most important feature off cell components is that the component that we create has

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.620
styles scoped to these component.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.150
They will not be shared across the global scope.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.930
I like with traditional way off styling with CSS files.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.230
So let's install it and inspect.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.170
So I'm gonna open my char terminal,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:44.470
and I will do NPM install styled components while it is installing Let's Open the Assets

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.360
Folder and here we confined inter itude styled components.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.030
Let's open this file and let's copy 1st 2 files index html and index CSS.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.830
So here we will pour this inside index html.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:09.060
Let's open public and let's put it here right before the end of hat and bubble removed all

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.780
of that and leave it like that.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.000
Now inside index,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.870
he assess,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.030
we will put this so instead of body and code,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.280
we will put just this and that's it.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.070
No,

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.180
Our next thing is to use style components,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.090
So let's run our application and PM Ron start and what we will do under components,

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.840
we're going to create one you file,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.230
which we will name styled GS.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.040
Inside,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.210
we will pour our styled components.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.380
So here what we will do little import styled from styled components.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.160
So to create a component,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.430
we simply need to create a new available.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.890
So,

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.730
Const.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:00.850
Let's say we want to create a component that will be a wrapper around give and it will have

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.460
flex markup.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.460
So we will have a great so we can name this component as flex grid and then we will put

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.490
styled.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.580
Then we need to put dot and from in Tallis,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.130
since we can pick any HTML elements that we want to style.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.520
So let's say it is going to be a development than right after that.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.680
We need to open back ticks and inside these back ticks,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.100
we can pour any valid CSS or SAS market.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.170
So let it be Div,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.830
with display set to flex than let's say we want to justify content center.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.640
And also flax rap is going to be set to rap now how we can use it.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:57.530
Let's first export it and let's open our great component and what we will do instead of

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.560
this rapper Deve.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.230
We will put this flag secret component,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.050
and it is just a wrapper around,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.570
def.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.760
It will still be dif but with styles.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.650
So let's import from styled.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.530
And let's specify So this is flex grit.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.550
Now we can use it inside our mark up,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.780
just like so if I save it.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.950
And if I go back to my app If I had a fresh if I look for shows,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.300
I can see that I have grid.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.050
And if I inspected,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.830
let's take a look at the rapper element.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:40.690
So as you can see,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.150
this element has this class name styled components and then goes,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.940
sounded else.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.780
So under the hood style components,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.050
this library created a unique class on Lee for this component only for this element.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.590
This is why styles will not be shared across the global scope.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.410
This is why it is so cool.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.910
And this is really important.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.760
All right,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.620
now,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.530
let's also specify this flags grit for our other great component,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.240
which is actor grit.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.350
And here we will also do flex grit.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.340
Okay,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.100
Perfect.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.540
Now let's check it out.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.250
If I look for actors.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.360
Yep.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.550
I have the grit.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.330
All right,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.040
amazing.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.650
Now let's define and mother styled component,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.250
which we will name Serge Cart.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.670
And it is going to be also styled Deve.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.690
We will open back ticks and the markup that we will put for this sort card.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.900
We will get it from this assets file.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.430
So let's copy it and let's put it here inside.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:00.280
So what we're doing we define a few simple properties than we define class than some other

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.600
elements and so on.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.170
And the cool thing.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.020
As I said before,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.740
because these styles are local,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.770
you are not always want to use class names.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.860
So for this reason,

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.190
you can directly reference elements instead of classes.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.990
But sometimes we still do need classes,

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.800
so that's why we're using them.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.620
All right,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.880
so now inside show card instead of this wrapping element,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.370
we can put Sarge card.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.890
So let's put search card.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:39.350
And also let's import it import search card from styled.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.770
All right,

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.420
let's check it out if I look for something,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.210
Yeah,

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.630
but it's not ready yet because he was specified image rapper class,

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.610
so we need to poor class name for this day.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.250
If you made Rapper now,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.250
let's check it out Yep.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.900
Indeed.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.040
Now we have the beauty perfect.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.310
But there at one more thing with style components.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:12.240
What if we have multiple components that share some common markup CSS mark up,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.820
but we don't want to repeat ourselves Using style components,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.350
we can extend styles from one component to other.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.800
So what I mean is that let's actually create one more file under show Fuller,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.950
which we will name show card styled GS,

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.500
incurable poor styled components related to show card component.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.490
So here will import styled from styled components.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:47.570
And we will specify something like export const maybe styled show card and it is going to

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.370
be styled.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.500
But this time we will not use dot syntax.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.570
We will pour parent cases,

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:59.960
and here we need to specify the style component that we want to extend styles from.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.480
So here we need to first import it.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:10.010
So I'm gonna import from styled and we will extend styles from George Cart.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.030
So we will import search card,

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.990
and inside this part of Jesus,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.470
we will put search cart.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.490
Then again,

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:22.710
we will open back ticks and inside this back takes whatever we poor will be sat on top off

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.030
the existing styles off search card component.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.950
Pretty awesome.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:33.390
So now let's open the assets file and here we confined Styled show card.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.690
Let's copy the CSS mark up,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:44.320
Let's put it here and let's use that one instead of just sorge card inside Show Car GS.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.650
So here we will replace it with Styled Serge Show card.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.860
Okay,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.870
Styled search card.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.800
Who will import it from show card style and also seems,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.370
would define Dodge Batons class.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.700
We need to put it here.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.310
So,

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.320
buttons,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.650
Let's save it.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:16.350
Let's get back to our app Let's look for something and Tara Now we have our beauty.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.200
We have great and we have styles for our carts.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.290
Pretty amazing.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.200
But now we need to do exactly the same thing for our cars,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.050
for shows.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.350
So what do we do inside actors?

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.240
Inside Actor folder.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:40.030
We will pour actor card dot styled does Gs and here he is in exactly the same approach as

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.930
inside show carded styled togs.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.900
We will pour instead off styled show card.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:55.590
We will open the assets while and we will copy styled actor card and we will export it.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.760
And as you can see,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.870
this is very simple.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.890
Just defining one more class inside.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:14.590
So inside actor card we will use styled actor cart and also let's Imported from Styled

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.850
Actor card.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.010
And that's it.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.980
We are ready to go.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.150
Let's check it out.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.640
Let me search for James.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.110
If I select actors now,

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.290
I can see that it works.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:35.210
But we don't have in major being prepared because we didn't pulls the major rapper Kyl s

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.410
over here now.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.650
And also because we didn't specify the death they class.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.240
So for this Pitak,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.450
we will put that day and that's it.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.210
Let's take a look one more time.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.340
And as we can see now,

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.060
we have the complete styling for our carts.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:54.910
Perfect.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:59.230
I hope you liked it because I'm really excited to use this library.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:09:59.960
All right,

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.950
let's commit our changes and finish this video,

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.080
so I will put it,

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.750
get at dot and then get commits,

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:18.490
installed styled components and created styles for search cards.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.950
Okay,

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.220
for Frank,

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.910
everything's in spying.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.450
See you in the next one
