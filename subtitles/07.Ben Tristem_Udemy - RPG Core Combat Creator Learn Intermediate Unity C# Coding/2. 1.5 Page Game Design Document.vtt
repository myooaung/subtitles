00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.650
Hello again my friend in this video.

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.860
We're gonna start our one point five page game design document.

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.600
That's what GTD stands for.

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.490
I'm gonna give you a template so that you can start working on your own game design and come up with

5
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.430
your own ideas for how cool your game can be.

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.870
And eventually we'll get to the point where it looks something like this which is what my game design

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.150
is.

8
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.050
So let us start off by making a point that RPG game design unlike many other type of game design is

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.580
a real battle between your epic imagination and your realistic limitations.

10
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.800
So I know that you've got tons of ideas you've played a lot of games you've got a lot of cool features

11
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.320
and stories and characters.

12
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.350
So you've got a lot there.

13
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.530
I know that but also you have realistic limitations in that maybe you're working solo it's just you

14
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.630
maybe you've teamed up with a friend maybe you're not very good at art perhaps you're still learning

15
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.800
programming this some things that you can or can't do so you want to think about cool stuff but keep

16
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.850
it realistic in the way you do that is by thinking big.

17
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.360
By all means but start small and then build on that and build on that and build on that.

18
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.190
So start back by creating a simple game play moment what Sam and I are doing we're starting off just

19
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.120
by getting our character to run around and to hit enemies and we can take damage and they can take damage

20
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.320
and we just want that moment to be interesting and and a good experience for the player and fun basically.

21
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.430
So that's why we're studying.

22
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.790
And then we add on top of that and add on top of that.

23
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.280
And in this particular lecture the challenge I've got for you is to set your creative direction even

24
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.110
if you're going to be following along exactly with what Sam and I are doing.

25
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.490
I want you to think about what your game could be.

26
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.260
What would you be excited about creating.

27
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.540
So I want you to complete the first section of the one point five page GTD which I'm gonna go through

28
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.980
in a moment.

29
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.550
So we'll go through it together.

30
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.720
But I'm just letting you know this is what I'm expecting your output will be in this video.

31
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.060
And I'm also hoping that you'll add a couple of images that summarize what your game is about and create

32
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.010
a simple one line summary of your game.

33
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.640
So that's what we're gonna get done by the end of this video and this stage you might be saying but

34
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.400
where do I even start Rick.

35
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.250
What do I do.

36
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.720
Okay.

37
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.490
The first place to start is get inspiration by looking at other games and playing specific features

38
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.350
or mechanics or aspects from that game.

39
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.520
So this is Diablo 3 and the diablo 1 2 3 and 4 in the future series just amazing we love the there's

40
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.010
tons of enemies coming at you that there's just a big smash fest going on you level up your character

41
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.630
you get new abilities there's particle effects flying everywhere.

42
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.290
It's just it feels like a battle.

43
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.940
And that's one of the things that we wanted to recreate in our game.

44
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.480
So from Diablo 3 we're taking this mass enemy battle feeling out of it and you don't have to own the

45
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.190
game yourself.

46
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.690
You can watch YouTube videos as I'm doing now.

47
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.080
This is another game battle hot legacy which I love it's a mobile only game.

48
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.910
It's just so simple but so so rich in the game just you fight a few enemies at a time you bounce around

49
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.740
on the screen you've got the click to click to use abilities down the bottom you don't have a million

50
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.920
of them you've just got enough to make this game feel rich.

51
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.410
The story is simple but it's so powerful you don't know who you are as a character but you build the

52
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.400
story yourself and you can see the UI here is really clean really simple just a nice game.

53
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.290
And the other one I wanted to show you that I took a lot of inspiration from his Torchlight 2 and I'm

54
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.700
really looking at the visuals here that the nice world with trees and grass.

55
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.770
But the special effects really pop you can see the the fire and the lightning everything just kind of

56
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.940
punches out this really nice atmosphere that's been created by this game.

57
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.990
So if you want to take some time to do your own research and watch some videos and play some games now

58
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.870
that's great.

59
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.810
And if you're ready let's dive in and have a look at getting some things down on paper.

60
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.490
So we say what is your game what are you creating.

61
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.560
First of all I've given you a link in the resources for my template which deliberately looks a little

62
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.550
bit ugly so that you can kind of make it look nicer which is cool.

63
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.080
So I'm working in Google Docs.

64
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.130
It's free it's very easy to sign up.

65
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.930
They might need you to throw in an email address.

66
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.610
That's all great.

67
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.720
Google what could go wrong.

68
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.640
But it's really easy way to get started with no barriers so click on the link.

69
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.900
Jump in if there's any sort of sign up type things you need to do then do that probably shouldn't be

70
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.230
yet but click on file and then go make a copy when you click on that.

71
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.060
It'll ask you to rename it and then where you want to save it.

72
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.630
If this is the first time you're using Google docs then you might need to create a folder structure

73
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.340
or it'll put it just somewhere in your high level folder which is great.

74
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.910
Don't write about the other buttons then click.

75
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.370
Okay that's one way to do it the other way is to go file and then download as you can download this

76
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.340
as a word document.

77
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.240
If you're more comfortable working off line in a word document.

78
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.470
Okay.

79
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.030
So go ahead and make your copy now if you will.

80
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.720
I'm just gonna rearrange my tabs a little bit here pop that to the side so I can see it as I go.

81
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.480
So I've got a couple of notes already I've made myself my copy which is here I've called it Rick and

82
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.280
first thing I'll do is just get rid of the notes that I've made for myself up the top project name it's

83
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.890
good to give yourself a codename don't stress about this don't try to come up with the final name if

84
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.330
you try to do that you'll be if you're like me you've been here all day I've just got mine project dragon

85
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.340
all right because that's RPG ish I want to give it a place holder name the summary your hook will come

86
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.050
back to the images will come back to in a moment as well let's start by putting in some of the details

87
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.180
down here in this video we're just focusing on this top chunk we're not focusing on the other details

88
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.640
down the bottom but feel free to have a look at that if you want.

89
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.890
So the genre what I mean by that well it's the type of game that we're making.

90
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:30.230
So obviously you're making an RPG and mine is a third person as my preferred third person action RPG.

91
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.980
It's single player I'm not doing multiplayer and it's fixed camera just to be clear it's not a look

92
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.260
around camera type games so that's my genre.

93
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.520
That's the type of game that I'm making.

94
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.310
Target audience.

95
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.450
I've said it's good to put an age group.

96
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.080
So is it a.

97
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.530
Is it a E for everyone.

98
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.690
So little kids could play it.

99
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.400
Is it a game for teenagers is it 18 plus kids are going to have all sorts of Gore in there for us.

100
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.290
I think we're going for a 13 plus which is a T for teen if you're looking at ratings.

101
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:09.450
Fans of old school what would be AP GS like Diablo and people who like funny things because our game

102
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.740
is gonna be all about funny which I'm going to talk about a bunch throughout this section of the course

103
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.790
the controls we're just doing mouse and keyboard for our game not going into controller just at the

104
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.350
moment thematic setting.

105
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.670
Okay.

106
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.060
So this is where you say Where is it set is it.

107
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.460
Is it a space game.

108
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.500
Is it a medieval game.

109
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.590
Is it a steampunk game.

110
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.460
And for us we're doing Medieval Europe kind of game kind of.

111
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.370
England is the way I see it.

112
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:51.380
Fantasy knights and what is it knights and swords and dragons and stuff OK.

113
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.500
So I'm going slow I'm going deliberate so that you can do this as well so hopefully you're typing yours

114
00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.360
out as I go post a video if you need to but follow along don't just watch I want you to be creating

115
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.570
something that you would like to make yourself the tech stack.

116
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.190
Well obviously we're using Unity.

117
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.800
Twenty Eighteen point three.

118
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:17.200
We can use some audacity for some audio creation and probably just asset store for the art for 3D.

119
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:25.240
And you I so assets to asset packs platforms while we're targeting just steam at this point we're not

120
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.760
trying to make it a mobile game.

121
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.270
Just to keep it nice and straightforward when you try to make it P.C. and mobile as a whole lot of extra

122
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.020
complexity you have to think about.

123
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.580
And then the MVP game moment.

124
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:38.890
OK.

125
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:44.200
So what is these at the bottom up level where we're talking at high level with most of these things

126
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.460
from a bottom up.

127
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.350
What is our game.

128
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.780
What are we going to do in that.

129
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.490
In that first thing we're working towards in our prototype.

130
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:59.260
And for us we're making a to me that both two minutes of simple linear level flow linear means just

131
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:10.400
from a to b with basic combat against 3 or 4 3 3 enemy types.

132
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.230
So why are we bothering to write this.

133
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.700
And so we're clear to ourselves what are we focused on now.

134
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:21.040
Don't allow yourself to get drawn into a massive game and massive development.

135
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.990
For now focus on the milestone.

136
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.760
This just in front of you which is creating a simple little combat sandbox demo.

137
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.530
Okay.

138
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.530
Now scrolling all the way up to the top I've had a lot of time to think about my game so I already know

139
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:37.150
a lot of these things for you it's okay to ponder it for now putting something placeholder if you don't

140
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:44.020
know anything but on a brief summary or a hook for my game and for me it's going to be Diablo meets

141
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:53.080
Monty Python Monty Python being a super funny British comedy TV show where in movies and stuff.

142
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:59.230
Life of Brian the Holy Grail just love it is really funny and silly and crazy so that's what that's

143
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.640
what I'm heading towards in Diablo.

144
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.630
Well we know Diablo as a as the fixed camera third person click to move style game.

145
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.280
Okay the last thing we do in this video is we need a little bit of imagery.

146
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.900
This at the moment is like I have no idea what's going on with this game so I'm going to jump over to

147
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.490
Google images and within Google Images I'm just going to search for whatever I think.

148
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:24.670
So if I search for Monty Python to see what comes up it's probably Monty Python and the Holy Grail is

149
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.080
what I'm really thinking of.

150
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.860
That's the movie that's all the knights and swords and is just ridiculous.

151
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.030
They're pretending to ride around like on horses and clicking coconuts together.

152
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.700
It's just such a wonderful movie.

153
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:40.480
So what I want you to do remember our challenge is to add two images that summarize what your game is

154
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.020
about.

155
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.610
Go through find some google doc images or wherever you get it from.

156
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.020
At this stage here's the point I want to make.

157
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.440
Don't worry about infringing upon copyright.

158
00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.890
Don't worry about if you're allowed to use it.

159
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.410
This is for internal use only.

160
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.370
Only you are going to see what's going on here.

161
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.550
Maybe you'll share it to a friend.

162
00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.110
So just use whatever at this point but don't put any of this stuff into your game when you launch it.

163
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.920
That's the point.

164
00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.590
So we're trying to I liked that one there so I go right click copy image.

165
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.010
OK.

166
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.630
Delete the place holder we've got there right click paste and then boom.

167
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.140
There we go.

168
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.210
We've got an image wonderful.

169
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:13.510
OK.

170
00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.910
So find yourself another image or two so that you can really good feel of visually what your game is

171
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:19.960
all about at this stage.

172
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.640
Complete your tag line.

173
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.250
Complete the top chunk of text and when you done that I will see you in the next video.
