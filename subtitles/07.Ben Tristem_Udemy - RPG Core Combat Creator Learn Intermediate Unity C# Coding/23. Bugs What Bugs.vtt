00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.220
In this video we're going to fix a couple of somewhat obscure bugs without animation and also have a

2
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.130
quick conversation about bugs themselves.

3
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.780
In this video we're gonna have a look at something we have implemented but has caused an issue and that

4
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.730
is known as a bug.

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.970
So if you're not familiar with the term a bug is when the game doesn't work as intended.

6
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.960
That's a bug.

7
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.120
And just quickly I want to share with you my philosophy here on when to fix different types of bugs

8
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.810
because they can really distract you from what you need to do on your project.

9
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.900
If you find a game breaking bugs that stops something from working the game just crashes then drop everything

10
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.660
and fix that immediately.

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.140
Make sure you fix that straightaway or else you won't be out to properly implement your new code.

12
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.010
You might be out of place for your game you might be out to share it with other people.

13
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.350
If it's something that's annoying in other words the player will be distracted as we've talked about

14
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.870
then fix it before moving on to the next feature.

15
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.120
That's where we're at right at the moment.

16
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.330
I've got one thing that I think we really need to fix before we move on.

17
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.800
If it's something that looks bad.

18
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.300
So the play on notice like a little bit of a glitch like the players clipping through some collision

19
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.650
incorrectly or something.

20
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.520
Some of the trees don't quite look right.

21
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.470
Then fix it if you get time fix it after you've implemented all of your other features and then come

22
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.350
back to it.

23
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.920
If and when you get time.

24
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.620
These are things that often you just don't get done that you need to live with that need to be loud.

25
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.450
That's cool.

26
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.410
And then things that could be improved the player may or may not know about them you look at and say

27
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.760
ah you know I could really have it.

28
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.460
So when you swing it smacks into the player and there's a bigger particle effect in that moment.

29
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.270
Well that's not about my friend.

30
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.280
You just need to add it to your published list for the end of the project.

31
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.810
And if you get to it you get to it.

32
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.390
That's cool.

33
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.850
So here's the problem I'm seeing at the moment when I ran up to him enemy punch and then run away and

34
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.050
then come back and hit again.

35
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.480
He does this little glitch.

36
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.300
It's as if he's starting the attack but it's not quite working so I'll show you that again.

37
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.640
Run up and did the glitch straight away.

38
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.390
Well done.

39
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.120
Run up and glitch as well so that's the issue.

40
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.590
And often if someone finds a bug in your game they'll say Hey man your character glitches out when you

41
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.670
go to hit you like oh what do I do about this how do we even find what it is.

42
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.580
Well let me give you a little process for fixing bugs.

43
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.240
The first step is you have to be really clear on the reproduction step.

44
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.640
So we say the reproduced steps.

45
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.620
How do you go about getting that bug.

46
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.150
What are the conditions so for me.

47
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.110
I ran up and clicked and then I clicked away and he does a little glitch.

48
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.550
When you run up and attack the enemy again just an extra note I find it's easier to reproduce if you

49
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.940
put the player's time between attacks up to say something like 4 or 5 and wait until he's finished his

50
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.210
attack and then walk away.

51
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.590
So be clear on the repo steps and next you want to follow your codes logic step by step and ask at each

52
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.380
step what exactly is this step doing so what.

53
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.710
In my code is making me click and attack.

54
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.780
What is changing my attack state.

55
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.280
What is transitioning out of it.

56
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.230
So looking at all those different aspects along this pipeline and looking for something that's doing

57
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.340
the wrong thing something that's doing additional things or something that's not actually doing the

58
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.360
thing you think that it is doing and then also the code make some changes.

59
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.640
This is what I think will fix it make a fix.

60
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.830
In other words and then test the repo steps so the things that we know produce the bug in the first

61
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.170
place but also this is really important.

62
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.580
Test your general gameplay so play the game a little bit to make sure you haven't introduced any other

63
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.350
issues in there.

64
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.280
So what I'm going to do is give you a challenge here to find the problem and this would be good.

65
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.290
If you have the same code base as Sam and I at the moment not so good if you've gone off made a bunch

66
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.540
of changes but if you're working in pretty much the same as what we're working in then follow the repo

67
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.760
steps that I've just given you and with our bug to see if you can identify what's causing the bug so

68
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.690
try to figure it out.

69
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.560
This is not a go fix it challenge you can if you want to but I want to just see if you can figure out

70
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.280
what is causing this bug and then please share your answer in our discussion section and of course make

71
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.450
sure you don't accidentally look at other people's answers just put what you think it is.

72
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.220
Give it your best shot.

73
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.930
This is a really this is core to being a great game developer is being out to figure out why the heck

74
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.990
with my code work so there's the challenge find the problem and I'll see you back here when you've given

75
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.500
it a shot.

76
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.360
Okay.

77
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.250
How'd you go on with that.

78
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.700
Did you figure out what's going on.

79
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.330
What I've found is the easiest way to figure this out is if I click on player and change the time between

80
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.410
attacks or something pretty high I will say 4 that's making it a lot clearer.

81
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.570
The fact that we have transitions in and out of attack into locomotion.

82
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.510
So let me show you what I discovered when I just give ourselves a little bit more time between attacks

83
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.770
when I run up.

84
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.780
So I'm currently in locomotion just doing my idle idle idle run up in attack.

85
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:46.880
It plays the attack and then when I move out of the way after the attack while he was standing in locomotion

86
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.380
my stop attack trigger has been triggered but not consume.

87
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.560
Now when I run up and click on him again the first thing that happens is it gets consumed and then he

88
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.230
does his attack.

89
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.310
I say that one more time.

90
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.380
So it happened again just then I was standing in locomotion my stop attack trigger is turn on if I click

91
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.010
it I'll turn off the stop attack trigger.

92
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.180
So the first thing will happen I'll punch him and now I'm in locomotion.

93
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.340
If I move out of the way the stop attack trigger is on when it shouldn't be on because I've moved I've

94
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.300
already stopped.

95
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.420
So if we remind ourselves of what's going on in our action scheduler if we are currently in combat.

96
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:31.210
So the action is combat and fighting and we cancel that so that we can go into movement.

97
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.730
We call current action not cancel which is going to be the cancel we find in fighter dot c s and you

98
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.600
can see in here we are setting the trigger of stop attack.

99
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.110
However this is a really interesting quirk is because our animator wasn't in attack in the attack state

100
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.830
that is where we have the transition as one transition of just if you finish your attack has exit time

101
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.880
that means you finish your attack then just go wait in locomotion until we think you supposed to attack

102
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:07.100
again the other transition here is the one that has the stop attack condition so that condition is being

103
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.400
triggered when we call cancel.

104
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.470
However because I've moved away from attack so I'm going to hit him once.

105
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.170
Now I'm going to hit come on it.

106
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.580
There we go.

107
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.180
What's wrong.

108
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.970
Okay hit this guy.

109
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.330
Wait wait wait wait hit.

110
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.560
And now I move away.

111
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.330
See how I'm not actually in attack.

112
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.510
So my stop attack trigger wasn't consumed and I'm back in locomotion and it will be consumed the next

113
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.380
time I'm back in attack.

114
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.970
So these triggers are really interesting they're like a bull that gets flicked on and off and it's gonna

115
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.190
get flicked off immediately.

116
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.670
Once it is consumed by our condition over here.

117
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.470
So the very second I run back up and get back into the attack state again.

118
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:51.260
There is a transition that says okay if this trigger is called then cancel attack which you just did

119
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.110
it moved out.

120
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.630
So how do we fix this.

121
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.330
Well the issue is if we have our stop attack trigger that sitting there waiting to be consumed then

122
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.450
the moment we run up and do our attack let's consume it let's automatically consume it.

123
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:10.250
We can do that by calling reset trigger that's equivalent set Trigger clicks it on reset trigger it

124
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:16.220
turns it off so it's fine we we'll do that now code over in fighter dot yes I'll look for the moment

125
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.610
that we're triggering attack we want to go straight into attack and I'll put a line before that actually

126
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.230
I'll copy this whole line of set trigger attack.

127
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.240
Copy that.

128
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.600
Put it just above and we want to change from set trigger.

129
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.980
We want change that's a reset trigger and instead of attack where resetting the trigger of stop attack.

130
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.090
Okay now I'm going to highlight these two lines.

131
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:43.450
Click on the little light bulb just to extract these out as a method double click on this method F2

132
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.310
will call this trigger attack

133
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.340
and then trigger attack is looking all cool.

134
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:52.790
And you know what.

135
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.540
I don't think it's going to happen very often but let's make sure we're protecting ourself the other

136
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.290
way around.

137
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:03.680
So when we stop attack let's make sure that we reset the attack so that that doesn't happen.

138
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.370
So this little mini challenge for you is to do the same thing that I did above.

139
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.910
But the other way round so that we're resetting attack OK.

140
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.600
Little that was a mini challenge.

141
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.150
So what I'll do is highlight this line.

142
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.840
Copy and paste.

143
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:27.080
We will reset tree of attack small A.

144
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.660
And once again I'll just extract these out into a method just to keep it tidy.

145
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:38.750
Click on the light bulb extract method double click new method if Two and this will be stop attack as

146
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.320
the method.

147
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.200
Is looking pretty good let's save that up make sure it's doing what we expect it to do yet we can move

148
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.830
around a little bit.

149
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.810
All good run up and hit a guy bonk punched him walk away a little bit.

150
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:51.140
OK.

151
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.260
Our stop attack trigger is still sitting there not being consumed.

152
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.220
But when I run up and hit him again bonk straight away because we've reset that trigger.

153
00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:58.760
Excellent.

154
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:04.700
We have fixed that bug and you know I've got one more little bug that our wonderful behind the scenes

155
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:10.130
team member Mark has mentioned that when we are calling in one of our animations or went in when we're

156
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.850
hitting.

157
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.030
We've got our hit event which is calling our hit method that we've created.

158
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.450
There's times where that doesn't quite work out.

159
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:23.390
Maybe if you exit the animation a little bit before the hit event or the character runs away or dies

160
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.200
there's there's issues that we might get with that at some point.

161
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.190
So let's fix that now.

162
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.840
It's a pretty simple thing we just need to make sure that we actually do have a target.

163
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:37.800
So if we find hit and here how do we prevent ourselves having a null reference exception if it can't

164
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.500
find a target.

165
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:45.110
Well we add If Target equals equals no.

166
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.320
Then what do we do.

167
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.010
Well we return okay.

168
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.780
Just a side note and here you don't have to put in these curly braces there.

169
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.950
It's an optional kind of thing.

170
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.720
I know that Sam tends not to.

171
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.560
He does it like this.

172
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.780
That's exactly the same.

173
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.540
It's just a habit that I've developed from.

174
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.180
Thank you Ben Tristram for saying that we should always have our curly braces because if we go and create

175
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.810
a second line and we've forgotten to putting our curly braces then the moment we do this we're gonna

176
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.160
have issues happen because it's not knowing what's going on.

177
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.530
So it's up to you.

178
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.410
Kelly braces or not.

179
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.370
I just wanted to point that out because I know some people ask why is Rick doing Colleen Kelly braces

180
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.510
when he doesn't have to do it.

181
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.520
Just a preference of mine to do that in their OK.

182
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.340
Save that up.

183
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.870
We're not going to see the impact of that bug because we didn't go through the repo steps as a little

184
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.250
bit more obscure or a little bit harder to replicate.

185
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:37.100
But we have prevented a bug in the future which is the best kind of bug of all.

186
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.720
So great work in this video.

187
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.700
Well done for fixing bugs it's not the sexiest of topics but it's a really important skill for you to

188
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.830
have to quickly find and eradicate bugs.

189
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.630
And I'll see you in an upcoming video.
