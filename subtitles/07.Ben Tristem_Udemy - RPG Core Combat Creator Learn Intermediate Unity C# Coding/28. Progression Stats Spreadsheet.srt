1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,340
Now that we have the start of our progression system how do we know what numbers to put in here what

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,800
makes sense what's going to make for a fun game.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,880
Well I can be a little bit overwhelming so what I want to do is give you a couple of techniques that

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,480
will help out.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,340
So what is it that I'm doing.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,440
Well he is a spreadsheet with a bunch of numbers.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,220
There we go.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:21,690
Done.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,280
Good luck.

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,610
Now I'm just Just joking just been an idiot.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,270
So the first thing that I do is to find myself what I call like a soul number what's the soul of my

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,730
spreadsheet or what's a key stat.

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,530
The first case that that I've got that I think I've mentioned to you in the past is how many hits do

14
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:45,150
I think it should take the player to kill the enemy if if we're at the same level so he's made the player

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,860
he's an enemy if we're both level one and I run up to this guy on average it should take me I think

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,520
three hits like bang bang bang gong.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,800
If he was a level all right level five then it should take me a lot more hits maybe it's going to take

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,910
me six or seven or eight and then also more relevant to what we've been doing in the let's see the levelling

19
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,740
up is how many kills do I think I should get before I level up.

20
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:18,100
Now there's again a bunch of ways that you can approach this the way let me just get my scribble a pen

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,920
so I can scribble some stuff here that looks decent.

22
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,240
OK.

23
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:29,620
So for me the approach that I'm going to is a very very standard RPG approach if this is my time.

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,670
So time is this way.

25
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:37,990
How long I've been playing the game for and this is leveling up level up in terms of how much experience

26
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,000
it takes to level up at the first level.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,230
It takes a small amount at the next level a larger amount next level a large amount larger amount.

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,840
You could do it linear so each time I level up it takes a little bit longer it took me 25 kills and

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,940
then it took me 30 and then it took me 35 and it took me 40 and so on.

30
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,610
So you can do this in a linear fashion or you can do it something that's a little bit more exponential

31
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,560
exponential so slow slow slow and then it gets harder harder higher and then it's just crazy impossible

32
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,590
by the end is really really hard to level up.

33
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,220
I don't think that's so much fun.

34
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:17,200
You can also do it in a way which was I don't know is maybe at the start it's super easy takes nothing

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,240
to level out you can't see that yellow sorry let's do it in black.

36
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,850
So at the start it takes nothing to level up nothing nothing nothing with her first five levels and

37
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,200
then it gets crazy difficult to level up for a little bit and then it flattens off again and then it

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,490
peaks up so you can do your progression however you want.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,250
Like I say I think I'm going to do mine more in a gradual at slightly more difficult at each level.

40
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,090
It takes a little bit longer to level up.

41
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:47,400
Now there's some other factors in this when I am level 1 and I'm fighting level 1 beasts.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,170
I want my Level 1 beasts to have a certain amount of experience for example they give me just for example

43
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,880
50 experience.

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:02,230
Now when I'm level and I level 20 I don't want the level one beast if I happen to come across a level

45
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,250
one beast.

46
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,090
I don't want them to give me a different amount of experience that wouldn't make sense that would feel

47
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:13,030
a little bit cheapening so I still need them to be worth 50 experienced but when I'm fighting a level

48
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:19,870
20 beast I might want them to have a ton of experience so that it feels like a really big worthwhile

49
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,670
kill maybe they're worth 4000 experience for example.

50
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:29,440
So I need a way of managing just how many experience should a level 20 thing be versus how much should

51
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,030
a level one thing to be.

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,560
And then as you are tuning your game when the player is in the very first level you're gonna give them

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,250
a bunch of level ones to be fighting against these little ones that they're finding is maybe there's

54
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,020
a two that's a little bit of a challenge or the bosses are three level three gives them more experience

55
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,230
maybe 200 instead of 50 experience and so on they finish level one that was amazing.

56
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,940
Now you know because you've calculated.

57
00:03:51,970 --> 00:04:02,800
Okay I've got my 25 25 kills to level up and I went and put in approximately 30 enemies in Level 1 then

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,010
I'm pretty certain that when someone gets to my level 2 is my level 2 Hopefully my scribbles here are

59
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,990
making sense when the plague is my level 2 I'm pretty sure they're Level 2.

60
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,790
So the play is going to be up against a bunch of Level 2 enemies maybe a level one to say Look how powerful

61
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:24,250
you are now and then some threes and maybe the bosses of five because they've progressed loan themselves

62
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,440
so show you the next page of my spreadsheet and while I do this I just make a point that I've given

63
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,960
you a link against this lecture for this particular spreadsheet or if you want to just type in this

64
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,330
you are Oh now go ahead I'm just joking with you being an idiot again.

65
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,490
So go find the link for that against this lecture and what you'll do when you open up you'll see mine.

66
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,140
You don't need to ask for permission I get a lot of people who are sending requests to edit like don't

67
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,180
edit this one this is mine what you want to do is got to file and to either download.

68
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,620
You can do that as an Excel spreadsheet or whatever else you want but the main thing you want to do

69
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:07,420
is to make a copy let me listen to what I've done in here first just a very simple piece of house spreadsheets

70
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,580
work in terms of calculations if you've never worked with a spreadsheet.

71
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,150
When you click on a cell you can put in a formula within that so you can type in a number obviously

72
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,490
and type in 27.

73
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,700
Or I could do something that I do a calculation the way I do that is I hit equals.

74
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,550
And then I can choose for example one of my cells I can choose.

75
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,630
The multiplier for my base health click on that and that is in Cell B so B across this way.

76
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,850
And 12 across that way.

77
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,970
And then I could multiply that by doing the asterisk sine I can multiply it by for example.

78
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,460
This thing just hit this cell 10 full and then hit enter.

79
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,310
And now that's gone and calculated that times that say three times ten equals thirty.

80
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,040
So you see that if you go and click on my my little formulas in here you see those sorts of things up

81
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,230
in the the bar up here you see that all the time.

82
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,110
The other thing that I'll add in my just very very quick and simple spreadsheet intro is sometimes you

83
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,000
see a dollar sign.

84
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:08,500
That means if I copy this cell somewhere else then don't change the the letter or the number that the

85
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,700
dollar sign is in front of.

86
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,570
So not small on my screen here that has dollar sign.

87
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,590
Be dollar sign.

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,660
Well that means this 150 is being generated by multiplying be twelve.

89
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,990
And that's b twelve which is this number just here.

90
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,080
This is my number of hits to kill at same level my multiplier.

91
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,650
It's multiplying that by G 8 and G-8 is my total damage.

92
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,270
So how much damage the played out spaces in this times that.

93
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,000
Because there's a dollar sign I can copy this.

94
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,270
Copy that and pasted in here and paste it in here and so on.

95
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,750
And when I pasted in there it keeps the beat 12 exactly the same it doesn't modify it but it progressions

96
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,750
along the H eight it moves it along a s smart enough to know that you were multiplying that and you

97
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,530
copied this.

98
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,280
So when you paste that in there I'm going to move this one along as well.

99
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,510
And the fast way to do it is if you have a formula set up here at the start you can grab this little

100
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:10,600
squared and the bottom is go drag drag drag drag and it will populate that for everything beyond that

101
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,930
point probably if I drag this one yes then it's going to continue along with whatever formula I had

102
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,270
in that previous self.

103
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,570
Okay.

104
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,890
So I just wanted to I know some people get a bit stuck on that so I wanted to explain to.

105
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,020
Now let me talk to you about my rationale and what I've actually done in this spreadsheet.

106
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,320
I've got the play details at the top that I have enemy details below that and I've got my l You means

107
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,110
level up.

108
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,940
And if you see the little top right triangle thing then that means I've inserted a comment against this

109
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,980
multiple means multiplier and was l You means how much is added when the player levels up and so on.

110
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:51,700
So the experience to level out this is what we want to know the player at level 1 they need 2000 experience

111
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,660
from level 1 to level 2 level 2 they need 3000 to get level 3 level 3 then a four thousand and so on.

112
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:03,670
And you can see I've got in here 1000 l you that means that I've got my fairly linear path but it's

113
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,030
getting a little bit more difficult each time.

114
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,640
So we might need to put in a new row in here which is cumulative.

115
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,950
I'll do that now and you can see me as I do it insert a row and what I'm going to say is to get from

116
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,910
level 1 to 2.

117
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,140
Okay.

118
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,990
Well that's the first time we've leveled up so it just equals that 2000.

119
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,030
Great to get from level two to three.

120
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:32,320
I need a further 3000 so I'm going to add 3000 onto my previous number so I'm going equals 3000 plus

121
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,390
the number just to the left.

122
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,380
And that should make 5000 now I've set up my little formula.

123
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,550
If I go drag drag drag drag all the way out to level 18.

124
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,550
That should work accurately.

125
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,370
Let's see.

126
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:49,750
And it's showing us to get from level 2 to 3 and a further 4000 on top of 5 which means a cumulative

127
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,080
total of nine cumulative experience.

128
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:53,720
OK.

129
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,090
Now when you're at level 1 I've said I want the player to have to kill around about 25 enemies to get

130
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:04,600
to level 2 and I know I've said well let's start with 2000 Experience Experience points you need to

131
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:11,140
reach 2000 to level up you need to kill 25 enemies to do that therefore how much experience should each

132
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,310
enemy give you.

133
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:19,500
Well that's going to be the let's see the experience 2000 divided by 25 equals 80.

134
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,470
So each enemy gives you 80.

135
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:27,110
And when you kill 25 of them you'll have gathered 2000 Experience points and for a moment I'm just gonna

136
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:33,850
set this number here to zero and you can see that gives me the experience per enemy is 80 forever even

137
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:41,740
when I'm killing a level 8 enemy I'm getting 80 experience then this consistent the whole way throughout

138
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,850
all the enemies are exactly the same.

139
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,850
They don't give you any more value you know super boring but what happens in that case if I'm saying

140
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:55,210
you need to get more experienced to level up instead of getting four you need five instead of five six

141
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,890
then the number of enemies you need to kill you can see the pattern here at level one is 25 then it's

142
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,010
38 enemies then 50 enemies in six 3 I don't know.

143
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,530
By the time you get to level 10 138 enemies feels like a lot.

144
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:13,700
And so what I want to do is make that journey a little bit smoother but also give the player a feeling

145
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,100
of reward when they kill a bigger enemy.

146
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,610
You could say 50 so if I kill level 3 thing then it's a whole hundred experience points more than that

147
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,520
level one guy and so on when I'm killing a level 10.

148
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,220
Thing it's 530 So if somehow I'm level 1 and I managed to find a level 10 creature then it's going to

149
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,050
give me a ton of experience.

150
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,020
However that means the number of kills I need to get is decreasing.

151
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,080
Well I could probably solve that by saying each time I level up let's add 2000 to this and see what

152
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,800
happens.

153
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,400
I get 25 31 33 35 that actually feels not too bad.

154
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,390
The number of enemies to that I need to kill to level up at flattens out a little bit which is quite

155
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,050
interesting as the numbers up here get quite huge.

156
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,810
The numbers down here aren't quite so huge big and see these levers have different effects.

157
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,890
They're not exactly linear in how they works I could changes to 40 additional experience each time I

158
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,540
level up and then it continues to make this curve a little bit steeper.

159
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:17,060
I could change this to eighteen hundred for example additional experience I need so that's something

160
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,220
for you to play around with for now.

161
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,900
I'll just leave it at 2040 and see how that feels.

162
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,160
Okay.

163
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,180
That gives me the number of creatures that I need to bump on the head to level up and base health it's

164
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:32,150
the same thing 40 some going from 200 to 240 to 280 seems okay but maybe I want the play to have a lot

165
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,750
more health.

166
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,150
They feel a lot more powerful each time they level up.

167
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:40,700
Maybe it's 100 each time maybe it's 200 each time from 200 to 400 to 600 and put that back to where

168
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,990
it was 40 for now just to see how that feels and have to play that and see how it works.

169
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,110
Similarly base hit.

170
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,090
I'm saying it starts off at 10 each time I level up I get another 5.

171
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,400
Now I've put in here a standard weapon bonus to acknowledge the fact that when I'm level 10 I'm going

172
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,110
to be finding these really amazing swords when I'm level ones and not so amazing.

173
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:06,320
Generally I'm saying they should be roughly the same value as the current players health so the players

174
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,710
damage.

175
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:13,670
So if you do 20 unarmed then if you find a cool weapon it should be roughly another 20 to do damage.

176
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:13,940
Okay.

177
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,800
These these are general numbers to help me make decisions when I say how much for my weapons be worth

178
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,830
and also how much damage am i doing therefore how many hits is it gonna take me to kill enemies.

179
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,700
Okay let's just quickly go through the enemies here.

180
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,540
I know this is a lot of content with taking a while with all these the base health.

181
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,980
Now this again as I said before as a number of hits to kill at the same level and I've got in here this

182
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,930
value of 60 which is let me look at my formula.

183
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:45,890
It's been 13 so it is my number of hits to kill times by D 9 which is my total damage so if I'm doing

184
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:52,850
20 points of damage and I want to have three hits to kill a same level enemy then and level one enemy

185
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,030
should be 60.

186
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:59,840
Like just a nice linear growth on the enemy healthcare per level and then likewise how many hits for

187
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,680
the enemies to kill the player I'm saying 25 at the starts.

188
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,680
That means the enemy is just a standard enemy needs to be doing 8 points of damage.

189
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:17,420
That's based upon the D6 divided by so D6 is going to be the player's base base health divided by how

190
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,740
many hits we want to have kill them.

191
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:25,070
So it's gonna be 8 when we're at level 1 and 10 and 11 13 14 and so on and then I've just gotten here

192
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,750
a functionality if we want to have the enemy do a big hit maybe it's a massive big slow hit or maybe

193
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,770
they've got a special ability that I've just given ourselves a mechanism for that we don't really have

194
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:39,320
that now code at the moment and then I've gone down and said well for a soldier or a grunt as Sam has

195
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,210
been calling it what would be the stats the different level I've got to multiply in here saying the

196
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:50,990
grunt or the soldier is the standard so a 1 multiplier on everything so basically whatever the base

197
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,040
enemy has the Soldier has exactly the same.

198
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,240
However if we say a heavy soldier on the heavy soldier to be more of a challenge I want them to have

199
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,280
more health I want them to hit harder.

200
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,310
They're still level 1 but there are more challenging level 1 and so their health is higher the damage

201
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,500
per hits higher and the experience you get from them should be a little bit more as well I think minions

202
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,990
let's see minions I've got in here is just a little creatures I'll put in there a point for slave less

203
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,220
health and do less damage and you get a little bit less experience for them and then I've just created

204
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,120
a few other categories.

205
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,570
We've got Archer in here for example again tweak the number and that will change the the values so if

206
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,150
I say Well no maybe Archer should have the same health as a standard soldier change that then it'll

207
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,290
change the numbers from from each of the levels.

208
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,610
That's my stat spreadsheet.

209
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,420
What do I do now will I get my spreadsheet I put puppet down in the corner over here rip him.

210
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,170
We open up our progression we say with our health for the player.

211
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,210
I'm going to put in 18 and you can see it's left a whole bunch of stuff in here to populate.

212
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,760
So I jump over into my stat spreadsheet I find the players health.

213
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,590
Where are we player base health at level 1 should be 200 and then back over here sorry about the flipping

214
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:12,670
and flopping but at level 2 is gonna be 240 so I copy that and I pasted in it is a little bit manual

215
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:19,300
there it's a lot manual but it's gonna give us a lots of flexibility lots of visibility lots of visibility

216
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,820
to know is that right compared to this compared to that and then we putting our numbers into our progression

217
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,700
so I think you've probably guessed it by now.

218
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,040
Create your own stats spreadsheet as I have just done or update my spreadsheet I guess and then populate

219
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,660
your game with your progression data so it makes sense that you could be playing your game from level

220
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,560
1 to level whatever you want.

221
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,630
I'm going to pause the video while I put mine in now so you don't have to watch that now just briefly

222
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,230
show you what I've done when I come back.

223
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:45,600
Okay.

224
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,740
Jump in take on that challenge.

225
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,190
Welcome back.

226
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:54,790
I've put it in my numbers didn't take too long actually and I've got my player's health damage experience

227
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:01,440
level up and then with the characters I've got the grunt with its health and damage and so on.

228
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,370
And then same with the Archer and I wanted to have all my fields entered manually so we know have it

229
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:11,260
correct but you might say Ha Man if I make a slight tweak in my spreadsheet is there a quicker way to

230
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,970
enter it.

231
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,750
Yes there is.

232
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,340
Thanks to the intellect of sand pit to see who reminded me we can do it this way.

233
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,320
If you open up visual studio code then you can go and grab your progression file drag it over individual

234
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,970
studio code drop it in place and that will allow us to see you smile.

235
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,910
That relates to our all about progression information you can see our character class 0 that's the player

236
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,730
stat 0.

237
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,630
That's the first time we've entered I have deliberately accidentally made a mistake which is I've gone

238
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:45,580
and entered my non cumulative when I should have ended my cumulative experience so what I'm going to

239
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,290
do is highlight all of my numbers here from 1 to 18.

240
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:56,170
Copy that jump over into my progression asset in Visual Studio code look for where I have that information

241
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,700
and it is step two.

242
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,160
Just here it's important through this whole process that you don't mess up the indentation you want

243
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,280
to keep those the same.

244
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:11,290
What I can do is highlight all of my numbers here blank and paste that's going to paste my numbers across

245
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,140
the page.

246
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,130
It's deleted the ones are in there across the page.

247
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:20,890
So if I highlight the space after my first number and before my next number hit control D that will

248
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,540
find the space space space space race between all the numbers until I get to the point where I find

249
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,990
the last one do I have the last one there.

250
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,080
I think I do.

251
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,310
Yep.

252
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,560
The last one I can hit Enter so it pushes all of those down on the page and then I can do dash space

253
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,310
that will do the indentation.

254
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,740
It looks like it's at the right spot I need to do it for the 2000 Dash Space.

255
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,640
It's kept it at the right level I believe you can see where the indentation is there.

256
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,220
If I save that up we could have done this first time round I just wanted to get the structure in place

257
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,120
and show you how you can update your numbers a little bit quicker in the future.

258
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:02,740
Now when I jump back over into unity let's have a look health damage experience to level up 2006 12

259
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,730
and the highest being 34 2000 is that looking correct.

260
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,710
Always right of me.

261
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:08,920
Yep.

262
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,370
There we go.

263
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,380
34 2000.

264
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,700
Okay says Just a quick away that you can make some more wholesale changes in the future.

265
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:20,880
Going in and editing the progression asset using the yellow visualization that we've got there now.

266
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,480
The other thing that we need to do in here is to make sure that we add in the appropriate weapon damage

267
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,880
so resources find the script of subject for say sword now sort of an interesting one Sam's given us

268
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,990
a bunch of flexibility.

269
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,760
Here we can have the weapon damage maybe put that at 2 it's not much but then percentage bonus of 50

270
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:43,540
so my character's currently doing 10 damage at level 1 then it's going to add an extra 5 based upon

271
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,380
the percentage.

272
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,300
So I think if this is a sword of Level 1 it's going to scale a little bit it's still going to be relevant

273
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,950
as well Level 3 and 4 and 5 but we're gonna be looking for a better sword that's giving us a better

274
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,850
percentage bonus as we go.

275
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:01,840
So I'd probably even put this lower I'd say a 20 percent bonus if I look at my spreadsheet again and

276
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,990
see that I winning generally wanting to add a bonus of weapons it's around about the same amount of

277
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,330
damage as our base damage but I don't want all of my weapons to be amazing.

278
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:18,010
So I think the balance between the damage and the percentage bonus is pretty important here as the weapons

279
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,990
get way cooler and better you might want to have more of it be about the percentage but at a lower level

280
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:29,830
have more to do with just the weapon damage itself so that you're not going and giving them a weapon

281
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,010
that scales really well level one weapon shouldn't scale super well.

282
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:40,360
You want to be looking for cooler weapons as you go make sure you change the fireball and the red and

283
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,370
blue projectiles as well.

284
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,710
Just some numbers that I've got in there for you.

285
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,920
Again putting what numbers works for you.

286
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,110
Give it your best shot.

287
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,900
Play the game see how it feels and continue to finesse and tune.

288
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,690
Update your spreadsheet if you've got any questions let us know.

289
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,650
And if you want to take a screenshot of your spreadsheet so you can see his hammer.

290
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,280
Show us how much love you put into it.

291
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,140
That'd be cool as well.

292
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,630
It's been a huge lecture.

293
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,880
Thanks for bearing with me and I'll talk to you again soon.
