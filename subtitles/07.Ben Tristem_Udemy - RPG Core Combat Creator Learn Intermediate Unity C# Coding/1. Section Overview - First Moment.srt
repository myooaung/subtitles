00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,060
Hello and welcome to the next section of the course in this section we're going to be creating a moment.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,320
Our first gameplay moment for the player.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,860
And we're going to make it even more interesting by exploring sinner machine and creating ourselves

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,440
a little bit of a cinematic where we take control away from the player.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,580
We switch around the cameras we present the scenario that they're about to engage with and then we take

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,520
the control back to the player again so that the person playing the game can work their way through

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,070
the moment or the challenge that we've created for them.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,820
So we're going to be talking a little bit about game design theory we're gonna be doing a bunch of snow

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,430
machine.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,980
We're going to be doing timelines in a machine and tunneling go hand in hand.

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,900
And the end of it hopefully we'll have something that feels pretty cool as it's just a 15 to 30 second

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,810
moment that we can say this is what our game is starting to feel like and it will give us a great feel

13
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,660
for what we need to work on next to make our game even more interesting.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:58,910
Okay.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,750
We've got this moment.

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,660
What is next.

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,480
So let's jump in and create ourselves our first moment.
