00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.750
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.730
We are going to be adding some sound effects.

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.170
Excellent.

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.020
Let's dive right in so let's start to add some sound effects to our game so that we have got a more

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.220
complete and polished think.

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.680
Now let's talk about what sound effects I am going to be adding in you might want to add more than me.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.150
But this is what I'm going to start off with as a minimum.

8
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.750
So we're going to have one on taking damage.

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.550
So a hurt sound kind of kind of sound and we're gonna have an on dying sound so it kind of sound and

10
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.210
then an on weapon hit.

11
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.830
So a clang of a weapon something like that and on projectile hit like a thump if it's an arrow or if

12
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.460
it's a fireball and then the projectile launched so that could be like a fuse or something along those

13
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.080
lines.

14
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.950
Now if you don't have your own sound effects yet and you just want to put placeholders in then do just

15
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.660
record into the microphone or your phone or something like that and just have some place holders like

16
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.210
I literally just did and that is actually what I've done for the on die animation.

17
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.440
Sorry.

18
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.250
The sound effects and we've got some sound effects to get you started off in the sound effect pack.

19
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.420
It's not at all a complete set but it is something that might get you started.

20
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.420
So if you go ahead and download that unzip it and drag it in to your project now then what you will

21
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.790
see is that you've got some sound effects for area of effects attacks attack hit sounds some taking

22
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.320
damage.

23
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.610
Ouch sounds we have even got the die sounds ones that I've actually recorded myself in audacity.

24
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.820
So if we go ahead and import those is going to take them in to the game digital TV assets folder and

25
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.310
it should be underneath the SFX folder here.

26
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.540
Now the next step is to bring these sound effects into the game world and to do that we need to add

27
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.240
some audio sources which are basically the places from which these sound effects emanate and they are

28
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.890
components as you might imagine.

29
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.480
Now there's two parts to the audio system in unity the one is the audio source.

30
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.800
The other is the audio listener the audio listener at the moment exists on our camera.

31
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.770
So our camera has this audio listener component you can see it has basic no properties it just acts

32
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.510
as a ear or receptor to the sounds that are coming from the world.

33
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.330
And then we've got to create an audio sources.

34
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.380
So let's start off with the first on the list which is taking damage.

35
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.450
Now we can actually do this already because we have a unity event for this.

36
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.530
So if I go and find my character's character prefab then you will see that we've got a health component

37
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.570
the health component has got a unity event and that can be used to cool things and we can use that to

38
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.120
play a audio source.

39
00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.120
So I'm going to go ahead and create a an empty game object for to put out audio source on.

40
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.590
Now you could put the audio source directly on the character but we're gonna have multiple audio sources

41
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.840
and as we'll see later audio sources are a 3D thing so we can position them relative to our character

42
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.770
we can have some at the feet if their footstep audio sources we could have some at the hands if they

43
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.240
come from the weapon or we could have them at the mouth if it comes from the player's mouth.

44
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:32.320
So what we can do is name this the damage sound and then we're going to add a component audio source

45
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.680
and let's just overview the properties for those of you not familiar with audio sources or haven't used

46
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.860
them in anger before the main properties we're going to be interested in are the audio clip the play

47
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.150
on awake the volume and the spatial blend.

48
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.290
Now by default what I'm always gonna do with these is I'm going to disable play on a wake which does

49
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.030
kind of what it says on the tin it will play as soon as this component has been created so that either

50
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:08.050
when the scene loads or when you spawn it and then there is the spatial blend which allows you to say

51
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.760
this sound is completely 2D.

52
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.840
This means that no matter where you are in the world the volume will be the same.

53
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.540
That is probably what you'd use for music and stuff like that or maybe some sorts of dialogue as well

54
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.590
and 3D is completely the opposite end of the spectrum.

55
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.050
It's entirely dependent on where you are in the world.

56
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.020
So if the audio listener is far away it will be quieter if it's close by.

57
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.470
It is going to be louder.

58
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.660
It also affects stereo.

59
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.470
So if your audio listener is facing off to the right then you'll hear it in your left ear.

60
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.020
If it's facing off to the left then you'll hear it in your right ear.

61
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.360
It does all of that sort of stuff for you automatically.

62
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.390
So generally we are going to be wanting to not play on awake and have it triggered by some sort of gameplay

63
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.240
event and we want the spatial blend to be completely 3D.

64
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.760
Now the other properties volume is pretty self-explanatory and the audio clip is the one that it's going

65
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:58.850
to play.

66
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.170
So in this case we want an ouch kind of sound effect.

67
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.120
So I'm gonna go to the SFX and have a look for an outside effect that I think is satisfactory.

68
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.700
That's quite a good one.

69
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.950
It's quite simple and slow and quick I mean so let's take our sound effect number one now.

70
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.380
One thing that we're not going to be doing in the course is random rising sound effect so that you take

71
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.440
a bunch of sound effects and choose between them or even randomize the pitch for a sound effect.

72
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.270
But this is fairly simple to implement with just an extra script on top of this that would swap out

73
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.180
the audio clips from a list using the random number generator and potentially changing the pitch between

74
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.920
a range again using the random number generator if you want to go ahead and try that then you can and

75
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.870
if you're stuck at all wondering how to do an audio randomize then why would suggest you try is going

76
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:58.990
to have a look at how the game kit 3D I believe uses an audio randomize to do this kind of thing so

77
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.900
you can see how they've implemented it there.

78
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.210
If you're getting stuck anyway that's side a side let's go back to actually triggering this event.

79
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.610
We can do it using the unity events that we've got here for take damage under health.

80
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.660
You just go ahead and add another event listener and then you can drag in the game object the damage

81
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:26.050
sound and from the dropdown we're gonna go to audio source and we're looking for a method called play

82
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:33.160
in the static methods and now hopefully if we go ahead and hit play and go up to this god and attack

83
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:41.040
him you can see he is making a sound he's making it sound as he is being hit again.

84
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.940
Obviously a randomized is going to give more polish to that sound but we're not going to cover that

85
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.690
in this lecture so other desired sound effects on Di that we can deal with weapon hit at the moment

86
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.920
we're not going to deal with until the next lecture or the lecture after that because we want to do

87
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.110
a little bit of a refactor of the weapon in order to be able to get events and make the right sounds

88
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.160
then we're going to have the projectile hit and projectile launched.

89
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.690
Now these three you can have a go at yourself if you feel confident with adding a unity event if you

90
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.230
want to see me add a new unity event first I'm going to do on die and then challenge you to do the rest.

91
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:24.580
OK so let's dive in first of all I'm going to open up the health components and that's because that's

92
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:31.720
where dying happens that's what can trigger a die event can add a new serialized field for the unity

93
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.570
event called it's gonna be of type unity event.

94
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.050
And again we don't have to do a subclass here because we're not passing anything we don't have to pass

95
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:47.890
a float on die it's just a signal saying that we have indeed died now where we're going to call this

96
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.690
now is a few places you might choose to you might choose to do it in the die method but the problem

97
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.400
with the DI method is it also gets called when we're restoring from save and we don't want death sound

98
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.370
effects happening when we travel between worlds.

99
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:06.010
So I'm going to do it in take damage which is the last time that's more basically the first time that

100
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.170
die is called.

101
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:13.630
So we're gonna have on Di dot invoke happening inside this if statement exactly when the health put

102
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.040
values are equal to zero.

103
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.220
So that's going to invoke a unity event we go back to our character and we should have a new unity event

104
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.990
crop up in here.

105
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:30.820
Now I'm going to duplicate our damaged sound and rename that to die sound and I'm also going to create

106
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:39.850
a new empty game of it to be the audio source container just call it audio sources and put these two

107
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:45.940
sounds underneath that and then the DI sound as you can see we've already because we duplicated it and

108
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:52.460
got play on awake disabled special blend is entirely 3D and then I'm going to take a death sound.

109
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.540
Let's choose that sound.

110
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.550
That's OK.

111
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.930
Maybe death sentence huh.

112
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.050
I quite like that one.

113
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:04.300
So I'm gonna use that sound too for my Di sound like that.

114
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.550
Take it over in to the audio source audio clip and let's hook it up.

115
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:19.300
So we go to the character and find that new unity event on Di drag in my Di sound object and go to function

116
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.590
audio source and play.

117
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:26.960
So hopefully now if we go ahead and hit play we should kill this God.

118
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.480
Oh he goes oh a few times.

119
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.010
Oh they go.

120
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.670
He died.

121
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.940
So that's good.

122
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:40.700
Hopefully that's not too faint for you to hear but it is basically doing what is supposed to do.

123
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.750
So now I'm going to challenge you to do the same thing for the projectile sound effects.

124
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.440
So create audio sources for projectile hits and projectile launched.

125
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.610
Also creates any unity events that you might need little hint.

126
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:57.120
Do you actually need to unity events or could you get away with less.

127
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.030
Paul's video and have a go.

128
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.390
Okay.

129
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:05.660
So hopefully you caught calling on that we might only need one unity event and indeed the projectile

130
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:11.090
launched could just be done as a play on the wake because the projectile launching actually spawned

131
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.840
something new.

132
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.380
So OK let's go and find out projectiles.

133
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.070
I'm going to start by copying audio.

134
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:25.930
Two audio sources in here and then I'm going to go into projectiles find the root arrow projectile and

135
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:33.640
I'm going to paste in those audio sources and I'm going to rename it from the launch to launch sound

136
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.080
and hit sound.

137
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.840
So now the launch sound as I said we want to make a plan a wake.

138
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.190
Cool.

139
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.890
And then we want some sound effects.

140
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:55.870
Let's go to our Sound Effect folder under game type assets SFX and we have got a I think a hit sounds

141
00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:02.380
are the ones I'm going to want to use and I think hit sound one is good for launch and I think hit sound

142
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.400
too is good for impact.

143
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:10.550
So we're gonna use launch sound is hit sound one and then hit sound too.

144
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.180
He is gonna be for the actual hit.

145
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:13.820
Okay.

146
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.820
And then we're going to go over to actually create this event.

147
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.330
So we're going to find our projectiles.

148
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.310
Yes.

149
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.270
Create a new event up at the top.

150
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:32.280
So it's going to be a serialized field type unity event and we have to include the right thing.

151
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:40.350
So using Unity engine events and then we are going to call this on hit.

152
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.150
Now where are we going to do this.

153
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:47.250
We're going to do this on our on trigger enter down here we've got a bunch of hit effects big instantiated

154
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.430
the things that need to be destroyed and actually just before all of this I'm going to do on hit invoke

155
00:11:54.950 --> 00:12:00.620
and then we can go head over to the inspector to hook this up to our hit sound.

156
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:07.550
So let's go to the root of the arrow projects I'll add a new listener on hit drag in hit sound and then

157
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.330
select the play function from the audio source.

158
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.320
And finally yeah on launch should be happening on play on a wait.

159
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.680
So let's go and get hit by some arrows shall we.

160
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.010
Don't hear that everyday.

161
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.470
Let's go over to the bridge

162
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.460
that you got.

163
00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.160
Go on impact sound and the launch sound as well.

164
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:29.960
That sounded good.

165
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.920
And we've also obviously got an hurt sound.

166
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.370
Ouch.

167
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.580
Happening when the player is being hit because the player is a character too.

168
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.040
Okay.

169
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.990
So that's all good for the arrow.

170
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.640
We're just going to do the same thing.

171
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:47.700
Take copying those audio sources going over to other projects all which is the fireball Feibel paste

172
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:53.290
in here and we're just gonna want to change out our hit sounds and link it up.

173
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.310
So add a listener for the hit sound.

174
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.220
You know how to do this by now.

175
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:04.880
And then we are going to change out sounds for some proper sound effects.

176
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.550
Now I think that hit sound five sounds like a good launch.

177
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.610
And I think the power attack hit sounds like it could impact that.

178
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:19.500
So I'm gonna use it like say say five for launch Let's just check that I got that right again.

179
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.090
Yep.

180
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:28.560
And then hit is going to be that power attack hits like so let's give this a play and see how it goes.

181
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.650
So we're going to.

182
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.060
Excellent.

183
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:37.770
That is working all of the sound effects that we wanted to implement and now implemented in the next

184
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:44.190
lecture we're going to look at how we need to modify our weapon system so that the sound effects are

185
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.950
working for weapon clashes as well as such as the sword.

186
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.390
See that.
