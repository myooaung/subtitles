00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,740
Hello and welcome in this lecture we're going to be hooking up and portals to each other.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,580
So this I can go through to the next scene.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:10,880
Okay.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,830
That's nothing new.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,290
But if I go through the other portal it actually takes me to a different place in the original sandbox

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,230
scene so we can use this to navigate across our world and we can link these portals together.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,060
Let's dive in and see how.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:32,610
So we've worked out that if we were to go into our transition level then we get teleported to this particular

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,260
portal this portal one.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,800
What.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,170
But I've got two portals in this level and I want to be able to decide which one we actually get teleported

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,030
to.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,460
So how are we going to distinguish and connect portals.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,630
Well the easiest way I find overdoing doing this and I took inspiration from the Unity 2D game kit which

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,550
is a great example project to have a look at for all sorts of things in fact we are heavily modelling

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:03,510
our transition and seen loading stuff off of the stuff that's going on on the 2D game kit and basically

17
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,810
just in general having a look at example projects is a great way to learn anyway.

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,600
That said the way we're going to do this is with an enum.

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,300
So we're going to create an enum and we're going to do it within the class.

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,470
Hopefully you've used an enum before.

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:26,070
I'm going to call my enum destination identifier and it is going to be the identifier of the destination

22
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,850
that we want to go to basically linking up the two destinations.

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:38,910
And the way I'm gonna do this is I'm just going to have a list of a b c d e and you can go on as long

24
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:45,300
as you want basically to give a number of identifiers you could do this with string references if you

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,840
wanted to but then you've got the whole issue of copy and paste when you do it with an enum.

26
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,760
I'll show you why it's really cool because if I create a serialized field that tells me the destination

27
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,860
so it's gonna have type of destination identifier and it's going to be called a destination.

28
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:10,800
If we go over into unity and wait for it to reload the code you can see that by default and enum is

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,370
a dropdown.

30
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,900
So this is a great way of making sure there are no spelling mistakes because I can say hey this portal

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:23,980
over here that's Portal A this portal over here that's portal B and that's a great start basically.

32
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,910
So let's have you do as a challenge the move to the correct portal now you've got an identifier it should

33
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,760
be fairly easy to make sure you're selecting the right portal to move to.

34
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,300
So update the get other portal method that's where you're going to be making the change and create a

35
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,420
counterpart to both portals.

36
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,340
So in transition look we've got two portals at the moment make sure there's two portals with corresponding

37
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,400
counterparts in the main sandbox scene as well.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,240
And test it out and see that you can correctly get to the other portal pause video and have a go OK.

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Welcome back.

40
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,960
So let's give this a shot shall we.

41
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:09,420
Basically we want to find a portal that isn't this portal and if the portal dots destination is not

42
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:16,770
equal to this destination so just the destination really then we also continue basically we're only

43
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,240
going to be retain the portal if it has the right destination and it's not us.

44
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,090
That should basically do the trick.

45
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:31,980
Let's go over to our sandbox scene and in here we are going to go ahead and try to to do fine.

46
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,720
So we've got portal one over here and the other portal I want to have over the bridge.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:45,300
So this is just for testing purposes obviously this isn't a game design decision that is very sensible

48
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,850
but let's try and position this so drop the portal into the world and and resizing the collider to fit.

49
00:03:52,850 --> 00:04:01,460
Then I'm gonna go ahead and start adding in the visual language of these gates and resizing them reshaping

50
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:07,790
them rotating them as Rick has been doing previously and just making a copy of this and scaling it and

51
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,680
changing it so it looks a bit higgledy piggledy and then I'm going to change the size of the collider

52
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,560
to match with these gates.

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,560
And we want to connect up this portals.

54
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:23,660
So the first portal in our level is going to destination a the second portal is going to be corresponding

55
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,110
with destination B and that's just check that out if we go over to the main scene.

56
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,020
I think I already changed this over sandbox to look at Portal 1.

57
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,450
Yes it's got destination of peace.

58
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,230
Let's try that out.

59
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:44,690
If we go from sandbox to I'm going to go over into portal B and there I am in this part of the level.

60
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:51,370
Looks like we need to rebuild that nav mesh so open up sandbox and then we can bring up the navigation

61
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,310
pane hop over there and hit back they go.

62
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:01,570
That seems to fix that issue so maybe if we go back to sandbox to now it should be better.

63
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,420
So I'm going to run through this portal and.

64
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,100
Mm hmm.

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,750
There we go.

66
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,050
Yep.

67
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,870
We were just in front of these gates.

68
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,060
If I go through the gates.

69
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,650
What happened there.

70
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,760
No reference to something.

71
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,040
What's going on.

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,720
You know I think what's happened is that we have forgotten to set the scene to load.

73
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,350
So this error message is a bit rubbish.

74
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,370
Let's improve it.

75
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm going to on our transition.

76
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:35,870
Just gonna check and say if the scene to load is less than zero then we're going to want to return and

77
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,920
not do our transition.

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,000
But we also want to print out a log message so going to be a debug dot error log error.

79
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,520
And we are going to be logging out at the scene to load is not set.

80
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,140
And notice I need to return something from this.

81
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,790
I can just return no.

82
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,980
And hopefully that will do the trick.

83
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:02,090
It doesn't seem like it actually if I hover over the return statement it kind of gives me the hint it

84
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:08,000
says if you in an iron numerator you can either do a yield return statements return a value or a yield

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,750
break to end the iteration.

86
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,050
So here we actually need to do a yield break.

87
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,540
I actually learned something new there just by the hovering over things in Visual Studio.

88
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,910
So let's give this a go now.

89
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:25,220
Hopefully we should be able to go through the transition portal and back the other way or it should

90
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,110
give us an error which I'm expecting it'll give us an error go through try and go back the other way.

91
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,400
And sure enough at saying scene to load not set.

92
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
So let's try.

93
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,490
It should be able to just click on that log message it takes me a cake to the code.

94
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,580
Not very helpful but if I open up the sandbox and select Portal 1 then I should be able to in the inspector

95
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,530
say hey I want this to load.

96
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,790
Scene one please.

97
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,710
In the build index.

98
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,250
So let's try that.

99
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,090
So playing through is not going to work because I'll get attacked too much so I'm just going to pause

100
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,090
come out and move the player towards the bridge

101
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,940
and resume some getting chased again.

102
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,970
Let's go through the portal trying to escape.

103
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,120
And there we go.

104
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,100
We load into our transition area.

105
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,440
My portal placement could be much better.

106
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,630
Fact let's try and correct that a little bit.

107
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,960
So I'm basically going to go to the sandbox scene and find that little hillock that hides an exit point

108
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,270
and just trying to road it down a little bit with its rain to say that we'll be able to see when we're

109
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,620
going in to that trigger volume we can click on it.

110
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,900
Most crucially and I'm gonna move the player towards the end of the level so that I can play through

111
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:43,520
and test so that about wraps it up for this lecture now we are able to go through portals as we intended

112
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,940
and go back to the other side a set portal and I can use this transition level to basically go from

113
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,850
the beginning to the end of our map nicely.

114
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,500
Like so now just one thing I want to finish off is I moved my player.

115
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,330
I'm just gonna move it back because I don't want Rick telling me off for spoiling his moments.

116
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,310
Great stuff.

117
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,150
The next lecture we're gonna learn how to cover up this kind of jarring moment of transition with the

118
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,250
camera bouncing around in just a sudden transition by doing a fade out and fade in.

119
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,340
See you in that lecture.
