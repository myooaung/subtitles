00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,270
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,380
In this lecture we are going to be introducing these health balls at the moment they are inert.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,600
But in the next lecture as well we are going to be looking at making them active.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,680
So let's dive in and see how great these health balls okay.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,970
So I'd like to create a health bar in very much same way as we've done with our damage text.

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,040
So for me I'm only going to put health bars on the enemy.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,840
So let's go to the enemy prefab and create an empty object which is going to be the root of our canvas.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,000
Now I want the root of our canvas to not be a canvas itself.

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,710
And we'll see why in a few minutes.

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:47,360
But basically the idea is I'm going to have a health bar prefab and I'm going to prefab this into the

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,670
game UI in game folder.

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,590
So we have this health bar prenup.

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,600
Okay let's open up the health bar prefab and under that I'm going to put the canvas.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,810
Now the reason I'm not putting the canvas at the root level is that I don't I'm going to want to change

15
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,070
things like this scale in here and the width and stuff like that.

16
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,400
And I don't want that to get messed up by where I'm including it.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:18,080
Remember that where you include a prefab often overrides the transform of the proof of the root elements

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,670
of the prefab.

19
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,680
So if you want that not to be messed with then you need to put it underneath a little parenting game

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,700
object.

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,240
So this canvas we are going to want to scale appropriately now with the text.

22
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,880
I did a bit of a hack of changing the scale factor.

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,180
Now it's not going to work very well for all UI elements.

24
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:43,170
So what we're going to do instead is the UNITY OFFICIAL way which is in the render mode.

25
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:50,630
You go and select 12 space and then you have to decide what kind of resolution you're going to be dealing

26
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,320
with.

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,140
And because this is just a health bar we don't need a lot of pixels to define this health bar.

28
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,780
I'm going to go for 100 width and 10 in height and I'm going to reset the position while I'm at it 2

29
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:10,980
0 0 0 and then we can focus in on our health bar and the aspect ratio looks about right to me might

30
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,170
struggle to see that on your screens.

31
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:20,640
Now this is going to be absolutely humongous in our world because how it's currently set up it's going

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,180
to take up 100 meters 100 unity units.

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,430
So we want to bring this down so that maybe it just takes up one meter and the way to do that is to

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,780
change the scale.

35
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:37,230
So if we wanted it to take up two meters what we would do is do two divided by whatever the width is

36
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,580
100 in this case.

37
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,920
And that would be the scale that we want in our case.

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,120
I want it to be one metre wide so it's going to be one divided by 100.

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,050
So it's going to be one hundredth knot.

40
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,280
It's gonna be nought point not one.

41
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,040
And I'm going to use that same value in the x y and z scale.

42
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,870
They don't really need it in the z and then you can zoom in on the canvas and it's going to be much

43
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,090
more small and appropriately sized.

44
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,190
You might be thinking it's quite odd to change the scale and why not just make the width and height

45
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,730
smaller.

46
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,070
Well that's because the width and the height of your canvas has a special meaning that actually tells

47
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,300
the rest of the UI rendered within the canvas how many pixels of resolution it has to render.

48
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,630
So we don't want to change those we want to have that resolution.

49
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,180
We just want to make that resolution smaller in the world.

50
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:30,090
Now in this canvas I am going to set up a background image and a foreground image and the foreground

51
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,860
image is the one we're going to scale to give us the inside of the health bar.

52
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:45,840
So I'm going to go to right click UI and image and then I am going to make this image a slightly D saturated

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,010
red and then I'm going to.

54
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,330
Okay.

55
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,540
So I want it to take its height and width from the size of the canvas.

56
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:01,650
So I am going to change the way that we are doing our anchors to select the anchor preset.

57
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,820
And just this one at the bottom right where it does kind of the width full stretch and both directions.

58
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,850
That's what I want to do.

59
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,670
And then you can see the rack transform has been modified to now instead of saying the width is saying

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,730
the distance from the left top and bottom so I'm going to set the top and bottom width to be zero so

61
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:26,730
that this red image just takes up the whole of our canvas and I'm going to rename the image to background

62
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:35,350
and what I'm gonna do is add a duplicate and put a foreground and I'm actually going to child the foreground

63
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,540
to the background and change its color to green.

64
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:48,820
Now White I child it to the background because now if I were to change the size of the background for

65
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,910
example I might bring in 20 from the canvas.

66
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,510
It actually also changes the foreground because the foreground is being sized relative to the background

67
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,390
so it's just undo that modification.

68
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:08,380
And now the foreground the way I want to be manipulating this in script to show our health is by changing

69
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,630
our X scale.

70
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,460
So if I change my X scale you will see that it is essentially bringing in from both sides.

71
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,480
I want to avoid that.

72
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,030
So how do we avoid that.

73
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,410
Well let's just make sure I've got my right transform tool on and you'll be able to see that there is

74
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:31,050
an anchor here and I can change the anchor manually or I can do it in the rect transform components.

75
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:38,810
I'm going to set my pivot to zero and I'm going to position my bar to the far left of the background.

76
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:45,730
And now what we're going to see is that if I change my scale it is behaving as we'd expect at 1 which

77
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,320
would be full health is fully green at zero.

78
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,820
It's going to be fully empty and at point five it's somewhere in between.

79
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:59,800
And then we can change this scale this along so that for now that's what I'm going to use as my preview

80
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,070
will get round to updating it in code in a later lecture.

81
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:09,160
Now many challenge for you is going to be getting this hovering above the enemy's heads and facing towards

82
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,120
the camera as we have done before pause the video and have a go.

83
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,870
So first thing is going to be to get it facing towards cameras very easy.

84
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,270
Go to the root health bar components or even the canvas doesn't really matter which one I think they'll

85
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,440
put it on the canvas.

86
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,790
And I'm going to do a face or camera face scripts going to add the camera facing script and then I'm

87
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:38,840
gonna go to an enemy so open up the enemy and you can see we've got ourselves a health bar at their

88
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,280
feet.

89
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,030
And it's one metre wide if you change the scale than that it's going to be a different sized health

90
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,360
bar.

91
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:51,200
And then we can take this health bar and bring it up just above their heads you can choose where you

92
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,940
want it above the head you might choose that with a big boss that has a lot of health you might want

93
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,400
to change the scale of the health bar so that it is bigger and looks more intimidating but in my case

94
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,190
I'm going to leave out the default.

95
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,500
Now we are going to just go and check whether the facing is working correctly.

96
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,360
Yep sure enough there are all these health balls every enemy has a health bar and is facing towards

97
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,160
us.

98
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,850
And if I go and attack them nothing happens because there's health bars I'm not actually being updated

99
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,670
correctly yet.

100
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,470
Now one more mini challenge for you we've seen how to do scaling the unity way in the health bar and

101
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,530
we haven't been doing that in our damaged text.

102
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,430
So if we can damage text prefab you can see the damage text is currently doing it using a dynamic pixels

103
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:44,150
per unit thing which is a bit weird and I'm just gonna go ahead and reset the scalar and the challenge

104
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,730
to you is going to be to reset your scalar and get things back to working but this time using a scale

105
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,780
and a width that is appropriate just like we did in the health bar.

106
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,240
Try that okay.

107
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,690
Welcome back.

108
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,870
So I'm going to go with.

109
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,510
Let's see.

110
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,000
I think about 100.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,850
Width is going to be correct here again and I'm going to go for 50 height and then we can have a look

112
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,150
at our text which is absolutely minuscule down here.

113
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:18,500
We want that to be taking up again the whole of the canvas so we can stretch in both dimensions and

114
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,600
set the top and left in all of these to zero so that it takes up all the space.

115
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,970
Double click so that we have the space available to us and you can see the text is a little bit small.

116
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,310
That's because we need to increase the font size so increase the font size a little bit.

117
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:39,480
I'm still feeling that this is very low resolution text so I might decide that 100 pixels isn't enough.

118
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,840
Let's go for 200 pixels by 100 something like that.

119
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,170
And now scale up attacks even further say increase the font size.

120
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,630
Now that's looking like about the right sort of resolution.

121
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:00,280
I'm also going to center a line in the vertical axis as well and let's see.

122
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,290
So now we just need to pick our scale.

123
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,520
So if I'm going to say that this text should be about a meter across.

124
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,150
That seems a bit large I'm gonna say it's half a meter across so point five.

125
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,930
The scale is going to be point five divided by 200 because that's the width of the rect transform.

126
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,540
And that gives us a scale value.

127
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,670
And I'm going to use that across the board and we can just go ahead and have a look and see that that's

128
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,640
still looking fine it's just much much smaller.

129
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,490
And we've got to go ahead and update the animation because if you go ahead and play at the moment and

130
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:40,400
do some damage to somebody then you'll see that in fact that's actually pretty small.

131
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,430
I think I'm going to double the scale there.

132
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:52,490
So let's we can just do that by doing a star to will increase the scale by 2 on this on that scale there

133
00:09:52,970 --> 00:10:00,170
and bring it across to the X Y and Z and just have a look in games check that it's not so small anymore.

134
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,850
Go ahead and hit this guy with five balls and that's a little bit better.

135
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,660
But you can see the animation is not quite working as it used to.

136
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,750
So we can see that that's because we've basically been monkeying around with how things are scaled and

137
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,050
so on.

138
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:23,540
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go ahead and change the location that we fade out to so take our

139
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:33,310
text and shift it up like so like we were like with him before and make sure that we keep frame it so

140
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:39,130
that we have the new values totally key framed you might have to deselect this canvas group in order

141
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,630
to do the key framing.

142
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,550
Let's try that see whether it's now going up.

143
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,840
Yes it is.

144
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,950
But you can see it's only doing it after having faded out so I'm going to just remove the key frame

145
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,080
for the anchor position that is halfway along our timeline.

146
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,290
So now it is going up and fading out after a little while.

147
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,630
Okay.

148
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,710
So that should hopefully fix up the in-game animation.

149
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,300
Let's give it a go.

150
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,300
And do some damage and see if the animation is working as intended.

151
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,510
Yes we've got 13 little no evaporating over the top of this guy's head so everything is working as it

152
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:23,170
was doing before except now we're using proper canvas scaling and just one more little tweak to that

153
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,340
damaged text at the moment.

154
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,240
If I do damage to my enemy here you can see overlaps with the health bar.

155
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:29,950
I don't like that.

156
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,340
I think we need to put that a little bit higher.

157
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,180
So let's go to character and find where that positioning is.

158
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,790
Oh actually it looks like if I select my damaged text born and that is not what does the positioning

159
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,580
of the text.

160
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:52,990
So what is doing the positioning is in the prefab it's the default value of in-game and we go to text

161
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,310
prefab you can see that this is currently positioned not at 0 0.

162
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,790
So its position is 0 0 and the damage text.

163
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:07,210
And then we can go in it to add character and in fact I'm going to go to the enemy directly so I've

164
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,400
got something to position it above and we can take our damage text spawner and just position it just

165
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,170
a little bit above the health bar so that they don't overlap one another.

166
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,420
That's the idea.

167
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,260
So that should hopefully do the trick.

168
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,360
I'm just going to apply that position back to the root character so applies override to the prefab character

169
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,990
that's what I want to do I go ahead and hit play now then hopefully if I do some damage then that text

170
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:37,710
is spawning above the health bar which is just a little bit more sane cool.

171
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,360
So in this lecture we've seen how to set up proper canvas scaling and we've applied it to our damaged

172
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,580
text and also to create some health bars next lecture we're going to be looking at setting that scale

173
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,820
of our health bar in code so that it really reflects the health of the particular enemy.

174
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,250
See you then.
