00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,390
Hello and welcome to this lecture where we're going to have a health display for the enemy as well so

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,040
it's currently the targeted enemy.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,760
So if I let this enemy you can see his health percentage and it goes down as I attack him until he dies.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,270
And the same is true for all my other enemies.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,640
I can attach tacky Archer who has a little bit less health and he dies a bit quicker.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,350
You can see the percentage of health goes down quicker.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,290
Let's dive in and see how to achieve this so we want to include health for the enemy as well.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,970
So I'm going to do is I'm just going to start off by duplicating our health labels and you can follow

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,250
along with this.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,760
I'm going to call the first one the enemy health label.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,990
Let's rename that enemy health label.

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,860
There we go.

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,550
And then the second one is going to be the enemy health and family.

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,890
So OK.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,810
And I'm going to move these two down a notch.

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,680
So we won't be seeing this in the rec too.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,320
And ideally I wouldn't be moving it to the left and right.

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,920
OK.

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,050
So there we go.

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,510
Enemy health label needs to be changed and is going to change this over to enemy like so.

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,140
So we're going to have that we can see the health and the enemy's health at the top left.

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,050
Let's see how that looks in the game that looks about right.

23
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,940
So what we want to do now is to be able to update this.

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,800
So instead of having the health display on here we're going to remove this component and instead we

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,900
are going to have to create a new health components but one for the enemy.

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,230
So I'm going to copy the health display because that is a good place to start.

27
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,630
And I'm going to pay states into combat.

28
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,180
Now you're going to ask me why am I pasting it into combat.

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,040
Can I paste here.

30
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,560
Yes I can't.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,580
We'll control V.

32
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:55,740
And I'm going to instead of calling his health is playing and call this enemy health display and I'm

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,860
going to do the same thing for the class name.

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,030
So it's going to change over to any health display like so.

35
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,870
And here.

36
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:09,600
Basically instead of getting hold of the player's health component we want to get the hold of the fighters

37
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,450
while the players fighters targets health components for what a mouthful.

38
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,770
So we currently have no way of finding out what the fighters target is.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,090
There's no public method for that.

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,100
So I'm going to scroll down to our public methods we've got this equipped weapon public method after

41
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,200
that.

42
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:34,910
Then add another public method which is going to return a game object which is going to be the target.

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,490
Or is that right.

44
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,400
Let's have a look at Target actually a health component so we can just return the health component directly

45
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,910
that's what we actually need.

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,540
I'm going to call let's get targets like so.

47
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,620
And as you can imagine it's just going to return at target variable.

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,250
Very simple get that.

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,500
So I would like you for your challenge to fill out basically replace what's going on in this enemy health

50
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,850
display with a display that actually will show the enemy's health that we're currently attacking.

51
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,640
So you're challenged to create an enemy health display so store the players fighter value in a wake

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,520
get the target from the fighter every update because Target is going to change and include a default

53
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,000
value.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,840
So if you don't have a target what are you going to display.

55
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,660
Think about that.

56
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,750
Pause the video and have a go at the challenge.

57
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,710
Hopefully this wasn't too tricky.

58
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,540
So instead of storing the health component we're going to be storing the fighter.

59
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,540
We're also going to change the name space should be RPG.

60
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,810
Combat in here.

61
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:40,130
So restoring our fighter in the awake so fighter is fine.

62
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,210
Play with Tag component is going to be fighter like so.

63
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,930
So we've got our fighter component.

64
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,410
Now what we want to do is see whether we have actually got target.

65
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:57,230
So if the fighter top the top get target is equal to no.

66
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,040
And then what we want to do is set our text and the text component to model.

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,480
Maybe just not applicable or not available.

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,860
That's what I'm going to put in there for the text and then.

69
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,600
Otherwise we want to get this health percentage.

70
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,960
So how do we get our health components.

71
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,940
Well we can get that from the fighter.

72
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:25,620
So going to do a fighter dot get target like so and we don't have health because we don't have access

73
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,600
to it.

74
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:33,150
But if we go ahead and include using resources then which is okay because combat already depends on

75
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:39,040
resources then we can go ahead and basically get access to our health component.

76
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,460
So let's see if that's working.

77
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:47,010
If I go and add the components I want the enemy health display this time like so and if I go ahead and

78
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,580
play then hopefully we should see not applicable.

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,780
There's no enemy selected.

80
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,880
But as soon as I select the enemy he's got a percentage and it decreases every time I bash him until

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
he's dead.

82
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,870
Now there's no point to issue that I'm forgetting to address you can try and investigate for yourself.

83
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,700
Many challenge to try and fix it but it will be fixed in the next lecture.

84
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,300
Don't worry.

85
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:06,930
Okay.

86
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,490
So that seems to be working.

87
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,240
If I can I can go and attack different enemies.

88
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,530
You might notice this guy has got an A and which stands for Not a number.

89
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,520
Now why was that.

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,590
If we're going to have a look at that particular guy I think it is because he's an archer and we haven't

91
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,390
assigned any health to the Archers yet.

92
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:30,480
So he just gets the default zero health and dividing by zero is something we aren't allowed to do so

93
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,410
let's just go ahead and give some health to the archers to check that hypothesis.

94
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:42,330
We go to our core progression and we go to our class I'm going to add in the archer class give level

95
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,020
1 archers health.

96
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,610
So let's give them a little bit less health than the default grunt.

97
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,820
Go ahead and hit play now.

98
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,840
Then hopefully if I go and attack that Archer he now has got 100 percent health because he's got some

99
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,690
health to divide by in calculating a percentage.

100
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,780
You see he dies much much quicker than the other guys.

101
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,370
Cool so now we have got health for the enemy and health for ourselves.

102
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,590
Well basically the current target.

103
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,640
So we've been able to look up the current target from fighter and display that and also give a default

104
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,390
value when we don't have any target currently set in the next lecture.

105
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,440
We're going to be doing something very exciting we gonna be learning about how we can have experience

106
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,720
points and gain experience points when we kill enemies.

107
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,340
So let's dive on and find out how that's done.
