00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.630
Hello and welcome in this lecture we're gonna be working on getting an animation triggered in code.

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.560
So if I go over to our capsule he starts beating it up with punches and that's the idea and when we

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.940
walk away he stops.

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.550
Eventually we'll fix that a little bit more later.

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.520
But let's go in and find how we can trigger these events.

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.430
So last lecture Rick put together the animator controller and what you actually noticed is that when

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.170
we hit play two things happen.

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.650
First of all he does the character does a punch and that probably shouldn't be happening but we can

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.300
fix that.

10
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.140
And there's another thing here that is slightly weird.

11
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.440
It is saying the player animation of hit has no receiver.

12
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.540
Why is that happening.

13
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.210
That only happens when we actually do the attack animations have to select my player and hit the attack

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.230
trigger.

15
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.230
Then you see it creates another one of these hit things but not immediately.

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.080
So what's going on that.

17
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.220
Well let's deal with that problem first then we'll come back to why the character is actually trying

18
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.140
to hit straight away.

19
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.000
So this is a an event an animation event and animation events are basically if you go to your character

20
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:17.250
controller your animation controller and select the animation you can get to the animation that we want

21
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.390
by one or two ways.

22
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.310
Basically by selecting the animation whoops I'm not meant to open it selecting the animation in the

23
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.020
animation controller or in your asset browser in the project browser basically.

24
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.210
So with the animation selected we can actually have a look at the details of the animation by going

25
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:45.890
to window and then animation and then the animation again tab and I'm going to try and dock this somewhere

26
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.330
sensible like Can I pop this down here in place of the console.

27
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:58.640
So what you've got here is a bit confusing because it's actually just like a set of locations for each

28
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.480
frame for the different bones of the character but we're not interested in that.

29
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.830
What we're interested is this bit at the top which is an animation event.

30
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.990
And basically what this animation event is saying is that when you reach the stage in the animation

31
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.460
trigger off a call to a component on this object and that's great because it does allow us to do kind

32
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.670
of a synchronous things so that when you are at the punching stage of your character's animation so

33
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.020
let's have a look at this.

34
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.940
Now what Rick did is he did it by dragging in the player which is definitely one way of doing it you

35
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.400
can drag in the player or I did it by selecting the model with it hitting the little avatar button and

36
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.530
then selecting the unity model.

37
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.910
Either way is going to work.

38
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.400
I think having a look at how the actual player does it looks kind of better.

39
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.310
So let's do that.

40
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.270
And what you can do here is you can kind of scan through the animation and you can see that that hit

41
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.100
event is happening where is it happening it's happening around.

42
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.040
I don't know.

43
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.890
Eleven seconds so we can have a look at about 11 seconds and sure enough that is where the fist would

44
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.170
be making contact with the enemy.

45
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.810
So that's great because it means that we could spawn a particle effect right here some like blood splatter

46
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.430
or may we can take the damage at this point it allows us to synchronize our gameplay events with the

47
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.050
animation.

48
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.940
So that's the idea of animations but it gives us an error if we haven't got one implemented.

49
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.280
So what we should do here is go over to one of the objects on our planet let's see what objects we've

50
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.790
got available.

51
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.220
And by that I mean the model behaviors the components.

52
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.240
So we've got an action scheduler a fighter player controller what should handle a hit event.

53
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.850
Do you think.

54
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.860
Have a little mini think about this mini challenge.

55
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.480
I think that the fighter is the logical place to do this I'm going to open that up and then we can go

56
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.090
and how do you handle a hit event.

57
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.880
Basically you have to create a void event called hit for example like so.

58
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.050
And I believe this should be enough identikit even has to be public.

59
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.660
We'll check this out in just a second.

60
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.880
Got some red squiggles here.

61
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.500
Not entirely sure why these lines will disappear when you restart Visual Studio code but I'm not going

62
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.210
to do that in this lecture just to save time.

63
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.900
Let's go ahead and hit play and see whether it wants it to be public.

64
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.460
You see even when it's not public just the same as the start and update events in unity.

65
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:25.010
So these just ignore my red squiggly span I'll get rid of the millisecond the updates and starts they

66
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.400
don't they're private they aren't public.

67
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.070
So that's the same with hit.

68
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.210
It can be a bit confusing.

69
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.900
So what I'm going to do here is put a comment above it saying that this is an animation event because

70
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.280
if you don't put a comment in there when someone comes back to read the code including yourself you'll

71
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.050
be asking why on earth is where on earth is this hit called from.

72
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.350
You know I can right click and do find all references and you won't find any references because basically

73
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.790
this isn't called from within the code it's called within the animator.

74
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.720
And that can be super confusing now as to why we're punching repeatedly if we go over to our animator

75
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.170
you can see that the attack trigger is kind of set automatically we want to switch it off by default

76
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.310
because otherwise we'll be triggering it whenever we start the game.

77
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.310
So now if I start the game I should see that my player doesn't attack which is better but he will attack

78
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.530
if I hit the trigger.

79
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.460
But I have to hit the trigger when I've got the player selected in the scene so got the player selected

80
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.910
the scene hit the trigger and he punches he punches he punches.

81
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.730
It's fantastic.

82
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.680
Okay.

83
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.510
So what we want to do is figure out how to hit that trigger from code now if you think you already know

84
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.080
how to do this then you can not even look at what I'm about to put on the challenge.

85
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.020
Because that might ruin it for you but if you don't know has to follow along what we want to do is trigger

86
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.590
this at an appropriate time for us to actually show this animation.

87
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:58.520
So have a think about that and the code that you're going to use is going to be the following line where

88
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.080
you think and character should punch.

89
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.260
Basically it's gonna be get component animator I'm going to set the trigger instead of setting float

90
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.440
began to set trigger and the trigger is going to be attack.

91
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.640
So pause the video and have a go at seeing if you can fit that in the right place okay.

92
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.820
Welcome back.

93
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.450
So we're gonna go over into the fighter jets.

94
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.120
I think this is the right place to do this and is just ignore my red squiggly lines at the moment.

95
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:31.970
So what we can do here is I think the right place is going to be when we have stopped moving.

96
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.800
When we're attacking so we know this is the attacking behavior here with an update.

97
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.040
And we've got what happens when we're out of range as we move to when we're in range.

98
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.010
We should cancel the move.

99
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.700
But we should start attacking.

100
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:51.200
So we're going to do a get component and it's going to be animator and then we are going to on animator

101
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.780
core set trigger.

102
00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:02.510
And here is where I really urge you to copy and paste the trigger name because I can guarantee you might

103
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.430
get it wrong this time but one time you aren't going to get it wrong so hopefully that does the trick

104
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.950
should set the trigger when we get within range.

105
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.530
Let's go and play and try it out.

106
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.320
So I am not currently triggering any animation.

107
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:21.790
I go over to a cube cube capsule and he attacks attacks attacks as quickly as he can.

108
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:27.200
And then if I move away yet there's a little bit of delayed animation stopping we'll fix that at some

109
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.010
point but it's generally good.

110
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.590
Now I just want to tidy up a little bit here because this update method is getting a little bit crowded.

111
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.930
What I'm gonna do is I'm just going to extract out this line 24 that is currently just setting the attack

112
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.960
trigger to make it more meaningful and going to extract it into a method with a little light bulb and

113
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.020
rename it with F2 to attack behavior.

114
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:55.440
Now this is partly because I know that we're going to extend expand this method further my auto complete

115
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.150
works I'm just going to correct it slightly.

116
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.840
We're going to expand this method further and do more stuff than just setting an attacks such as applying

117
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.280
damage and so on so forth.

118
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:10.250
So this is why I'm making it a function but also because it documents say in the update loop you know

119
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.900
we've got move to move cancel and then attack behavior.

120
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.650
So it really makes it clear what that's going to do.

121
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.820
Anyway we've got some attacking in place.

122
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.320
We've eliminated all our errors.

123
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.170
I'll see you in the next video where we will be working on slowing down his attacking because frankly

124
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.900
it's currently is all back to back as fast as he can go.

125
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.500
We're going to make that slowed down by a configurable amount.

126
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:33.890
See that.
