Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:13.100
In this lecture we're going to be adding sound effects to our sword and to our punches and we're also

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.540
going to be increasing the volume by bringing our microphone or the audio listener closer to the character

4
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.030
in question so that we can hear the sound effects from their point of view.

5
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.010
Let's dive in and see how so.

6
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.920
Let's try and get some sound effects working for our sword now.

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.020
The sound effect I think that works for the sword is this hit sound three which sounds like a metallic

8
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.050
clash.

9
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.880
And the way we're gonna do this is we're gonna go over to our weapons prefabs the sword and the equipped

10
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.310
sword prefab and create ourselves a new empty game object.

11
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:57.480
We're going to use for an audio source so I'm going to call this the hit sound and I'm gonna go ahead

12
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.330
and add a component called audio source and then use the audio clip that we had just selected so it

13
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.050
was hit sound three and not play on a wake and set the special blend to 3D.

14
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.620
Now we want to hook it up from the weapon script which currently has the unity event.

15
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.120
So we need to ask ourselves a simple unity event.

16
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.490
So it's gonna serialize field unity events and then we're going to make this unity event called on hits

17
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.640
with a lowercase o as opposed to the uppercase o of the method and then we want to include the using

18
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:42.270
Unity engine events to catch up with that and then we are going to make sure that we invoke this in

19
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.550
on hit like so and then we can go over and link this up in the prefab so we add a listener.

20
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:59.670
We drank in game objects we select at play function and then if we go ahead and hit play pick up a weapon

21
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:09.960
go and attack this God oh oh oh oh you can hear that metallic clanging sound going on there.

22
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.250
So that sounds good.

23
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.120
That's what we want.

24
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:20.640
Let's go on the bank and actually a little mini challenge for you is to do the same thing for the punching

25
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.190
sound.

26
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.480
There's no currently a punching sound you will need to create a prefab for the fist that doesn't have

27
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.280
any visible objects to it and so that you can have an audio source in that prefab.

28
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.200
So go ahead and give it a go.

29
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:44.200
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna go down to our weapons and create a new folder to store unarmed

30
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.400
stuff in and match against just duplicate the equipped sword and bring the equipped sword into unarmed

31
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.810
and then I am going to rename it to equipped unarmed

32
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.210
and then in that prefab I can go ahead and delete the reference to the other sword prefab and we've

33
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.380
got our hit sound.

34
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.200
I want to change the hit sound to a different sound effect I think.

35
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.520
SOUND EFFECT Five is good for it.

36
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:24.790
So I'm gonna use that a in my hit sound like so and it should already be hooked up because we duplicated

37
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.360
the prefab.

38
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:33.010
Then we should be able to go to our weapon resources unarmed and hook up the equipped prefab for unarmed

39
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.900
so that that will be spawned.

40
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:46.280
And now if I go ahead and hit play and I go up to this enemy you can hear that there is a thud when

41
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.820
he hits me.

42
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.320
So now we've got sound effects for both of the weapon and for what both of the weapons the unarmed and

43
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.990
the sword the ones should make sounds when they hit the bow and the fireball make sounds when they launch

44
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.470
projectiles.

45
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.740
So that's okay.

46
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.690
Now that pretty much wraps up for Santa Fe.

47
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.060
So I wanted to create one thing I'm noticing is that the sound effects are quite quiet.

48
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.900
Part of the reason for this is that our camera is all the way out here and the listener therefore is

49
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.490
also all the way out here so it's actually really far away from the sounds.

50
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.160
So it's not picking up a lot on the sounds if we go ahead and hit play we can actually see this in action.

51
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.690
If we go into our scene you can see that here we've got the camera all the way out here listening in

52
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.040
to events that are taking place all the way down here.

53
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.760
So a very long long way away.

54
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.220
And that's not what we probably want.

55
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.560
So two solutions.

56
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.590
This one you might think okay let's.

57
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.040
We've got a character let's put the listener on the character's head.

58
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.680
So we hear things as if we are the character.

59
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.330
Now that might seem like a good idea at first but then if you actually try it out and I do recommend

60
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.640
that you do give it a go.

61
00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.620
You will notice that it's going to change the stereo of your sound depending on which way the character

62
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.520
is facing and that believe me is really really weird when the character is facing towards you and the

63
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.000
stereo is essentially inverted to what you see.

64
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.420
So a better solution that I found is to imagine you have kind of like a camera boom you have a boom

65
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.570
microphone that is coming down from the camera and is coming closer to the player and then you can tweak

66
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.890
how close you want the listener to be to the player.

67
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.770
And that's what I have decided to do.

68
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.050
So we're going to go to our camera prefab and we've currently got our listener attached to the camera

69
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.400
directly.

70
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:45.690
We're gonna create a new empty object to be the mike boom and we're gonna put the audio listener on

71
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:55.670
here directly and we are going to remove the audio listener from the camera and then I'm going to move

72
00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:03.200
the mike boom just a little bit away from the camera just down the front line of the camera and what

73
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.560
we should be able to do is when we hit play we can then adjust this more specifically dependent on the

74
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.430
distance from the plan.

75
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:20.450
So if we go over into our scene and find the camera object and the core camera and want to find the

76
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:26.240
mike boom and the mike boom is actually quite close to the plate already I might move it up a little

77
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.480
bit.

78
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.090
So it's just about above overhead but you can see how the stereo here is going to work because if an

79
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.990
event happens over here then we're going to hear it in the right way.

80
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.900
If an event happens over there it's going to happen in the left ear and it will work based on where

81
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.570
we're looking from our perspective but it also be a little bit up closer to where the character is so

82
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:54.120
that we're hearing things based on our characters location which is the two things that we really want.

83
00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:01.250
So I'm gonna go ahead and copy the component values from mike boom transform and I'm going to apply

84
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.250
them in mike boom in the prefab place of component values in there.

85
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:15.140
And if we go ahead and hit play now then we should be hearing these sounds a little bit louder and oh

86
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.500
oh oh perfect.

87
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.830
We are also hearing the stereo effect a little bit.

88
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:28.550
So you could notice that if you have stereo headphones or speakers then we were hearing that the attack

89
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:34.810
sounds were coming over from our right when we were attacking a player on our right.

90
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.520
If I move further away this is more obvious.

91
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:43.220
If I attack him with a fireball you can hear it mostly in your left ear and it gets quieter the further

92
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.570
away I am.

93
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.570
And the same will be true when I am being attacked by these guys over here.

94
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:56.090
Oh you can hear that the impact sounds are much louder than the sounds of the arrows being set off because

95
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.370
that is happening further away.

96
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.320
But we are closer to the character now.

97
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:04.410
And so things just seem to work much better with that boom arm microphone case.

98
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.770
I mean this lecture we've done two main things we've added some sound effects and unity events to our

99
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.450
weapons.

100
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:16.640
We've also brought in and like flying a bit closer to our player and still able to have the stereo effects

101
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.520
working correctly.

102
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.730
I'll see you in the next lecture.
