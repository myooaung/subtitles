1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,110
Hello again.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,720
Welcome.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,370
In this video we're just making ourselves a really simple second sandbox scene.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,460
Say that quickly so that we have a place to load into and save from so that we can start working on

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,370
our scene management functionality.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,560
So a little bit hard to do scene management with just one scene.

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,900
So again to make ourselves a second one let's jump in and get started.

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,410
You're probably gonna hear me use the words scene and level a little bit interchangeably when it comes

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,820
to what we're doing here because technically this is a level we interact you go through your exit.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,900
It's also a moment because we've made this as a moment based upon all the things we've talked about

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,320
and unity names each of these things as a scene.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,260
This is a scene file so we could also call it a scene.

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,910
So you know I'll probably be calling it is a level that's just what I have in my brain and what I'm

14
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:56,120
going to do is create a mechanism where I see this entry point and that exit point or that entry exit

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,840
point over there I'm going to pretend there's another level just in here.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
So it's just going to be a small little thing with a play I can run from one end to the other.

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:10,140
And then as Sam is hooking up the save and load functionality will have a little portal here and then

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,510
we also have a little portal down there just so we can make a little bit of a loop the whole way through

19
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,100
which I think would be a little bit nice.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,000
And the first thing I do is just delete my code over here.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,750
My code that I've been using as prototyping thank you for that we don't need it more.

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:30,020
Now we have our sky back again and what I will do super quickly is before I jump into the next scene

23
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:36,380
is I'm gonna grab a copy or I'm going to duplicate the fence that I've got here moved the fence over

24
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,950
to this kind of entry exit point just so I can get a little bit of language to the player or to ourselves

25
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,260
as well that when we see these fences that means we're entering a different area or about to load into

26
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,590
something just to see if that makes sense if that's a good system

27
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,600
just quickly play make sure that looks okay.

28
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,520
Run run run run run run run run run run.

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:00,880
Okay.

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,690
And then that's around when that tree gets in the way that's around where we would want to load which

31
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,920
I think is cool.

32
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,180
Okay.

33
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,450
So we've done that little bit talking let's save that up now what we need to do before we go and jump

34
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,440
into our next scene is to make sure we've got the right things prefab so our player is prefab.

35
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,750
Make sure I had forgotten to do any overrides.

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,920
Yep that's looking good.

37
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,920
We have our one directional light that's probably gonna be the same our camera.

38
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,620
We haven't prefab down our camera.

39
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:31,270
When I say we I should say me because I haven't prefab the camera so I'm going to find my game and then

40
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,250
Cor in here we've got the follow camera.

41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,890
That's the old flow camera which are going to delete.

42
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,010
Yes you can delete that.

43
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,560
So grab our current camera drop that in grab our follow camera drop that in.

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,090
We'll see if there's anything we need.

45
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,770
We've got our enemies our prefab.

46
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,450
Yes.

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,750
And cinematics we don't need to take our cinematics over.

48
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,330
So I think this is looking pretty good.

49
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,060
It's really just player and camera that we need to get in there.

50
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,990
So going to save this up and now we want to go to file new scene you've probably done this a million

51
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,850
times when you've been making games.

52
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,690
Now we will start by saving our scene Save As.

53
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,940
What do we want to save it.

54
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,320
Well into the scenes on call is sandbox to not the best name in the future we'll do a little bit better

55
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,320
without naming but for now fast and loose with our sandboxes so it's perfectly fine going to right click

56
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:24,820
Create a 3D object terrain drop that in make it way smaller than it wants to be at the moment.

57
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,200
Make this 100 by 100.

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
Just guessing that's an okay size.

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,330
Make sure we go on to liking and where are we.

60
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,160
He auto generate.

61
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,120
Turn that off so it's not sitting there trying to do the lighting over and over.

62
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,730
So my 0 0 looks like it's right in the middle if I drop it in a player.

63
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,360
So we'll go to our core characters.

64
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,860
They drop the player into the hierarchy then right click reset transform it's way up in that corner

65
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,340
over there.

66
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,170
So that looks to be at 0 0 corner which means I'm going to grab my train.

67
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,810
Move it to minus 50 and minus 50 on the X and on the z because I like to have my terrain my world right

68
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,820
in the middle if I've got something centered in my 0 0 side is reset the player back to 0 0 I'd like

69
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,380
to have it centered in the middle.

70
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,280
Now let's just quickly sketch out where we're going to do our level like before.

71
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,240
There's parts of this video I'll speed up if I think you don't need to see them and other bits where

72
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,050
I'll talk you through it.

73
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,570
So we need to bring in our terrain textures.

74
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:29,090
So over on terrain click the paintbrush paint texture edit terrain layers add layer.

75
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,680
Now because we've got these already we shouldn't have to go and create them from scratch.

76
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:44,060
So double click on dirt edit add layer green grass edit add layer like dirt hit it add layer light green

77
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,290
grass so you can see that they weren't automatically part of our scene because the terrain layers are

78
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,030
scene specific each scene you're gonna have to go on set up your layers all over again but if you've

79
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,770
already made them created them and tweak them then it's as easy as just going add layer as I did just

80
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,040
there.

81
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,990
And the challenge of coffee is to make a second sandbox level be clear on where the player can enter

82
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,940
and exit your scene and it's up to you how much polish you want to put into it.

83
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,160
I'll be making mine really quick and dirty I'm not gonna put a lot of time and effort into it I'm going

84
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,150
to make it so it's quite small so that when we're testing out our entrance and exit we don't have to

85
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,520
run a whole way through our level to do that.

86
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,690
So I'm going to create my See now I'm going to speed up the video so you can see all the action you

87
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,850
can create yours at the same time or watch me make mine and then make yours as well like say if you

88
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,110
want you can just have a flat ground plane and that's it you can be done you don't have to put a lot

89
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,060
of effort into it but if you do here's a good chance of flex your level creation muscles again I can

90
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,050
start off by just painting on the ground where I think my level should go through you can see those

91
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,600
two dots pretty close because I just wanted to be a close little sandbox level just trying a few different

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,740
brushes here to see what look I think looks good for my eyes sort of mountains around the outside to

93
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,890
sort of splash them around leaving not much space in the middle like I say this is really sand boxy

94
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,050
just so I've got a short path to go from A to B painting some stuff Brown you can see I'm accidentally

95
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,280
gonna make myself another terrain here I'll delete that later on.

96
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,490
Not sure how that happened I didn't see that as I was creating it to be honest okay.

97
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,810
Putting in some trees for the different sort of the other sort of tree that I've got the asset pack

98
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,560
you some of the trees are going to get in the way of the camera later on so might need to tidy those

99
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,600
up but just slapping them down putting the path along the pathway finding my fence so I can have my

100
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,370
language to the player this is where we enter this is where we exit just the same as I did at the end

101
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,800
of my other level and then what are we doing here duplicating putting the fences down the other end

102
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:39,200
became my terrain to sandbox to terrain so it's putting the cameras and see if this actually works properly

103
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,530
so where are we looking for that under core we're dropping our camera and drop in our follow camera

104
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:53,560
the follow camera we need to change the flow to be the player okay make sure navigation bake we take

105
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:01,500
our NAV mesh so that we do have one k now let's click on play see what happens here okay.

106
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:06,700
Run run run run it's kind of cool sideways that's not the way I'd intended it but not too bad so I'm

107
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:15,270
just gonna tidy up my trees the closed side to the camera now make sure this is all okay that our character

108
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,130
can move around yet through the gates and I'll just put a little bit more of an obvious barrier down

109
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,050
the end here that you've reached the end

110
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,530
okay.

111
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,370
It's looking pretty good.

112
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,890
One last final play to make sure everything's in order as we're expecting.

113
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,840
Looks my light is still baking or maybe I need to change up the sort of light I having in there.

114
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,650
I'll get rid of that one last tree but then run run run run run.

115
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,160
And then we have our other load area.

116
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,070
So super simple there's not much going on with this level.

117
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,480
The last thing I need to do is throw in a skybox.

118
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,840
So where did I bring in my skybox asset packs.

119
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:57,140
It was box phobic I believe skybox undamaged materials skybox drop the skybox in the same skybox.

120
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,300
There we go.

121
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,260
Probably a little bit silly me having all these trees in the level so I'm gonna go and get rid of all

122
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,050
these ones up the back here that we're never going to see okay.

123
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:13,440
That's looking a little bit nicer to save up my level while my video was posed my lights have finished

124
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,040
baking and then let's finish up with little bit to tidy up.

125
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,900
I'm going to create myself an empty.

126
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:25,170
I will rename this to be core as we did in the previous scene reset the transform on that grab the player

127
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,690
the camera the follow camera drag those into core the I've made a bit of a mess here I've got two terrains

128
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,240
let's see that terrain looks like that one there and the one that I renamed sandbox 2 terrain Sorry

129
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,430
that was actually some sort of mis click.

130
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,450
So the two I'm going to delete that.

131
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:45,190
Then the terrain I've got in my scene I will call this sandbox to terrain.

132
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,890
Click on assets I can see I've got these two terrains here one is new terrain that looks kind of like

133
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,380
what I've slept down in there and terrain data doesn't look like we need that one there so I'm gonna

134
00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:02,330
delete that and this new terrain I'm going to rename sandbox to terrain.

135
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,660
So this terrain now should match this terrain in our scene.

136
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,350
And I'm going to drag this terrain into my scene a little bit messy I know but I think we got there

137
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,130
in the end.

138
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,740
It's got this one terrain.

139
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,680
Let me just reduce my photo size here so it's a little bit more civil.

140
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,570
This sandbox I'm going to drag in a sandbox too so that should belong in the right place.

141
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,730
The scenes we've got at this higher level so I can see them easily.

142
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,380
Great sandbox to terrain.

143
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,240
I'm going to drag into my environment.

144
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,170
Game Object.

145
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,290
Excellent directional light into my core main camera we don't need because we've got ourselves our fellow

146
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,360
camera everything in there should now be complete save that up zoom back in a little bit.

147
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,140
Click on play just a final check to make sure it works.

148
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes it does awesome.

149
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:46,540
Okay.

150
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:46,940
It's pretty good.

151
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,370
That's it for me for now.

152
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,630
