00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,500
Hello again in this video we're going to use one key game design metric so that we can figure out how

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,820
many hit points our player should have and our enemies should have and how much damage they should do

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,690
when they hit each other.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,100
So let's jump in and get started.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,770
Now we need to make a meaningful contest between the player and the enemies how do we do that we've

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,630
got some tuning values that we can play around with if you have a look at the player we've gone our

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,170
damage that the player is going to do we've also got our health.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,210
So over 100 health and 5 damage we have similar numbers on our enemies.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,620
Let's talk about some game design and the game design problem specifically how many hit points do we

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,740
give our player do we give our enemy do we give tougher enemies do we give weaker enemies.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,270
And how much damage is dealt by the player and by enemies.

12
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,380
And here's the solution that I'm gonna use for this game design problem.

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:57,470
I'm gonna link my decisions back to one central metric that metric is hits to kill.

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,980
So in other words how many hits should it take to kill something.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,830
And I link all of my tuning back to that.

16
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,450
In the future we're going to be making ourselves some nice big old spreadsheets.

17
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,340
But for now we just want to come up with one number that feels good.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,280
And then once we've got that number we can modify it with simple formulas for things like what's the

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,020
player's current level so if I'm at level 1 What should my hit points be if I'm at level 2 what should

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,190
my hit points be.

21
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,430
Also taking into consideration the enemy's current level so I like to think of it.

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,800
If I'm at a particular level and the enemy is one level higher then how many hits should it take to

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,590
kill them then if they're two levels higher.

24
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,240
How many hits three levels and so on so we can come up with a mechanism for saying this is a tough enemy

25
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,810
because it takes for example 20 hits to kill or is this is an easy enemy because it takes just one hit

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,870
to kill and we can also take into consideration with our formula the bonuses for buffs.

27
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:58,760
In other words if you give yourself extra boosts or spells also for weapons and so on.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,200
But as I mentioned or that spreadsheet goodness is gonna come later on in the course we just want to

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,540
get our moment feeling good.

30
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,160
So here's the process I recommend you go through first of all play your game and see how many hits feels

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,800
right for the player to kill the enemy.

32
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,650
That's what we gonna do right now in this step one.

33
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,140
So I've got my player.

34
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,100
It currently has or he currently has weapon damage of five.

35
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,250
I'm gonna put that to tend just to give it a nice even number.

36
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,620
Now if I want to run up and take let's see four hits to kill the enemy then how many hit points the

37
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,460
enemy need.

38
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,210
Or how much health IT needs.

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,590
40 so 40 points and 10 points each.

40
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,320
So it's going to take four hits to kill the enemy.

41
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,970
So I'm going to find out as grab my enemy bring it over he will have this fight on the breach so I don't

42
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,090
have to keep running in every time and have you guys watch me run all the way.

43
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,720
So we have 40 hit points on this particular enemy.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,520
Health points I run up.

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,850
Okay.

46
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,400
He's come back to his patrol point that worked well Rick.

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,730
One two three four.

48
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,200
That felt okay for.

49
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,550
For punching for fists I mean if we haven't had a sword it might be different there's so many variables

50
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,500
that we're gonna be playing around with later on but for justice point of the moment how many hits to

51
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,740
punch someone to death for seems okay.

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,030
I'm going to go with for for the moment now.

53
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,450
The next step in the process is to play your game and see how many hits feels right for the enemy to

54
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,890
kill the player.

55
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,760
If I was to put the number of hits to kill the player at say 10.

56
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,100
Then after fighting two and a half enemies I'm going to be dead.

57
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,560
Do I want that in my moment though I want to create a moment where the player has to run the whole way

58
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,300
through the level and avoid fights.

59
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,740
Probably not.

60
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:44,230
So I think at this point I'm going to say I think around about 20 hits to kill the player.

61
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,370
I don't see how that goes.

62
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:52,820
Step three is to pick a starting health for our player and when I say starting health I mean just a

63
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,180
health.

64
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,110
Now while we're playing around with it while we're prototyping this could also be the health of your

65
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,270
plan at level 1.

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,740
But for now just pick a health level for me I'm going to go back into my character find the player and

67
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,010
give the player 200 health points.

68
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,150
If the enemies are also doing 10 points of damage to me then 200 means 20 hits.

69
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,790
He's going to kill me and then step four is to set enemy damage based upon how many hits it should take

70
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:23,230
to kill the player and then step 5 is to repeat steps 3 and 4 the health points for the enemy.

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,860
So how many health points should they have and the damage that the player does when the player hits

72
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,100
the enemy.

73
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,620
So I rush through those last couple of little bits because I didn't want to give you all of my solutions

74
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,400
in one go.

75
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,380
I want to give you a challenge to tune your combat determine your hits to kill and then set the health

76
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,540
points for the player and for the enemies and then to set the damage down and for bonus points you might

77
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,920
want to have a tougher enemy in there.

78
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,240
That's cool.

79
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,210
And then to play test and remember these numbers will change.

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,870
I'll absolutely change when we give the player a weapon it's all going to change when we change armor.

81
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,660
It's all going to change.

82
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,880
So for now it's just a starting point to get into the flow of how we can go out shooting this moment.

83
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,680
So it's a cool moment.

84
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,140
So jump in combat and I'll see you back here when you done okay.

85
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,960
Let's wrap up the last couple of BTR so weapon damage for the player 10 it's already done.

86
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,260
Health points 200 are already done.

87
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,670
I'm going to click on my enemy here and let us see.

88
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,540
Health points 40 yes and then damage dealt.

89
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,130
To put that up to 10 in the future I might make that different but it kind of seems logically okay.

90
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,060
They punch me for 10 I punch then them for 10.

91
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,010
That's okay.

92
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,750
Now I'm going apply some of these back to the prefab so I'm going to apply the fighter scripts yes apply

93
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,360
that to the enemy the health.

94
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,170
Apply that to the enemy as well not to the character.

95
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,020
Character because that would change the player.

96
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,350
But we're going to apply it to the enemy prefab and the enemy II controller.

97
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:49,630
Okay.

98
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,860
That's got to do with the chasing so I don't want to change that at the moment so that should have changed

99
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,130
if we just go click on our enemies they should all now have ten and forty ten and 40.

100
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,780
Okay cool.

101
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:04,620
It's going to put my enemy back where he belongs and I think I will create a slightly tougher enemy.

102
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:13,570
So I'm going to find just my first enemy duplicate that first enemy drag that enemy down the end here.

103
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,690
Okay just f to focus in swinging around a little bit.

104
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:19,920
Okay.

105
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,820
We haven't developed our system just yet for how we are naming our enemies who they are.

106
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,110
Are they soldiers is this big soldier.

107
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,750
For now I'm just doing it fast and loose where we'll take this one enemy.

108
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,840
I'll rename it in here.

109
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,620
But notice how I'm not creating another prefab variant just yet.

110
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:46,820
I'm just gonna say tough enemy and I'm going to change his color so go into Sinti materials let's see.

111
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,750
Just scrolling now is control and scroll wheel to scroll in and out zoom in and out here so texture

112
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,760
black.

113
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,410
There we go.

114
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,870
Just so he looks a different color.

115
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:01,070
So says I'm a slightly different enemy and how shall I make it a different enemy.

116
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,070
How did the kill or hurt the player more.

117
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:10,790
You know I'm going to give this guy just double the number of hip points 80 he points and same weapon

118
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,240
damage.

119
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,590
So if the player was just a blip but up the middle here he's probably not going to arrive with enough

120
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,510
hip points to kill the enemy which is cool that's kind of encouraging you to either find a better way

121
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,040
to hit them without them hitting you or to go around the track so save that up.

122
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,660
Let's just quickly check that works.

123
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,340
I'm going to run past my initial enemies.

124
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,310
Which side note.

125
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,580
That's something in our design that we need to make sure the player doesn't just run past everyone and

126
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,850
say I don't care who is going to run to the end of the level this guy's doing some wondering which I

127
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,610
don't want so I have to change that.

128
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,750
Okay.

129
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,300
Fighting fighting fighting.

130
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,680
All good and it feels like staying bit too long to kill that guy but all in all pretty good.

131
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,000
I've got a tough enemy.

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,740
I need you just change his patrol routes.

133
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,560
We'll do a little bit more on the patrol routes in the next video and tuning where the enemies are moving.

134
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,300
But for now we've got our hit points and our damage figured out.

135
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,510
Hopefully you had good success with yours and I'll see you again shortly.
