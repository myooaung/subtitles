00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,030
Hello and welcome in this lecture we're going to be adding an experience component like this one down

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,150
here as you can see I start off with zero experience points.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,160
But if I go and clobber this god and knock out his lights then what you see is my experience increases

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,320
and if I go on to kill more guards it goes up and up and up and up.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,410
So we're gonna dive in and see how that's possible and how we can make it so those gods depending on

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,560
what level they're at.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,670
Give us a different amount of experience points so here's the plan for this lecture what we want to

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:43,570
achieve is that when the enemy is attacked the enemy health knows who the instigator of the attack was.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,040
So by instigator we mean the person who initiated the attack.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,970
Then if the enemy is killed in this particular attack what we're gonna do is get the experience points

11
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,960
for the.

12
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,640
That should be awarded based on the particular enemy that we've killed we'll get out from base stats

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,460
so the progression tells us how the experience points of the enemy progress as we get to higher and

14
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,840
harder levels maybe an archer is worth more experience points than a grunt.

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,150
Things like that those are the kinds of decisions you can make.

16
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,010
So we're gonna get that from base stance then we're going to get the instigators experience which is

17
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,140
gonna be a new component that we're going to create a new resource essentially we're gonna get hold

18
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,840
of the experience see if it has one and if it does we can award experience points to its experience

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,760
component.

20
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,950
So that is the outline of the lecture this is what the flow that we want to do.

21
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,920
So how does this line up with our code.

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,640
Well if we go and have a look at visual studio we're talking a lot about the health component particularly

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,780
the enemy's health component.

24
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:51,790
So we've got this take damage and intake damage what we're going to do is if we are dying we want to

25
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:57,940
award experience points but we have mentioned in here that we need to know who the instigator is when

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,710
we take damage.

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,320
And at present we don't know that.

28
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,450
So I'm going to change take damage so that it takes in an instigator as well.

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:13,330
So the type will be game object instigator and obviously this is going to cause us issues in other parts

30
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,620
of the code base where this no longer works.

31
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,980
So for example the fighter no longer has it doesn't doesn't work because we don't have the instigator

32
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:27,640
Well that's easy we can just say pass in the game object that will be the instigator because we're the

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,940
person doing the damage on the target but there's also another place which is the projectile and the

34
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,050
projectile does not have an instigator set.

35
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,880
So we don't have anywhere in here a way to refer to who shot the projectile.

36
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,100
So the projectile itself when it has set targets we're going to have to set up who the instigator was

37
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,890
as well.

38
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,730
So I'm going to create a new state variable for the projectile type game object.

39
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,460
We're going to call it the instigator.

40
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,780
Start off as normal by default.

41
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,060
And this instigator we want to set through our set target.

42
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,040
So I'm going to add in a variable we've got the target we've got the instigator we've got the damage

43
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:16,510
so then this dot instigator is going to equal the instigator argument that comes into set targets and

44
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,510
that means that hopefully now and take damage in on trigger enter as well as passing in the damage we

45
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,220
can pass in the instigator and that at least fixes up projectile.

46
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,230
But now our weapon script is the one that does the launching and you can see that we're kind of having

47
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,820
to hop back here.

48
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,620
So set target.

49
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,370
No it doesn't have an instigator.

50
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:43,000
So we need to pass in an instigator but we need to pass that into launch projectile as well so left

51
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,160
hand right hand target.

52
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,920
And then the game object instigator as well.

53
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,250
And finally that should take us back up to fighter actually launches the projectile and we can pass

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,810
in the instigate game object with our projectile.

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,300
So that's done a few hops.

56
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,830
Let's just review that shall we.

57
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:09,340
We've gone into launch projectile which is in the weapon script which then goes in to the projectile.

58
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:17,440
So set an instigator as a variable here that gets later used on trigger enter where we take damage finally

59
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,750
to the health component.

60
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:25,870
So that basically the health component can know who its instigator was who actually gave us this damage

61
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,180
and this killing blow so that we can award the appropriate experience points.

62
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,590
So hopefully that all makes sense.

63
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,810
So the next thing is that we want to get the experience points from base stats and we don't currently

64
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,750
have a stat for that but we are going to look at more general stats in the next lecture.

65
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:53,560
So for right now I'm just going to have a get xp method and in fact I'm going to rename it to experience

66
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,680
reward.

67
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,030
So we've got the experience reward coming back from there and I'm just going to return 10.

68
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,680
So everything gives us 10 experience when we kill it.

69
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,920
That's a straightforward assumption at the moment.

70
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,360
Obviously we're going to want to look up in the progression later on but I think what we're going to

71
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,620
actually have to do is make all these different types of stats into E names and that's gonna be the

72
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,520
subject of a future lecture.

73
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,140
So we've got the experience reward.

74
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,450
Okay.

75
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,290
What next.

76
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,650
The instigator gets the X sorry we get the instigators experience.

77
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,530
We don't have an experienced class.

78
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,180
So what does that look like.

79
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:35,860
Well we're going to go ahead and create a new class so and the resources in fact create a new file called

80
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,790
experience

81
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,810
and we're going to make a mono behaviour in here that's going to reflect very much the same as the health

82
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,200
component so it's going to be a namespace RPG.

83
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:54,350
Dot resources and then they experience what does experience need to have.

84
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,270
Well we need to keep track of our experience points.

85
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:03,450
So we're going to have some state called the make it serialized field so we can see it serialized field

86
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:12,840
float experience points and we're gonna start off at zero and we're going to need a method to call in

87
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,630
order to award experience points.

88
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:24,540
So I'm going to have it void and just call it gain experience and in here we're going to take the flight

89
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:32,220
value of the experience that is gained now very straightforwardly these experience points just get increased

90
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,730
by plus equals.

91
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,380
The argument that we've passed in the experience so that pretty much sums up what experience does.

92
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,930
It just grows over time as we call this experience method.

93
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,070
So I think that just leaves us with enough for a challenge that in the health components I would like

94
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,670
you to do the final bits of awarding the experience.

95
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:00,420
So you need to get the experience from the base stats get the instigators experience components and

96
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,070
then gain points on it by the appropriate amount and go and check in the inspector that when you're

97
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,150
killing the enemies you are gaining experience obviously it's not going to be safe just yet.

98
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,840
That's going to be a subject of a future lecture as well post video and have a go okay.

99
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,980
Welcome back.

100
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:23,710
So first of all I'm going to just create a method called ward experience and it's going to have to take

101
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:31,450
in the instigator like so and I'm going to go ahead and also create that method in health.

102
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:38,710
Got this award experience it's a private song and put it under and get percent and under die because

103
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,110
it's a bit more specific than that.

104
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,370
And what we're going to do.

105
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:48,910
Well first of all we want to get hold see if the instigator actually has so get components does it actually

106
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,130
have an experience component festival.

107
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,970
Does it have an experience component.

108
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,460
And if it does have an experienced component then we want to do some stuff.

109
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,210
So festival was just store that

110
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:13,270
so storing the experience and then we can say if experience is null then we can just return.

111
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,890
So if it's no to a quick return out of here.

112
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:25,880
Otherwise with our experience we aren't going to gain experience points by how much.

113
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,470
Well that's going to depend on get components and then we're going to get.

114
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:42,480
Remember the base stats and from base stats we are going to get our experience reward which at the moment

115
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,530
is fixed but later on down the line will not be will flesh that out.

116
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,390
So that's it.

117
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,620
Basically this is going to return how much experience we should reward.

118
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,740
This tells us who we should award it to and so on and so forth.

119
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,100
So let's dive in and see if that works.

120
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,310
So I'm gonna go ahead and hit play.

121
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,590
Some no references why there's no reference is happening.

122
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,960
Well it looks like I forgot to do an early return here.

123
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,700
Sorry about that.

124
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,280
Folks must been screaming at me about that.

125
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:16,140
That basically wants to set it to N.A. and then return early so hopefully this didn't put you off too

126
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,130
much in the last lecture.

127
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,740
Now go ahead and hit play.

128
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,090
And now we've gotten those errors.

129
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:28,770
I can attack the enemy and try and kill it kill the enemy and go and have a look at our player and see

130
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,360
how much experience he's got.

131
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,220
He has got no experience because I didn't have an experience component so let's add the experience component

132
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,420
to the player.

133
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,500
Notice I want to add that to the player but it's my choice that I'm not going to add it to the enemy's

134
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,530
as well so we're not gonna have enemies that are beefing up as they kill players or kill kill NPC because

135
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,520
that's just a bit weird.

136
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:53,130
So we're just gonna add the experience script to our player then we're gonna go to kill the enemy.

137
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,380
You can see his experience points are currently at zero and once I kill the enemy I gain 10 experience

138
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:58,720
points.

139
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,530
Let's go and check that if I go and kill another enemy.

140
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,700
Say this Archer dude over here shouldn't take very much to kill him he's quite weak I would go and I've

141
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,580
got now 20 experience points so you can see I got the basics of levelling up so let's review what we

142
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:23,900
have done we have passed through the instigator all the way from the fighter through projectile through

143
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,770
weapon to the health component so that the health component knows who instigated an attack so that we

144
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,000
can award experience.

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,230
We also updated our base stance to include experience so we can pull those two things together to award

146
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,650
experience when we die now at the moment.

Our experience is static so in the next set you're going to fix that and improve our stat system so

148
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,630
that we can add more stats really easily.

149
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,130
See you there.
