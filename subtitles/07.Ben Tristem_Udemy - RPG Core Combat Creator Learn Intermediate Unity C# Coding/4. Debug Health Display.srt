00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello and welcome in this lecture we're gonna get some programmer UI in here with our health percentage

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,830
by go up to this garden he starts beating me you can see that my percentage starts to go down we're

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:20,320
also going to learn how we can make sure this is rounded so there's no decimal points in our display

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,040
as well.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,280
So let's dive in and see how it's done.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:30,460
Okay so the first thing I want to do is create some basic program UI to show our health in the top left

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:30,820
corner.

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,530
So I'm gonna go because I want this in all scenes I'm going to do this in the core prefab.

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:43,930
Going to add a new piece of UI so I'm gonna go to right click UI text she's gonna be our text for the

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,220
help we're just gonna use how basic text here rather than using health bars or anything like that.

11
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,400
I'm gonna rename the canvas to HUD.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,590
Heads up display for those who don't know and in the game folder I'm gonna go ahead and create a new

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:04,870
folder and call it UI and in here we're going to drag this heads up display to create new prefab so

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,190
we can edit this prefab.

15
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:14,290
I'm just going to switch over to the scene and editor in to demoed and then what we're going to do is

16
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,570
take this topped out.

17
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:23,410
This text element and position it in the top left I'm going to move the anchor to the top left as well

18
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,840
and change the anchoring sorry so I move the pivot to the top left and change the anchoring.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,580
Then I'm going to change the color of the text to white because we mostly got a dark background and

20
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:39,040
changed the text itself to be hair health colon like so let's see what that looks like in the game view.

21
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,570
Yep top left Nance a bit too close to the top left it's moving out now.

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,980
If it ever gets stuck to the left like this which keeps doing for me I find that restart and the editor

23
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:54,690
is the only solution so I've gone ahead and done that I'm going to open up the HUD prefab again and

24
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,780
go into the game view and you can see it's unstuck itself from the left corner.

25
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,610
For some reason it does that I don't know why now it's looking a little bit blurry.

26
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,960
So what I'm going to do is switch from free aspect to low resolution aspect ratio and then there's a

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,150
few other things I want to tweak because that's using my full resolution now having switch that over

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,400
it's now using the full resolution my screen if you are using 100 percent scaling then you won't have

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,110
this problem if you're using a higher scaling ratio high DP high screen then it will give you the option

30
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,710
to have a low aspect ratio so then we can go to our text and there's a few more tweaks I want to make

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,080
in fact for the scope to the canvas object the first tweak I want to make is to the UI scaling mode

32
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:41,160
is say it's in constant pixel size which means it won't make use of the extra pixels in the screen if

33
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,070
you have high DP light displays because it will basically make smaller text instead of making sharper

34
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,640
text.

35
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,020
So if I go for physical site constant physical size instead I'll try and make sharper text when you're

36
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:58,470
on high DPA screens which I think is probably the better way to go in this day and age and then what

37
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:06,390
we want to do is also check off pixel perfect mode for really lovely font rendering in the canvas components

38
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,400
and in the go into game now you've got really nice clean font rendering up here.

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,870
So now I'm going to duplicate this text component and create a second piece of text for the actual health

40
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,580
value that's what we're going to update with a script in just a moment we're going to put the health

41
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,080
to 100 percent as a placeholder now we're gonna rename these two elements so we're going to have a health

42
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,410
label and we're going to have a

43
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:42,100
text value to you in fact OK so that is our heart pretty much done you can see that's what it's looking

44
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:48,310
like the text is a little bit big let me scale the text and change the font size something like 12 go

45
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:56,020
in game now then still a little bit large let's bring it down to 10 get back in game OK that's small

46
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,780
enough it's debug so we don't need it to be massive so we've got our health value just bringing a little

47
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,000
bit closer make things a little bit neater.

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,940
Okay so what we want to do is update this by a script so we're gonna create a script in the resources

49
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,570
folder because we want to have access to the health component and I think that's going to be the easiest

50
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:19,570
for now it may choose to move it at some point we'll call this the health display C.S. s to create a

51
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:27,820
mono behavior in here and we're going to move the mono behavior into a namespace RPG resources the existing

52
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,010
resources namespace.

53
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:37,510
So we have access to the health component and then what well I want to display the health as a percentage

54
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,050
on this health display.

55
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,540
So we need to get that to come out of our health component in the first place.

56
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,850
We also need to get hold of the players health component.

57
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,270
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to have a reference to the health component for this class.

58
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,940
And I'm going to basically cash it on awake.

59
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:02,920
So we're gonna create an a wait method and sort out these curly braces and then I'm going to set the

60
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,220
health to basically the.

61
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,510
Game Object Dot.

62
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:13,390
Fine whereas it fine with tag we're looking for the player and we're looking for his health component

63
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:18,500
so get components health components and that should do the trick.

64
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,020
So now we've got the health components we can now do something in update I'm going to leave update as

65
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:35,890
a to do for you guys to just update to do updates your text basically but there is one more thing we

66
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,220
need to be able to do out of health is we need to be able to get a percentage.

67
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:47,470
So I'm going to create another public method we've got is dead take damage after take damage.

68
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,990
I'm going to create another public method which just returns a float which is going to be the percentage

69
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,070
essentially of of what we've got.

70
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,960
So.

71
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,780
How how much health we've got.

72
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:05,540
So I'm going to have this as get percentage does need to take anything just to get.

73
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,480
And that's where we're going to do our calculation of the percentage.

74
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,730
Now there's a little mini challenge if you think you know how you can calculate the percentage of health

75
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,400
points to return here then go ahead and do that.

76
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,780
If not I will go ahead and write this.

77
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,820
So we're going to do a return value here and we've got our health points.

78
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,910
So that's the current health points.

79
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:35,200
But what we actually want is the health points divided by the initial health points which was this The

80
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:41,110
get component base that get health so we can do that division divide by the original health that we

81
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,720
set and then what.

82
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,150
So that's giving us a fraction of the health.

83
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,240
But we said percentage which is in basically this times 100.

84
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,450
So let's do that to go a hundred times remember the order of multiplication doesn't matter 100 times

85
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:05,050
the health points divided by health so we can see right up front that it's gonna be in percentage units

86
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,420
so time for your challenge to display the health.

87
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,660
So you're going to write your update method that we left as a to do you going to set the text on the

88
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,220
text component that we're attached to.

89
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,670
You're going to have to obviously put our mono behavior act components onto that tax component as well.

90
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,680
And don't forget to add your percentages at the end.

91
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,760
So doing a little bit of string composition puts video and have a go.

92
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,210
Okay.

93
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,080
Welcome back.

94
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,380
So we've gotta get percentage notes we got.

95
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,560
That's what we're gonna use.

96
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,810
We're also going to get the text component so get component text.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,460
And this that we don't have yet.

98
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:46,090
So we're going to have to use the unity engine UI namespace and then using this text component can set

99
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,770
its text to the text content too.

100
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:57,580
Well health dot get whereas it get percentage that we go and at the end of this I'm going to have to

101
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,460
add the percentage sign because that we're going to overwrite and that will go.

102
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,170
So that should pretty much do the trick.

103
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:14,960
If I drop that onto our health value added components the health display component where is it that

104
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,200
would go and if we go ahead and hit play now hopefully that's going to show us our health.

105
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,050
So got health hundreds and I woke up to this god and pummel me a bit and my health goes down.

106
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,920
Now it's giving me lots and lots of decimal points which is not what I want.

107
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,220
I think I want to stick with probably no decimal points actually would be better for this display.

108
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,770
Now beware this won't happen if your damage perfectly divides into percentages.

109
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,900
So try tweaking it if you're not seeing this behavior.

110
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:48,860
So the way I'm going to get round this is using the string format method from C sharp.

111
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:58,480
So what we're going to do is wrap this all in a string of capital s String dot format and what this

112
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,140
does is it takes a what's known as a format string which basically tells you how to insert variables

113
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,960
into the string and then the values you want to insert.

114
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,500
So a format would start off with saying Hey take the first thing zeros thing that you want to insert

115
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,320
and then put it in here and then I can write stuff after it so I could put my percentage sign afterwards

116
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,440
and what this is going to do if I remove the percentage sign that I was adding here is exactly the same

117
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,490
thing as before.

118
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:34,150
Now I've got to include what do I need to include the system namespace in order to use string dot format.

119
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:40,780
So what we've got here is it's saying take the first thing on the right here the percentage and plop

120
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,420
it in place of this thing with the curly braces the zero with the curly braces and you can add extra

121
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,650
arguments with one for example like this with curly braces.

122
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,850
And just to show you.

123
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,260
And I can add something before like health maybe even.

124
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,360
This is obviously not what we're going to want to do but let's just have a look what happens if I go

125
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,840
ahead and hit play now.

126
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,060
Why expectancy is health.

127
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,630
Health and they go as formatting that string and including the health percentage in that but this hasn't

128
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,520
actually helped us.

129
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,890
If I remove this because I'm gonna go ahead and hit play and go and get pummeled a little bit.

130
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,460
That's going to get pummeled and you can see it we've still got loads and loads decimal places.

131
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:27,130
Now the good thing here is that we can do some formatting options on the things that we try to include.

132
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:32,090
So what I can do is I can put a colon here and then I can put some formatting options.

133
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,960
In this case I want to say how many decimal places I want.

134
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,530
So I could put zero for example and that's going to say OK don't include any decimal places.

135
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,640
The precision is going to be zero decimal places.

136
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,430
So let's go ahead and play.

137
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:50,470
Go get pummeled and you can see that our health is decreasing in single units.

138
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,640
So you can see it's going down every other time he hits us because he's taking off something like a

139
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,300
half health half percentage every time he hits.

140
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,740
So you can see the health is going down and it is using no percentage points to display that.

141
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,200
So what if we did want to add more decimal places then instead of having zero here instead of putting

142
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:14,430
we don't put one we put zero dot Zero we're saying that we want to have always one decimal place visible.

143
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,260
So if I go ahead and play that then you can see we've got a hundred percent point nought and if we go

144
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,930
up to the guy he's going to batter us and we can see that percentage is going down and we've got that

145
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,650
always one decimal place so that's how you use the string format operator in order for us to get the

146
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,740
0 decimal places which is what really we want to see in this display.

147
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:43,480
So to summarize what we've got is a health display that gets our players health components and updates.

148
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:50,770
This tax component in our HUD so that we can see how much percentage of health we have got left as the

149
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,540
player in the next video we're going to look at how we can get the health for the enemy that we're attacking

150
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,650
as well which is also gonna be very useful.

151
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,180
So you that.
