00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello and welcome it's a new section and following on from the last section that we were doing our first

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,110
moment.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,200
Now we're going to learn how we can string those moments together in separate levels.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,170
So we're going to be having a section all about scene management and loading scenes.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,260
Let's dive in and see what the prototype has to offer us.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,270
So here this prototype is looking different from the scene that you've just created because it was based

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,580
off the previous section.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,560
But if I run in this direction Fade out fade in and we're now in a different scene.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,960
We're gonna be learning to do this and creating portals in the levels.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,880
So here I'm in a transitionary level.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,430
If I go to the portal at the end of it which is just a basic corridor then I fade out fading and I come

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,780
back actually to the top of the previous level so if I zoom out what we've got is a situation where

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,800
there's a portal here at the end and a portal here.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,390
At the beginning that's where I just came in.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,280
So we're gonna add multiple portals that take you to different parts of different levels.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,100
And that's going to allow me to teach you about co routines that run between levels asynchronous seen

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,280
loading to allow us to say hey wait for the scene to load then fade back in and how do those fades in

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,110
the first place or the scene management stuff.

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,870
Quite cool.

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,570
Let's dive in and get started with implementing scene management in this section.
