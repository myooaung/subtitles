Hello.

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.830
Just a quickie here.

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.430
We're going to be setting up a canvas with a canvas group to allow us to fade in and fade out.

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.250
It's just the initial setup says very quickly.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.090
Dive on.

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.050
So we'd like to be able to fade out and fade back in.

7
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.920
And the best way I've found of doing this is via the unity canvas UI system.

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.010
So what I'm going to do is under the core game objects because I'm gonna want this Fader set up in all

9
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.680
of ours all of our sandboxes.

10
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.870
I'm going to create a UI object called Canvas and I'm going to side stick that in court and go and call

11
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.030
automatically and I'm gonna rename it to fader.

12
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:52.260
And the idea here is that within this canvas we could add a text UI for example here some text UI.

13
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.090
But how do we make it fade out.

14
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.360
How do we make the contents of the canvas fade out.

15
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.290
Well the way to do this is to add a component called a canvas group and the canvas group does a few

16
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:13.870
things but mainly it allows us to change some properties for the things underneath this game object

17
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.590
in the canvas.

18
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.570
And one of these properties is the alpha.

19
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.230
So if I change the alpha value it goes from 0 to 1.

20
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.230
You can see the text there is fading out.

21
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.180
So my challenge to you mini challenge I'm not gonna put up a slide here is just to make it so it fades

22
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.390
in and out from black or white whichever way you want until it's completely transparent.

23
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.940
And just so that fades out by using the alpha value.

24
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.470
No clever code just yet.

25
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.790
So pause video and have a go.

26
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.990
OK.

27
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.530
Welcome back.

28
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.750
So the way you could do this you could create another game object underneath a fader.

29
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.250
I'm just gonna add a component directly on here can add an image component and then I'm gonna configure

30
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.290
that image component which at the moment there's no source image I'm just gonna use a color.

31
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.720
I'm going to fade.

32
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.540
Let's see.

33
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.720
I think I'll fade to white.

34
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.640
I think I like the effect of fade to white.

35
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.060
I've tried that already and ah but you can choose fade to black.

36
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.160
You could fight agreed if green if you like to we could even use an image like a little loading screen

37
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.390
or something like that.

38
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.130
So I'm going to show you that.

39
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.250
Now if I alter the alpha at Alpha 1 it is not transparent at all and we fade out to white and Alpha

40
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.650
Zero.

41
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.950
It's completely faded so we can go this do this fading thing.

42
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.980
That's it for this lecture.

43
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.500
I just wanted to set up that.

44
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.150
And then in the next lecture we're gonna look at scripts to control it.
