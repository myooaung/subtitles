00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.360
For our project and throughout this course Sam and I will be using Unity twenty eighteen point three.

2
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.060
We're going to look at that version unless there's a really really good reason not to do so.

3
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.260
And the reason we're locking is when you change version of software it creates all sorts of problems

4
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.560
and hazards and re factors that you need to do.

5
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.980
So we're going to challenge you to be a grown up.

6
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.000
Having a grown up conversation here you and I is don't chase the latest version of Unity because new

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.160
versions come out very regularly like that feature looks cool all that feature looks cool.

8
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.000
The reason we're going to twenty eighteen point three is that's the first version that uses nested prefabs

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.800
and that's very important to us in the way that we're gonna be teaching this project now unity twenty

10
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.660
eighteen point three should be available to you forever more if it's not trying to find the closest

11
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.760
match and might be unity twenty eighteen point four and what version of twenty eighteen point three

12
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.210
do you need.

13
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.890
Well whichever one is available all the twenty eighteen point three is whether it's point three point

14
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.720
one or point three point eight on point three point twelve should be pretty much the same and give you

15
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.790
what you need throughout this course if you already have that installed or if you've already installed

16
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.740
unity hub and you know how to get twenty eighteen point three then skip the rest of the video if you

17
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.470
haven't got to that point yet then I'll show you how to grab unity hub install unity and be ready and

18
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.110
raring to jump into the rest of the course so open up your browser jump over to Unity 3D Dot Com This

19
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.670
is what the page looks like for me but it unity changes all the time so it's gonna look a little bit

20
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.100
different for you find that get started button or the download button or the let's get going button

21
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.510
whatever it might be for you things change with unity and at some point you're probably going to be

22
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.710
presented with would you like to pay some money or would you like to go for the personal version.

23
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.810
Now again this might change in the future we can't predict what unity is going to do but you're looking

24
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.580
for the thing that doesn't cost you money.

25
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.150
So for us now it's called personal win click on Try personal.

26
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.730
And from here it's going to ask us to accept the terms basically saying if you're earning less than

27
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.390
one hundred thousand dollars in the thing that you're using Unity for then you're all cool.

28
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.420
After that point you need to pay unity some money so that's great.

29
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.010
If your game earns tons of money then you need to give unity a share of that money.

30
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.830
And we're going to click on the download unity hub.

31
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.390
You haven't use Unity hub before this is really amazing it's a tool that allows us to have multiple

32
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.120
versions of unity manage our projects and a few other things.

33
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.250
So it's a pretty quick installation click on wherever that is downloaded for you and then click.

34
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.900
Yes.

35
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.040
I'm going to cancel out of my installation because I have unity hub installed already but just follow

36
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.630
the prompts.

37
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.570
It's pretty straightforward.

38
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.670
I think you know how to download and install some software given that this is an intermediate course

39
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.360
so install unity hub should be pretty quick.

40
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.470
And when that has finished downloading open it up if it hasn't finished yet and you're still waiting

41
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.110
for it then you can pause a video at this point or you can watch through and then circle back and do

42
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.210
this when it has finished downloading.

43
00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.130
Now it's three this is Unity hub there's three tabs Project Loon and install projects it's going to

44
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.660
show us all of our projects that we have access to that we've created installs is what we're looking

45
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.430
for that will show the installs that I have already on my machine and also the official releases.

46
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.070
This is what we're looking for click on official releases.

47
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.730
And for me right at this very point in time the latest is twenty eighteen point three point three.

48
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.470
Now for you it's probably going to be point three point four point three point eight or even the latest

49
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.650
one might be 20 19 or whatever they choose to name it in the future.

50
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.690
So find if you can find a version of twenty eighteen point three.

51
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.650
Doesn't matter whether it's point three point three four point three point eight or point three whatever

52
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.790
just songs is twenty eighteen point three points something and click on the download button and in here

53
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.910
it will show us what components we want to install.

54
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.920
If you're planning on doing something for Android you can turn that on or IOW et cetera.

55
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.410
For us all we're going to do is the editor and the web JPL support and then click on done.

56
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.510
Once it's installed you can come back and change what components are installed so I'm going to just

57
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.790
give you an example that he's on my machine.

58
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.990
So this is currently installing and you can see I've got an older version of twenty eighteen point three

59
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.240
this twenty eighteen point three point one if I click on the three dots here I can add a component and

60
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.100
then come back in and add something that I may have missed in the past it's like actually you know what

61
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.540
I do wish to put these on Android so you can then go and install that retroactively which is really

62
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.030
cool.

63
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.520
And while we're waiting for it to download and install which will all happen automatically which is

64
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.260
very cool while that's happening we'll jump into the next video but just a quick note before we do at

65
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.660
some point unity might ask you to set up your account.

66
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.420
They might have done that already mind set up so it might ask you if your email address and what log

67
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.780
in details you want so just go ahead and set that up which is pretty easy to do.

68
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.880
Just follow the prompts there and then when it is finished installing you can click on these three little

69
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.490
buttons here and you can say set as preferred that means that will be the version of unity that opens

70
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.000
up when you start a new project as your preferred your default program.

71
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.290
Okay.

72
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.770
So let that finish doing what it's doing and jump over into the next video we're going to be talking

73
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.140
about installing our edit which is a little bit different to what we've used on our other projects.

74
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.810
It's visual studio code.

75
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.220
Okay.

76
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.300
Let's go to the next video.
