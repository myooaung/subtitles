00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,680
Hello and welcome in this video.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,820
We're going to be making our pickups response so if I pick up the five flower pick up the sword and

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,140
regret my decision.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,140
Then in five seconds the Firefly will come back and I can re-equip that one instead let's dive in and

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,520
see how to do this responding so as we said at the end of last lecture The problem with our pickups

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,390
is that they get destroyed after you pick them up.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,140
And because we don't have any inventory management system.

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,760
If you pick up a different pick up you can't go back and re-equip the sword.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,490
So what I'd like to do is to have a pickup responding process so instead of destroying what we're going

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:49,340
to do is create a car routine and it's going to be a private eye innumerate car routine and it is going

11
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,480
to return.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,440
What's it going to be.

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:59,030
It's going to be basically something like hide for seconds and it's going to take the float of how many

14
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,310
seconds it should hide for now.

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,190
This is just we're going to call this basically in on trigger enter.

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:14,990
So when do we equip the weapon we're going to start co routine for the hide for seconds of how many

17
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,470
seconds.

18
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,160
Well that is going to be so we can make it configurable so it's going to be a serialized ball field

19
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:28,850
float respawn time and I'm going to start off with 10 seconds as the default in fact make it five for

20
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,710
now just make it easy to test and that's what we're gonna pass into our hide for second.

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,470
So at the top level hands it read on trigger enter if it's a player equip the weapon to the player and

22
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,140
then start the car routine hide for seconds of the respawn time.

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,690
So this is where we now want to go ahead basically and do the following.

24
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:59,870
So we're going to hide pick up then we are going to do a yield return new wait for seconds

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:11,930
and we're gonna wait for the seconds given and then we're going to show the pickup now.

26
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,250
How are we going to show and hide the pickup.

27
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,530
Now you might be tempted to disable the pickup so we've got our pick up under this folder.

28
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,990
You might be tempted to say hey let's just disable the game object.

29
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,780
Well that would be great if it didn't stop the car routine from running which is not ideal.

30
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,270
So instead what I would like to do is disable the sphere collider so that we can't trigger it again

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,170
and also disable its children.

32
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,010
So you go through each of the children of the sword while driving your pickup is in our case.

33
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,150
That is what the prefab that shows us the sword and just disable that instead.

34
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,060
So the pickup body is still there that route.

35
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,230
Game object will still be there but all of its children will be disabled and its sphere collide it will

36
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:02,400
be disabled and that's going to be the trick to disabling our pickup so this is going to be your challenge

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,480
to disable the pickup.

38
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,960
So first of all you're going to disable the collider then disable the child's game objects remember

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,380
that you can do a for each loop over transforms so that you can get all the children of the current

40
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:16,880
transform.

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,850
That's one way of doing this.

42
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,680
You can Google it a little bit if you're not sure how to get all your child game objects and you're

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,700
going to rename them all.

44
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,390
Now before I tell you to pause I would like to say that.

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,580
Remember there's a slight difference between disabling a game object so you can do a game object dot

46
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,630
set active and you can set that to false.

47
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:43,050
For example that's how you disable game objects whereas a component such as this weapon pickup for example

48
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,970
you need to do enabled equals false and that's slightly different.

49
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:56,340
So there's there's two different ways for a component and disabling a game object itself so pose video

50
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,850
and how to go at this challenge okay.

51
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,450
Welcome back.

52
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:10,190
So let's go ahead and implement our Hyde pick up and our show pick up as well and in Hyde pick up.

53
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:19,990
The first thing we can do is do a get components our type collider and we're going to do enabled equals

54
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,920
false.

55
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,600
Simple as that.

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,510
And I'm actually going to do show pickup and high pickup has one thing because I think this can make

57
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,960
it nice and easy.

58
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:41,820
So we're going to have this renamed to show pickup taking a boolean should show and this can be set

59
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,420
to false.

60
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:48,790
So if it shouldn't show then we should it should if it should show it's enabled if it shouldn't and

61
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,810
it's disabled.

62
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,650
And similarly so now we can call this show pickup is going to be true at the end but we're going to

63
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,130
do show pickup false at the beginning like that.

64
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,160
So now it kind of makes sense and then we want to go through all of the children.

65
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:11,470
Now one way you could have done this is to do a transform dot get child and then you can get the child

66
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,500
indexed you get the zero child for example to start off with and you could get the game object associated

67
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,830
with this transform and then you could set it active too well depending on whether you should show or

68
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,530
shouldn't show we are going to use this should show boolean.

69
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:33,160
So that's one way of doing it but that if he had more transforms then this wouldn't necessarily work

70
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,440
he wouldn't disable all of them.

71
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:41,830
So I'm gonna do a for each loop over transforms so that type is gonna be transform we're going to have

72
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,170
this child in the transform our own transform.

73
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,850
So if you do it like this transform child and transform Guess Who will the child transforms of the current

74
00:05:51,850 --> 00:06:00,440
transform and then we can do is child dot and then the game object set active as we've done here and

75
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,680
that should pretty much do the trick.

76
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:09,800
So let's go ahead and see whether this is working now I'm going gonna go ahead and play and go over

77
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,640
to our pickups in the other world avoid this enemy.

78
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,820
So I'm going to step on the fire flower and you notice that has now gone and we wait around for five

79
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,420
seconds and it comes back.

80
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,930
So all of these should now be doing the same thing.

81
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,660
So if I accidentally picked up the bow but actually should wanted the fire flower then I can go and

82
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,030
get it in five seconds time.

83
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:36,470
So that just hides that issue that we currently have of not having an inventory system we can kind of

84
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,790
how our inventory system in the world for now until we've implemented it.

85
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:46,790
So to review what we have done is we have started a code routine when we pick up a weapon that hides

86
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,310
the weapon pickup for a few seconds.

87
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,800
It calls this show pickup method which does two things disables the collider and disables all the child

88
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,620
game objects doesn't disable this game object because otherwise the code routine would fail to run.

89
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,150
Cool stuff I'll see you in the next video.
