Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.900
In this lecture we're working on animating the text so that when we hit play you will see that the text

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.460
kind of evaporates off their heads.

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.970
It happened very quickly so I'm want to show you in the prefab that when we go and play this animation

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.250
that is what's happening.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.620
It's just evaporating away repeatedly in this particular instance.

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.760
Let's dive in and see how to create that kind of animation okay.

8
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.380
So we want to add a fade animation to add damage text.

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.450
The way to do this.

10
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.330
Make sure you are in your damage text prefab is to add an animator component so go to add components

11
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.110
and not an animator but an animation component sorry which is going to just deal with playing an animation

12
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.010
clip.

13
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.410
Now that does mean we need to play an animation clip or create an animation clip so go and open up your

14
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.630
animation tab.

15
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.250
I believe you do that through window animation and then animation tab like so and then you can hit the

16
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.960
big create button there.

17
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.860
Now I'm gonna save it in the same folder as our prefab.

18
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.210
I'm going to call it the damage text fade like so.

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.260
So we're using the damaged text fade as the name and then we want to do is select some properties that

20
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:28.690
we are going to animate so and property and in this case we are going to add eight for the text component

21
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.370
and I'm going to select the rect transform and we're going to select the anchored position as the thing

22
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.540
that we want to change we basically want to shift that text upwards.

23
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.980
And one other thing that I'm going to change maybe is going to be again the rect transform this time

24
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.600
the scale.

25
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.500
And then one more potential property that I want to change is going to be I want to change fade out

26
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.330
but we don't have anything that could fade out the moment.

27
00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.770
So on the damaged text canvas I am going to add a component which is going to be our canvas group because

28
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.520
we know that the canvas group is able to fight things out from our fader.

29
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.580
We know this.

30
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.750
Going to add a property here and select the canvas group and we're going to add the alpha property.

31
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.490
Okay.

32
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.230
So now we've got key frames for all of these things the kind of initial values I believe might not hurt.

33
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.110
Just to add a key frame they are actually adding a key frame you can see it's in now in blue and that's

34
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.730
quite clear that it has saved all these values.

35
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.290
Now what I'm gonna do is over a 30 second period I want this to animate out.

36
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:43.300
So the way I'm gonna do this is basically just by pulling up the damaged text a little bit and not the

37
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.350
damage takes the actual text object itself within the canvas I'm going to pull that up I am going to

38
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:59.300
scale it as well like so so kind of fading up and evaporating a little bit and then also I am going

39
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.430
to I'm going to start by key frame those just in case I lose those changes as I got to my damaged text

40
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.440
and I go to the damage text object.

41
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.460
I change the Alfa here down to zero.

42
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.980
Okay so I'm just gonna go ahead and key frame that as well and I expect to see is that is kind of just

43
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.740
evaporating over that time and you can see that there are some key frames at the end here that I don't

44
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.040
want so I'm gonna go ahead and delete those because I just want to finish it with evaporating away.

45
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.260
Now one thing I'm going to do actually is just shift my key frames up here.

46
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.990
I want to create I want to stop it from fading out until we reach this point.

47
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:51.610
So I'm just gonna go into the damaged text again and I'm going to set my alpha to 1 at this stage and

48
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.570
just keep frame it.

49
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.780
So what we should see is it's just increasing in size going up and then it starts evaporating.

50
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.980
So you can't see it.

51
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.600
So it goes guys Alford out and I think that's looking okay.

52
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.290
Now we just need to make sure that animation is set to automatically play and if we go ahead and hit

53
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.810
play I'd expect to see these text objects evaporating it's not happening.

54
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.120
The reason being I haven't hooked up my animation clip.

55
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.450
So in that animation component we need to select a clip which is not showing me here.

56
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.880
So let's go over to our project browser and drag the clip in from there instead go ahead and hit play

57
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.440
now.

58
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.820
I would expect to see those text objects fading off their heads which indeed it is doing and I'm pretty

59
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.730
happy with that effect.

60
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.890
So that was a quickie on how to do your animation of this particular text object.

61
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.010
Now go ahead and make it your own.

62
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:53.420
Do the animation however you feel is appropriate for your particular game maybe spruce up the text use

63
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.410
some different fonts different colors and whatever you like just make this particular fade look pretty

64
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.960
and the next set you going to be looking at spawning this text dynamically see that.
