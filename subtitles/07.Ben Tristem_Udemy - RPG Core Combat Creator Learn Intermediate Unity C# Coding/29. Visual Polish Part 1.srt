1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:04,560
OK.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,060
This is how my level is going to be looking by the end of this video.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,130
I'm just starting the process of tidying up I'm doing a little bit of undulations with my my terrain

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,100
just tidying up my painting of the textures and putting in some nice water so we can get closer to having

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,900
this look show worthy.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,040
OK let's jump in and start thinking our live a little bit more like I'm not gonna show you click by

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,860
click exactly what I'm doing here but I'll show you what it is that I'm trying to do.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,150
And then I'll show you the result after I've done it so the first thing I'm gonna do is to increase

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,280
some areas of my elevation throughout my map to make some undulations in there so it's not just one

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,050
flat flat flat flat just a little bit of a side note on that.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,280
It probably does make sense that the town is flat because towns tend to be flat but maybe over the backyard

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,310
it's a little bit higher.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,960
And as you're coming into town maybe coming from up and then running down a little bit into the town

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,460
so I'm just gonna go ahead and do that.

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,700
So if you've got any elevation changes you want to make to your level now's a good time to do it.

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,950
I'm midway through the process just a quick update here I've got rid of my trees in the area I'm working

17
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,180
on they're easy to put back in but I find them a bit distracting I push my pickups out of the way I've

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,250
just gone and raised some areas I'm making these kind of stepped approach by going set height so selecting

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,950
set height of my terrain and then if you hold down shift and click that'll allow you to do the height

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,570
of things I'm just tidying things up.

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,860
I know the sand has been running down this side but here which wasn't really the purpose so I can put

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,060
trees there so you can't run down but I still want to be out to see into the river come from a little

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,510
bit higher down a little river deep up and up and over such just a bit.

24
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:28,960
Interesting.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,680
Ups and downs and then after I've made my steps at the height I want them.

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,720
This is way too steep but just doing that for illustrative purposes you know to smooth height put it

27
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,750
at a very aggressive opacity and then just go up and wave it around like that that'll smooth this out.

28
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,370
So it's a little bit smoother and get to the point where if you're happy with it that's not too steep

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,420
then that's a good little undulations.

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:50,670
OK.

31
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,810
That's a midway I'll keep working on my thing and switch on the camera if I find anything else that

32
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,340
I think might be useful for you.

33
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:57,640
OK.

34
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,690
I finished editing my train and playing around with the elevation put a couple of light ups and downs

35
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,230
over here like I said before I think it's good if you've got a natural environment to have some ups

36
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,980
and downs.

37
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:11,200
I made a little ledge up here where we could put some sort of landmark like a church or you know they're

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,760
often up on a hill just imagine our camera the whole time thinking that way is my camera the camera

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,260
around here there's a little bit of interesting set dressing we can do up the back here put some sort

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,870
of interesting landmark I think then running down here then elevated this a little bit so up into the

41
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,460
town and up out of the town for both of the areas where my bridges will be a low elevation.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:30,780
Okay.

43
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,400
The next thing I'm gonna do is tidy up where I've got my texture.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,920
You can see the blue now because I've put some of this out.

45
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,790
Let me just change that so it's not going away.

46
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,780
I push some of my train.

47
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,240
I love it.

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,900
Now my blue doesn't really make sense in some of my paths aren't quite right.

49
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,670
So I'm just gonna go and tidy up my my painting of my ground texture.

50
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,190
Next I'll be back in a moment.

51
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,740
Okay.

52
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,180
Good good.

53
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,460
I've done a little bit of painting here just made it look like there's been people walking around on

54
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,090
this dirt a little bit more is gonna look different once we put our foliage over the top but I just

55
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,700
want to make sure I've got the underlying principles right.

56
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,860
We don't have the water the blue being painted all the way up onto there so it's pretty good.

57
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,320
Next what I want to do is just fix up my water.

58
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,680
The the actual water a little bit the water plane we've got in this let's find that click on water.

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,620
You can see you can just go to the albedo and change it around here maybe make it less transparent.

60
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,690
That's not so good maybe make it darker.

61
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,440
Few things we can play around with in there.

62
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,170
Actually I'm going to bring in a different water and my caveat on this is if you find that bringing

63
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:33,340
in a different water into your game brings errors and makes things go slow or makes your character do

64
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,350
weird things it might be that your computer is just not up for the challenge of having the fancier water

65
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:38,770
in there.

66
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,390
So by all means leave this water that's in here what I'm going to do is jump over the assets store find

67
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,370
the standard assets I've just searched for standard assets click on import it's going to take a little

68
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,140
bit of time I'm going to choose just the water assets I don't believe I had low river search for it

69
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,990
and I believe we've brought in the other water that I'm looking for in here so it's going to take a

70
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,580
little bit or just click on none I can just collapsed all of these and I found water under standard

71
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,340
assets environment and then water and do not work in VR.

72
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,430
OK cool thanks for that.

73
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:16,390
So water plane pro time day I think it's gonna be this pro day time I'm looking for to poop but I am

74
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:22,510
just going to click on all of the water and bring in all of the water in port all of that into my project

75
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,880
should bring it into an asset pack called standard assets or something similar to that that I was gonna

76
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,810
go through I have look for the water because I like the water that we get from the standard assets I

77
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,550
think it looks a little bit more fancy than the one that we've got in our level at the moment but totally

78
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:43,450
up to you I gonna grab my standard assets has been brought in drag it on two asset packs give myself

79
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:50,860
a little bit more space here I in the scene find the water what do we got in here standard assets environment

80
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:58,390
water water again lots of water and then prefabs I think it's going to be and water pro daytime just

81
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,830
drag that in there guy that looks a little bit different a bit more watery so I'm gonna say thank you

82
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,370
to my previous water.

83
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:11,590
Or is that delete that go back up to my other water I've just dropped in drop it onto environments and

84
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,800
then do a little bit of moving around drop it into place.

85
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,950
Okay and then just stretch it and get it so it's fitting underneath where my river is just using the

86
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,210
stretch tool it should all scale nicely rotate a little bit.

87
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,000
This is not a square one as the previous one was this is more of an SAT an oval as with any of these

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,480
things try to make it bigger than you need it down to it.

89
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,740
Okay so I just scaled and moved and rotated make sure it's fitting into all the areas where we needed

90
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,540
to fit just by doing a bit up and down knees again this way a little bit more that looks like it's fitting

91
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,520
in all the places I know what I want to show you one more thing just remembered with the water when

92
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,280
you clicked on your water you can go to the water.

93
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:56,370
Pro daytime shader open that up and I'm going to change my refraction color just to show you if you're

94
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,490
running around in a swamp you can maybe make it green and give it that greenish kind of tinge.

95
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:06,630
If it's you've got some sort of devilish volcano type thing then you could.

96
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,050
What am I trying to say here.

97
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,750
I don't know an evil level then you can have a red color.

98
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,360
I'm gonna have my more of a deeper blue just to simulate the fact that as you're running along you're

99
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,730
not gonna see through it when I have it a little bit blue a deeper richer in color.

100
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,540
Okay cool.

101
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,610
And then I make sure we click on place outlooks in the game.

102
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:30,400
It has inspired me actually as I run into my level I think I'm gonna make a little bit of a sneaky thing

103
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,140
around the corner here.

104
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,050
Put a tree in that bit just there.

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,570
So that playing can come in here get a health pack or a weapon pick up a piece of loot or something.

106
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,950
Then block this off with a fence or a bunch of trees.

107
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,250
That'll do two things One it gives the player a little bit of a secret thing a little bit of a side

108
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,760
track but not very far just like a five second side track but also gives them a chance to have a look

109
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,950
at the water that I'm pretty proud of that we've got now levels so they can appreciate Oh that's a river.

110
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,270
What are the implications.

111
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,430
The river runs through the level or through the town so they get a little of an anchor point about what

112
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,000
the town's about because they can see that there's a river running through it.

113
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,520
Okay.

114
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,730
So I think that's enough for this particular video I just wanted to make those additions to improve

115
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,020
the visual look and the terrain of my level in the next video.

116
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,360
I think it's time for us to start adding a few extra props and just playing around with the placement

117
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,950
of our houses making sure this all looks looked pretty cool.

118
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,530
So great work.

119
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,210
I hope your world is coming along nicely and getting a little bit shinier and I'll see you in the next

120
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:28,630
video.
