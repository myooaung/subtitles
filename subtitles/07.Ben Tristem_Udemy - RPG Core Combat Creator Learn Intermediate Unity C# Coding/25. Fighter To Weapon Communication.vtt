00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.390
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.170
In this lecture we're gonna be getting a message through to our weapon instance such that it can print

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.070
out a log message so I've got sword equipped here that will print out a log message.

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.190
I go and attack this guy and you can see we get this weapon hit with the name of the weapon game object

5
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.520
showing up in the logs every time we hit.

6
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.950
That's an event coming from fighter down to the weapon.

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.540
Let's dive in and see how we can do that.

8
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:38.180
So the subject of this lecture is about trying to get this link to the current weapon instance.

9
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.150
Now let's go over to our fighter script.

10
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.530
This is where this is going to be happening.

11
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.880
And what we're saying here is we've got a current weapon which is actually a current weapon conflicts.

12
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.230
Let's go ahead and rename that straightaway current weapon config.

13
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.410
And we also want to have a link to the actual current weapon.

14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.890
So it's gonna be a type weapon called current weapon.

15
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.040
Now the lazy value in the current weapon conflict makes me think maybe we need a lazy value for our

16
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.840
current weapon as well.

17
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.250
And I'm not hundred percent sure about that so let's talk it through.

18
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.940
Let's think about the use cases.

19
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.770
So where do we read these two variables.

20
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.740
Well potentially in public methods.

21
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.750
So they could be read from in start.

22
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.480
That's a problem.

23
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.110
If we were to initialize them and start what happens if we were to make them happen before start What

24
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.820
if we were to set them up in a wake.

25
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.040
Well the problem there is that we are doing some spawning in response to this from a potentially calling

26
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.310
to other things as we see in our attach weapon attach weapon calls out to an animator for example and

27
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.900
it uses a spawner here.

28
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.770
So no good doing it in a wake because we're not allowed to call out to other components like the animator.

29
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.600
So the other option that gives us now is to use a lazy value.

30
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.810
But one thing I would like to point out is that actually the current weapon config could be set without

31
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.690
doing attach weapon.

32
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.610
So what I'm gonna do is I'm actually going to remove the lazy value for the time being from the current

33
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.650
weapon config and instead do the following will do in starts instead of doing a force in it at this

34
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.950
we're gonna do attach weapon of the current weapon.

35
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.640
So we'll make sure the current weapons attach the current weapons already been attached to be attached

36
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.890
the second time it's not actually a problem and we want to make sure that's attach for the current weapon

37
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.210
conflict not the current weapon and then what we've got to do is in a wake where instead of setting

38
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.530
lazy value to current weapon conflict we could just set it to the default weapon and that is fine.

39
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.450
Actually that doesn't require as a lazy value could have done that earlier but that's okay.

40
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.970
But what does require a lazy value is our current weapon because in order to have the current weapon

41
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.610
we have to have attached and spawned it.

42
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.190
So that does require us to have a lazy value because we need to do that with the animator.

43
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.970
Okay.

44
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.410
Well that then we.

45
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.190
We have now that we have asserted that we definitely leave the lazy value for our current weapon instance.

46
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.160
We can wrap that in a lazy value and set that up in a wake.

47
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.630
So we'll do current weapon in a week equals a new lazy value of type weapon and then we want to give

48
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.440
it and set up a default weapon but s default weapon currently concerns and returns a weapon configured

49
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.660
where it wants it to return a weapon in order for it to set the default value of our current weapon.

50
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:48.130
So it is going to attach the default weapon but the question here is what's it actually going to return.

51
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.000
How is it going to have that weapon to return.

52
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.090
Well the problem is attach weapon calls to spawn and spawn at the moment doesn't return anything.

53
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:03.800
So little mini challenge for you is to switch over from spawn returning void to spawn returning the

54
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.060
weapon that we actually instantiate here.

55
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.670
So the way I'm going to do this is by this variable is currently within the if statement so I can't

56
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.520
return it down at the bottom here which is where I would like to return the weapon.

57
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:26.180
So what I've got to do is I've got to pull this weapon out to the top level the top scope of my function

58
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.360
and it's going to be defaulted to.

59
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.110
No.

60
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:37.940
Because if we don't default to know when we've got no equipped prefab and we don't spawn anything then

61
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.880
we are going to end up with nothing.

62
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.860
So there's nothing to return.

63
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.580
So it will be defaults to now I'm just making that explicit.

64
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:53.570
So now that the spawn returns something and returns the actual weapon we can make attach weapon itself

65
00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.260
return the weapon instance that was spawned which just means it returning returning it and changing

66
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.640
the return type and now where we use attach weapon we need to make sure that we also set it.

67
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.560
So I'm going to go and find the first place we use it in setup default weapon.

68
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:20.510
So we're going to use that as the return value for set up default weapon and then also let's have a

69
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.040
look.

70
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:30.320
We want when we are equipping the weapon we want to make sure that we set our current weapon don't value

71
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.810
equal to attach weapon.

72
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.860
And I want to point out that in a couple of places we're still using the current weapon Conficker dot

73
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.280
value and that we don't want.

74
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.490
We just want to switch that back over to current weapon conflict because we've removed the lazy value

75
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:54.050
wrapper from the current weapon conflicts and just cannot replace that threw out this file.

76
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.480
OK.

77
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.490
So now let's just check.

78
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.800
This is going to make sense.

79
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.820
The one concern I have is that in starts we are doing attach weapon.

80
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:13.230
We actually can now just do current weapon dot force in it which is going to do an attach weapon of

81
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.450
the default but not if this has already been set.

82
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:25.710
And that's important because we may have overridden the default weapon when we do restore.

83
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.410
So this was something that worried me in setup default weapon is that we are attaching the default weapon

84
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.170
here.

85
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.000
And what happens if that weapon has been changed.

86
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.310
So that is going to be fine because this won't be called in start.

87
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.540
If that weapon has changed or it will be overridden in our restore.

88
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.030
So hopefully this is now going to give us what we want which is to have a weapon reference such as Go

89
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.580
and check in unity that things are going to compile and can go ahead and hit play.

90
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.820
I would expect my sword to appear in this case I already have a save file if I go ahead and delete my

91
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.930
save file.

92
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.950
They will get just deleted and let's go back into unity.

93
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:09.620
Reset

94
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.240
so let's just check my default weapon.

95
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.570
Yes.

96
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.300
Is the fireball I can pick up a sword equipped.

97
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.580
I can pick up a bow.

98
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.690
Let's just check as I go between levels that it restores correctly as we'd expect to go between level

99
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.950
and I appear with my bow in hand and go back so that all seems to be working correctly and I can use

100
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.250
the bow hopefully to attack this guy.

101
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.570
Okay so that's cool.

102
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.710
We just want to make sure that we can use that reference to the weapon now.

103
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:47.030
And I want to do that by forwarding on this hit event to our weapon instance now I am going to do this

104
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:55.640
regardless of whether it's a projectile weapon or it is a normal just take instant damage weapon and

105
00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.380
we do have to check that we actually have a weapon instance because some weapons don't have a weapon

106
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.750
instance like the fireball does not.

107
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.610
There's no actual weapon in the hand.

108
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:10.670
So what we're gonna do is we can check that the current weapon of value is not equal to now make sure

109
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.420
is that you're checking the current wealth and value because we check current weapon directly.

110
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.880
Then things don't work.

111
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.380
It will be always true.

112
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:27.200
So then we can do current weapon dot value dot on hit and this will trigger an on hit event which if

113
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.050
we go and have a look currently does nothing.

114
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:35.000
So let's just make it print something out and we're going to print out a message that includes the name

115
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.040
of this game object.

116
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.920
So it's going to be weapon hit plus the game object don't name and then semicolon at the end of the

117
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:52.980
line if we go ahead and hit play then I want to see is that with my bow I would be getting hit when

118
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:59.670
the arrow is fired off like so I'm getting the weapon hit weapon because all our weapons get renamed

119
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.300
to the same thing.

120
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.540
So I also want to check that the fireball does not generate a weapon hit because it is a weapon without

121
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.860
an equipped weapon.

122
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:14.670
So I'm going to go over to delete my save file and start off with my fireball again from scratch and

123
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:21.180
if I go and attack this guard with my fireball so he attacks me there's no weapon damage log and I attack

124
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:26.770
him and there's no weapon damage not because there is no weapon prefab calls out in this lecture we

125
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:34.620
have got a link from fighter to the currently equipped weapon that we can use to trigger hit events

126
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:40.560
on that particular weapon in the next lecture we're going to get the audio in place for that weapon.

127
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:40.980
See that.
