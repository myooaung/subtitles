00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,230
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,210
In this lecture we are going to be adding particle effects when we level up as you will see in just

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,260
a second.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,650
And we're also going to regenerate our health percentage.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:21,220
So even though that God had done a fair bit of damage to me when I leveled up I will no matter what

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,320
have my health regenerated 270 or greater.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,830
If I had more to begin with.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:33,250
So let's dive in and see how we're going to achieve those two feats so we'd like to replace this print

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,620
statement the leveled up print statement with something more flashy more like a particle effect.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,420
So fortunately I have a particle effect for you here.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,730
The self heal VFX is a package against its lecture.

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,540
You can import it as you would with packages.

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,860
So let's go ahead and do that.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,960
I import it goes under the game dev TV assets folder and it is called self heal.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,350
So what does it look like.

16
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,790
Let's go ahead and open the prefab and zoom in on the prefab and let's just restart it since this bunch

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,370
of plus icons that just evaporate into the air.

18
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:15,100
That's what we're going to use as a basis but I'm going to create a new prefab in our effects folder

19
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,940
to do this.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:22,390
So I'm gonna go back to my scene create an empty I'm going to call this the level

21
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:31,210
and then I'm going to make that effect in the game effects folder and then I'm going to delete it from

22
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,630
the scene then I'm gonna go and open that up and I just want to check.

23
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:34,900
Yep.

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,170
The position has been set to something weird.

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,640
Let's just reset the position so we make sure we've got a clean starting points and I am going to go

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,720
ahead and set this up.

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,490
Now if you feel like you can do this challenge for yourself then do pause a video and just have a go

28
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:54,090
at spawning whatever particle effect you would like in this update level.

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,930
Otherwise I'm just gonna walk you through.

30
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:04,360
So we're going to go to the asset packs the game dev self heal and drag in under our level up under

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,900
that root.

32
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,620
We're going to drag in this VFX particle OK so we've got this VFX particle we have got it set up it's

33
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,890
got rotation and stuff which is cool.

34
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:21,240
I'm gonna change the color to a blue for the particles themselves.

35
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:28,270
So it looks more to me like a spawning like a levelling up kind of signal.

36
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:34,360
And then what we're gonna do is I want to change the simulation space from local to world so that as

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,830
we move around the emits from us but it also kind of floats around.

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,370
And then what we're going to do well we want to be able to clear up this particle system when it's finished.

39
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,190
So we're gonna add the destroy after effect but there is a restriction with this destroy after effect.

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,540
Currently if I have a look at how the script works it works on the current particle system and it destroys

41
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,310
the current game object which isn't gonna be sufficient because we actually want to destroy the parents

42
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,090
as well.

43
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,790
So what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna extend this class a little bit and give it a serialize field

44
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,440
where the game object called target to destroy which is going to default to no.

45
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,890
And what we're gonna do is if we have a target to destroy so if target to destroy is not equal to now

46
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:35,900
it's been set in the inspector then we are going to destroy the target and otherwise so else destroy

47
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,090
the game object that we're currently on.

48
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,810
So put that one in there like so.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,510
So destroy the game object currently on.

50
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,020
Otherwise the target destroy if there is one available.

51
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:54,710
That means that in this particular VFX we can drag in the parent in the target to destroy and it will

52
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,200
when the particle system finishes destroy the parents basically the whole prefab which is just what

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,250
we would like.

54
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,910
So I'm gonna see whether this is sufficient.

55
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,010
Let's go over to base stats and the update level script and where we have this print statement.

56
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:17,470
I am going to create I'm going to call a new function which I'm gonna call level up effect.

57
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:25,460
So let's create it control dots generate the method and then a case it's private.

58
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,420
Yeah that makes more or less enough sense whereas put it I'm gonna do an instantiate.

59
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:39,280
Now we need a prefab to actually instantiate so let's have a new serialized field and it's going to

60
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:48,640
be if type game objects and it is going to be the level up particle effect

61
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,820
initialized to No.

62
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,950
But obviously going to be set in the inspector then we can instantiate the level of particle effect

63
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,230
and we are going to set its position.

64
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,720
No we are going to use one of these other overloads of instantiate.

65
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,570
We're going to use the one that has the transform parents so that this effect is going to be parentage

66
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,800
to the spawner and we'll follow it around.

67
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,810
So the plus icons are going to float offers very nicely.

68
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:26,780
So we're gonna do a transform like so and let's see whether that's going to work.

69
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:33,300
I just need to find our player prefab so that's an end game player.

70
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:40,670
Open up the play a prefab and then we are going to do what we're going to go and find base stats and

71
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,020
the level up particle effect we need to set from our effects folder.

72
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,870
Drag it in and let's go ahead and hit play.

73
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,540
Okay.

74
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,500
So I need to go and level up so I'm actually going to delete the save file because I think the easiest

75
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,920
way to level up is just to kill this guard bash him about a bit.

76
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,210
And then okay.

77
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,690
We have leveled up and they go.

78
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,040
We got a nice particle effect.

79
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,570
Now I didn't get to see whether it follows us around nicely when we move.

80
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,810
So I want to just try that one more time so get the sword.

81
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,400
Kill the guard and if we move around you can see the plus icons are following us around but are also

82
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,420
world space.

83
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,990
So the ones that have already spawned state where they work were fantastic.

84
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,150
So that's the level up effect.

85
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,380
Hopefully you had a go at that yourself and were not too trapped in figuring that out.

86
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:37,740
So that's all well and good but one thing I'm noticing that is a bit frustrating and we could perhaps

87
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:44,880
fix with this level up notification is that our health is going down and when we level up it with we're

88
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,780
still losing health it would be nice if when we leveled up we got a health bonus as well at least that's

89
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,430
what I want to implement in my game and it's a great challenge for you to apply your knowledge of events

90
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,110
from a couple of lectures ago.

91
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:01,890
So I'd like you to have a go at the challenge to regenerate your health so add an on level up events.

92
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:09,060
I'd like you to add that in base stats and then in the health component subscribe to that on Level Up

93
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,060
events and use it to set their health to a percentage of its maximum.

94
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:20,070
Every time we level up we can set to a percentage of maximum or if you've already got more than that

95
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,140
percentage of maximum keep it as it is.

96
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,000
See if you can do that kind of behavior.

97
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,390
If you're not sure how to do this bit then do everything else and just set the health to maximum to

98
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:37,550
100 percent by using the base stats to get the number of health points that is maximum.

99
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,870
Pause the video and have a go at this challenge.

100
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,670
KAYE Welcome back.

101
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:49,770
So we're going to add an event now it should be starting to become a bit easy to do these events.

102
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,330
Well it's gonna look like is it gonna be a public event action because we don't need to take any arguments

103
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,340
we don't need to return value and it's going to call on level up like so.

104
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:07,630
And then on level up we are going to call on Level Up Where are we going to call it in wherever we have

105
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,240
done the level up so we got a level of effect after the level of effect has been spawned.

106
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,070
We'll call on level up which will call all the things that subscribed to on level up.

107
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,140
So we want to find our health components and subscribe as we said.

108
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:27,280
So we're gonna do that in start and we're gonna do this regardless of whether we have set the health

109
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,350
points or not.

110
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,890
So it's going to be getting the base stats and then we're gonna do on level up.

111
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,950
We want to subscribe a function what are we going to subscribe Well I'm going to create a function so

112
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:48,640
plus equals re Gen rate health like so and I'm not calling it because we are trying to subscribe it

113
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,470
and I can just go ahead and generate this method.

114
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,730
Private method regenerate health.

115
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,670
Let me move it down below the public methods.

116
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,960
So we've got Di it's more important.

117
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,750
Keep that up their experience reward them below that.

118
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:08,470
I'm going to have regenerate health and as I said the simple solution is just to set it to Max.

119
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:15,100
So that would be health points equals get component based stats and then based at health but we might

120
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:21,210
want to do what's the maximum between the current health points and some percentage of this.

121
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:29,590
So say we want to regenerate to 60 percent then let's have a sterilized ball field for the percentage

122
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,660
sterilize field

123
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,760
floats.

124
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,770
Read Jan Gration percentage.

125
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,550
And we're going to set it by default.

126
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,130
Let's have it as 70 percent regenerates to 70 percent health and then what we're gonna do is in our

127
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,870
regenerate health we're gonna get any floats called region

128
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:09,850
points like so and we're going to multiply our maximum health by the reed generation percentage divided

129
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,010
by 100 to make that into a fraction rather than a percentage.

130
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,600
So it's going to be point seven for example if it's a 70 like we've got.

131
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:27,700
So we got a region health points and we're going to set the health points equal to math f dot Max which

132
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,380
allows us to get the maximum two values that we pass in and that can be the maximum with the health

133
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,740
points.

134
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,730
So if we've got more health points than the region health points don't reduce it.

135
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:43,360
And otherwise we do at region health points and set it to that instead.

136
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,300
So let's see if this notification system is working and we are indeed regenerating our health points.

137
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:52,960
So notice we died down to about 40 health points when we killed that God.

138
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,530
Let's try it out now.

139
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:03,040
If we are killing the God I'm getting some health region so whack the God a few times like so and then

140
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,890
notice I have region by health back up to 70 percent which means that I don't get all the benefit of

141
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,420
having all the health and just leveled up to I would need health potions and so on to get there but

142
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:20,560
I have got a little bit of health region to help me go on through the level and if we want we can tweak

143
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,020
our regeneration percentage we go for 50 percent or 20 percent or whatever the regeneration percentage

144
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,570
you actually want to be is cool.

145
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:35,440
So to summarize what we've got now is a particle system spawning when we level up and we've also revised

146
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,950
our events and delegates to create an event for level up that we've used in our health script to provide

147
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,730
health regeneration in the next lecture.

148
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:50,950
We are gonna have the damage caused by the enemies and by the players change depending on their levels

149
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:57,970
so that if we are encountering a grunt when we have levelled up it's suddenly easier to attack them.

150
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,410
I'll see you in that lecture.
