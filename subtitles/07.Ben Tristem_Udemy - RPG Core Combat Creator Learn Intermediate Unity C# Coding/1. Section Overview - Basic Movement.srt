This video is a quick overview to show you what we'll have done by the end of this section.
1

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:14,060
We will have our character running around in our world navigating seamlessly around objects looking
2

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,710
cool with a full blend tree animation that we'll set up from scratch.
3

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,380
Here we are in our scene.
4

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,590
You'll see that we'll set up a simple terrain just drop a couple of place holder houses in there a little
5

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,400
bit of structure.
6

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,100
No need to go to town just yet set up our navigation using a nav mesh and putting a nav mesh agent on
7

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,670
our player.
8

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:37,730
So the player does some really cool things like just understands that it needs to go around objects that
9

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,930
are marked as static in the world you can see they're just kind of figures it out like a clever little
10

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,030
sausage that is great work and you can see our blend tree down here which will be part of our animation
11

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,760
system sorry animator system.
12

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,490
There we go.
13

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,910
Just one state of locomotion in a blend.
14

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,350
tree dropping in a couple of assets and implementing a follow camera to follow the player around.
15

16
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,560
So let's jump in and start getting a little bit of a sandbox together so we can make movement for our
16

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:03,920
game.
