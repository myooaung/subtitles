1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,110
High again in this video we are going to be instantiating a big old soda a little bit of a silly sword.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,240
If I do say so myself in the player's hands so that we can run around with a weapon and start the whole

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,250
journey of putting weapons into our game.

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,320
So let's jump in and get started for our play to wield a weapon we need a concept of what in other words

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,910
what weapon and where in other words where is our playing and a hold that so going to start by jumping

6
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:34,240
over into my fighters script find a dot see yes and we'll give ourselves to new fields in here to new

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,270
serialized fields serialize field.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,800
First off will be a game object.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,720
And I'm gonna call that weapon prefab because our weapons will be prefect and I will initialize that

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,530
at no.

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,140
Just so if we don't have a weapon equipped the compiler knows that we deliberately don't have anything

12
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,800
in there.

13
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,880
For example if we're just doing unarmed and we don't want a weapon now.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,040
Second we will serialize field.

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:05,000
This one will be a transform because it's a where we need to know the location.

16
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,210
I'm gonna call this hand trance form because I'm putting putting the weapon in the player's hand.

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:16,380
And again I'll initialize this at no save that up jump back over into unity.

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,560
Now what we need to do is to first of all identify where we are going to put that.

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,690
So let's go into our play a prefab click on the little Chevron arrow key thing to the right of the player

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,840
prefab and within here we can see we've got our character model I'm going to scroll through here I'm

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,070
using my arrow keys right arrow key expands and down arrow he moves the indicator down I'm just did

22
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,250
the data and looking for spine down right down right you can use a little clicky thing on the left here

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:44,600
if you want.

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,300
That's the official name for it but I find this is quick when I'm looking for something if he does hold

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,020
down right it just quickly expands out everything and then you can go off and find what you're looking

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,520
for what we're looking for here is the hand I'm going to put the weapons in the right hand for now.

27
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,090
Later on we will have some weapons in the left hand like the bow and arrow but for now we're going to

28
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,090
put it in the right hand and underneath my right hand I'm going to right click Create empty in here

29
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,470
I'm going to create a new game object this will be what's the weapon we're gonna use First I use a sword

30
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:21,900
first so I'm gonna call this e quipped sword is this a new game object make sure that the equipped sword

31
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:28,170
is at the 0 0 position which it should be if you've just gone right click and created an empty game

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,550
object now going to go and find within my Sinti asset pack here my prefabs burn where are we right down

33
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,360
the bottom this sword so S M weapons sword 0 1 Dragon to the hierarchy underneath equipped sword if

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,250
you're using your own weapon again make sure that it's reset to 0 0 0 if you've got some weird numbers

35
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,740
in here then you're gonna get all sorts of mischief when you try to rotate and s so make sure the child

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,390
is reset to being zeroed underneath the equip sword.

37
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,600
So now we can manipulate our sword within our equipped sword game object.

38
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,650
The reason I've done it this way and staggered it is that what I want to do is go into play mode move

39
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:14,130
around the positioning of the sword and have its position relative to the equipped sword game object

40
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:20,670
which I know is being childish right under the hand so it's going to be in its correct position you

41
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,260
can see our indicator here it's right under the hand now I can go in and monkey around with his sword

42
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,570
to my heart's content content knowing that it's going to follow around where the hand goes and importantly

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:38,700
what I'm going to do is jump out of player click on Play Now go back into play at this point we're working

44
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:46,260
on an instance of the player not the prefab itself when we click on play so as I go and find where is

45
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:57,000
the root hips to using my keyboard again the spine clavicle shoulder elbow hand Okay and here I will

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,120
find my equip sword These are all instances so changes here aren't gonna be applied back to my prefab

47
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,110
so I'm gonna have to copy the values so let's have a look where is it currently position not in the

48
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:14,160
best spot but we will while clicked on this sword I'm going to rotate it around properly click on pause

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,220
just so he's not wobbling too much rotated around get it into the right position I find we need to have

50
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,770
our weapons rotated quite a long way away from the player if you're having trouble seeing and if you've

51
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:35,950
got some clipping plane issues and click F to zoom out to focus in on your weapon and just getting into

52
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,170
a pretty good spot that you're happy with.

53
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,120
Okay now what we can do is on pause and as we run around these sword should be in the correct position

54
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,460
in the player's hand it's kind of chopping his face off a little bit there.

55
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,960
So what I'll do.

56
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,610
Click f just to get it into the right spot.

57
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,280
Does it rotate mine down a little bit so it's nearly touching the ground as he runs.

58
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:55,610
Okay.

59
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,350
Nearly bunks him in the head but not quite.

60
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,020
Awesome.

61
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,300
The other thing I'm going to do for my sword just because I think it looks funny and silly is to scale

62
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,840
it up so I will take my scale and maybe make it two to two.

63
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,990
Okay so is really dumb massive saw that he's running right.

64
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,830
It's too long now.

65
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:22,900
I think the scale what's at the X on the Y so I make the Y a little bit shorter I wanna make it kind

66
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,940
of this big fat final fantasy style sword that he's running around with that looks a little bit too

67
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,580
heavy for him clunk clunk nearly banging on the ground.

68
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,560
Excellent excellent excellent.

69
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,810
A dumb funny way.

70
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,100
Okay.

71
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,450
There we go.

72
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,670
So it's a little bit silly a little bit funny but that's the game that I'm going for here.

73
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,400
Now what we need to do before you can get a play mode and click out to play mode yet is to right click

74
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,220
on transform copy component.

75
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,850
Now we can click out of play mode and enter our play a prefab again find where we've got our equipped

76
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:58,840
sword and then click on underneath that find the transform of the the sword prefab itself right click

77
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,770
and paste component values and that should be there we go.

78
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,820
He's got his sword.

79
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:10,730
Now when I click on play again we can run around run around when we click on play.

80
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,890
It should all be copied in there as expected.

81
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,830
Okay excellent.

82
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,660
Now we need to make sure that is a prefab.

83
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,680
So again from within my player prefab I'm going to make myself a new folder game.

84
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:33,370
I will call this weapons create folder weapons and within weapons I'm going to drag the equipped sword

85
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,990
down.

86
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,260
Excellent.

87
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,980
And now that our sword is prefab if we're going to edit it I recommend that you click into the equipped

88
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,550
sword.

89
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,500
Now we're working on the prefab the sword itself.

90
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,870
You want to make any changes to it.

91
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,620
You can make some changes in here.

92
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,690
Make sure you're editing the sword itself.

93
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,160
So if you're wanting to change the position of it if you've got some new values change the sword itself.

94
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,020
Don't be changing the equips so we need to keep that at the 0 0 point sitting right on the head because

95
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,810
any changes we make at the child level will be propagated to all of the equipped swords out there in

96
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:10,960
the scene whereas if we make changes to the transform of the parent of the equipped sword it won't be

97
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,850
propagated.

98
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,520
It won't go and change any instances that we currently have in the scene or other swords that enemies

99
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,180
for example might be wielding.

100
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,460
Okay.

101
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,450
Hopefully that explanation made sense for you.

102
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,840
If I jump back out into my game you can see our player has the sword sitting his head.

103
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:34,210
But how do we instantiate this sword at runtime so we can in the future switch out our weapons.

104
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,740
Well that's gonna be the challenge for you.

105
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,620
What you instantiate the weapon in the hand create a spawn weapon method to instantiate a weapon in

106
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,450
the player's hand when the game starts.

107
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,250
And here is a hint for you instantiate takes you know what it takes in a way which has been what we've

108
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,110
been talking about until this point.

109
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:55,870
So in the fight did not see a script spawn a weapon in the player's hand and I'll see you back here

110
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,320
when you're done.

111
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,300
Right here.

112
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,560
So I'm going to.

113
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,630
From within my player.

114
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:07,390
I'm just going to delete this equipped sword point because we want to be instantiating at runtime so

115
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,450
we don't want him to be holding one already back out of player over into my script.

116
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,130
I'm gonna do this in the stop method.

117
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,620
We want to have this straightaway as the game starts so start just tidy up my parentheses here.

118
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,900
My what are these my curly braces.

119
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:27,730
Tidy them up a little bit and I'm going to create a new method spawn weapon parentheses semicolon.

120
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,760
This isn't created yet so click on it.

121
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,580
Control.

122
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:37,390
Full stop or control period will allow me to generate method and it's as simple as using instantiate

123
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:44,410
and then the what is going to be the weapon prefab and the comma where he's going to be the hand transform

124
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,500
and transform.

125
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,790
Okay semicolon save that up.

126
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,710
Now we've got a couple of thing I'm just gonna move this down.

127
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:58,000
Actually it's good coding practices we believe to have your start and update method right at the top.

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,470
So underneath method I'm just gonna paste that new method spawn weapon we just created such a little

129
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,350
bit tidier.

130
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,960
So we tend to go start an update and then we have our public methods.

131
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,600
Then we have our private methods back over into unity what do we need to do.

132
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,450
Well we need to click on the player.

133
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,440
Let's jump into the player prefab again as Sam has reminded me a gazillion times make sure we're working

134
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,900
inside the prefab then we know it gets applied the right level in the right way.

135
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,690
And if I clicked on the right thing just then on the player there we go.

136
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:33,310
Now we want to find the fighter script currently the weapon prefab well will drag in the equipped sword

137
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,940
from our game.

138
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,290
Game weapons photo and then we will find the hand which is sitting on the player I'm gonna grab the

139
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,840
hand itself.

140
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,210
Drag that in a hand transform and there we go.

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,620
And just a side note we're gonna be doing a lot more work with this will be using scripting all objects

142
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,320
so this is just to get us underway.

143
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,900
But in the future we'll be having this a lot more sophisticated.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,740
We won't just be dragging in a weapon because we need it to change when for example the player picks

145
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,250
up a weapon.

146
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:01,970
Okay.

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,980
So let's click.

148
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,090
We'll see if the player has a sword in his hand.

149
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,070
Hopefully he does fighting.

150
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,750
Why.

151
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,270
There we go.

152
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,250
Shazam we got this big old sword.

153
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,560
And if I can drag my window over a little bit we can run over to the enemies and they don't have weapons

154
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,450
yet but can we still doing our old animation we're gonna change that in upcoming videos.

155
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,770
But we have our weapon.

156
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,750
If you wanted to you could go ahead and do exactly the same process and put the same weapon or other

157
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,340
weapons into the hands of your enemies and you may notice we're getting some red arrows.

158
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:31,860
That's okay.

159
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,520
That's because our enemies are instantiating weapons but they don't have any weapons yet.

160
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,450
That's fine we'll be fixing that in the next video.

161
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,680
So for now that's it.

162
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,020
We've got our first weapon.

163
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,880
We're well underway and I'll see you in the next video.
