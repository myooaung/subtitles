00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,670
Hello and welcome in the next handful of videos we are going to be looking at how to add damage text

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,020
that spawns above our player's head when we take damage or above the enemy.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,540
So if I go and attack this enemy you can see that we've got damage coming up fading off kind of vapid

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:25,430
writing off the enemies and it is coming up and spawning and always facing towards the camera.

5
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,540
Now in this lecture we're going to figure out how we can create text like that in game UI that faces

6
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,520
towards the camera at all times.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,800
Let's dive in so we want to get some health text over the top of the player's head.

8
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,550
So how we're going to do this we're gonna go open up our character prefab and we are going to start

9
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,600
off with adding in some text why.

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,870
And we're gonna do this by right clicking on the character going that's the you I objects and selecting

11
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,370
just a text object.

12
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,950
Now you could do this with text message probe.

13
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,760
I don't want to complicate things more than they need to be.

14
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:13,520
Now one thing we're going to change right off the bat is this canvas is currently in screen space overlay.

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,680
That means that if we go ahead and hit play is going to show over the top of the screen as you can see

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,040
here this new text is showing right in the middle it's a little bit faint maybe we will change the color

17
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:32,570
over to Red a nice kind of vibrant red like this just what we're probably gonna want to use anyway.

18
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,120
Let's go ahead and hit play and they go.

19
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,640
You can see it's hovering over right over the top.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,610
In fact it's quite a few copies of it are hovering here because one is there for each character.

21
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:51,000
Now what I want to do with this text is make it into world space so that it follows the characters around.

22
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,720
We do this on the canvas itself.

23
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,300
So get to the cameras find the camera's component the render mode.

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,800
We want to switch over to world space like so.

25
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,950
Now if we go ahead and hit play it's going to be completely out of whack.

26
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:10,100
The scale is not ready there if we show gizmos you can't even see it it's just really hard to see and

27
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,800
you might be see and seemed I'm not going to fart around what we're going to try and do instead is bring

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,930
this into line because basically what's going on when you do world space is suddenly these width units

29
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,850
are height units they're all in meters which is obviously huge.

30
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,170
So let's bring this down to one meter by one meter.

31
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:35,780
Now let's try and get our text into that canvas so you can see it's going to be a bit of a stretch because

32
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,320
the text is getting pixilated already.

33
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:46,280
As I scroll in so we can fix this by looking at our Canvas Scaler and we want to change the dynamic

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,490
pixels per unit because if you increase this you can see the sharpness of the text goes up and that's

35
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:58,250
what we want to be doing and it can keep increasing increasing increasing and eventually it's going

36
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,670
to start scaling the text down.

37
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,410
And that's what we're going to want to do.

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,950
So let's give that a shot.

39
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,590
Let's see if we can get this down.

40
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,370
I think I found that about a thousand.

41
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:20,870
This seems to work and we want to position our text so that it is inside our canvas rectangle so let's

42
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,290
do that by changing the width of our text element.

43
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,570
And if we zoom in now you can see that we are in much more sensible territory.

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,590
It is not quite right still but it's much more sensible.

45
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,390
Now all we have to do is center that canvas.

46
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,380
So at the moment it's in an odd position that's central.

47
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:47,620
0 0 and have a look over in game if we go ahead and hit play then we should be seeing would expect to

48
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,360
be seeing some canvases at their feet.

49
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,700
Let's try bringing the canvas a little bit higher okay.

50
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,130
Now we've got the text hovering above their heads.

51
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,480
So that's the kind of thing that we want to have except that we want the text to turn towards the camera

52
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,020
rather than be turning around with the character.

53
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,440
So that's not quite right that particular aspect.

54
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,120
Also the text in there is going to be a number.

55
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:23,270
So perhaps you do 100 damage that would be a representative example and you can see didn't quite apply

56
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,700
to the prefab service save.

57
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:33,410
Also sent the text while we're at it and hit play and have a little walk around and you can see that

58
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:39,440
now we have got the text 100 floating above our characters had in fact all the characters heads.

59
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,050
Now obviously that's not all going to want.

60
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,010
Eventually we want this to turn towards the camera and we want it to only show up when we take damage.

61
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,690
But for now this will do.

62
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:57,320
So what I'm going to do is create a camera facing script over in in Corso script core and create a new

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:07,700
C sharp script called camera facing and this component is what we are going to use to rotate out our

64
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:14,300
text component our canvas so that I could give you a little mini challenge of your feeling confident

65
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:22,010
to go ahead and fill out the camera facing script so that it updates the position of that text about

66
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,960
the rotation particularly of that text so that it faces towards the camera.

67
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,360
If you feel able to do that it's a little bit of a tricky challenge.

68
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:36,580
And don't worry if you do it a different way and my way is better than to take my way if you do it a

69
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,970
different way and your way is just as good.

70
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,960
Then do it that way instead.

71
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,930
Now I'm going to go ahead and plough on.

72
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,670
So if you want to give a go at this challenge pause video.

73
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,290
Now OK.

74
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:48,710
Welcome back.

75
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,500
So I'm going to first of all stick this in a namespace.

76
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,040
So I wonder if you forgot to do that.

77
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,330
So it's gonna be RPG dot core and then paste that class back in.

78
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,520
And I don't need to start method all I need is update to update the rotation of the text every single

79
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,480
frame.

80
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:15,530
Now one way we can do this to update rotation is actually by setting a transform dot forward vector

81
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,820
so you can tell.

82
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:22,910
You can set the forward vector and at 10 essentially says this is the way that this particular object

83
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,750
should be facing.

84
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,860
So what way do we want it to be facing where we want it to be facing the same way as the camera.

85
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:36,800
So I can do the camera dot main so get in the main camera and then get it transform and Gates forward

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,520
vector as well.

87
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,220
So if we set our forward vector to the camera's forward vector the canvas is going to be facing the

88
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,320
same way as the camera at all times.

89
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,830
That's basically what we want.

90
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,810
So let's have a go and add this on to our canvas and then we'll make a prefab of this to clear things

91
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,540
up.

92
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:00,850
So going to add a component is going to be the camera facing script like so.

93
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:07,940
And if go ahead and hit play now what we should see is that all of those canvasses are facing towards

94
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,860
us like so.

95
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:16,190
So as I said the last thing I want to do is just clear up this canvas I'm going to change it in to giving

96
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,760
it a different name.

97
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:26,300
It's going to be the health the damage text like so and I'm going to make a prefab of it in to the game

98
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,320
folder and particularly under UI and I create a new folder in here for in-game UI.

99
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:40,940
So create folder in game and then inside that folder I'm going to just drag out damaged text as it is

100
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,160
and that's just going to the damage takes prefab that's just to clear things up we're gonna make modifications

101
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,680
to damage text prefab in that prefab and the character prefab might link into it might use it for other

102
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,180
things.

103
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,920
And in fact later on we all going to be spawning this damage text prefab from a damaged text spawner.

104
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,120
So it does make sense for us to put it in a prefab at this point.

105
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,830
So a word of warning to those of you who might be using a newer version of unity if you've created your

106
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:13,310
prefab and it's got this canvas environment as the root this kind of weird black Great out thing and

107
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,030
you cannot see your text that's the most important thing because we're gonna need to be animating it

108
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,650
in the next lecture if you cannot see your text then follow these steps.

109
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:26,870
We're going to go back to our character we've created our damage text prefab and just right click and

110
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,420
unpack the prefab completely.

111
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:34,730
I'm also going to go ahead and delete that prefab that we just created because we want to go ahead and

112
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,930
create one a new.

113
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:45,440
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create just a empty game object that we will use as the basis

114
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:54,880
for creating a damage text I'm just gonna call it damage text and pull it over and then we can copy

115
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,780
this damage text in fact cut this prefab.

116
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,900
Well I think you might have to copy it go into the damaged text prefab and paste it in here and we can

117
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:12,370
then go back to find our character and remove the extra set of damaged text now you'll see that in this

118
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:17,440
prefab while you've got an extra parents in here you now have a canvas that should be working and you

119
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,730
should be able to see your text.

120
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,380
Cool stuff.

121
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:27,280
So in this lecture we have looked at how we can use a canvas act to turn and face towards our camera

122
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,860
as you can see here.

123
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,060
I've got our number 100 is facing towards the camera no matter where we are in the world or how our

124
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,400
player is rotated and we have made that into a prefab.

125
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,880
Now in the next lecture we're going to be looking at how we can animate it so that it floats off into

126
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,480
the distance and fades out.

127
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,070
We'll see that.
