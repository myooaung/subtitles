00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,090
Welcome to the architectural overview.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,170
In this video I'm gonna get you really excited about the different features we're going to be implementing

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,360
in this RPG by showing you the prototype we've already got and showing you how it breaks down into bite

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,250
sized modules that we are going to be implementing one by one and which courses you should go to to

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,550
learn which bits of this RPG

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:33,250
so let's take a look at the modules that we're gonna break this down into the first core module is going

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,510
to be movement is gonna be a namespace in C C sharp parlance.

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,980
So basically this is going to be a point and click movement system a bit like torchlight.

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,660
You can see how it's based off a nav mesh here that blue stuff and all these widgets are showing us

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,940
how the nav mesh stuff works.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,330
So next dependent upon that movement system we are going to have the control system which is responsible

12
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,700
for the player movement but also it's going to be responsible for the A.I. of the enemies which will

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,850
be able to move as well.

14
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,320
Then after that we are going to build a combat system.

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,060
This works very much like you would expect a combat system to work.

16
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,350
You point click you click on an enemy and if you have a weapon equipped that is you walk up to the enemy

17
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,120
and you start attacking them and obviously they can attack you too they've got A.I. that allows them

18
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,890
to do this after the combat.

19
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:28,960
We are going to notice that the combat has to rely upon movement because when as you saw when we click

20
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,800
on an enemy we have to move up to the enemy.

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,800
So there's a dependency there and you can see it start to get complicated but also we're gonna have

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,730
a core component which all these things depend upon.

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,170
Now it's gonna get more complicated than this.

24
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,170
Bear with me.

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,350
After that we are going to be implementing saving.

26
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,560
This is going to be as a separate course hence it's in gray and combat and movement and going to rely

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,550
on saving because they will need to know how to save their content.

28
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,150
That's going to be implemented on per module basis combat will save things like the health state movement

29
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,760
will save things like your current position and so on and so forth.

30
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,750
Then we're going to implement stats which combat is going to rely on and that's going to allow us to

31
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:17,680
tweak certain parameters we might have stats such as how much damage we do per hit how quickly we hit

32
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,330
what's our base health rate.

33
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:25,450
So combat is going to rely on that and stats will be modifiable later on by our inventory items by the

34
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,420
attributes of the player such as their strength and so on then we're going to be implementing a progression

35
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,750
system.

36
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,640
This is basically experience points levelling up.

37
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,700
That's something else that can affect the stats.

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,820
So if as you level up your base health is going to level up as well.

39
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:46,380
Then in blue because this is gonna be in the part to course not in this course we are going to be doing

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,430
inventories.

41
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,130
So you can see that going on here.

42
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,330
I've got inventory I can equip items I could also pick up these items from around the world and depending

43
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,820
on what I equip that's going to affect the combat system.

44
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,230
So if I have the sword which is much more powerful than this hammer I am killing these minions in no

45
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:01,850
time.

46
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,230
And that's going to depend upon the saving system to save what you currently have in your inventory

47
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,290
and on the stat system because it is going to implement things in stats.

48
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,360
It's going to modify the stats just like progression and also it's going to be depended upon by combat

49
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,210
and control systems as well combat because combat needs to know what weapon you've got equipped control

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,020
because it needs to know how to pick things up and so on and so forth.

51
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,360
The next system going to be implementing is the special actions system.

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,850
This is special abilities also known as.

53
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,130
So if we take a look at this epic box battle scene I'm clearly losing healthcare so I've equipped a

54
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,700
special ability the health potion which is consumable so if I use it up as I do in the course of battling

55
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,560
this boss I have no more and he's eventually going to go ahead and get me killed.

56
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:57,110
And you can see this is dependent upon combat it's dependent upon inventories it's dependent on saving

57
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,990
and core.

58
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,570
So saving because we need to be able to remember which special actions we currently have enabled which

59
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,650
ones we have in our hot action ball.

60
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:11,570
It needs to depend upon inventories because we are going to be equipping actual actions from inventories

61
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,350
you might just do it through a spell book but it's pretty much like an inventory and it depends upon

62
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,170
combat because we can essentially have special actions that act like combat and control because we need

63
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,190
to be able to activate these special actions.

64
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,770
The next thing is going to be questing and to enable us to do questing we're going to have a dialog

65
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,000
system.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,650
So the dialog system can look a little bit like this particularly it's gonna come in two parts.

67
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,110
This is the editor where you can add nodes you can write in your text you can then go ahead and make

68
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,600
the connections to create a tree which is going to be your conversation tree then that conversation

69
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
tree when you go up to somebody who wants to talk to you.

70
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,550
Looks kind of like this you get the options under the tree and the dialogue to choose from and you can

71
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,050
follow the tree down that way.

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,820
And as you can see the dialogue system is also control because we need to be able to click on and on

73
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:06,000
certain characters and for them to be able to activate the dialogue now we're gonna be creating the

74
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,550
attribute system which I hinted at it's going to be things like strength and so on in many games it's

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,580
called a stat system.

76
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,980
But basically these are things like strength dexterity very common to most arpeggios and you can see

77
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,390
I'm not doing well in this fight but if I increase my strength I'm doing far more damage to this ogre

78
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,010
and I will eventually be able to kill it.

79
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,430
That depend on stats because it's going to modify as we've seen the different stats such as your health

80
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,130
and your damage per second.

81
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,800
Going to have a progression import system which is going to bring in things from an Excel spreadsheet

82
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,090
into our progression so we can say things like at level 2 you should have this base health and so on.

83
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,930
And then polish it all off we're going to bring this together with some UI which is just depending on

84
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,180
a lot of stuff because it relies on a lot of things dialogue needs UI special actions inventories and

85
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,110
attributes all need UI.

86
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,720
Now that being said you don't have to take this course as part 1 then part 2.

87
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,030
This is you at the start.

88
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:04,290
You can choose to go down part one's route and do movement combat control stance and progression or

89
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,460
you could if you decide you prefer the features from Part 2.

90
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,820
Go ahead and start part 2 first.

91
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,490
You're not going to need the knowledge we're going to just import the code from part 1 but anything

92
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,810
we touch we're going to go over and most things we're not even going to touch.

93
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,220
They have been specifically decouple this way and split into the courses so that you can start Part

94
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,000
2 and just treat Part 1 as a library as if you were using Unity you know you don't know how Unity works

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,290
do you but you are able to use it the same with the part 1 code.

96
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,860
So if you're more interested in learning about inventories first please go where your motivation takes

97
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,950
you as you will have a much better learning journey and start Part 2 instead.

98
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,620
So there are these two completely decoupled paths and if you want to you can also go down the route

99
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,450
of doing saving or dialogue mini courses which are gonna be separate courses because they're quite applicable

100
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:57,000
to other games and they're quite bulky in themselves so you can go ahead and choose your learning journey

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,700
and I'd like you to share your choice with other students as well as your reasoning and what you're

102
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,670
most excited about.

103
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,420
So tell us what the plan is.

104
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:12,030
Use the sharing link against this lecture I'll take you to the forum with a pre populated post and which

105
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,550
modules are most exciting to you fill out that post.

106
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,440
Share with people and go and see what other people are excited to do and maybe you'll find something

107
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,580
in common to chat about and I'll hand you over to Rick for that lecture.
