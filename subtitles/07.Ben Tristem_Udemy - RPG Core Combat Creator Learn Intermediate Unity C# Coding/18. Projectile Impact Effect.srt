1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,580
In this video we're gonna have ad hit impacts for our projectiles so that when things land Kaboom we

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,140
spray a little particle effect to give a bit of visual feedback that you've landed your target.

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,010
So let's company get started to make this process a little bit simpler.

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,260
I've given you a fireball impact that you can go ahead and download against this lecture and then drag

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,060
on into your project import that should all go in the right places.

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,370
It's probably created an effects folder so game effects and there's the fireball impact just drag it

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:39,160
in so you can see it's just a little impact like that seeing effects called fireball impact.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,400
Okay.

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,300
So we need to open up our projectile script at the start at the top.

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:50,170
I mean we need to add a serialized field that will be of type game object and we'll call that hit effect

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,760
and we'll initialize that at no.

12
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,480
I'm going to scroll on down and show you the location where I'm going to put our instantiation.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,660
So the moment where the impact takes place kaboom.

14
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,630
We want to instantiate that fireball impact at the position where the impact took place.

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,910
I'm going to give you that too as a challenge instantiate the impact effect instantiate a final impact

16
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,260
vector.

17
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,520
The point of impact.

18
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:14,830
Okay.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,520
Summarize that three times now those who challenged take that on.

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,490
See you back here when you've given it a shot so on trigger enter.

21
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,130
I'm going to go all the way down just before our destroy.

22
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:33,790
I'm going to add a new line which is if hit effect is not now so will protect against now in this instance.

23
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,920
If not now then what are we going to do.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,490
Well we want to instantiate instantiate so if we've got a hit effect we want to instantiate it will

25
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,960
be the hit effect that we just created a variable of where is it going to be.

26
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,250
Let's have a look and see what we've got access to.

27
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,980
We've got to get a location that is basically where we are trying to shoot at.

28
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,610
So we'll use that as our as our position.

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:06,880
So you get aim location parentheses and then the rotation will just say transform dot rotation semicolon.

30
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:14,020
Okay we'll save that jump back into unity and then find my fireball projectile so fireball projectile.

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,270
There we go.

32
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,810
Open up the prefab you can see now we have a place for our heat effect.

33
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,890
I'm going to find my new effect.

34
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,070
I just brought in fireball impact drag that on over.

35
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,150
That should be pretty good.

36
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,160
Click on play.

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,780
If I don't have the fibro equipped I can run out of my little fireball symbology thing there and shoot

38
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,800
and see what happens.

39
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,460
And kaboom we have this effect that plays really cool.

40
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,800
I like it nice and simple straightforward.

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,340
Having a fireball effect.

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,220
So what we could be doing is adding a an impact effect for all of our projectiles which just go ahead

43
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,190
and quickly make a variant of the fireball impacts.

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,850
I'm going to right click Create let's see beep prefab variant.

45
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,290
I'll call this generic impact effect.

46
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,500
Okay.

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,900
I'm not sure where I'm going to use it I'll probably just use it for my arrows for now might color it.

48
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,960
I might not but I was gonna make one here see if we can go through this process to make it work.

49
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,200
Open that up and we've got our kaboom.

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm going to scroll out a little bit play that.

51
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,420
Okay.

52
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,710
Make it a lot smaller.

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,630
So start size from point let's say point 0 1 to point 1.

54
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,180
See how that looks.

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:24,890
Yep.

56
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,660
And then we'll make the start speed between 2 and 4.

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,010
So it shouldn't go as far.

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,210
Push.

59
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:31,900
Okay.

60
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,490
Then I'm gonna narrow the hole shape down a whole bunch so it's more of a.

61
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,450
If it's an arrow strike it's gonna be in a tighter tighter area.

62
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:46,030
I think play blink and then we'll change the color to make it a little bit more neutral because color

63
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,140
over lifetime.

64
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,420
Click on that selector.

65
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,050
Now I've got a whole bunch of presets I've created already but you can go in and add new selector things

66
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,740
you can delete them you can change the color.

67
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,300
I think you've probably done that enough before so you know how it works.

68
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,230
Transparency at the top color down the bottom double click to add a new one.

69
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm going to just choose one of my other ones I've created previously.

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,370
This one that looks a little bit wacky.

71
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,840
It's got greens and yellows.

72
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,410
Okay just to differentiate it from what we had previously and you know what I'm going to do one last

73
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,580
little tweak.

74
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,620
I'm going to have this last for a shorter amount of time but go faster.

75
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:29,440
I think from say 10 to 15 sorry start lifetime point one two point two and push and start to be 10 to

76
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,080
15.

77
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,860
Bam bam.

78
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,570
Okay that looks okay.

79
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:38,920
Now we've got our generic hit impact jump back into our other projectiles will find the arrow projectile

80
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
blue.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,040
We will give that the hit impact of heat effect of generic hit effects.

82
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,680
Awesome.

83
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,540
And now I'm going to find my projectile red.

84
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:59,200
Do the same thing effects generic impact effect cause I could be adding this to my root arrow projectile.

85
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,700
That would be a place to put this so my heat effect is the generic heat effect that would be a smart

86
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,410
thing to do wouldn't it.

87
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,230
So generic hit impact is on our projectile at the root level so particularly for our arrows it means

88
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,010
they'll all get that.

89
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,870
I've also gone and added it to the blue and the red I didn't need to do that but we've got all our bases

90
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,740
covered now haven't we.

91
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,770
So I'm gonna click on play run over to my bow and arrow so that I actually am shooting the blue arrows.

92
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,270
We'll see how this looks and pull.

93
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,790
Okay.

94
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,670
They're hitting me I'm hitting them so I recommend you go and create a red one and maybe make this blue

95
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,220
one a little bit more blue.

96
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,420
I've got it a little bit green in my approach here but you know you can see that I'm actually landing

97
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:42,810
it and having that moment of impact I think makes our arrows and our missiles and all that kind of stuff

98
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,320
a lot more interesting.

99
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,340
So there we go.

100
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,370
That's a quick one for this lecture.

101
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,870
Great work and I'll see you again shortly.
