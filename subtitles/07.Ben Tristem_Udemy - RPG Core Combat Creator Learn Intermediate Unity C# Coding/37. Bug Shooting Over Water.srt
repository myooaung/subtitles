00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,950
So I just want to show you a quick issue that has been pointed out to me regarding how we deal with

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,900
can attack and not being able to move to targets.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,010
Now this doesn't quite work with ranged weapons.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,550
Let me show you how for example let's take this god here.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,040
The one with arranged bow and put him on the bridge.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,010
Let's delete a segment of bridge here and rebuild at nav mesh.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,370
Now what I'm expecting to see is that I could walk up to this bit just before the bridge and shoot at

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,550
this guy with a fireball.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,850
Let's try that out.

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,990
So if I go ahead hit play I get my fireball from over there and go to the bridge.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,150
And I want to click on this guy and I can not because there is no route to him even though my fireball

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,480
could indeed reach him and he is also not attacking me.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,560
So let's fix that quickly the way I'm gonna do that is by saying in this statement that if we cannot

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:07,920
move to and we are not in range of the combat target then we want to drop out and we can't attack but

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,790
if we are in range then we can attack.

16
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,770
Just to give us that option so we can attack things that are on an island or separated by a body of

17
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,820
water.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,190
So the way I'm going to do this is I'm going to modify and get it in range.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,610
So that actually takes the target transform in so let's do that.

20
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:35,040
I'll take a transform call it Target transform like so and we're going to replace the argument in here

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,150
where we're using the target that is set on the fighter which means we'll have to change where that

22
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,850
is called up in updates.

23
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,420
So we're going to pass in the target transform in here.

24
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:55,720
So get is in range target or transform produce and then we are going to call that in that can attack

25
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,860
if statement.

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:03,010
So I'm going to put an ampersand Ampersand to the end here can fix up my inventing a little bit.

27
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:08,080
Make things a little bit pretty and put my return statement on a separate line now that things are getting

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:18,790
a bit longer here and what we can say is that if the mover can not move to basically and we are not

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,550
get is in range of.

30
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,120
And what are we trying to get in range of the combat target that we are querying here.

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,310
Combat target transform like so.

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,190
So we're not in range of a combat target transform and we can't move to it then we're going to return

33
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,580
false.

34
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,570
Let's see how that affects things.

35
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,400
So let's go and try that out in unity.

36
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:44,680
I pick up the fireball what I'm expecting is that if I am out of range but can move to somebody like

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,010
this God over here then it will move me within range and then launch the fireball if I cannot reach

38
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,220
the rain the person by foot then it will still launch fireball at them.

39
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,690
And as you can see the enemies are also able to attack me in the same way.

40
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,190
So that fixes that little issue of not being able to attack things that we cannot reach with ranged

41
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,730
weapons.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,780
Hopefully that helps.
