00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:04.540
OK.

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.170
This is a quick design video just to let you know what it is that we're building before in the next

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.500
video.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.390
Sam is going to be talking to you about the architecture of how do we go about organizing our code.

5
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.580
So what I want you to know just at this point about our game design is that we will be implementing

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.130
the pretty much the same game as in the previous iteration of the course.

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.730
If you're familiar with that great if not no worries.

8
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.890
Well we have a fixed camera that moves with a player and a click to move system similar to games like

9
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.760
Diablo 3 which has got this really rich dive in battle a whole bunch of enemies and immersive world

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.240
game like Torchlight 2 we took a lot of inspiration from the look of the world but also the characters

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.680
with all the weapons they can pick up and the enemies and the progression through a bunch of worlds

12
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.180
and also a very simple why shouldn't say simple but a very clean mobile game which is called Battle

13
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.920
hot legacy which I like a lot made by just a couple of people I think might be a husband and wife team

14
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.970
and they've made a really rich experience without having a ton of features.

15
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.820
So I know that if you're a solo or a small indie team that it's not useful for us to try to create a

16
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.520
gigantic game we want to make something that we actually can create and produce and launch in later

17
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.440
sections of the course.

18
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.630
We'll be digging a lot deeper into game design taking a lot more about for our game how we came up with

19
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.470
the game design about the character and the story and the the worlds and progression and the stats and

20
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.500
balancing our spreadsheets and level design all those things that really go into making a great experience.

21
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.600
And the reason I'd like to bunch it all together is that if you're interested in that you can really

22
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.570
dive deep and really say what am I going to do with my game.

23
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.750
How I'm going to make my game really interesting and exciting to work on.

24
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.810
If you're not as interested in the game design and you hear a lot more for the knowledge of how to improve

25
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.760
my programming or how do I get deeper knowledge of unity then that's cool you can go quicker through

26
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.020
the game design stuff or maybe even skip it if it's not your thing that's totally cool.

27
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.700
So in the next section we will be diving in as quickly as we can and getting our hands dirty because

28
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.230
I know you're eager to get in there and let's make some stuff.

29
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.420
Let's let's talk listen and get in there and do.

30
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.490
And that will be coming up after just one or two more introduction and set up videos.

31
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.970
OK I'll see you again very soon.
