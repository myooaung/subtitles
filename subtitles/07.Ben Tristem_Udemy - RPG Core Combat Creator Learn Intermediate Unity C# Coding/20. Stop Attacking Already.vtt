00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:04.840
Hello again.

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.500
In this video.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.170
Time permitting we're going to do two things First of all when the player tries to move away in the

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.060
middle of an attack.

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.280
He keeps on swinging which is looks a little bit crappy.

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.160
We want him to stop and say oh I'm now walking and I'm not still trying to swing in the air.

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.840
The other thing is when we kill an enemy block we keep on hitting and hitting and hitting which is just

8
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.710
not cool.

9
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.460
So then the two we're going to try to take on and resolve in this video we'll do the first one and then

10
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.920
see how we're doing for time.

11
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.970
So in terms of this first part what I can do is add a couple of extra enemies just so I can see really

12
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.560
clear in my scene if there's any other behavior that's going to go on when I've got more enemies so

13
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.900
just control D to duplicate then hitting W to get my move tool making these enemies around.

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.490
Okay.

15
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.250
So now I've got three enemies so to test things out nicely.

16
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.380
And if you have a look at our animator you can see that we have from attack to locomotion our transition

17
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.560
away when we say I want to be walking now we've got has exit time clicked on and that means it will

18
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.310
finish this entire state before the transition happens.

19
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.370
Now that's cool that's valid for our standard we want the player just to be attacking and if we click

20
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.810
a bunch of times on the enemy we don't want it to be restarting the attack over and over over.

21
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.070
So that's cool.

22
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.150
What we can do is add another transition from attack to locomotion with a trigger which is a stop attacking

23
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.060
trigger or stop attack trigger it would be and this is going to be the source of your challenge.

24
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.880
So I want you to cancel the attacks stop the character's animation if we click to move.

25
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.880
So stop the characters attack animation if we click to move and then add another transition out of attack

26
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.940
in our animated controller for a transition from attack to locomotion and then add a new trigger and

27
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.740
coal set trigger.

28
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.600
So call the trigger that you've created and add that somewhere.

29
00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.590
This is my vague challenge for you is to figure out where you need to set that trigger of stop attack.

30
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.320
So there's you challenge take that on I'll see you back here when you done

31
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.510
right.

32
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.760
First of all with the now animation here animator sorry from attack we have a transition I'm going to

33
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.190
right click on attack make transition go to locomotion you can see that changes the arrow it's got three

34
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.340
little arrow things in there now to show that we've got multiple transitions if I click on the transition

35
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.200
line up here we've got transition first one in second one click on the second one that's what we're

36
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.560
going to change I'm going to remove has exit time.

37
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.960
Basically we want to be triggering something as a condition we haven't created our trigger yet.

38
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.670
So over within our parameters tab click on the plus and we'll make this a trigger.

39
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:52.850
I'm going to call this stop attack small s capital a stop attack and then over an hour conditions I'll

40
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.780
click plus select stop attack and there we go just do a bit of a save.

41
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.470
Now we need to figure out where to place this K over into our visual studio code in this video just

42
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.880
so you know I'm working in the health script the fighter script and the combat target script the first

43
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.950
thing we're going to look at is the fighter script.

44
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.820
Now at some point here we're canceling our attack and it's at that point we want to say okay let's change

45
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.240
the animation as well as long as scroll all the way down and find very simple.

46
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.180
Public void cancel where our target equals.

47
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:33.460
Now just above that I'm going to get component and the component will be the animator and make two or

48
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.210
parentheses set trigger not set but in locations set trigger and what is our trigger.

49
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.410
Well good practice.

50
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.700
Back over to unity.

51
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.620
We click once we click twice.

52
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.860
We hit the controller commands see magically that copies it for us back over into our fighter script

53
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.460
paste that between our quotations and we're saying stop attack.

54
00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.090
Now this code meet our current needs but does introduce a really subtle issue that I'm going to explain

55
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.790
in a lot of detail in a couple of videos time.

56
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.140
But for now if you find that you have an issue where your player seems to start the attack and then

57
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.890
stop the attack in a strange way don't worry about it.

58
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.340
That's a known thing that we're going to build on top of and explain and a whole bunch of detail in

59
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.500
a couple of videos.

60
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.030
But for now let's jump over and check this all works click play choose an enemy to slaughter click on

61
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.320
him and then move away.

62
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.850
And the moment I move away there's a little bit of overlap here a little bit of transition Larry to

63
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.770
blending which is good it's not snapping so yeah that looks good he looks like he's like oh no well

64
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.740
no it changed my mind.

65
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.430
Excellent.

66
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.900
I like it.

67
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.430
So let's first part of our video done excellent we've got a little bit of an area here.

68
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.060
I think that's a hangover from something we've done previous I'm going to clear that make sure that

69
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.020
we keep an eye on it.

70
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.600
But for now it looks like it's not breaking anything too bad.

71
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.520
And now for the second part which is once someone's dead you know leave him alone man.

72
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.190
Kill your jets.

73
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.830
No need to keep kicking him when they're down.

74
00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:01.000
So first thing I'm going to go over to my health script and I will write underneath our is dead bull

75
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.800
so we can see we know if the player is dead or he's not dead.

76
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.850
So let's have a way of just accessing that.

77
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.440
Is it a bunch of ways we can do this and they show you the very simple way of doing it and in later

78
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.970
videos.

79
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.260
I think Sam's going to go into a lot more depth on how to create getters and setters.

80
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.280
But for now we're going to create ourselves a public bool we will call is dead.

81
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.360
Is with capital ion capital D is dead parentheses curly braces.

82
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.580
And then in here we're going to return.

83
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.040
What.

84
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.420
What do you think we return will return.

85
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:40.700
The variable is dead as a simple way of other classes being out of say Are you dead or not just with

86
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.480
this little public.

87
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.590
Get a method.

88
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.880
Now what needs to know.

89
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.380
Well over into fighter.

90
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.730
This is what's going to need to know what's going on.

91
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.330
And one thing I'm going to do Sam and I were talking about this we would like to change out our target

92
00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.040
to make it more specific to be looking at health so we know that enemies all enemies must have health.

93
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.540
So instead of just saying that our trans target is type transform let's say that our target is of type

94
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.820
health so that we're very specific in terms of what we're targeting.

95
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.880
But also we get access to anything that we've put within the health class by the fact that we know the

96
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.510
target is of type health.

97
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.290
For example our method that we just our public method we just created is dead.

98
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.330
Now we can access that from our target without having to do any extra specifics of saying get component

99
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.860
of health and so on.

100
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:34.010
So that will break a couple of things let's go find our red squiggly lines for me line 24 target position.

101
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:41.000
So now because we before previously target was of type transform we didn't have to specify transformed

102
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.910
position because we knew that already.

103
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.030
But now we need to put in target dot transform dot position I there's another spot we have that.

104
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.360
Okay.

105
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:58.250
Down here in our Get is in range method target dot transform dot position and then in our attack method

106
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.330
instead of target equals combat target dot transform it's going to be combat target dot get component

107
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.200
and it will be the health component we're getting.

108
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.080
All right we're going health that's just a little bit of a tidy out.

109
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.970
Sometimes it's six of one half a dozen of the other but we feel the more specific you can be with the

110
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:17.930
variable type.

111
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.180
The more value you can extract from that in this particular instance.

112
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.880
And then we need to do the all important saying if the target's dead then don't continue to attack.

113
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.870
Okay.

114
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.000
That's simply the case of where are we.

115
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.320
Here I'm on line 20 I'm looking at it within our update I'm going to add a new line.

116
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.320
So he's a little mini challenge for you what do we need to write in here so that we don't do any of

117
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.700
these other behaviors.

118
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:54.600
If the character is dead if the enemy's dead okay what we say is if Target dot is dead because that

119
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.690
returns a bull remember.

120
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:02.340
Let me just remind you of that over here I created this as a bull a public method bull it's going to

121
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.020
return as a bull.

122
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.950
True or false.

123
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:13.980
So if Target is dead then we return and then the next thing we want to do is find our hit method in

124
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.390
here.

125
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.650
Tidy this up a little bit.

126
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.290
We don't need to be getting the health component.

127
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:23.910
So in to remove that and instead of saying health component dot take damage we're going to change this

128
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.840
to be target don't take damage.

129
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.830
Weapon damage because as I said before we're now accessing health from our variable.

130
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:33.270
Okay.

131
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.730
Saving up jumping back into unity and just a little reminder.

132
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:41.370
I had forgotten to save health so make sure you save that I had an error for a moment I just pause the

133
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.790
video trying to figure out what was going on I'd just forgotten to say my other script where we had

134
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.440
made a change in here so I make sure you're always safe.

135
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:57.200
Now back over into unity click on play and then click 1 2 and he's all gone and we stop attacking exactly

136
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.010
what we wanted to do.

137
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.510
And there's one last piece of tidy up we will do to make sure we don't get in problems in the future

138
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.790
is when we have a look at enemy.

139
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.800
You can see that we've got the fighter script we've got the health script and we've got the target combat

140
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.320
target.

141
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.440
So if the health script wasn't there if we'd forgotten to put it on for example if I removed this component

142
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.890
then we will have all manner of mischief where we've baked that in pretty heavily that we as assuming

143
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.380
that it has a health component.

144
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:27.960
So what we can do so that we don't have to assume we don't have to remember it in combat target.

145
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.170
We'll put out the very top of our script here.

146
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:42.510
Square braces require a component parentheses type of parentheses again it's going to be health and

147
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.140
in parentheses parentheses good.

148
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.370
No need for a semicolon.

149
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:52.830
So this is now saying that whenever we place combat target it is going to automatically place a health

150
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.820
component as well.

151
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.040
Let me just show you that in action.

152
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.660
I'll just do a quick undo to get my enemy back to the way it was.

153
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.690
So now when we click on an enemy you can see if I was to go and try to remove health.

154
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.610
Right click remove component it says can't remove health because combat target depends on it.

155
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.900
If I was to go and make a new game object so create empty just to prove a point here.

156
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:17.080
If I add the component of combat Target when I drag it over look what happens.

157
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.310
It automatically adds a health script as well which is really cool.

158
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.940
So basically it's saying you can't have a combat target without a health.

159
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:31.560
