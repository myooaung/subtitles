1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,300
In this video we're going to tune now enemy so that they have a different speed when they're walking.

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,940
As to when we have a combat moment you can see oh he's really chasing me down fast now.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,170
We're also going to tweak our placement of our patrol pass just get everything tidied up and ready to

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,690
declare our combat aspect of our moment done.

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,020
So let's jump in and get started.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,810
Let's start by updating our enemy patrol parts where they need to be patrolling.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,020
I'm going to grab the existing patrol parts and then I'll need to make a couple more so we've got this

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,420
patrol path zero at the back there.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,430
Who's going to use that over here for the gentleman who's patrolling around in the shrubbery is up the

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,290
back here and I grab the waypoints just move it around a little bit so he's not doing such a massive

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,350
patrol.

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,680
Yeah.

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,880
Come forward a little bit and then to speed up the video for this bit and then within our eye controller

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,220
we drag in patrol path.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,000
So he's using patrol path these two guys at the front.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,710
I think I'll just have them standing stationary.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,340
They gods.

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,760
After all we could have a little bit of milling around but I'll leave them stationary so this one in

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,130
the middle here I'll grab the patrol path that I've got.

20
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,230
Patrol path one in the back.

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,200
Just change the waypoints around a little bit.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,740
I'll speed up this part of the video.

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,010
I just kind of wandering around in a circle which I think is all cool.

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,810
Now he is enemy number two enemy number two needs patrol path.

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,760
Number one Okay then the guy at the back here I want him to be wandering around a little bit as well

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,540
up the back.

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,850
So we will duplicate the patrol path.

28
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,950
I'll duplicate patrol path.

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,830
One controlled D grab this patrol path.

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,030
Where are you there.

31
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,350
Leave it up to the back.

32
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,010
This is only got just the four points I think four points is enough for this guy.

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:49,730
And once again I'll speed up the video as I just move around these waypoints and if this tough enemy

34
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,310
currently has a patrol path a sign will just click up here and assign none.

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,520
So no patrol path enemy four correct three has none at the moment.

36
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,860
But we need to assign that patrol path.

37
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:07,570
We just made which was the patrol path to the enemy out the back so you do this however works for you

38
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,940
and your game you don't have to follow along exactly with me.

39
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,770
Just make sure that all enemies have a patrol path as the patrol path.

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,980
Game Object up the top there.

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,670
So first guy doesn't need one but he has one.

42
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,280
So let's click on that and set it to none.

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,480
Just make sure you don't want them patrolling then they don't have a patrol one that's cool too.

44
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,890
He's got 1 3 he's go on for he's got one and tough enemy does not have one.

45
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,460
Perfect.

46
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,910
Okay.

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,120
And offscreen I've been tidying up my red marks that I had on the ground.

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,360
I've nearly got them all just paint over those last couple of little bits.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,620
Not trying to make it look too amazing just to get the read out the way so it's not confusing.

50
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,400
Okay now I want to show you a little bit of a problem that I've got at the moment and see if we can

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,950
figure out a solution together to speed the video up as I run around the back to my patrol.

52
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,070
You can see as my enemies walking around his work he's chasing me now.

53
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,780
Well you can see when he chases me he chases me at a pretty old slow pace.

54
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,800
I can easily just run away thanks for a bit.

55
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,900
And when are you patrolling.

56
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,710
He's patrolling at exactly the same pace as well which I think is a little bit faster than normally

57
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,560
patrolling to be kind of meandering a little bit.

58
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:16,450
So the fact that both the speeds are the same patrolling and chasing is something that bugs me a little

59
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:16,570
bit.

60
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,040
So I wanna resolve that and give this to you as a slightly different challenge.

61
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,720
It's a problem with a solution challenge but I want you to think about the solution not necessarily

62
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,210
implement it although you're welcome to implement it if you're ready to do that.

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,370
Sam and I have talked about it.

64
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,380
We came out with different solutions so there are plenty of ways to skin a cat.

65
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm going to show you Sam solution after we've had to think about it because Sam is far wiser than I

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,780
am about these matters and I think his solution is pretty amazing.

67
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,150
So currently we've got a problem where we have one speed for patrolling and for chasing.

68
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,840
I want you to write out a plan or pseudo code for how you would solve this.

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,070
So where would you put particular lines how would you change your logic.

70
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,850
What classes or what scripts would you.

71
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,810
I've got here somewhere.

72
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:07,420
Which classes would you modify how you manage the two different speeds so how do you expose the tuning

73
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,170
variables.

74
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,280
What's the input to it.

75
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,060
So one of these ones where once you just have a look at your code have a look through your scripts and

76
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,900
think about it conceptually how would you go about having a patrol speed and a chase speed and having

77
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,710
them different.

78
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:25,510
So there's you challenge take that on have a think about it if you would like to share your answer in

79
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,680
the forum.

80
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,010
That would be awesome so we can see what you came up with.

81
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,760
And you can brag if you think you came up something cool and I will see you shortly.

82
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,470
OK.

83
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,100
I'll also play my play I got killed.

84
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,370
Okay.

85
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,090
Thanks for that God at least you're doing a job wonderful.

86
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,590
Now I'm gonna go ahead and open up visual studio and jump into our movie script.

87
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:52,500
So my natural inclination with this was to go into the A.I. controller and say OK here is where we have

88
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,240
the attack behavior behavior.

89
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,000
Here's where we have the patrol behavior.

90
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,590
Let's just make the speed during patrol behavior slower than the speed during attack behavior.

91
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,840
That's one way you could do it.

92
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,970
Sam had a great point which was well our movie is the thing that is controlling our nav mesh agent.

93
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,170
That is the place where we're making changes and it's our nav mesh agent that we're going to need to

94
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,770
change on our enemies too.

95
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,020
Let me just open up one of our enemies here to show you that the speed is where we're changing how fast

96
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,070
or how slow they go.

97
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:29,070
So that's the thing we wanted to be changing nav mesh agent dot speed and the best place to do that

98
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,560
is within the movie.

99
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,120
So let's start the process first of all I want to create a concept of a maximum speed.

100
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,440
So at any point I can say that maybe the players maximum speed is 10 whereas the enemies maximum speed

101
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,320
is 2.

102
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,730
So I want to have that control cells within my movie script.

103
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,560
I'm going to serialize field.

104
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,460
This will be a float and I will call it max speed so the maximum speed that you can go and I'll initialize

105
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,530
this at 6:00 just because that's what we've had our speed at to date.

106
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:05,970
And now likewise I want a place where I can change the speed of the enemies while they're doing their

107
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,380
patrols.

108
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,020
I'm going to go into the A.I. controller ad myself a new variable in here.

109
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,430
So again serialize fields so it's exposing the inspector float.

110
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,740
And this we will call patrol patrol speed for action.

111
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,500
OK.

112
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:28,750
And I'm going to initialize that at zero point two F so point two of whatever our maximum speed is.

113
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,900
So if our maximum speed is six then point two is going to be a speed of 20 percent of six.

114
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,040
Now why a fraction.

115
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,170
Well we're creating this notion of.

116
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,220
Here is your maximum speed.

117
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,020
And then when you're patrolling you're going at a smaller fraction or a smaller percentage of that speed.

118
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,480
And if we want to change the speed in other places for example if you want to have an enemy that gets

119
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,800
injured then you could have injured Speed fraction in the future.

120
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,650
Still equating back to a calculation on our overall maximum speed.

121
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,300
So back over into move it let's go and find where we need to change the speed stop move action and move

122
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,390
to the areas we're looking at here start move action is cold in a couple of places where we're starting

123
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,830
to move the the enemy the enemy II also to move the player.

124
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,720
So we need to take into consideration here that the player also needs to be not broken by our approach

125
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,370
when we're changing the enemy.

126
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:30,240
So when we call start move action what I want to do is require whatever is called it to pass in a type

127
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,030
float speed for action and that's what we're just creating over now.

128
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,440
II controller a moment ago this fraction of point two so when we're calling this we want to be passing

129
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,890
in what's the fraction and then we will be using that in our move to destinations so destination comma

130
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,130
Speed fraction and then of course moved to is complaining because right below which is where we have

131
00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:01,000
our move to method we need to give it the extra parameter of float and again we'll call it Speed fraction

132
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,680
so right after where we've said where the destination is we're going to add a new line and this is where

133
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,540
we'll be changing the speed.

134
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:17,470
So we'll be accessing our nav mesh agent dot speed and that will equal our max speed multiplied by a

135
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,010
fraction.

136
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:24,970
Now I'm going to put in a little bit of a protection here where we're going to use math f dot clamp

137
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:33,610
0 1 which is a really cool way of saying that whatever value is in our parentheses needs to be between

138
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,400
0 and 1 we're clamping it so we're forcing it to be between 0 and 1 and then what are we passing in

139
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,280
we're passing in Speed fraction and then semicolon.

140
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,450
And you know to protect ourselves even further I'm going to go back to the II controller and right above

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,810
where we have our patrol Speed fraction just to make sure that it's impossible for us crazy designers

142
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:04,550
to break I'm going to add in square braces range parentheses zero comma one and that means that whatever

143
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,720
patrol Speed fraction is can only be from zero to one.

144
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,590
Saving that bike every day.

145
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,810
Mover now that's going to have broken a couple of things because we now have an extra parameter that

146
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:21,710
we're asking to be passed in so going to highlight smart move action and right click find all references

147
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,120
and open these up.

148
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,950
The first one is in here.

149
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:31,040
Now this is broken because it's not passing in the Speed fraction that we're looking for and can see

150
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,420
within eye control a What is that fraction gonna be what we've just gotten created that variable right

151
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,790
up at the top patrol's Speed fraction.

152
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,880
So in here it's going to be start move.

153
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,170
Action.

154
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:52,260
Next position comma patrol speed friction and let's see if there's any other instances in here.

155
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,830
Stop move.

156
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,220
Action.

157
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,900
Okay.

158
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,550
So interact with movement get mouse button down.

159
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,620
This is in the player controller.

160
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,930
So see when I did the final references it's opened up our various scripts that we're looking at here

161
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,680
we're currently in the play a controller stop move action.

162
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,860
It is passing in hip point and then what do we want to have for the player.

163
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,080
Well at this point we always want the player to be going at full speed so we're gonna say one f in here.

164
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,000
It's okay to put one one is not a magic number in this instance it's just saying do the maximum the

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,510
maximum value that we have.

166
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,120
And then what else do we have the last one.

167
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,660
That was the one that we've already been changing.

168
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:27,990
Okay.

169
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,550
So then we are back into move to the other place that we changed was moved to.

170
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,670
So again highlight that right click final references.

171
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,060
This will change over on our left here in our fighter script.

172
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,790
We have let's see move to target transform position while we're in this fighter mode.

173
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,430
We want fighting to be at full speed don't we.

174
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,770
So again micro challenge for you what do we put in here.

175
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,250
Putting one if and then what do we have moved to they were the ones that we've changed already back

176
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,470
from our movie script and I think that's pretty good.

177
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:05,130
We've updated the areas that are calling start move action and move to save up all of our scripts make

178
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,510
sure it's all saved.

179
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:12,000
Looks all pretty safe to me jump back over into unity find one of our enemies and find this guy at the

180
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,180
back here he's enemy number four.

181
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:21,360
Let's see in our move are whereas move at the moment nav mesh agent close that up just one little note

182
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,610
just make sure you don't get confused there's a speed variable here that is not going to work if you

183
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:32,910
change that because we've gone and overwritten that with mover and with our A.I. controller let's race

184
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,900
around Assad to speed up the video a little bit as I'm running around to the side OK.

185
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,720
Watch from a distance OK he's dawdling along nice and slow fast to speed that up.

186
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,200
Pop pop pop pop he's gonna get even faster up to the point where he runs which is really cool we now

187
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:53,580
have our slider that allows us to change how fast our enemy is patrolling and then let me just check

188
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,040
when I run up I'll put it back to point two when I run up the trees kind of in the way isn't it.

189
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,820
Now he chases me and he's count for it he's chasing me down there's a little bit of foot sliding there

190
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,900
which looks a little bit wacky but I'm gonna leave it in because it's just the fact that our animation

191
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,790
when we're punching he he's locked his feet in the position but I want him to be able to do that to

192
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,370
be at a punch and kind of chase me down we kind of need a different animation where he's swinging and

193
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,790
running at the same time which I don't have at the moment so I'll leave it as he is but I'm pretty happy

194
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:26,190
with that I'm happy that we've updated our patrol behavior now look at me dying now it's not going to

195
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,050
be possible for us just to sprint the whole way through town past all these guards run straight to the

196
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,890
end and say Well that doesn't matter they can't keep up with me if I try to do that which is a kind

197
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,420
of fun thing to do they're right on my tail maybe I'll have them a little bit slower so I can get away

198
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,400
from them a little bit only to have them all keeping chase for quite some time till I get to the end

199
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,230
trying to fight the big boss and I've got these gaggle of guys trying to beat me up and which they successfully

200
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,780
do.

201
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,990
Okay so I'm happy with that now happy that this is a combat moment we've got some choice we've got our

202
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,610
enemies behaving in a clever way we've add a little bit more depth to our patrol I think now we're ready

203
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,570
to switch over to our cinematic moments so great work and I'll see you in the next video.
