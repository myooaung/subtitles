00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.800
Hello again in this video we're going to do two minor tweaks to our code so that we can declare our

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.510
basic movement complete.

3
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.460
Let me show you what our first challenge is.

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.560
If I click play as I move around I need to go click click click click.

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.240
Each time I want the play to move I have to click what I'd like instead is to have continuous behavior

6
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.470
where I can just hold down my left mouse button and have it go wherever I am waving my mouse.

7
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.730
So it's going to be our first challenge will take on I'm going to give that to as a challenge.

8
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.220
I'm going to keep it a little bit ambiguous so that you can do have a chance to do some problem solving

9
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.210
and I'll explain my thought process after this so you can see exactly how I go about doing it.

10
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.700
But here's the challenge to change of behavior so that the player can hold down the left mouse button

11
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.530
to continuously move.

12
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.400
Think about where in our code this might be controlled and to use the unity documents to help you make

13
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.950
a slight change.

14
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.160
You might know the answer already.

15
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.540
If not have a look in the unity documents and see if you can find what you could change to do that.

16
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.640
So it's a little bit vague I haven't given you too many clues beforehand but this is more of a on a

17
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.970
teach you how to think through the problem kind of challenge.

18
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.770
So he go jump in take that on.

19
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.790
I'll see you back here when you're done.

20
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.660
OK.

21
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.360
Hopefully you did give this a tried and just look at it and say Ah I don't even know where to start

22
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.440
with this but if you are struggling with this not a problem.

23
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.270
This is part of programming.

24
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.400
And let me show you the thought process I went through.

25
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.110
So I want to go instead of going click click click I want to hold down click.

26
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.520
So I know that's going to be in my movie script and something to do with my mouse.

27
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.530
And we're using input yet mouse button down so straight away on why I had got to be something to do

28
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.480
with this and the way that we can get clues on this is we know that we have our get button down method

29
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.900
here and we know that there's going to be more than just that we can use.

30
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.800
So we're looking within the input closer input dot something.

31
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.580
If I jump over to my Unity docs have a look here I can search for unity.

32
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.110
Sorry.

33
00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.850
To search for input.

34
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.810
Of course you want unity Rick what are you talking about.

35
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.370
So search for input and within input we can see what's going on here if you want to take the time read

36
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.940
it really deeply understand it.

37
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.260
But the quicker way is to go and find get mouse button down and sort of see what else is going on around

38
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.740
there.

39
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.160
So get mouse button down.

40
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.510
Returns true during the frame the user press the given button.

41
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.190
So it's returning true once just when we click down.

42
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.970
It's going to return.

43
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.060
Return true again.

44
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.510
When we click down another time let's have a look around here right above.

45
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.290
Get Mark mouse button down returns whether the mouse button is held down.

46
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.000
So we want this.

47
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.580
We want to be returning true if the mouse button is held down.

48
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.900
So this is a really easy tweak we just go into our code within update.

49
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.260
Don't hit the wrong button on your keyboard with an update input.

50
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.670
Get get mouse button down it's going to remove the down and save that.

51
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.970
We'll check that this works it's always good practice.

52
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.440
Here we go.

53
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.020
Let's check.

54
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.510
And it's working nicely.

55
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.890
OK.

56
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.050
And you even do a little spin around on the spot.

57
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.820
What would you do.

58
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.200
OK.

59
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.410
So that's the first thing I think that makes our game a lot tighter just a very easy little piece of

60
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.670
code tweaking.

61
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.250
The second thing you might not have had this yet but we will get some issues as we put more stuff into

62
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.890
our game where there's a jitter between the player and the camera where it looks like the player is

63
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.320
kind of skipping forward skipping backwards.

64
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.740
And that's something that we could wrestle with and scratch our head for a while and not know what's

65
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.610
going on.

66
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.280
But Sam and I've already scratched our head and wrestled with that.

67
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.230
So we'll save you that.

68
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.600
I was hoping we'd see it in the game so you could see the issue and we could go through the process

69
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.280
of figuring it out but it's a little bit difficult when you can't actually reproduce it.

70
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.370
So what what is going on on what could go on in that instance is we have our camera is being updated

71
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.560
each frame with an update the follow camera so it's moving along as it's trying to track where the player

72
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.870
is track track track track the player is moving along as well it's got its animations got what's going

73
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.760
on in the nav mesh sometimes there's a little bit of a mismatch where the camera tries to move first

74
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.310
and the player hasn't yet moved so the camera moves a little bit then we see the player move.

75
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.370
Other times the playing moves and we see the camera move that sort of mismatch when you see that going

76
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.940
on.

77
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.100
The thing I want you to think about is what's happening in terms of order of execution.

78
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.570
So if you're not familiar with order of execution you can jump over in a Google search for a unity order

79
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.920
of execution.

80
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.490
I've given you a link to this as well.

81
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.140
Click on that and you can see that there is a specific order that unity executes its functions executes

82
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.440
what's going on on each frame and if you scroll down you'll see here's the script lifecycle flow chart

83
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.910
and we can see right the very very saw the very first that's going to happen on initialization is awake

84
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.760
and within our game logic.

85
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.190
This is what we're interested in here.

86
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.710
We have update bunch of other things happen.

87
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.350
Internal animation update and then we have late update so we have an option in there if you find that

88
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.450
something really needs to happen after something else one of the ways you can do it you say well let's

89
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.240
put this in late update.

90
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.100
So which do you think we need to put in light.

91
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.290
Update our animation or our camera okay.

92
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.410
If you if you say camera you right.

93
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.250
So we want our animation to do its thing on a frame and then we want our camera to follow that afterwards

94
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.230
so we don't get that jumping where the camera's trying to guess where the frame where the character

95
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.740
is going to be.

96
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.900
So going to your follow camera script and where we have void Update we simply change that to void light

97
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.500
update.

98
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.270
Okay.

99
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.420
Once again just jump back over there and test that we haven't created any issues.

100
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.160
It should probably look very similar to what we had just now because we weren't seeing the bug or that

101
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.580
much.

102
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.210
Okay cool.

103
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.870
Yep looking nice and smooth.

104
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.960
Camera in light update now what we're going to do at this point is declare our basic movement done I'm

105
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.340
pretty happy with this there's a little bit of foot slipping I can tweak and tune I think his movement

106
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.830
a little bit more not super happy with the turning circle but until we get more things going on in our

107
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.820
game we do want to finish this right down to the core we didn't have an enemy to dodge around and we

108
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.980
need to have a combat happening and what happens when I swing the sword does that still have my movement

109
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.640
look how it's supposed to look will do I need to move my camera in on my camera out.

110
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.190
So at this stage I think we have enough to say yep basic movement is done so let's move on to the next

111
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.580
section.

112
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.560
So a couple of other things to tidy up this section of the course that I'm going to show you but for

113
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.950
now we need to clear basic movement done great work well done.

114
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.600
And I'll see you in the next video.
