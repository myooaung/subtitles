Hey and welcome to this.

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,420
Saving asset pack S..

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,340
So in this section we're gonna be looking at importing a saving asset pack that I have created for you

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,470
that you can use not only in this game but in any games that you create in order to add in a savings

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,660
system that is entirely flexible and we'll be able to save any of the data in any of the components

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,560
that you create.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,570
I'll be taking you over how to use it how to implement it in the RPG which will give you the transferable

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,150
skill of being able to use it elsewhere.

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:42,230
Now the actual creation of this asset pack is going to be quite in-depth and quite advanced.

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,270
I have included it in the next section of this course which is an optional section you do not have to

11
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:53,330
take that and if you don't consider yourself an intermediate to advanced but just on the lower end of

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,600
intermediate then I don't recommend you take that section at least not yet.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,480
Maybe it's something you want to loop back around to once you have finished this course.

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,660
So the only day of the saving system is that when we hit play it reloads the last level that we were

15
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:08,980
in.

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,830
And also all the state that is relevant.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,570
So my location and the level my health and also the health and status whether they're dead or not of

18
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,080
the guard.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,750
So you can see this.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,830
God I had killed in a previous round.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,630
But go ahead and kill this guard as well or even lure him away is all the locations of the guards are

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,020
also being saved.

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:35,220
And then I go through to the world again so you can see the fading transitions are still in place.

24
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,130
What happened as I went between worlds is that it saved and reloaded the state from that other world.

25
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,130
And if I come back here you can see that God is a stayed dead.

26
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,850
So we're keeping that state between at different levels.

27
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,840
But also if I go ahead and hit play again it's going to reload me from a last check point which is when

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,960
I came through the portal and that God is still dead.

29
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,360
And also that same thing is true for my position my health and so on so forth and all this is going

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,300
to be saved to your file system for you to reload at a later time it's a very flexible system and allows

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,490
us to save not just the health and position but anything that you might be storing in any components

32
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:16,890
the state of a quest for example is all going to be possible and extensible using this system so that's

33
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,440
what the saving system looks like.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,810
Let's dive in and see how to use it.
