00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,800
Hello and welcome in this lecture we're gonna be throttling the attack.

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,580
By this I mean we're going to be able to slow it down so he's not constantly punching all the time there's

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:19,000
a bit of idle breath time between and we've got this low configurable parameter the time between attacks

4
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:26,320
where if I increase this you can see he waits a lot longer on his locomotion state waiting around until

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,790
he attacks the second time around that's what we're gonna be implementing let's dive in and see how

6
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,730
it's done.

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,870
As we observed at the end of last lecture if you go up to this capsule our guy just punches as quickly

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,980
as he wants.

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,990
Now obviously this is something that we would like to control because for example you might have a lower

10
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:49,090
level character that has to has weaker and needs to take his breath between punches.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,190
Things like that and also for different sized weapons big hammers can't really be swung as quickly as

12
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,210
you would like you need to take a bit of a breather between swings that kind of thing.

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:05,350
We want to fix so if we go over to our fighter c s script what we're going to do for now is add a serialized

14
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,790
field.

15
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:12,090
Eventually this will be a property of the weapon equipped but we are not going to do that just yet.

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:20,530
And that field should tell us basically the time between attacks the time between attacks like so because

17
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,240
Currently what we've got is it's going back to back because we are constantly setting the trigger every

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,540
time we want to attack.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,680
Now how the trigger works we didn't quite talk about this fully and maybe you know already but a trigger

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,640
is quite clever.

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:40,250
It's like a boolean value but when you set it it waits until it has been acted upon that means that

22
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,950
the transition has actually happened.

23
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,170
They see notes we've got this condition transition.

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,600
Now if this had been a boolean it would keep making that transition as off basically all the time.

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,850
It is possible but the trigger is very smart.

26
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:00,400
It basically makes that transition once and sets the trigger back to FALSE sets the boolean back to

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,430
FALSE which means that the next time we go back into locomotion unless we've hit trigger again it won't

28
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,160
go in attack.

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,900
So that's a good thing and that's what we want to do we basically want to do the trigger wait a certain

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,120
amount of time and then do the trigger again.

31
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,000
So that's how this time between attacks is going to work time between tax is going to be a float value

32
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:29,140
and we can default it to I don't know once every second is actually quite a long time for time between

33
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:35,470
attacks if you if you actually work it out it turns out well what if you actually use it and play with

34
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,180
it one second or two seconds is actually quite a long time to wait between attacks.

35
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,650
So how are we going to figure out how long has passed since the last attack and whether we are ready

36
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,550
to attack again to do this.

37
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:53,860
You might want to introduce a variable so I'm going to introduce a float time since last attack.

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,180
And I'm going to leave up to you to do some of this implementation.

39
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,590
But what we want to do here is update this time since last attack every single update no matter what

40
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:11,620
even if our target is no we want to be updating this time since last attack because imagine that you've

41
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,750
stopped targeting the particular enemy and you want to run away to catch your breath.

42
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,100
You want the time since last attack to keep incrementing.

43
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:27,790
So every single update we are going to increment plus equals the time since last attack.

44
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:35,530
And that's going to be time dot delta time which gives us the time that the last frame took to render

45
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,710
basically the time since the last time update was called.

46
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:45,160
So you can see how adding this repeatedly is going to give us the total since we last reset the time

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,870
since last attack.

48
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:54,340
Now what I'm going to leave to you is the actual making sure we only trigger once the time enough time

49
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,840
has elapsed and resetting this time since last attack.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,560
So that's going to be a challenge to implement the throttle I'm calling a throttle because it kind of

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,840
slows down the throttles the ability to attack.

52
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,270
Now how to only trigger after time has elapsed that's your first question to answer and implement.

53
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:19,150
And the second is how will you reset after you have actually triggered so suppose a video and have a

54
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,260
go okay.

55
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,220
Welcome back.

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,250
So the first thing how to throttle so in our attack behavior we are setting the trigger.

57
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,980
So this is the logical place to put the throttle.

58
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:37,760
The first thing we want to do is basically say if the time since last attack is actually greater than

59
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:44,810
the what is it we're looking for time between attacks then what we can do is we can actually trigger

60
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,350
this attack.

61
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:51,050
So what I'm going to do it this way for now you could do an early return and flip around the boolean

62
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:57,110
here say whether it's less than but I'm gonna make it I think slightly easier to read here by saying

63
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:05,660
if it's time for us to attack we're going to attack and we're going to reset the time since last attack

64
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,180
to zero because we've literally just done want.

65
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,720
So the time since that last attack is in fact zero.

66
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,600
So that should be sufficient for throttling our attacks.

67
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,100
Let's have a go and see if this now works.

68
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,830
If I go and hit play I'd expect to have a second before starting every punch.

69
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,760
So let's go over to our capsule I guess it seems to be a bit slower.

70
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:35,700
Let's just make sure by changing our time between attacks three seconds between attacks.

71
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,480
There you go.

72
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,790
That's much longer and you can see it stays on locomotion for a while before hit.

73
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,170
Before getting a new attack trigger and going into the attack state and obviously you can tweak this

74
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,460
to your heart's desire.

75
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,670
The minimum of course is if you make the time between attacks very small then you're going to notice

76
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,960
that he the minimum he can do is as fast as the animation will allow.

77
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,550
But that's kind of okay for now.

78
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,870
We can just slow it down a little bit if we want to.

79
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,640
Using the time between attacks.

80
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,990
So that's how we got throttling implemented.

81
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,550
Hope you enjoyed that video.

82
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,540
And the next one's is gonna be very exciting because we're actually gonna be implementing damage so

83
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,110
I'll see you there.
