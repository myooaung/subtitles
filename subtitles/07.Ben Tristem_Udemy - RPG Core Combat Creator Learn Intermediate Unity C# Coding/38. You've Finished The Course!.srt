Hello my friend a huge congratulations you have finished the course vote for all of your hard work.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,530
If you have a look at your game now I think it's looking pretty good.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,760
We've got our core combat feeling really tight we've got the player running around we can shoot we can

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,140
bonk people on their head we've got different weapons that we can switch in and out.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,930
Those weapons have different stats.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,170
We've got progression for the player so as you level up your players stats can change.

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,740
We have enemies with some clever A.I. in there.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,600
They've got their patrol paths.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,260
If you hit the enemy they aggro towards you their friends see that aggro.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,210
Lots and lots and lots of stuff that we've covered in this course.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,660
You might be wondering what's next.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,540
Well Sam and I are hard at work on prototyping the next part of this RPG series which will be a course

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:55,710
focused at the other things to do with the RPG things such as questing inventory and dialogue and so

14
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,990
on and we'll keep you updated on the progress.

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,350
It's gonna take us a number of months to get that to the point where we're happy with it.

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,250
We don't wanna just rush it out similar to this cause you've just finished.

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,320
We want to do it properly and to give you the best learning experience.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,650
So thank you very much for joining us on this cause.

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,760
I would love to see what you've come up with with your RPG.

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,430
So please do share a video screenshot and description of what you've created.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,820
I'd love to see it and if you continue to push it further and make it into a bigger game then please

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,510
definitely do show us and share that with us.

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,520
So again thank you for joining us and we'll see you again real soon.
