00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.280
Now again in this video we're gonna be setting up our first virtual camera using synth machine using

2
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.010
it to follow the player as he runs around in the world.

3
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.900
So let's jump in to get started.

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.040
If you haven't done so already you'll need to add the snow machine package.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.270
We're gonna do that by heading out to window finding the package manager in the package many gems going

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.150
to search straight up for synonym machine.

7
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.550
There it is click install that might take a moment while it's installing on a talk a little bit about

8
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.530
what we're up to.

9
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.480
So since a machine and timeline synth machine is a powerful package that lets us manage multiple cameras

10
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.910
in our scene.

11
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.880
We're also going to be using timeline in the next couple of videos.

12
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.710
Timeline is an animation system that lets us time certain things or certain events while certain objects

13
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.930
to happen at certain times.

14
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.130
For example changing from one camera to another camera which is what will link into sinner machine.

15
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.790
So how does senior machine manage our cameras.

16
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.080
Well we have the main camera.

17
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.420
This is what we see our game through.

18
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.390
And then we apply to that or we add to that sorry a sinner machine brain module and this brain is going

19
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.240
to manage our virtual cameras we can have as many virtual cameras as we want.

20
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.840
Pointing in different directions having different rules some cameras might point towards an enemy some

21
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.200
cameras might fly through the air some cameras might have animation some cameras might be the follow

22
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.700
camera that we have following the player.

23
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.950
And the sooner machine brain is going to use the logic that we've told it to manage.

24
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.980
Which of these virtual cameras at any one point in time is being shown through the main camera.

25
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.800
And we will start by setting up our follow camera because that's a nice easy place for us to start understanding

26
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.760
these concepts.

27
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.810
So make sure this is all said and done looks like it is being installed.

28
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.410
Yep.

29
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.070
What we do need to do first of all is find our camera our follow camera and deleting it.

30
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.370
If we try to play the game now there will be no camera no problem.

31
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.660
So within core I'm going to right click Create a camera the bottom option their account is going to

32
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.170
fine with that game object is looks like it's at our c0 0 0 it's going to move it over generally near

33
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.960
my plan.

34
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.900
Just because I like to have these things basically in the same part of the world now that we have our

35
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.820
main camera back again just make sure those tagged as main camera.

36
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.440
So we've got some parts in our code that are requiring a main camera so we need to have that tagged

37
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.550
as main camera.

38
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.390
Now I'm going to go to my menu of the top Senate machine and create a virtual camera.

39
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.810
There's a whole bunch of different cameras and you know I've given you a link to the unity documents

40
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.130
force in a machine.

41
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.170
They are really good if it's in a machine so you can read up on that at any time.

42
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.130
But for now we're creating a virtual camera.

43
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.610
I'm going to rename that virtual camera follow camera because it is a camera that follows the player

44
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.930
and drag it just such at the same level in the hierarchy as my main camera but just underneath it so

45
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.720
I can keep it within my core game object here.

46
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.760
So the follow camera if we double click on that whereas that at the moment it's also way down in the

47
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.650
middle of the world.

48
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.390
Going gonna pull that over somewhere near my player again.

49
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.700
You can see it's orange in its outline here.

50
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.730
Whereas if I click on the main camera it is white.

51
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.590
Let's click back on the virtual camera and in here we have an option of what to follow and what to look

52
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.970
at.

53
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.040
We are going to ask you to follow the player so click on our selector find player.

54
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.080
There we go.

55
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.890
We can also do a look at a look at.

56
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.920
We'll stay in one point and just pivot around so sort of pivot around as something moves whereas the

57
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.540
flow is going to run along and flow with it which is exactly what we want.

58
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:44.290
We're gonna change the body to from transponder to framing transpose us or not transponder framing transpose.

59
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.990
What that does it is now going to try to frame our player or our point of interest the thing we're following.

60
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.400
If you click on your game tab you can see I'm just gonna move these side by side so we can see them

61
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.300
at the same time.

62
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.380
You can see the camera is now pointing at the player very excellent.

63
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.760
Unfortunately it's pointing at the player in a weird way it's way down in the ground.

64
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.950
Now one of the quirks of this if I go to grab it and move it around you can see that it's not actually

65
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.880
doing anything.

66
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.600
What I need to do is come into my body and change from framing trained Bowser to do nothing.

67
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.160
Now that's going to allow me to move around my camera and get it where I want it to be.

68
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.200
If you remember our camera before was facing up into the town so I'm going to orient it that way just

69
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.350
moving it around hitting a point it roughly towards the player move it up in the air a little bit move

70
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.800
it back a little bit and rotate it down towards the player so it's going to frame the player right in

71
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.400
the middle.

72
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.390
So when I switch it back to framing transpose.

73
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.480
Which means it's going to try to frame the player in the frame.

74
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.490
You can see that the player is in the frame.

75
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.400
I'm gonna give myself a little bit of width just play around with this and see how it looks at this

76
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.570
early stage okay.

77
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.070
It can run and it's following we can talk about all the controls in just a moment but let's go.

78
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.940
We now have a camera following the player.

79
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.800
Now I think the camera's a little bit too close to the player.

80
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.390
There is a value of camera distance if I increase that that is how we pull the camera away from the

81
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.110
player which is way better than getting into the scene and monkeying around with the camera itself.

82
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.180
So let's talk about some of the other things that we can doing here now that we've got a fellow camera

83
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.560
you can see that there's this red outline and there's a kind of bluey outline in there.

84
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:29.130
This is referring to a couple of things one is the dead zone and one is the soft zone so you can see

85
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.920
dead zone width as an option.

86
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.570
If you increase that it'll increase these first two lines and then height it'll increase these next

87
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.450
two lines till we get to the point we have this gap in the middle.

88
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.560
Now you can see if you run around within this gap the the yellow dot being the position the camera's

89
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.470
pointing at.

90
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.540
It's not really moving very much it's not going to move until we get to the edge of that dead zone.

91
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.320
Then the camera will move to keep up with our target.

92
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.770
So if you have a huge dead zone then the play is going to be out to move a whole bunch in the world

93
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.310
without without the camera moving a lot.

94
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.880
If you have a very small dead zone Sara is moving this stuff so it's very small dead zone.

95
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.640
Then the camera's going to try to follow the player pretty closely.

96
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.020
You can see the crosshairs aren't exactly on the yellow dog.

97
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:19.370
That's because we have a little bit of damping so the more damping you have the more the player's gonna

98
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.830
be able to get all the way over to the edge before the camera slowly tries to catch up with it.

99
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.230
So again if you want to have it the player can get marching off the screen and your camera is fairly

100
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.890
loosely following the player.

101
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.530
Then the X and the Y damping can do that for you.

102
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.790
Like time on a little bit closer here we can also increase the look ahead time which will try to move

103
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.160
the camera quickly in the direction we're going.

104
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.510
So if I click up to the top right the camera move fairly aggressively to the top right.

105
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.880
What we do to try to let me see more of the game as I'm heading in that direction so we'll play around

106
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.210
with these moves that a bit more.

107
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.160
The smoothing as well.

108
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.810
You can see it takes longer if you're higher have a higher smoothing but smoothing all the way down.

109
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.290
So the cameras looking ahead much further which is kind of handy for us.

110
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.660
It's good if you're running in a particular direction and you want to see more of that direction.

111
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.110
OK.

112
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.760
And then these soft zone is basically saying we're not allowed to go there at all so you can see if

113
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.890
I pull this soft swaps sometimes when you click on something else it change it click on the camera follow

114
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.020
a camera to get that back flip camera and just be careful when you're clicking around because you can

115
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.070
grab these lines and move these lines around while you're in this view or you think you're trying to

116
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.910
move the player.

117
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.580
You can also accidentally be moving your lines and changing skewing your camera.

118
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.680
I honestly don't know what I've done just here but I've made some weird changes.

119
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:45.300
Now we click out of play mode and have a look at things it has kept these settings and that is because

120
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.550
we have a save during play which is very excellent you can choose your camera and it stays with the

121
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.560
same settings that you've just tuned it at my weeds things that I've got to hear now because I accidentally

122
00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.480
grabbed something I think is because my put my look ahead time down again it's because I've changed

123
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.620
my screen wired screens it if you want to have the whole thing skew a little bit down Askew a little

124
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:06.860
bit.

125
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.430
So this is way more powerful than the camera that we've had.

126
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.750
There was a question we had in our forum why don't we just use the super machine follow a camera.

127
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.950
Well we wanted to get up and running and not to have too much time fiddling with the camera.

128
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.680
But I think when our ready to do some fiddling with the camera which is super cool.

129
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.930
Speaking of fiddling with the camera.

130
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.230
This is the challenge I've got for you is to tune you follow a camera so that you're happy with it at

131
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:32.390
a sooner machine brain of course add the virtual camera and to tune the feel of your follow camera until

132
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.430
you're happy with it when you are happy with it then jump over into the next lecture and a quick follow

133
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.390
up just in case you wondering these are the settings that I have for my camera at the moment.

134
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.470
OK see you again soon.
