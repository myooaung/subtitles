00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,180
Hello again another visual Polish video.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,120
This is where my level is right now.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,480
And this is what my level is going to look like by the end of this video.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,220
Now I'm going to be importing some assets all be using as we've done in the past.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,780
I'll be using assets from Sony Studios for example this lovely Knights pack.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,230
I encourage you to check them out.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,880
It's are amazing so many packs now as dozens of them.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,560
Just one thing I want to point out is that I'm bringing these assets into my level so that it can look

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,730
good at the end of the course he has it all looks nice and shiny.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,600
But these are assets that you do not have access to use yourself.

11
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,560
You need to buy them if you want to use them.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,980
So I'm not going to be providing these for you these Sinti assets these ones that I'm buying myself

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,840
and using because I have the license for.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,840
So you might want to go and grab yourself some more assets you might want to make your own assets whatever

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,380
it is how you're going to approach it.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,840
This is a good time to fill up your world with a lot of excitement as I did before.

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,410
I'm going to be starting playing around importing things moving things around.

18
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,780
And if there's anything that I think would be useful for you from a learning point of view I'll stop

19
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,680
my process and record and just take you through what I'm doing at that point in time.

20
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,690
For now it's going to focus on buildings and props and probably some trees as well.

21
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,690
Not sure about that yet but I'm gonna jump in and get started and I recommend and I have a challenge

22
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,410
for you that you do the same as well with your level.

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,700
Okay.

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,070
See you again shortly.

25
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,610
Hello again.

26
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,930
As you can see I've been making progress putting down some windmills and water mills and this is an

27
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,700
in just trying to stylized things a little bit a little bit of a stone path trying to create a little

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:46,570
bit of story for the player so he's a stone path leads up to this abandoned I guess ancient castle up

29
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:52,660
the back here and just generally trying to give it more flavor and more substance to my level.

30
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,150
One thing I wanted to show you in terms of a problem I've got here I wanted to make a little bit of

31
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,480
farm kind of action is the player was running into the level and I'll show you what the problem is at

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,140
the moment here.

33
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,670
Ignore the fact that there's some smoke coming out of my chimney we'll talk about that later on.

34
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,130
Oh the player might want to come up here and find something.

35
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,950
Maybe this is later on where we can put a quest giver that says hey there's some soldiers in town but

36
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,800
the problem I've got can you see it as this great big gaping hole that we've got on the side of our

37
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,110
train now I've deliberately tried to keep my terrain as small as possible because there's no point having

38
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,720
massive terrain if our level doesn't require it.

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,700
But what can we do in this instance.

40
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,570
Well several unity in more recent versions have has given us a tool if we click on terrain then go to

41
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,120
the the pike terrain brush.

42
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,620
The very first one create neighbor terrains is how we can solve this.

43
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,180
Once we've clicked on that it says our click the edge to create neighbor terrain which is pretty easy

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,970
just find the edge that I want over here click and that will give me a whole new terrain over on the

45
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,590
side.

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,010
Now I just ignore all this stuff down here this is me just grabbing assets and chucking them around

47
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,830
my scene because I tend to be like oh I want to grab that thing and put it in.

48
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:12,010
So this is kind of my palette to the side is how I work but the terrain here I don't need it to be that

49
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,430
massive.

50
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,380
All I want to do is just make sure that the player can't see underneath here.

51
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,580
So what I'll do from this point is click on the cog make sure I'm clicked on the correct terrain.

52
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,820
It's renamed it terrain underscore.

53
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,690
Whole bunch of stuff.

54
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:31,250
I'm going to call this terrain underscore south so I know this is the one just down the south.

55
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,660
Now if I scroll down in my settings I'm going to find the width.

56
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,280
I think the width is one I want change that to 200.

57
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,010
Yep that's it.

58
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,340
And it's just made it a lot less a lot less wide.

59
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,280
I guess just move to it on after there.

60
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,920
Now what do we do still got this gap.

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,320
The cool thing is when I click on this terrain if I go all the way back up to the top get on the paint

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,990
tools I'm going to find the set height.

63
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,530
I'm going to grab the height from the terrain.

64
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,710
That's just next to it.

65
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,820
And then when I come and paint here it will paint my new terrain up to that height so I can make it

66
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,710
all nice and smooth.

67
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,030
It's gonna make my brush size gigantic.

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,520
Increase the opacity and then just be like well that's not what I'm sorry.

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,360
And then just increase this here just so I can close off the gap.

70
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:22,300
So plenty of ways to paint that but this is the process where we can make sure that we don't have that

71
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,970
little seam down the middle.

72
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,630
That is just painting the same height cool and it's pretty seem less pardon the pun.

73
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,630
So that's how you can make sure that you don't have those weird gaps or if you say yeah I made my terrain

74
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,490
too small.

75
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,190
That's really easy nowadays to make your terrain much bigger.

76
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,360
So just double check make sure we read back out nav mesh.

77
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,530
But yeah that's cool.

78
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,770
Now we can't see under the world.

79
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,060
And you know what I think I'm pretty happy with the placement of my buildings.

80
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,430
Next up I'm going to concentrate on trees and I'm going to show you a way that I get more variety out

81
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,890
of my assets using trees as an example.

82
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:03,360
So I've brought in an asset pack into a new project and I've paid it down so I've gone through so I

83
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,060
like which ones don't I like just dragging all of the assets into the scene playing around with them

84
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,630
moving them around and seeing which ones I want.

85
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,600
So here's a subset of assets that I actually do want and I want to add a little bit variation the more

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,240
variation we get we can turn like 10 assets to make them feel like they're 100 assets.

87
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,630
I've taken this tree and I've just slightly changed the texture so it's a different color.

88
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,230
Okay.

89
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,020
Let me show you the process that I do for that so grab one of your one of your assets if it's a prefab

90
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,080
then I'm going to duplicate that.

91
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,550
You can see down here we've got the duplicated going to right click and unpack prefab just so it's not

92
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,550
linked to the the original prefab that we had before.

93
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,750
I can read prefab this back in a moment.

94
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,260
But for now I'm just keeping it as a game object that's not prefab.

95
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,470
There's no connection there.

96
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,280
And then in here you can see it's using this particular material to give the colors and you can go into

97
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,620
the material itself and you can you can edit that in Photoshop but an easy way to do it a quick easy

98
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,070
win.

99
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,610
It's not amazing in terms of quality but a quick easy win to get there and say Okay let me fine.

100
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:14,460
This is the material 0 1 I'm going to duplicate that that's gonna make a material for I'm going to apply

101
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,010
the 0 4 to this game object is going to look exactly the same.

102
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,230
I haven't changed it yet.

103
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,070
And now on this 0 4 material I'm going to find the color.

104
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,720
So just up on albedo color here and let me just change it around.

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,690
And this allows me to quickly make a variation.

106
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,190
So just a caveat to this it'll look a little bit weird on some objects it doesn't work for everything

107
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,270
because it's putting a tint over the entire game object.

108
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,170
So if you wanted to keep say the White on these these tree trunks exactly the same and just tint the

109
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,100
leaf area then it's not going to look so good it's not gonna be as easy to do that.

110
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,530
But if you say you know let's just make this all more of a brownie colored object.

111
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,440
Now I have and you sitting right on top of the other one that's what's confused me here I'm like Where

112
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,700
did the original one go to.

113
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,450
But there it is.

114
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,620
So now I've got these two.

115
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,730
They look a little bit different and if I get there and say scale it a little bit rotated a little bit

116
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:15,420
put it on a little bit of a lean and maybe stretch it round just doing it a direct overall scaling.

117
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,070
So now they're similar trees they look like they belong in the same family but they're different enough

118
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,910
that if the players is kind of running through a level run run run run You can see that there's some

119
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,770
variation in there.

120
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,870
So as you can see in just a few minutes I've made a whole bunch of different trees is grab a tree duplicate

121
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,760
moved to the side grab one of my textures I haven't used already on that particular type of tree dragged

122
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,670
on there we go boom but it is so quick to collect duplicate Blunk kind of and say it duplicate over

123
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,770
there drag on top.

124
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,310
There we go.

125
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,640
Got a new thing and now I'm up to a whole bunch of variety and you can see that looks much better from

126
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,280
a distance than just having them all exactly the same color.

127
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,070
Okay.

128
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,280
When you're ready to export what you need to do is to group all of your objects underneath one game

129
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,380
object grab that game object drag it down into projects that will create a new prefab and from that

130
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,960
prefab right click and go to export package that'll have all of the things you're interested in you

131
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,360
can export that save it somewhere and then re imported into your main project you've been working on

132
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,550
and you'll have all these assets ready to go to drop into you say nicely organized nicely color coded

133
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,450
already you don't have to try to fiddle around and do that within your main scene you can just do that

134
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,550
here in a nice clean easy way without having a full project folder to wrestle with.

135
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,990
So there we go there's a little bit of just creating variation for your game so that you've got a whole

136
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:37,170
bunch of assets with only having a few starter assets I can back in my main build I'm adding my trees

137
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,800
to my terrain tool here just wanted to show you my process just quickly so you can see what I do.

138
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,990
Edit trees add tree and then I've got my assets down here in my my prefabs then my project folder rather

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,490
than clicking and searching and cycling through I find it easier to grab it drag it over into the game

140
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:59,670
object click on add great edit free add tree grab the next one which is 14 dragon and boom there we

141
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,880
go.

142
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,350
I've just found that's a quick way to do it as opposed to doing it the other way I thought I'd show

143
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,830
you that.

144
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,590
Okay I'll put them all in I'll be back here again in a moment.

145
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,230
Now once you've got all your trees set up you can do this one of two ways you can do the adding or removing

146
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,590
method.

147
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,570
Let me show you the removing method if I click on mass place trees that will place it everywhere on

148
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:25,860
my terrain probably 10000 to many let's dial this down and say I 300 just to see how it goes click on

149
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,360
place.

150
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,410
Here we go.

151
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,530
That is one busy interesting full kind of town.

152
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,340
I like it.

153
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:39,470
The great thing about this is it immediately puts all of your your portfolio of trees into the scene.

154
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,820
Now all we need to do with the brush selected so click on one of the trees.

155
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,410
If you hold down shift you can go and remove these trees where whether in the spots where you don't

156
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,410
want them to be.

157
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,300
I really like this method it can speed things up for you particularly if you've got a lot of little

158
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,210
levels going there just whatever.

159
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,960
And then you can go on hand place what that's a bit too many make sure the tree density is where you

160
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,930
want it to be.

161
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,780
Three that you want and put a couple of trees in there.

162
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,300
Cool.

163
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,330
So you can you can do this really quickly I think it speeds things up a lot the other way.

164
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:15,070
Obviously if I undo all of this if it gives me enough undo this is literally to get them and place them.

165
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,940
I want a couple of trees there maybe reduce the density reduce the brush size and like that particular

166
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,020
tree right there.

167
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,070
That's a good spot for it.

168
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:23,610
Okay.

169
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,260
So once again I'll pose the video and I'll be back here briefly when I've finished adding trees into

170
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:34,520
my scene right here as you can see I've placed the trees in my world here I have gone through a major

171
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,880
that the trees aren't blocking the camera anyway that's super important to do and a quick note if you

172
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,440
find that you trees are blackening out off in the background there as you move around then that's because

173
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,600
of the fade length.

174
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,500
If you click on the train then click on the settings button scroll down until you find a fade length

175
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,580
if you move that around you can get it to the position that you like.

176
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:57,440
I found that a value of about 70 works for mine in terms of the size of my terrain where my camera's

177
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,500
going to be in the game.

178
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,940
In particular when I have my cinematics I want to make sure that my trees aren't being cut off in the

179
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,710
background.

180
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,940
My cinematics because often the camera is down here at ground level so that we go I've got my old macro

181
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,180
things in my scene now my buildings my trees placement of things the path going through town I'm putting

182
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,520
my new costly kind of thing I'm really happy with the layout the vibe the feel of it in the next lecture

183
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,080
I'll get a little bit more micro looking right down at the ground level got to get some grass in there

184
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,630
maybe play around with some little positioning of things just to get the fine tuning done on it now

185
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:36,000
that I've got the broad tuning done so great work hopefully your level is coming all along well as always

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,220
please do share a screenshot of it with us so we can see what you're up to I'd love to see it and I'll

187
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,030
see you in the next lecture.
