00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,750
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:12,890
In this lecture we are going to be designing a mob behavior so that if I have a ranged weapon and I

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:18,860
go and attack one of these guys he's going to bring his mate with him so he'll get aggravated but he

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,570
will also bring his mate it won't be in it won't just be him on his own.

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,850
Similarly if any of these enemies get alerted such as that Archer can see me from over there he's going

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,170
to bring these sword guys with him to making them a much more formidable threat.

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:41,080
Let's dive in and see how we can achieve this kind of mob behaviour so that's kind of behaviour that

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:49,430
I want but how can I alert the guards in my vicinity that I want them to attack as well.

9
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:55,690
Basically what we'd like to do is say hey all the guards within five metres of me I need to give you

10
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,280
aggro.

11
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,650
They need to get aggravated and try and attack the player as well.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,730
Now that's in order to do that we need to use something called a sphere cast.

13
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,780
So you've come across Ray casts before but sphere casts are a little different.

14
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:18,880
So a ray cast is quite simply just a laser beam type line that hits the first collider that it goes

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,480
through.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,650
And that's quite straightforward and simple.

17
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:27,640
A sphere cast is probably just as it sounds just a little bit different where instead of taking a a

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:35,310
line a single no volume line we're taking a sphere with a potential radius and we're tracing it through

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,000
still a kind of path from the start point to the end point and seeing whether we hit anything on the

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,270
way.

21
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:46,000
So if I was trying to trace from here over to this guy over here I would hit this little guy in the

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,850
way in between which I couldn't do with my laser beam because it passed right over his head.

23
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:58,030
Now there's a few situations WFAA casts can be very useful for example if you wanted to create a grabbing

24
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,230
type component a sphere.

25
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,220
Can be useful in giving you a margin of error.

26
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,110
So instead of having to be pointing directly.

27
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,980
So if I had a grabbing component and I was zoomed in on let's say I'd try and grab maybe this barrel

28
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,110
over here I'd have to be pointing the center of my screen right to point directly through the barrel

29
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,220
in order to grab it.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,460
And if I was slightly off over here then because my laser beam misses the barrel it would not actually

31
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:30,130
try and grab it but if I did a sphere cast then you'd have a much larger area and a basically a margin

32
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,780
of error.

33
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:36,070
Anyway that's a little aside because we don't actually need it for that we want to do a sphere cast

34
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:42,250
in the same way as we're doing Ray casts for movement and so on and so forth to get a bunch of objects

35
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,870
in and when we did it for Ray cast we're doing it down the line of our cursor.

36
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:54,400
But we might want to do it in a radius around our enemy to find all the enemies within radius.

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,180
So that's what we can do.

38
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,450
So let's go over to our attack behaviour and call a method that we have not yet created.

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,630
So we're going to call this aggravate nearby enemies and I'm going to go ahead and create that generate

40
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,710
the methods and basic.

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,230
This is where we want to do as fair CAS now fear casts work exactly the same as the physics recasts.

42
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,540
So you've got the option to do a physics dot right cast and recast all and all those options that we've

43
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,660
used before or you could do a sphere cast or a sphere cast all in our case.

44
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,430
I want to do a sphere cast all because I want to find all the enemies within a certain radius.

45
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,780
Then let's have a look at what arguments we've got we've got the origin where we want this fear to be

46
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,670
centred on the enemy.

47
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,010
So that's going to transform dot position then we've got the radius.

48
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:53,900
Well we don't yet know but I'm gonna call this the shout distance and that is going to be a property

49
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,590
that we can do as a serialized field.

50
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:04,520
So it's going to be a serialized field of type float called shout distance.

51
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,350
We're going to start off at five meters being the default short distance some enemies might be able

52
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:16,820
to shout louder OK so we've got an aggregate nearby enemies that transform centred on ourselves a radius

53
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,020
of the shout distance.

54
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,490
Now it's asking for the direction now because we're not actually casting this sphere.

55
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,650
It doesn't really make sense to give it a direction what we want to do is just create a sphere that

56
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:34,610
centers around our play we don't want to then move that sphere in a direction so any direction would

57
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:34,910
do.

58
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:42,180
I'm just going to use vector three dot up then the max distance again this can just be zero because

59
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,860
we don't actually want to move this sphere anyway I would just want to do a cast around.

60
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,420
So we're using it in a slightly different way to that which I've showed here on the slide where we're

61
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,300
having the sphere and then we're sending our direction and we're giving it a max direction which might

62
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,610
be all the way over here.

63
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,630
That's not how we're using this sphere cast but we're using in a slightly hacky way then we don't need

64
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,350
to provide the layer mask or anything else them.

65
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,280
And the result as you used to is actually just an array of recast hits.

66
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:19,410
So we've got recast hit array which I'm going to call the hits so charged to you is going to be to fill

67
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,960
out the rest of this method.

68
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,240
You're going to start off by looping over all of the hits then you are going to try and find any of

69
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,280
those hits that have enemy components.

70
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,740
So basically the enemies surrounding us.

71
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,280
And finally you want to call aggravate on those enemies so that they come and attack the player as well.

72
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,080
Pause the video and have a go at this.

73
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,500
Welcome back.

74
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,280
So first of all the for loop we're going to do a for each.

75
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,870
We're going to.

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,810
OK let's use the right expansion shall we.

77
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,810
And it's going to be a for each each element in the for each is going to be a recast hit which I'm gonna

78
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:01,960
call hit and the collection we are collecting over is hits now in this for each loop we want to find

79
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,120
any enemy components.

80
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,050
So that's going to be a hit dot.

81
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,260
Now it could use either the Collider or the.

82
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,410
Game that was their game object in here.

83
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,750
I think there might be a transform but I'm just going to use the collider.

84
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,140
Any of the components within hit will do.

85
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,550
And then we can do a get component.

86
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,730
That's the goal is to what component do we want to get.

87
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,040
We want to get the enemy A.I..

88
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,350
So it's the A.I. controllers ourselves basically and some but not ourselves but a class the same as

89
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,760
ourselves.

90
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,460
But on a different enemy.

91
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,340
And so what we want to do is take this A.I. controller story in a variable and now obviously there's

92
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,540
the potential that the thing that we hit did not have an AI controller so we need to check that we actually

93
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:51,220
have one safe AI controller is not no or maybe if it is now then we're just going to continue with the

94
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,260
for loop basically skip this iteration of the for loop.

95
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,800
Otherwise we are going to do a dot aggravates you go so we can call to I don't aggravate and that's

96
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,570
going to aggravate any enemy that is within ASCII cast radius so hopefully that should do the trick.

97
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,960
Let's go over and test it out in game I think I'm not missing any semicolon.

98
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,300
That was an old error.

99
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,180
If I go and hit play and go past this enemy see they both came towards me.

100
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:29,710
Let's check that that works when I have a ranged weapon as well so I'm going to go and pick up the five

101
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,880
flower in the distance.

102
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,440
Attack this enemy near me and he gets aggravated and brings his mate with me which now makes it much

103
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,440
much harder for me because I was able to kill the first enemy.

104
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,450
But the second enemy has still got some punch.

105
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,940
By the time the high time he arrives and that gets me my health down a little bit.

106
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:56,190
It also means that if any of the enemies have sights to me like that Archer had cite to me he's gonna

107
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,180
alert his friends with the swords and they're going to come at me as well which I think is basically

108
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,430
about the right sort of thing that we would expect.

109
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,580
We don't want an archer shooting at us and his mates with swords just standing around doing nothing.

110
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,440
They would be running at me as well he'd be saying hey look there's a guy over they should run an attack.

111
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,090
So that is what we've achieved here in this lecture we've now got enemies that when they attack you

112
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,430
also bring their mates with you a kind of mob behaviour.

113
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,590
In fact while we're here dealing with spear castes we can improve our current recasting system.

114
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:36,070
So at the moment the recasting can be quite finicky sometimes to get it exactly on these tiny little

115
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,100
players when they're off in the distance.

116
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:45,500
So one way that we could improve that actually is to change the interacts with components recasting

117
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,750
to recast with a sphere instead.

118
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,460
So let's see if there's anything else that would need that.

119
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,340
Well the movement is pretty straightforward.

120
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,930
It's hard to miss the terrain.

121
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,790
We don't generally miss that terrain so that doesn't need it but the components are a little bit more

122
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,200
finicky.

123
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,970
So where we've got recast all sorted.

124
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,150
If we go into recast all sorted you can see we're currently using a recast.

125
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:17,210
All we can easily just change that to a sphere cast all and Sphere cast all requires one more argument

126
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,510
and just requires the radius.

127
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:28,210
So let's add a another parameter up here in our player controller which is going to be serialize field

128
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:37,420
and it is going to be the float Ray cast radius and I'm going to set that to a default of one meter

129
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,060
to start off with.

130
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,650
And that's what we can go ahead and use down here in our recast sorted all.

131
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:49,940
So it's going to be recast radius and that should do the trick.

132
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:56,460
So very simply using a sphere cast instead of array cast we are now able if I go ahead and hit play

133
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:03,120
to have a larger area for attacking the enemy so it's just much easier to target an enemy than it used

134
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,430
to be.

135
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,770
You know you can just click in quite a large radius around them without having any sort of issue.

136
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,890
So that about wraps it up for this lecture.

137
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,020
We'll see you in the next one.
