00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.970
Okay I feel like we've had a lot of discussing and not a lot of actual creating so let's do a bunch

2
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.370
of creating in this video.

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.840
I'm gonna go ahead and turn my sketch into my environment.

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.290
I really want to stress at this point don't be precious about things don't have things perfect.

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.470
We need to be working fast and loose you need to be out to move things around.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.320
We don't know how far we should have our player run we don't know spacing all of these things we're

7
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.170
gonna work out as we go.

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.300
So for now it is be fast and loose with how you create things and have fun.

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.490
Have a good time doing it.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.420
I'm going to record myself creating this I'm going to speed it up and commentate over the top of it

11
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.840
so you can see my process as I go.

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.230
If there's anything I go through too quickly if you have questions How did you do that then throw a

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.570
question in the discussions I've got the link as always against his lecture the challenge I've got for

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.730
you is to craft your own environment alter your terrain place your assets where you want them and to

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.620
add your enemies you can do that now as I'm doing mine or you can wait until I've done mine and then

16
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.710
go ahead and do yours.

17
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.560
Either way please jump in and create your environment and a quick note if you don't want to create this

18
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.300
yourself.

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.340
I've given you a link against this lecture which has an asset pack that you can bring into your project

20
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.100
that is for the prefab environment so you might need to delete your existing environment game object

21
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.860
but you can bring in my new environment game object which will have my terrain and trees and houses

22
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.650
from the end of this section.

23
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.830
So you see where it's going to end up but that's only if you don't want to go ahead and create it yourself

24
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.590
in the next video we're gonna be talking a little bit more about our enemies and tuning our enemies.

25
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.880
For now we're placing them so over to the actual creation process and as I mentioned are going to speed

26
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.470
up the video as I go.

27
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.140
So because I want a little bit of a river in my design I need to raise up the bulk of my terrain because

28
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.310
it's all sitting at zero and my train can't go below zero.

29
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.500
That's the lowest that ranking.

30
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.690
Because it's a height map.

31
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.200
So I've selected set height it's about one point five.

32
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.700
I did that by holding shift while I clicked on one point of my terrain that was the height I wanted

33
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.530
to and that set the height.

34
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.840
Now we're smoothing it all out.

35
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.990
You can see my buildings are now underground as I've increased the height.

36
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.400
This will allow me to dig a little trough that I can put my river in in the future.

37
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.220
I'm just generally smoothing it all out here so that I've got plenty of room to rearrange WHAT I WANT

38
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.720
TO DO.

39
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.530
I'M GONNA GRAB THE BUILDINGS move them up so they're not underground and just fiddle around with them

40
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.400
a little bit so they're at the right height.

41
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.170
I can begin to speed up the video even more now so I can fly through it as I fiddle around with the

42
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.450
placement of my buildings.

43
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.420
I could just delete them all and start a game but it's easier to have them in the scene I'm moving my

44
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.260
player to the start point.

45
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.000
Just raising it up and down a little bit.

46
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.550
So play is where I want it to be.

47
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.960
And then just smoothing out my path so I can paint a new path.

48
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.180
This is the whole fast and loose on his paint a path in there.

49
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.770
Maybe goes through the middle of town that way and see how it feels if it's not right.

50
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.570
Then I can just paint over it in green and then repaint it.

51
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.660
This is where I'm thinking maybe my river goes here maybe there.

52
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.330
Yeah looks pretty good.

53
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.290
Towns are often built right next to a river.

54
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.080
Let me make it.

55
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.110
River size probably a little bit too wide.

56
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.260
I might narrow it down later on but it's okay.

57
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.810
Just still does painting with texture before I get in there and create any geometry or any terrain layout

58
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.130
itself in terms of raising or lowering.

59
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.640
I figured the river shouldn't really end in this height of the mountain so I've covered around the back.

60
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.230
Here again to create a nice border for the player.

61
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.780
Say you can't really go over the other side of the river and just smoothing it out here so to tuck around

62
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.950
the corner nicely and then just tidy up a little bit more there.

63
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.370
Now at the start with the players I want to raise the terrain a little bit so that the player can't

64
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.420
see straight through to the village just yet and lower some of these mountains that are in the front

65
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.940
and worried they're going to bump into the camera.

66
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.720
I do a little bit more of that again later on.

67
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.320
Just make a little indent into my river so it feels a little indented and again don't over overwork

68
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.320
this cause we might want to change the entire placement of the river.

69
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.420
I just want to dig it out a little bit so I get a feel for it.

70
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.590
And then just making a bridge where I've set the height and making it the same height as the terrain

71
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.100
around it.

72
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.390
Just painting it brown kind of feels a bit bridge ish if I like the size that bridge later on than I

73
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.160
can get an asset and put it there or build an asset.

74
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.600
If you've got a whole bunch of assets ready to go then you could just drop a bridge in there straight

75
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.870
away.

76
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.100
But who knows maybe I don't want a bridge later on this is all about let's create a moment let's get

77
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.810
out distances worked out let's get our sizes.

78
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.810
Is this enough enemies for this space is a lot of questions that we can answer in this process of creating

79
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.630
a moment before we go on over commit to any massive amount of level creation.

80
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.840
Because creating levels can take a huge amount of time here.

81
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.530
I'm just rearranging my buildings a little bit.

82
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.690
I want to create that block at the front.

83
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.770
Maybe something that represents a little bit of a tavern perhaps that the gods can be standing outside.

84
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.740
I don't think this building really matches the other buildings as kind of concrete.

85
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.210
Plus the wooden stuff over there but just arranging it into the size and shape.

86
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.990
And I want to make a two story kind of maybe this is the tavern over this side.

87
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.620
It would make sense taverns are often next to the river.

88
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.440
You have a little bit of logic in there when you make these things don't have both doors on the same

89
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.740
side and just call like a two story building type thing and then yeah just rearranging that they want

90
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.600
to block the player from being on a run along the edge of the river.

91
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.080
Just add another couple of buildings here just duplicate control D move them around a little bit and

92
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.850
then why not put a fence between the two again to see how it feels.

93
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.320
You can see here rather than just trying to have that fence panel that panel that I had and just keep

94
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.810
it the exact size just gone and scaled it up.

95
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.180
I often do that just drag it out these textures a good because they're just solid textures you can drag

96
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.560
and scale so you can scale things up without it affecting how the texture looks.

97
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.190
Now at this point I realized I better run through my levels see how it's feeling make sure you bake

98
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.200
your navigation beforehand your nav mesh or else it won't work properly.

99
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.400
I'm not digging the camera.

100
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.460
I want to have the camera and see the guy's head submerged there.

101
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.300
Let me out.

102
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.110
Not yet buddy.

103
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.070
So I wouldn't have the camera have a little bit more look off into the distance.

104
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.210
Don't over finish your camera just yet.

105
00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.590
We're gonna be doing a bit more awesome stuff in our camera in a few videos time with our camera and

106
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.920
a few videos time sorry.

107
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.500
Just playing around with it here seeing how does it look that reveal down the main street of town.

108
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.330
I quite like it.

109
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.940
I built it deliberately so you can see the hallway down there and it kind of leads the player in that

110
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.390
direction.

111
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.250
I think that's gonna make it more interesting when I have my choice.

112
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.430
One is obviously you've got to go this way and the other is a little bit more sneaky down to the side.

113
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.350
Just seeing what happens if I put a couple of obstacles in the world a little bit of finesse here.

114
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.040
Probably more than I need to at this point but the Street was looking a little bit empty.

115
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:38.280
I want to see as well how things go when we add more mechanics to make sure that our enemies on bumping

116
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.670
into the crates to see about sizes what's the right size for a little arena here a little battle if

117
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.140
I have it too close then the camera's gonna be bumping into the buildings the play is going to have

118
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.240
trouble getting past the enemies and I have it to open and it feels like the plague does run past the

119
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.550
enemies and not even worry about them.

120
00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.420
So I'm playing around with that here I'm just mapping out where I want my patrol path to be I've written

121
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.010
it in kind of scribbled it in yellow and figured hang on a minute I should do it and read as a consistent

122
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.810
language for what enemies are doing so that's just to say I want this guy patrolling up and down here

123
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.970
to get a feel for the distances before we go and implement that might only take five or ten minutes

124
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.980
to hook up our way points and have the enemy running up and down the way points but it took me all of

125
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.640
five seconds just to scribbled on the ground and get a feel for it.

126
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.700
Okay.

127
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:28.230
Just laying down some more buildings just scale this up to represent a bigger building down that back

128
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:34.270
end of town to my exit point and tidying up things.

129
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.490
Make that a little bit bigger.

130
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.980
You see there's a lot of fiddling and finessing I do when I'm creating a level.

131
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.680
It's up to you how much of this you want to do.

132
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.100
You don't have to spend tons and tons of time rearranging everything perfectly.

133
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:50.440
But I figure now enough building fiddling it's time to put in some trees and see how that goes.

134
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.350
I wanted to have a village we kind of feel where there's enough trees.

135
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.180
It feels a little bit you know a little bit lush in a way.

136
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.630
Obviously these trees aren't super lush trees necessarily but I like nature so I tend to put in a lot

137
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:09.360
of trees and a lot of grass here I accidently have my scales zoomed in too far on my game.

138
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.910
So that's why it was giving a little bit of a weird look there.

139
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.880
But it's time for time to play again to see what's going on.

140
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.060
You can see I'm not happy I've got some collision issues or some navigation issues at the front.

141
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.330
They're just figuring out my reveal.

142
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.580
I think that's a pretty nice reveal over the bridge.

143
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:29.070
So I put a little see here that to note to denote this is where I'd like to trigger a cinematic.

144
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.180
So when you get to that point we can have the camera fly around a little bit and show some things the

145
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:39.540
player and then just fixing up this this little hill over here which I was clicking on accidentally

146
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.480
and the nav mesh was getting picked up over there.

147
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.740
I haven't biked the nav mesh.

148
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.540
I forgot to do that so bake it again come back over and now it's not kind of clipping into the player.

149
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.270
Those trees are getting in the way I don't like those they're obscuring the player too much song and

150
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.370
to take care of those and probably the foreground trees.

151
00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.390
We need to be pretty careful with just so they're not getting in the way of the player just load have

152
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.030
tree finessing here.

153
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:06.930
And so the process is at this point put a couple of things down then play it.

154
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.590
Just a quick run through Dari about doing combat and stuff.

155
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.760
But make sure that you are running through.

156
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.060
I'm just putting down where my other patrol path would be for this enemy.

157
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.980
I'm not yet convinced of having just one enemy on the back.

158
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.700
Here is an interesting moment.

159
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.300
You can see I'm putting my question mark for do I have a big boss battle at the end or are stronger

160
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.020
enemy.

161
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:31.170
I better actually figure out where the exit of this moment is loops around the side there and probably

162
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.580
put another bridge paint this brand to say there's a bridge into town and a bridge out of town.

163
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.420
I think that's kind of interesting.

164
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.000
And then let's get a high level overview of what's going on.

165
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.470
So I still need to I think finesse a little bit.

166
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.980
My camera it's pointing a little bit too far off in the distance.

167
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.470
So it is angle it down a bit.

168
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.810
That's not too bad.

169
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.080
So let's do a final run through our level make sure everything's okay.

170
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:59.640
Might nature just tidy up these trees if you hold down shift then allows you to delete the trees if

171
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.040
you are just left click then obviously you place trees and you can place a whole bunch of trees by increasing

172
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.410
tree density.

173
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:06.810
Okay.

174
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.490
This is feeling pretty good just giving a little bit of flavor at the start there.

175
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.980
So now let's do our final run through see how it's feeling okay.

176
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.340
The distances there I'm liking if I go down the goat track that's feeling pretty good through the middle

177
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.070
of town.

178
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.420
Yeah.

179
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.900
It's not too tight it's not too spaced out.

180
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.890
And then at the end banked my nav mesh.

181
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.260
But that would be the end of town and all in all I'm pretty happy with it.

182
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.600
Okay.

183
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.810
So hopefully that was useful watching me go through that process and have me commentate over the top

184
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:31.590
if it's good.

185
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.950
Let me know if you want more of it than I'll do more of it as I go.

186
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.790
If not then I might skip it or go a lot quicker through the process.

187
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.290
But I was just trying to show you my thought process as I went make sure there's no surprises and it's

188
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:49.050
over to you now to create your lay out your environment get things ready so that in the next video we

189
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.500
can be putting a little bit more effort into the tuning of our enemies.

190
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:52.970
OK.

191
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.450
Great work.

192
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.420
And see you again soon.
