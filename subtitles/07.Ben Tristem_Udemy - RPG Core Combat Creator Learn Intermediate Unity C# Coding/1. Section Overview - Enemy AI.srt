1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,220
So the beginning of a new section it's time for me to tell you about all the wonderful features we're

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,720
going to be implementing here I am in the prototype you might see some differences because I based it

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,000
off some lectures before Rick finished off the last section.

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,470
So what have we got going on here.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,310
What are we going to be implementing it's the enemy I.S. obviously we're gonna be talking about enemy

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,520
II but let's be more specific about the features that we actually want.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,500
So the first thing we're going to have is a chase radius.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,060
That means that when we are within distance of a player of a player of an enemy.

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,610
Let me get my scale right.

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,620
If we're in the distance they're going to come and chase after me.

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,330
Okay.

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,070
So what's next after the chase radius.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,680
We're gonna have aggression behavior.

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,530
So if I let him actually get to me he's going to give me punches.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,110
And that's going to reduce my health.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:56,330
I look at the player then you can see my health points going down as he punches me.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,790
So you've got some symmetry there we can punch them they can punch us now.

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,490
Whoops.

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,090
Now there's gizmos so gizmos are what we're seeing here.

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,940
And both the scene view and the game view you can enable them and disable them from these menus and

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,920
I can disable them in game view so we don't have to see them.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,660
But what they're telling us is this blue sphere for example is the chase radius.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,120
That's when I get with and that he comes and tries to attack me.

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,900
These little gray orbs are actually that patrol routes which we'll talk about in a sec.

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,750
So we've got to have suspicious behavior as well.

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,490
So let me demonstrate this if I move out of his chase radius.

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,750
He's going to try and chase me to the last known location and then he's going to go back to whatever

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,300
he was doing before.

29
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,450
Which brings me on to the guarding behavior and the patrol routes which are also going to implement

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,910
you can see he's on a patrol route.

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,210
He's going backwards and forwards and there's other guard too who's going backwards and forwards between

32
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,920
his patrol routes which is all hunky dory.

33
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,610
But we've also got guarding behavior.

34
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,620
So these guys are just standing at the door.

35
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:03,300
And if I go and attract their attention but run away then they will return to their posts as guards

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,160
where they left off just like this guy returns to his patrol route.

37
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,940
So that's the general gist of the section lots of fun stuff to be implementing and obviously there's

38
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,660
other things I haven't mentioned that we will be going over to on the course of implementing all of

39
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,850
these features.

40
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,530
I look forward to it and I'll see you in there.
