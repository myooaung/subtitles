Hello again my friend.
1

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.540
In this video I'm going to show you how to get the most from this course by showing you how to get help
2

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.180
where to ask questions and how to share your progress.
3

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.280
And the first thing on a show is where to find resource links because you hear us from time to time
4

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.550
say something like we've given you a link against this lecture.
5

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.600
What does that mean.
6

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.700
Well if you have a look within you to me you see up in the top left although to be honest Udemy changes
7

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.610
this around so sometimes it might be top right.
8

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.140
But look for it says resources available and you can click on the little hamburger key thing there and
9

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.930
that will expand out all of the videos and the links that we've given you for each of the videos so
10

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.450
you can see in blue these links you can click on and say for our install Visual Studio code lecture
11

12
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.630
I'm giving you a link for where you can download Visual Studio code.
12

13
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.500
You click on that and that takes you to the place that's pretty straightforward.
13

14
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.320
What we do as well is we will link you to places where if you have any questions you can go to that
14

15
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.590
specific point and ask your questions or if we've given you a request to share your challenge answer
15

16
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.470
or share ideas or show you what your work.
16

17
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.350
Then they'll also be links against a particular lecture.
17

18
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.150
So you see one of my previous videos here.
18

19
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.550
It says this lectures discussions if I click on that it will take me to the game dev TV community site
19

20
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.530
where it takes me to that particular post that's relevant for this video.
20

21
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.350
It will pre populate it with some tags.
21

22
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.440
And I've written a note in here.
22

23
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.380
Hey do you have any questions about what we're building in this course in terms of the game design.
23

24
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.700
You can click reply and say I would like to know such and such.
24

25
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.030
If you've got a question or if it's been a video about code might say my code is not working here is
25

26
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.040
the code.
26

27
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.940
Now if you do have problem with your game with your project try to take some screenshots of what's going
27

28
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.150
on screenshots of your inspector or of your hierarchy and also paste in your code so we can see exactly
28

29
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.950
what's going on.
29

30
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.290
Seniors click on reply and that would reply to this post with your particular question or idea or I'm
30

31
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.820
just gonna get rid of this one so it's not sitting there cluttering things up so that is where you answer
31

32
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.170
that you can also go just anywhere within the community site if I click on the community button up on
32

33
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.450
the top here it'll take me to the main page for our community site you can see we've got unity discussions
33

34
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.980
blender unreal and a whole bunch of our other courses in here that you can talk about we're interested
34

35
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.030
in unity you might want to go have a look at what people are showcasing by clicking on show.
35

36
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.650
You might want to look at the questions or ask a general question that might not be related to a specific
36

37
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.600
lecture that's fine or just talk about something hey I've got this idea for a thing or what do you think
37

38
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.680
about the latest changes to what unity is rolling out at the moment.
38

39
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.060
So if you click on say the talk button here then I'll take you into all of the recent topics to do with
39

40
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.550
what people are talking about.
40

41
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.410
You want to create a new discussion topic just up to the top right click on new topic right.
41

42
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.680
In what the title is and you're often racing in terms of posting to our forum which is great.
42

43
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.380
Now when you first line on this site it might ask you for a social log in or some way just to retain
43

44
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.750
your presence on this particular site.
44

45
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.530
It's totally up to you.
45

46
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.570
You don't have to be part of this community.
46

47
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.730
It's here to help you and to make your journey a lot better your learning journey a lot smoother.
47

48
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.580
So it's up to you whether you want to interact or not.
48

49
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.120
It is completely optional.
49

50
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.810
Just want to be clear on that and then back to the Udemy lecture here.
50

51
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.100
The other thing I wanted to point out that for nearly every lecture particularly , im going to scroll later
51

52
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.710
on into the future a little bit you haven't got to this section yet but for any lecture where we change
52

53
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.120
our code we will give you a link to our github repo.
53

54
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.500
It might say something like github repo for this lecture or lecture.
54

55
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.130
Project changes or just git hub if you click on that it will take you to our repository.
55

56
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.850
That's what repo stands for is short for sorry.
56

57
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.310
And we'll take you to the state in our project at that particular point in time.
57

58
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.740
And you can have a look at our project.
58

59
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.930
You can click into it maybe look at the assets if you want to check out some scripts because your particularly
59

60
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.790
interested in what was the the thing that we've implemented my script doesn't match your script or what's
60

61
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.210
going on.
61

62
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.430
Then you can navigate navigate around our project and have a look at exactly the state of our project
62

63
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.060
at this point.
63

64
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.800
So that should be against pretty much every lecture you'll see that something to the github or this
64

65
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.360
lectures changes.
65

66
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.770
Now I've jumped into the community site but I want to show you the places that you can ask or show your
66

67
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.400
work.
67

68
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.800
We've talked about the GameDev.TV Community Forum.
68

69
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.940
There's also the Q and A section on this platform this platform being Udemy.
69

70
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.750
So within the Udemy mechanism here or this close up my resources down the bottom.
70

71
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.180
And again this has changed recently.
71

72
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.510
It used to be in the right I think.
72

73
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.070
But you'll see somewhere browse Q and A.
73

74
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.180
If you click on that it will show you all of the questions that people have asked for this particular
74

75
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.370
lecture and that's great because someone might have already asked and answered the question that you've
75

76
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.880
got.
76

77
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.250
This is a great place.
77

78
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.150
If you've got a quick question or if you've got something to do with the video that didn't work or didn't
78

79
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.000
make sense that you want to be very clear that it's to do with this exact video.
79

80
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.980
This is a great place to ask it.
80

81
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.460
And so the way to ask a question is just click on the Ask a new question button if it is a question
81

82
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.680
we request that you put in square brackets.
82

83
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:11.690
QUESTION Actually if you lies it it's even nifty to question how to improve my games such and such such
83

84
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.270
and such is a fancy way of saying you know insert a thing here that's a placeholder terminology and
84

85
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.460
then you would write in your question putting in screenshots if you've got any again pasting code etc..
85

86
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.230
And it's briefly while on the Udemy player if you go down the bottom left or it might change but at
86

87
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.360
the moment it's bottom left you see the playback right.
87

88
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.940
We find a lot of people to our videos are at a faster speed one point to five for example if you want
88

89
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.950
to get through it more quickly if you're more comfortable with the topic or if your English is not your
89

90
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.350
first language perhaps slowing it down to point seventy five.
90

91
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.900
That can be useful as well.
91

92
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:44.240
Okay.
92

93
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.790
So we've talked about Q and A section on udemy.
93

94
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.960
We also have a GameDev TV Facebook group if you're more comfortable with Facebook.
94

95
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.880
This is a great place for us to hang out and have a chat.
95

96
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.710
I've given you a link to this as well against this lecture in here you can see what people are talking
96

97
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.240
about someone celebrating the fact that they've finished one of our courses that's called sharing their
97

98
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.820
game sharing screenshots of their game getting feedback saying hey what do you think about this what's
98

99
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.390
going on.
99

100
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.530
Just a whole bunch of stuff that people are sharing on there and then the fourth thing I wanted to show
100

101
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.050
you in here is discord might be comfortable discord It's a chat server and I've given you a link that
101

102
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.530
will take you to an invitation click on except invite look for the either the C sharp conversation or
102

103
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.270
the unity conversation you see click on unity.
103

104
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.430
This is people chatting in real time so that is a really great spot to hang out.
104

105
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.990
Okay.
105

106
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.220
The other thing you might have noticed so far is that we from time to time put up the challenge slide
106

107
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.280
it's got the green border and the little pause the video symbols down the bottom the challenge I've
107

108
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.030
got for you in this video is to name the donkeys.
108

109
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.410
This has been our favorite challenge from the RPG cause for a little while now is to find the link against
109

110
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.460
this lecture to our name
110

111
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:57.320
The donkeys community post and add your answer for what you think the donkeys should be called and just
111

112
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.980
a hint.
112

113
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.820
Sam and Rick.
113

114
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.770
It has already been mentioned so you can cowboys something even cleverer than that so that's a challenge
114

115
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.280
when you have done that jump back here.
115

116
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:11.040
I'll quickly show you myself going through the challenge and then it'll be time for the next video.
116

117
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.010
OK so I haven't posted my video yet but I would click I'm at the top left I'd find the video click on
117

118
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.140
the link that says find the donkeys or name the donkey sorry.
118

119
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.100
That will take me to this page from this page you can see that here are a couple of donkeys that originally
119

120
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.140
Ben posted this.
120

121
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.990
I'm going to scroll all the way down the bottom because lots of our cool community has already had a
121

122
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.290
bit of a stab at naming these donkeys.
122

123
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:42.160
When I click on reply and here I'm going to say I think they should be called not Rick and not Sam.
123

124
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.960
Look at how how creative that is not very then click on reply.
124

125
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.380
And by being better boom there is my response on the community forum.
125

126
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:52.780
So there we have it.
126

127
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.300
The four main ways that you can get support while going through this course please do ask questions
127

128
00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.860
please do share your progress.
128

129
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.510
That's how you get the most out of this course.
129

130
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.830
We'd love to see you succeed.
130

131
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.880
We'd love to see you make some great games in the future that we can play.
131

132
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.860
So great work and I will see you in an upcoming video.
