00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,210
In this lecture we're talking about the player experience.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,180
And I'm going to challenge you to come up with an experience that you want to give your player in your

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,250
game.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,270
So what do people like playing games.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,450
Well what they'll say to you is it's fun you know I like it because it's fun.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,000
No I'm good at it or the graphics look great.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,200
That's what they're saying.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,700
What's really going on.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:28,270
I think what they actually mean is it made me feel a certain way or it gave me an interesting experience.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,490
And the best games give a player a consistent experience throughout the game.

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:39,220
And I think the most important high level design tool or design technique you can have in your in your

12
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:45,430
toolkit is to create a very specific and consistent player experience that you then have every aspect

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,100
of your game support.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,880
Let's talk a little bit about how you come up with a player experience.

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,100
So I've got three ways here that you can express your player experiences more I'm sure.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,430
But let's talk about these three the first one is to make the player feel like a particular type of

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,260
person.

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,340
His couple of examples if you look at the Elder Scrolls series I'm looking at Skyrim just here.

19
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,370
The game creators want you to feel a particular way like a something and I think they want you to feel

20
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:18,280
like an adventurer you're going off on these big quests across faraway lands you're having to scale

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,150
mountains and battle monsters and discover things and and find allies and kick down doors.

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,830
It's all about being an adventurer and a lot of memos give you this kind of or open world games give

23
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:35,290
you this sense of being an explorer and adventurer going off on a grand quest.

24
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,840
But if we look from the same studio Bethesda the Fallout series in particular we're looking at full

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,950
out for here.

26
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,270
The experience that they're giving the player is different it's not an adventure but it's as a survivor

27
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,670
it's post apocalyptic.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,820
You have to scrounge for materials you have to you're running around as a lone wolf trying to survive

29
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:01,980
from mutant monsters jumping out at you to unravel what's going on and just just stay alive just survive.

30
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,590
And if we look at a different game Assassin's Creed This one's great.

31
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,700
It's right in the title.

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,680
They want you to feel like an assassin you're running around with a hood over your face he slinking

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,170
through the shadows you trying not to to be seen or get caught it's all about this secretive assassin

34
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:24,640
bad ass fighter kind of guy dropping on your enemies from the rooftops your you're sneaking around you're

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,700
shooting arrows just everything about this game makes you feel like an assassin.

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,210
There's another way to express it is to make the player feel a certain emotion.

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,620
So what I mean by that couple of examples here God of War I love this series within God of War.

38
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,960
How do you feel when you play that well you feel powerful you feel like a god you feel like you can

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,980
smash things you just bust through walls and and command great surging power.

40
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,080
It's one of those games that just everything says we want the player to feel powerful.

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,840
If we look at a game like five nights at Freddy's or many the other scary games you could say I want

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,670
the player to feel scared.

43
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,950
That's okay but I think it's more you wanting the player to feel tense.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,690
But it's all about the anticipation waiting something's going to happen something's going to happen

45
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,210
and then you get the jump scare at some point of you know the scary payoff but it's that that tenseness

46
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,330
is why people love it.

47
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,280
Similarly I'm so scared but I love it.

48
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,450
So the the experience doesn't always have to be one of pure joy.

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,350
It can be one that's a little bit painful the player but you know in a way that makes them want to keep

50
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:35,440
going and playing through the game flour if you've seen the game flour or played it I think you could

51
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,520
say this is where you control the wind and you moving around petals of flowers.

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,090
You could say well want the play to feel like the wind.

53
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,980
But what's the downside of that.

54
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,830
If I say the wind to you it might mean something.

55
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,310
I might be thinking a gentle breeze.

56
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,720
You might be thinking a hurricane so we can't just say we want the play to feel like the wind.

57
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,600
I think here the what the developers were going for is to make the player feel peaceful.

58
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,160
When you say peaceful you like Ah I know what sort of wind will have the play I feel peaceful there's

59
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,980
there's a powerful ness to it but it's rustling through the grass and and swooping around and if you

60
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:15,210
look even the artwork even the title screen has a peacefulness to it blue sky and green grass it's not

61
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,610
it's not a stormy day with a thunderstorm that wouldn't be peaceful would it.

62
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,890
And another way you can express it is to give the player the same feeling as doing a certain activity.

64
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,050
So a couple of examples on this Minecraft.

65
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,510
What do you think what activity does Minecraft feel like.

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,290
I think Minecraft feels like playing with Lego.

67
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,890
So if you say I want to make a video game that feels like playing with Lego people we like aha I know

68
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:44,710
what you're trying to make here and when you're making decisions on your games team you know does this

69
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,390
make the player feel like they're playing with Lego.

70
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,990
Yes or no.

71
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,460
If it's yes you do it.

72
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,940
If it's no you don't put it into the game.

73
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,170
Similarly fortnight how do you feel when you're playing fortnight and also pub G and the other battle

74
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,700
royale type games.

75
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,910
I think it feels like playing a game of tag or sometimes playing a game of hide and seek.

76
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,830
But there's a whole bunch of us in a playground running around.

77
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,640
I'm trying to tag you you're trying to tag me or in this case you're trying to shoot me while I don't

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,130
even know where you are and I get frustrated and quit the game.

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,780
Okay enough about me but it's that feeling you get when you're playing that game of tag with a whole

80
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,580
bunch of friends running around in the schoolyard.

81
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,020
So having a player experience makes your decision making easier.

82
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,250
I've alluded to this the best games create a consistent experience in every aspect of the game within

83
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,200
the art within the gameplay within the audio within the story within their marketing.

84
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,250
Everything speaks to that.

85
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,810
You don't sit there and say what should I do in my marketing promo art piece you like.

86
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,390
Well I need to create peaceful.

87
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,300
All right I need to create powerful and so you know how to go about doing it.

88
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,590
It helps you make decisions.

89
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,600
So if you're in doubt what should I do.

90
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,120
Do whatever will create the experience that you're aiming for for your player.

91
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,590
That's how you make decisions.

92
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,080
So I have a challenge for you and that's to decide what's the player experience you're creating for

93
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,770
your player.

94
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,420
Now you might need a little bit of time to think about it.

95
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,900
You might want to put down an answer and then say I'm going to think about this a little bit more over

96
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,860
the next couple of days so that's cool but I want you to put down something now so you've made a start.

97
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:13,510
Just go with your gut your gut reaction might be powerful or or frantic or an adventurer like you might

98
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,140
already have a feeling of what your game that you've got in your mind is going to be.

99
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,900
So think about what's the experience want to create.

100
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,560
Write this into your one point five page DDD.

101
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,620
And also please share your choice with the community.

102
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,010
Let us know what you've come up with and so you have it as a point of comparison here is what I'm doing

103
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,460
for mine.

104
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,480
I'm going for the joy of laughter going for funny is a little bit.

105
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,990
I've wrestled with this a lot funny is not really an emotion funny is a is an approach so we wanted

106
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:45,090
an absurd funny game but what is funny if someone's laughing Well it's the joy of laughter.

107
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,120
So that's the experience I'm looking to create for my player.

108
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:53,830
The joy of laughter through absurd absurd comedy and humor so there's your challenge.

109
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,430
Take that on come up with your player experience and after you've done that I'll see you in the next

110
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,810
video.
