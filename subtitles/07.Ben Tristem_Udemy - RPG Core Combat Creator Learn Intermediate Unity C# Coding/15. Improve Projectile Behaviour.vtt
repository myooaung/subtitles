00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.340
Hello welcome back.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.950
We're gonna make our projectiles a little bit spiffy by having the option to have some missiles heat

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.570
seeking and other missiles like this blue ones not heat seeking is just going in a straight line.

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.860
We're also going to fix a couple of issues with wonky behavior when you shoot enemies in the arrow is

5
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.450
not behaving as expected.

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.010
So let's jump in and get crackin.

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.490
Just a quick bit of tidy up from my last lecture.

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.500
I left a sword pickup lying around in my scene but it doesn't have a mesh so each time I run over my

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.860
weapon disappeared confused me no ends.

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.030
Thanks Sam for pointing out how simple it was to fix that if I'd just paid attention.

11
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.730
I'm going to delete that old sword pick up and then find my two other sword because I've pickups I've

12
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.110
created and drag that into my pick up folder of my pick up game object sorry.

13
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.260
And that's pretty good.

14
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.060
I've got an archer that's not in my enemies so just that we have tidy up and put him into the enemy's

15
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.580
folder.

16
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.160
That is fine for now.

17
00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.550
OK.

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.700
So at the moment as you know our projectiles are homing missiles which I think is really cool but I'd

19
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.400
like to have the option to have sometimes having missiles sometimes not.

20
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.510
Or at least we had to turn it off so that we don't get this.

21
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.650
I think with a with a fireball This is convex Corbett with an arrow it looks a little bit tricky so

22
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.790
I'll keep it in as a fireball behavior but take it out as an arrow behavior and then the other thing

23
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.850
that a bunch of folks in our community have pointed out is a couple of issues we're having so I'm going

24
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:35.040
to find my let's see find my projectiles so projectiles blue arrow open prefab speed changes down to

25
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.370
10 so that we can see this issue more readily.

26
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.670
I'm also going to increase the distance that my player can shoot.

27
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.250
So where are a bow and the bow with blue projectile weapon range 20.

28
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.800
OK just so I don't have to get quite so close to my enemy.

29
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200
Let me show you what I'm seeing at the moment here.

30
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.350
I think these arrows are a little bit too slow but you might want to have your arrows slower by the

31
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.430
time my arrow is mid air I've shot another one and you can see it's hitting the collider and disappearing

32
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.690
so it's kind of as if we're hitting the enemy all over again which is a bit silly.

33
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.530
If the enemy's dead I want it to go flying off into the distance and acknowledge the fact that there

34
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.580
is no enemy there anymore so that's one of the issues that I've seen.

35
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.310
And when we play around with it a little bit we can introduce other issues where the arrow kind of just

36
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.360
stops mid air of the arrow sticks and stays around and jitters so as a challenge I'm gonna give to is

37
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.890
implementing a couple of bits of functionality and also seeing if you can find those couple of bugs

38
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.000
or a couple of issues when we do play around with our functionality so we're tweaking our projectile

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.910
code the functionality first of all see if you can make out projectile go in a straight line instead

40
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.730
of being a homing missile or homing projectile.

41
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.660
This is a pretty straightforward fix something you should be figure be out to figure out even if you

42
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.540
don't take on the other parts of the challenge.

43
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.160
The second part of functionality is hey let's create an option to select if the projectile is a homing

44
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.290
projectile or is not a homing projectile.

45
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.260
So for example when we implement our fireballs pretty soon maybe they follow the target no matter what

46
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.450
but our arrows don't follow the target and we don't have to go and create a whole new script.

47
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.360
So within our projectile script how do we do that so you can select.

48
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.570
Is this particular projectile homing or not homing and then to fix these issues as they arise as we

49
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.130
make these changes in here new ones might come up hopefully not too many.

50
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.240
First of all the project projectile gets stuck in the dead Target's collider if the target is dead.

51
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.490
We want the projectile just to go flying off into the distance and we also have an issue where the projectile

52
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.280
stays in one spot.

53
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.470
If the target dies before the projectile reaches that you kind of the arrow just sort of pauses Mid

54
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.430
Air is one of the things that I found so all this is going to be in one script just the projectile script

55
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.080
in that class.

56
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.690
See if you can figure out how to improve the functionality of our projectile and I'll see you back here

57
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.710
when you've given it your best shot.

58
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.680
Remember even if you only take on one aspect of this that's better than taking on no aspects of it.

59
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.820
So give it a shot.

60
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.300
I'll see you back here in a moment.

61
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.010
Okay so first thing I'm going to do.

62
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.580
Have a look in my project our code is say what do we need to do so that we can have something that goes

63
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.140
in a straight line is not homing.

64
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.960
So update our big hint here is we're looking at something every frame.

65
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.080
So if something's moving around then we're changing our look at position.

66
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.300
So I think I could just grab this.

67
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:31.850
Create a start and tidy up my brackets a little bit and I'm going to copy the look at copy and put it

68
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.420
into start.

69
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.880
So the very first thing we do when this projectile is instantiated is it looks at the target and says

70
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.310
aha there's the target right now.

71
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.990
Now if I don't want it to be going towards the target every frame I can just comment this and I'm not

72
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.220
going to delete it because I'm going to put it back in in a moment when we want to toggle between homing

73
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.370
and not homing is that we're no longer on update looking at our target.

74
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.430
So it should be as simple as that.

75
00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.690
Let's save that up and see if it works where all of our projectiles now should no longer be homing missiles.

76
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.170
I'm going to see if my enemy.

77
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.860
Run run run.

78
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.190
And yet I can dodge out of the way which you know is really pretty cool.

79
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.040
I think we could have an enemy that shoots big slow things and you kind of have to dodge the gauntlet

80
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.020
as you're trying to get past the guy.

81
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.970
I think that'd be quite interesting so we've now officially made all of our projectiles not homing missiles

82
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.730
just kind of cool but we want the ability to say some projectiles are some projectiles are not so how

83
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.220
we gonna go about doing that.

84
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:34.130
Well I have decided to add a bull as a new variable top so serialize field.

85
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:41.980
This will be a bull and we'll call this what is homing and I'll initialize that at true so our projectiles

86
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.540
do start off being homing projectiles and then within my update I'm going to put back in or uncommon.

87
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.690
My look at and I need a little bit of logic in here.

88
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.400
What logic you think we need.

89
00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:02.790
I think it's gonna be as simple as saying If is homing then in that instance we're going to look at

90
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.710
the target.

91
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.830
So therefore if it returns false then we're not going to look at the target.

92
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.880
Let's see how that goes.

93
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.910
Save that up.

94
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.530
Jump back over I will make the red projectile.

95
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.790
Let's go find the projectiles the red projectiles open them up.

96
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.680
We will have them as is homing.

97
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.510
Yes that's good we'll start with that.

98
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.400
And then you know what.

99
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.420
I'll give my other one of the other guys in the scene so I don't have to do this take too long this

100
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.040
guy here with the blue arrow will make this not homing.

101
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.330
OK.

102
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.970
So open up our arrow projectile blue switch off is homing and then I need to find that enemy who's holding

103
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.040
that and give him a bigger attack range I think.

104
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.130
Who is that there.

105
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.550
This is Bob.

106
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:46.230
Bob.

107
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.180
Now where are you for your distance.

108
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.070
Distance distance Chase distance.

109
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.510
We need to put that up to 20.

110
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.760
OK.

111
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.260
Now Bob should shoot at us with a non homing.

112
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.370
And the other guy homing and not homing.

113
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.610
OK.

114
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.750
So we've got that two different.

115
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.520
You see the blue arrows are just going straight and the Red Arrows are cutting success.

116
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.770
OK.

117
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.660
So we now have the option to have homing missiles and not homing missiles.

118
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.070
Now let's look at the other issues.

119
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.240
What was in our list just here projectile getting stuck and projectile stays.

120
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.600
Okay.

121
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:17.840
Cool.

122
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.310
We're gonna be using is dead a bunch in this to see whether something is dead or not.

123
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.180
So let's see.

124
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.920
Did I kill this guy.

125
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.830
Bob I think I did Bob for now.

126
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.890
I'm going to move him out of the way so we don't get shot and killed too quickly actually.

127
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.010
No I'll leave Bob there.

128
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.800
Just give the play tons of help.

129
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.470
That's probably the smarter way to do this.

130
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:43.390
Health points six hundred just so I'm not going to die halfway through showing you what's going on.

131
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:49.710
Okay now I want my projectiles to be nice and slow so that I can kill this first guy.

132
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.460
But be still be shooting another projectile before he's dead.

133
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.750
All.

134
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.940
You can see I've got a few on the way.

135
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.390
When he dies let's see what behavior happens.

136
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.530
They kind of bump bump bump.

137
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.420
Just kind of blink out into nowhere.

138
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.010
So let's look and see what we need to do here.

139
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.450
Well if we scroll all the way down to.

140
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.990
On trigger enter so our dead enemy we're still colliding with it with our arrow that thinks the enemy

141
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.590
is alive.

142
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:23.020
So let's putting a line here before we are trying to give damage let's just type in If Target is dead.

143
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.320
Then what are we going to do.

144
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.450
Will return basically at this moment where we collide with the enemy we say is the enemy dead.

145
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:36.590
If so then don't try to be giving any damage and in particular don't destroy the game object.

146
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.950
We don't want it to go blank into a kind of a nothing collider and burn out.

147
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:47.600
So it's safe that see how that functionality goes basically we want it to be flying off into the distance.

148
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.080
We'll have to probably have to create another mechanism for destroying it after a certain amount of

149
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.360
time so it doesn't just go sailing into the beyond forever and ever.

150
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.130
But there we go.

151
00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.390
Okay.

152
00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.910
That's cool.

153
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.270
Look at that.

154
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.520
It just went sailing off sailing off nice.

155
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:10.140
Now I think if we turn on projectile is homing we get some other sorts of behavior that might break

156
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.150
it again so it's put homing back on for our blue missiles.

157
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.810
This is part of the bug testing you have to test it with homing on with homing off if the enemy shoots

158
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.980
me I shoot at the enemy running around.

159
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.260
So you want to make sure you move it up a little bit and then just do exactly the same thing each time.

160
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.960
OK.

161
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.860
Shoot shoot shoot and then point and you see this interesting behavior.

162
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.090
Let me pause and jump into the scene.

163
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.650
You can see the arrow is just kind of dicking around hanging around.

164
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:44.850
So that is an issue with homing because when we go and have a look at our homing logic here it's saying

165
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.880
if he's homing Yep then keep looking at the target.

166
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.960
So we just need to say that if the target is dead stop looking at it.

167
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:58.120
So is homing and and exclamation marks are is not target.

168
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.170
Dot is dead.

169
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.460
That should protect us against the case of homing missiles trying to stick around the dead body and

170
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:11.730
kind of add insult to injury and be like haha what's that called tea bagging someone maybe that's a

171
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.270
different thing.

172
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.370
No I think that is when you play first person shooter then go look that up online.

173
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:23.640
If you don't know that means shooting shooting shooting and off in the distance I think that is it.

174
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.110
I think we found all of our issues.

175
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.760
If you find anything else any other bugs we've introduced or any other kind of weirdness if you make

176
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.740
the arrow super fast or make the arrow super slow then you might introduce something else but generally

177
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.380
this is the speed we'd want to have our our magic fireball kind of things I think that's okay any slower

178
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.880
than that is a little bit ridiculous.

179
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.410
We haven't really planned for our game to go much slower and we still want to be out to see when we

180
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.240
shoot our arrows.

181
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.980
So we haven't planned for the arrows to go like a thousand frames per second we we want to have it still

182
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.720
reasonable so you might find some really crazy outliers but generally the game is intended for the arrows

183
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.140
to go between you know projectiles going from that speed to that faster speed.

184
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:02.550
Okay.

185
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.930
So there we have it.

186
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.220
Let us know in the comments how you went with figuring out this is this the right sort of challenge

187
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.420
for you was it too easy was it too difficult did you like it.

188
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.830
Do you like the hole put your sleuthing hat on and try to figure out what the issue is and give us some

189
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.500
feedback on that let us know how you went.

190
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.160
And I will see you in the next lecture.
