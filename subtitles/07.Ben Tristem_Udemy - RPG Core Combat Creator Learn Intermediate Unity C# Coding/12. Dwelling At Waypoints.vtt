00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:11.760
Hello and welcome in this lecture we are implementing dwell time in our waypoint behavior and our patrolling

2
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.440
behavior so that our enemy can stop for a certain amount of time at every waypoint configurable amount

3
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.850
of time.

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.010
Let's dive in and see how it's done.

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.900
So implementing it to all time is mostly gonna be a challenge for you because it is repeating a lot

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.940
of the stuff we have already done.

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.820
But before we do that there's a couple of tweaks I would like to do.

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.610
So the first one is that these patrol paths we won't find them a little bit cumbersome to work with

9
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.590
before because they were attached to the prefab.

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.610
So what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to go ahead and break the prefab by right clicking on

11
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.850
it and going to unpack prefab completely.

12
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.280
And this just breaks the link entirely.

13
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.450
GONNA DO THIS FOR BOTH OF THEM AND YOU MIGHT wondering why do we have a prefab why do we bother there.

14
00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.860
Well because the prefab does allow us quite easily to get a designer started so a designer wants to

15
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.160
create new patrol path they go and dump the patrol path prefab in and then they can break it and tweak

16
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.330
it.

17
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.220
So that's the idea but the patrol paths are intrinsically linked with a world.

18
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.930
So it makes sense that they exist only in that world and that they're part of the same file.

19
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.030
I've kind of rethought it from her original lecture but that's fine you know these decisions are iterative

20
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.550
and we think about it.

21
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.090
We try it out see what the implications are and then adjust.

22
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.370
So the other thing I don't like at the moment is that if I want to attack this character if I've been

23
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.470
running around and my mouse hovers over him Look I just stop moving now.

24
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.600
The reason for this you could have a little go at seeing why this is happening for yourself if you like

25
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.370
the clue would be here in the play control.

26
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.680
So yes if you want to have a look.

27
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.220
But basically what's going on is that we've been moving we've not had our mouse over anything that can

28
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.720
handle combat.

29
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.140
So we've been moving but our mouse goes over something that can handle combat and look what happens.

30
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.700
It right cast hits I mean it can handle combat and whether or not we attack it it returns true.

31
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.300
So we stop moving as soon as our cursor goes over something we can attack which is good but also not

32
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.180
so good because we haven't actually attacked it would be much more natural if while we are moving our

33
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.970
cursor around in the game world.

34
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.040
Let's try again.

35
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.130
I start attacking that character so that's how I'm going to tweak it so that instead of having this

36
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.680
get mouse button down it's going to be the same as movements to have get button down.

37
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.830
And that's really all that tweak and tails and very very simple nice nice bindings a simple isn't it.

38
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.010
So if I hold down over him then it attacks my mouse away then it will run away.

39
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.090
So that's quite a natural feeling of attacking system there.

40
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.270
Okay.

41
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.690
So without further ado let's get into your challenge to implement dwelling.

42
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.720
So this is gonna be similar to the time since I last saw player.

43
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.150
So that's over in the A.I. controller and we've got this variable which is handling all time since last

44
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.400
saw play it's going to be really similar to that in that we're going to be updating it when we reach

45
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:19.010
a waypoint and then you need to move to the next waypoint only after a configurable time has elapsed.

46
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.300
So you're going to have to all the same sorts of things as time since last saw player in order to do

47
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.560
this.

48
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.650
So it's really gonna test out your knowledge to see if you understand how these kinds of timers are

49
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.520
working.

50
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.890
Pause video and have a go okay.

51
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.930
So there are a few things we're doing with time since last saw player the first one is we're setting

52
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.400
it to zero.

53
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.710
When we do attack we are checking it before we do suspicious behavior.

54
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.480
We're making sure that if it's less than the time that's elapsed then we can do the suspicious behavior.

55
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.060
Now what do we want to do with our time.

56
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.770
Well let's first implement the timer.

57
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.940
So again I think we're going to need it to start off at infinity because we haven't arrived at a waypoint

58
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.160
time since I arrived at waypoint.

59
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.450
At the moment we haven't arrived at waypoint so the time is infinite.

60
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.240
And what is it that we want to limit when we do this.

61
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.930
Well if we go down to our patrol behavior what we want to limit is when we can move to the next waypoint.

62
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.150
So we want to say that if time since arrived at waypoint is greater than and then we want some kind

63
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.550
of configurable time.

64
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:35.140
So we'll have a serialize field up at the top of the file for floats waypoints dwell time.

65
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.550
Okay.

66
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.150
And then we're going to dwell there for three seconds so that if we go back to our behavior that patrol

67
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.100
behavior time since arrived at waypoint is greater than waypoints dwell time then that is when we can

68
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.680
start moving to the next waypoint.

69
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.330
But when is it that they should get reset the time since arrived at waypoint.

70
00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.510
Well when we do arrive at a waypoint which is in here if we have a patrol path and if we are at the

71
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.740
waypoint then we're cycling the waypoint and we're setting the times it's arrived at waypoint to zero.

72
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.480
One more thing we have to do is update it in every update.

73
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.590
So time since last saw a plan and time since arrived at waypoint we undo plus equal time delta time.

74
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.260
Now notice these two things are doing very similar stuff.

75
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.590
I'm gonna actually hide them extract them into a method called update timers like so and then if we

76
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.740
wanted to because we've started hiding these timers then we could update the time since last so player

77
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.520
to actually go inside the attack behavior itself so that things are just a bit cleaner because we're

78
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.820
not seeing the timers at these level this level any way because of the patrol behavior hiding its timers.

79
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.120
So it kind of they kind of explain what they do already in their name the time since arrived at waypoint

80
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.000
as long as you make sure those timers are getting updated then everything works just fine.

81
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.620
So shall we see whether this is going to work or not.

82
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.890
I'm going to get out of the way of this guard he's gonna go to his waypoints and have a look in the

83
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.540
same view.

84
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.040
Now he's waiting his waypoint for a little bit of time and moves onto the next one waits at his waypoint

85
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.390
for a little bit of time and then moves on to the next one and hopefully we should be able to see that

86
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.610
if we select the right enemy.

87
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:27.400
And I go and find his waypoint to well time I can make it really small so he just spends half a second

88
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.860
there.

89
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.800
Let's see if he does that yet.

90
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.750
He spends less time or we can make it really large frame.

91
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:41.060
Five seconds it gets there and then he has to wait five seconds before he can move on so you can do

92
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.960
a lot to adjust the way that these guards patrol so that it's not completely obvious to the player how

93
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.000
this guard is going to actually patrol whether he's going to go down this route down that route.

94
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.190
You can make the routes more complicated.

95
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.020
So sometimes they look back on themselves but then loop off in another direction.

96
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.200
You can add lots of uncertainty to the player in that regard.

97
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.410
If you want to add some kind of stealthy elements you can add dwelling in and so on and so forth.

98
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.090
Got lots of design levers that we can pull from this waypoint system.

99
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:16.220
So with that said I'm going to hand you over to Rick for the next lectures where you're going to lay

100
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.930
out this level to actually be challenging and fun to play through with this A.I..
