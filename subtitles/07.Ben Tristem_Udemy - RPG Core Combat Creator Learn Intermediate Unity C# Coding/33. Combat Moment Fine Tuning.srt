1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,630
We've talked about tuning combat a lot in this video.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,250
I'm going to show you a little bit of my final combat tuning to make my moment my five minute moment

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,530
exciting and interesting and a good gameplay experience.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,170
My challenge for you I haven't given you many challenges lately but I have a final combat training challenge

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,390
for you which is to train your combat moment so that it is a fun five minutes.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,250
Don't worry about how it fits within your overall game.

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,350
That's something that you would tune when you've got your overall game for now.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,960
Just wanted to make a fun five minutes and tune the combat so it's cool for that.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,010
And then if you haven't done so already have someone other than yourself play your game.

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,160
Give me feedback give me thoughts and celebrate the fact that your game is awesome.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,530
So there's your challenge.

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,240
Show you a little bit of what I'm doing for mine and what I had been doing the last kind of half hour

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,340
or so I've put a couple of guys up in here just to break up the moment so it's not all about this moment

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,720
down here on the bridge although that's delivered to the start of the show starting my player off unharmed.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,160
So I'm kind of pretending like this is the start of the game but you know at the start the game is going

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,170
to be quite different to this because we have a little bit of tutorial but this is a five minute moment.

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,450
So I want to have a little bit of progression in my five minute moment.

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,920
I'm unarmed I run over here I hit these guys I've had to choose my own arm a little bit to give them

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,990
a little bit more of you know what I'm gonna do while I'm here is hang on a sec I'll kill these two

20
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,710
guys finish my thought I've got the flame thrower fireball over here picked it up I put a light on it

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,720
so it stood out a little bit more now I've got the fireball one thing I wanted to show you is you can

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,610
see that my enemies have got the weed kind of border on their on their health by here I'm going to pause

23
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,710
the game going to scene and just show you probably enough to go on the scene but I'm going to show you

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:49,380
here if I grab let's see scroll down if I grab canvas and click that off so click off canvas all those

25
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,870
go away all that outline that I had there also my players got some little audio things around him so

26
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,940
I think what I'm going to do is just grab all of the 3D icons and just shrink them all down to pretty

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,250
much zero that way those things aren't going to get in the way I find I don't look at the gizmos so

28
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,260
much but when you're back into building game mode like playing around with your construction of your

29
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,870
game you can go back and increase that up again oh that's what all those things are.

30
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:21,230
OK so that is just a footnote there and then unopposed I've now got my flamethrower thing here in my

31
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,000
window when I get more content in my game this is where I could have a quest giver or some loot or some

32
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,190
some other weapon or arm or even a shop over here could go over and do a little bit of inventory stuff

33
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,110
sorry just a footnote for that that I can still use this this kind of moment later on when I add more

34
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,070
features and functionality than up here I've got this moment on the breezeway Oh goodness me this guy

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,650
shooting at me I've kind of drawn the aggro of this soldier here I'm going to pick him off with my fireball

36
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,930
shouldn't take as many have gone in done a lot of tuning on my weapon so my fireball was a little bit

37
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:59,220
weak so I've gone into my script to all objects here my bow my SO MY BLUE Bow that I give to the player

38
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,580
the red I give to the enemy make sure that the distance so the range is consistent and the fireball

39
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,370
what I mean by consistent is that the enemy should be out of out shoot the player so you can see here

40
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,840
the weapon range is twenty whereas what the player is gonna do is just sit just a little bit out of

41
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,680
range and pick off the enemy which we don't want to have happen.

42
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,510
So the player I give the blue projectile which has a range of 18 and the enemy I have the red projectile

43
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,730
which is 20 so the enemy can shoot me a little bit fireball also 18 I increase the specs on that increase

44
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,320
the damage because I wanted it to be a bit more powerful and then sword I increase the damage on that

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,490
as well I've dropped the sword later on in my scene over here near the fireplace just there before I

46
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:48,200
get to my difficult battle at the end here with the stronger guy and Sam made us our little health cheat

47
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,560
here I put that just the other side of the bridge to create this interesting moment where I can run

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,130
run run run and get that health and then running the way again if I want to be shooting at this guy

49
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,480
and have a little bit of a standoff shooting sorry let me show you that I've got my projectile weapon

50
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,550
now I can run up here to the bridge Oh I see a guy over the bridge I can shoot he shoots me I shoot

51
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,680
him I run away I dodge dodge his weapon he's not clever enough to dodge mine which is kind of cool shoot

52
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,530
reload shoot again.

53
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,190
Come on do it.

54
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,590
Just standing there doing nothing that's not the way to shoot OK.

55
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,780
And then I get him who I can't I can run over and get a little bit of pumpkin action this guy standing

56
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,750
here with the massive sword shoot at him a couple of times.

57
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,760
Side note I think there's a bit of room for us to add more feature work so that when you shoot them

58
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,260
they come running at you I think that's a little bit lacking at the moment.

59
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,460
So that's one example of kind of a last minute feature bug tweaking we might do might might make another

60
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,170
video too on those sort of things so if you find anything that you say Hey Rick can Sam this is really

61
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,370
busted can you do a video on this then let us know we'll add another video or two into the course.

62
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,360
So then I'm not gonna fight these guys with guys patrolling make sure you update your patrol routes

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,250
make sure that the world looks lively and alive as you're coming through then as I said before I would

64
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,320
have picked off these guys I probably would have gone and got this sword which I won't have enough damage

65
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,510
on it.

66
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,430
So sir.

67
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:02,940
OK.

68
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,450
SAVAGE I really don't die but enough damage on it so that I can pick off these guys and have a really

69
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,730
good last battle with the last guy so probably another health pumpkin or two along the way so I don't

70
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,350
die but I'm pretty happy with that.

71
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:20,120
I think if I'm making this five minute moment where the player has to figure it out you don't want them

72
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,420
to do it first time.

73
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,570
Oh that was easy done.

74
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,230
And you don't want them to fail miserably.

75
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,950
I've got no idea.

76
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,920
But you know you have to figure out that oh I can pick up that fireball thing here.

77
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,310
Oh I can get the health from there and like I say if I go and duplicate this and put that another one

78
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,140
down in there to so I've got a couple scattered around then the player knows I'm trying to get to the

79
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,470
end.

80
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,310
And when you're giving this to someone else to play what you want to say to them hey trying to make

81
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,760
it all the way through town or whatever your objective is so that they know what they're trying to do.

82
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,520
You don't have to give them all these details you know all you can click on the flower or you can do

83
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,800
these and whatever.

84
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,940
Just tell them enough so that they know what am I trying to do in this game.

85
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,930
And then as I mentioned before the challenge is for you to change your combat moment so it's a fun five

86
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,370
minutes.

87
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,720
As I've been doing here June how many enemies you've got in spots how much damage they do and how much

88
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,040
help the player has chewed it all so you get this really cool five minute moment.

89
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,030
You can show it to people.

90
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,540
It looks good and it plays good.

91
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,060
So that concludes ask creating our five minute moment.

92
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,830
I'd love to see what you come up with and I'll see you in an upcoming lecture.
