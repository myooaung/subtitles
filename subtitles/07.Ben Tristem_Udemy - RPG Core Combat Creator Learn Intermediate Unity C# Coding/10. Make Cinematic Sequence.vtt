00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.030
Hello again in this video really cool.

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.270
We're gonna be creating a cinematic sequence where I'm just pushing play.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:16.170
We can go from camera to camera follow the guards as they walk around and use a dolly track to swing

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.300
around a guy at the end and then back to the player.

5
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.010
Let's jump in and get started okay.

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.650
Let's start with a little bit of structure I'm gonna go into my game folder right click and create a

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.430
new folder which I will call cinematics for all things cinematic related.

8
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:39.600
Also within my hierarchy and a right click Create empty and I will call this likewise cameras or cinematics.

9
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:47.440
I call this cinematics as well cinematics just reset and transforms us right in the middle.

10
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.770
Okay.

11
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.250
So we have our cinematics game objective and cinematics folder.

12
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.810
Next I'm going to click on my follow camera and just change the priority here to 100.

13
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.950
That should mean that when we're playing the game this camera has the highest priority over everything

14
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.250
else.

15
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.020
Now if we had cameras that we wanted to dynamically switch between and have the snow machine brain figure

16
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.330
out should it be this one or should it be that one then you can use the priority system to give a waiting

17
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.640
to that sort of camera.

18
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.320
But for now this is just a way of me saying this when I click the play button I really want to make

19
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.960
sure that this is the camera that is going to be used.

20
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.420
The follow camera that is now next I'm going to figure out where I want to have some virtual cameras

21
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.810
during my cut scene or my cinematic moments I'm running in I'm triggering the moment here.

22
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.540
I want to show a couple of things I probably want to show.

23
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.590
Let's see this God this God in the middle I think and I want to show this god over in the side and probably

24
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.400
some sort of interesting reveal of the final guy that would have the he's how to exit the scene right

25
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.840
next to him will exit the moment.

26
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.430
Okay.

27
00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:00.000
So I'm going to hop over here near this guy create myself a new snow machine create virtual camera will

28
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.590
drop that into the same if we double click on it where have you put that camera.

29
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.540
Just give it a wiggle around and rename this I'll leave the C.M. because that's the convention that

30
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.480
snow machine puts in there I'm going to rename it to reveal one that's the reveal camera one.

31
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.070
And if I click on the solo button here I can see in the game window where it's currently pointing not

32
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.170
in the best spot that allows me to move it around a little bit find where this god is had a little bit

33
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.760
of a think about how close I want it to be to this God and he's going to be wandering around doing his

34
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.190
patrol which is cool so I'm going to puppet just here and in terms of what I want it to be doing I want

35
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.640
it to be looking at this guy here.

36
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.550
So what.

37
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.630
Who is this guy.

38
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.720
He is enemy number two.

39
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.540
So I'll click him I see him reveal camera find my look at the selector and enemy number two.

40
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.740
Now again if I click solo I can see it is locked to that guy there which is awesome and if I click on

41
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.430
play while I've selected solo then we can see I have to click solo again in play you can see it's going

42
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.450
to follow him around he's kind of dawdling around that's what my shot is going to look like in game.

43
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.930
Next up we will show this guard over here now what you can do is blend from camera to camera so don't

44
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.620
want do I want to do that do I want to blend from this one it might be a little bit wonky but I'll show

45
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.330
you this from a functionality point of view on a blend from that camera to a camera which would be stationed

46
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.500
just here so pop into the world add myself a senior machine create virtual camera and rename this to

47
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.250
see em reveal to and we'll figure out which guard this one is it's number four.

48
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.860
So I will you know it is drag enemy for into the.

49
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.000
Look at on my reveal too.

50
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.350
And again quick solo here it's pointed.

51
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.470
It's pointed way underground.

52
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.730
So just shuffle it ran a little bit moved down here probably a longer shot off in the distance through

53
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.730
the trees something a little bit dramatic popping around the side of the house.

54
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.980
This is a love scene a machine so once you become a movie directed at you you can have the whole we

55
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.080
can see him around the corner if you wanna have that peeking around the corner feel you can have it

56
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.320
right up close and personal if you want to be getting a little bit of his personality in there.

57
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.440
For now I'm just gonna make it a little bit simple.

58
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.380
What I said was I'm going to have it come around the side here.

59
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.190
So yeah.

60
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.580
Okay.

61
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.900
We'll see how that feels nice and low to the ground.

62
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.020
There we go.

63
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.650
So we have two cameras that's enough for me to show you the next part of this process.

64
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.850
I'm just gonna grab my two cameras and drop them underneath the cinematics game objects so I can open

65
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.400
and close them nice and easily the next thing we're going to do is to create an animation or a sequence

66
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.630
using these cameras.

67
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.980
So gonna head up to window sequencing and timeline.

68
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.150
I'm going to drag for me the timeline down here next to my animation windows and you can see it's empty

69
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.040
at the moment it's asking us to click to create a direct component.

70
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.210
Now first of all what I want to do is create a game object.

71
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.110
So underneath cinematics right click Create empty and I will name this.

72
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:16.000
Our intro sequence just to be clear that this is the cinematic which is happening when we first run

73
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.740
into our level we can have a ton of these if we want but this is just our intro sequence and within

74
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.230
our intro sequence while clicked on that.

75
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:30.340
Now when I click Create it's gonna allow us to create a playable director on a save this in my cinematics

76
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.800
folder that we created earlier intro sequence timeline that looks good.

77
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.860
And now we have a sequence in our timeline timeline is just like when we're using our animation system.

78
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.900
It has a sequence things that starts from zero and goes for a certain amount of time or a set amount

79
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.130
of frames.

80
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.170
Now what do I want to be sequencing.

81
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.070
I might be using the word sequencing and animating into dependency here.

82
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.300
For me I kind of mentally think of it as on animating stuff but technically we're sequencing it.

83
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.590
I'm going to grab my first camera drag it down over to the right hand side in this gray area.

84
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:13.390
This pain Ed clip with snow machine track it's placed my camera onto the sequence so it's placed a track

85
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.950
that has that particular camera but we don't have a scene a machine brain at the moments on a click

86
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.970
my selector.

87
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.360
We only have one scene a machine brain which is on the camera double click on that.

88
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.170
Now we know what's controlling it so now we are able to see.

89
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.120
So we need that brain to be at it.

90
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.100
Do our to actually show this clip.

91
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.660
So I can pop that down to the front.

92
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.560
Reduce the time a little bit.

93
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.830
Next up I'm going to grab my other reveal camera.

94
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:44.230
So while still clicked on intro sequence I'm going to grab and drag real camera to put it on the track.

95
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.950
Just drag it to make a little bit shorter as well.

96
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.690
Now when I drag it over the top of the first one you can see that it's creating this line here which

97
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.240
is a blend between the two.

98
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.500
Which allows us to as I was mentioning before we can go from the first camera.

99
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.220
And then I can transition into the second camera which I think is really awesome as time.

100
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.710
Number five I've said that this is awesome.

101
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.520
Now if I click on play pop it's going to go from one camera to the other.

102
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.190
If I want to see how this looks with the guys walking around I'm going to have to click on play and

103
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.540
while clicked on play I can then have my sequence playing and you can see a little bit of that is showing

104
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.710
these two gods.

105
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.570
So first one.

106
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.720
And second one.

107
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.950
Now if I want to add even more flair to my blending what I can do is just give myself a little bit of

108
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.780
space grab the following camera drag that onto the track as well it's going to put it at the back just

109
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:45.490
tidied up so it's nice and small drag that to the very front of my cinematic moment and then you can

110
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:50.520
see we're gonna have a blend from the player into my first camera.

111
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.540
That's a little bit too quickly of a blend click of a blend of scrolling in a little bit you can grab

112
00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.460
the handle between the two and make that a longer transition.

113
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.270
So then we run run run run run with our follow camera and then it will swoop quickly go over to this

114
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.550
other camera do what it needs to do quickly go to that other camera and then if and when we want to

115
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:17.220
return back to the player we can snap back to the player or we could do another blend transition to

116
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.000
that camera.

117
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.950
Some pretty happy with that.

118
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.540
We've got one more thing I'd like to do in here and that is create a camera that circles round this

119
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.310
big bad dude at the end.

120
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.210
That kind of effort to simulate this kind of does a bit of a.

121
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.340
Here he is and then looks back into town to kind of show what he is saying now the way we're going to

122
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.110
do this is with a dolly track.

123
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.310
So over in cinematics I'm going to go to senior machine.

124
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:41.900
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:42.720
Create Dolly.

126
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.220
Camera with track.

127
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.610
That will add into the scene a virtual camera and a dolly track.

128
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.560
Dolly track is like a roller coaster track if you will that our camera can move along.

129
00:08:51.760 --> 00:09:00.350
I'm going to rename Sam the cam one to be Dolly one and then my dolly track one that's cool as it is

130
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.780
just changed the ordering in the hierarchy.

131
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.260
Okay.

132
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.340
Nice and good.

133
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.960
Now if we click on dolly track this is where we have a bunch of waypoints that we can be adding If I

134
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.350
click plus that will add our first waypoint into the scene.

135
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:21.630
And this is where I can have the start of my track and I started down here in front of the tough enemy.

136
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:28.710
Now if I click plus again we have a second waypoint and it move this one down probably over here.

137
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.090
Go Be careful I'm not going to get stuck on all these trees but I have to get close and personal with

138
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:34.400
the guy.

139
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:39.960
They're not going to create a another waypoint that will put it down the end which should allow me to

140
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.150
be loops that allow me to look back down my village to where the player is going to run up.

141
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.320
Now what do we need to do.

142
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.560
Well first of all let's click on dolly track 1 Have a look at what's going on here.

143
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.840
Make the width of my rail a little bit wider not because it changes gameplay just makes it easier for

144
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.960
me to see from a distance what's going on.

145
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.860
You can change the color over of it if you want it if you want to have a different color for your track.

146
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.890
I'm just going to leave it as the green that it was that is cool.

147
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.960
Now that's the track it's going to be that virtual camera that will be moving along the track.

148
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.330
There's a few ways to do this.

149
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.740
We've created three waypoints waypoint zero waypoint one waypoint 2.

150
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:23.190
Now if we in the body of my daily virtual camera if I was to select path units then we can move from

151
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:28.590
path zero which would be the first waypoint to path one which would be the next one to Path 2 which

152
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.140
will be the final one or any point in between.

153
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:37.980
So one point five would be from this middle waypoint to the end waypoint halfway in between that's path

154
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:43.860
units or by distance you can see if we click back on our daily track it has a distance or a path length

155
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.130
of twenty one.

156
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:52.200
So that allows us to say if we're moving our camera and click back on the camera now moving by distance

157
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.420
then it can be moved.

158
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:58.160
You can see maybe on my screen here the camera is moving along to simulate that.

159
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.600
It is moving actually click on the solar button.

160
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:07.200
So we'll see through this camera we can move by scrubbing along here it's going to move by distance.

161
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.420
The other thing we can do is set this by normalize which is what I'm going to use which says the start

162
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.740
of your rail is zero.

163
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.800
The end of your rail is one.

164
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:21.510
And it will be smoothly calculated the whole way through out from zero to one.

165
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:28.080
So if I was to put my camera at point five that is going to be right in the middle of my rail from start

166
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.250
to end.

167
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.820
The other thing I want to do in here is look at this enemy as we go zinging past.

168
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.730
So as we've done before click the look at select.

169
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.730
And I know the enemy's cold tough enemy.

170
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.740
Double click.

171
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.200
So as we go flying past we're gonna be looking at that tough enemy.

172
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.670
Let's just simulate how that's going to look but the proposal he's kind of looking at his feet a little

173
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.320
bit.

174
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:56.610
So what I might do is click on my dolly track find waypoint number one by clicking just here.

175
00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.620
You can also click on these cameras to see exactly where they are it'll snap to where they are in the

176
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.480
scene and just kind of move it back a little bit maybe move it up a little bit so it's going to be up

177
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.800
and down on our rail which is absolutely what we can do.

178
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.990
Now let's animate that camera.

179
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.430
So as it is if we click on an intro sequence it's going to move this to the top here.

180
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:23.880
So we need to do first is grab our Dolly camera and put that down onto our senior machine track that

181
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.770
tells the Senate machine brain.

182
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.770
At this point of our sequence switch to this camera.

183
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.860
OK.

184
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.210
Boom.

185
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.520
That was switching to that camera.

186
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.050
We can have it transition as we've done before it's a bit of a long transition.

187
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.350
So what I might do is just have it as a cut.

188
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:42.240
Well we don't have any blend between the two so it's going to show that going to this one down the end

189
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.780
and to animate.

190
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.350
So it's not yet animated along the path to do that.

191
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:52.860
I'm going to grab my virtual camera dolly one drag it down to the left hand pain animation track and

192
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.990
you'll see there's an animation track with that camera in there.

193
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.810
I could have gone clicked on add an animation track.

194
00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.260
That's another way to do that.

195
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.280
Now within here what is it that we want to animate.

196
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.950
Well we're animating our camera.

197
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.040
We're animating it along our path positions.

198
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:11.660
So from zero to one just put that back to zero from zero to one is what we want to be animating.

199
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:17.430
So clicking on our intro sequence I'm going to go to the end of where I want this animation to take

200
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:25.500
place click record and then find our Dolly camera changed the path position to one which will be the

201
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:32.580
end of its journey scroll my slider to the start of the journey change the path position to zero hit

202
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:40.250
Enter unclear record and then now as we hit play room we slide around that character.

203
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.020
So let's have a look from start to finish.

204
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.320
We start off with our follow camera probably a little bit too long I'm just gonna trim that up a little

205
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.860
bit as we go.

206
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.910
So it's going on there.

207
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.680
Move to this first guy.

208
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:57.600
More of a lengthy reveal can highlight a couple of things and then move them all along a phone and drag

209
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.120
them all out highlight the next two.

210
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.530
Move them along.

211
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.670
Just to make everything a little bit longer and have this overlap.

212
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.130
Maybe that delay down a bit further just tidying things up a little bit.

213
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.370
OK so now I'm going to hit spacebar as we scroll through.

214
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:18.230
He's gonna be walking around swing over this guy he's gonna be walking around and then swing to the

215
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.230
last guy.

216
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.510
Okay.

217
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.080
You can see I've broken my animation here which is cool let's go through how to troubleshoot that.

218
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.810
I've moved these guys but I didn't move the animation.

219
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.030
How do we do that clicking on it doesn't seem to work.

220
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.860
So what I need to do is double click on that and that will take me into the animation window.

221
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:39.260
Now I've got a really interesting issue here where the scale looks like it's in seconds on within my

222
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.110
animation but on timeline it looks like it's within frames.

223
00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.710
So I want to get consistency there I'm going to right click on the cog while in my timeline and change

224
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.300
these two seconds.

225
00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:55.430
Now should be in seconds and I can scroll all the way up to where my daily camera should be doing daily

226
00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:05.760
camera stuff that is holding my left mouse button 623 up until 7 43 so so over on my animation described

227
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.190
a little bit.

228
00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:12.880
Grab the two key frames move them both up to starting at what is at six twenty three six twenty three

229
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.670
six 24 ish.

230
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:14.600
Yeah okay.

231
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:21.200
So now my animation is working because we're able to move that I just need to make my camera a little

232
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.820
bit longer here.

233
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:23.810
Hold on that guy.

234
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.910
So from start to finish one more time make sure everything's working that guy that guy swing around

235
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:35.480
there and then our animation adds looking pretty good and then snaps back to the player because we don't

236
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.850
really want it to fly through the entire world from there back to our player.

237
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:45.260
Okay so that is my somewhat rough and ready cinematic sequence created my challenge for you is to make

238
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.190
your own cinematic sequence I'm sure you've been doing this as you've been going along with me but I

239
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:54.110
want you to stamp your own mark on it create a playable director which you've probably done at at least

240
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.300
two virtual cameras.

241
00:15:55.310 --> 00:16:01.580
You can add as many as you want and use at least one dolly track if you will June till you're happy

242
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.090
with it.

243
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:07.010
And then if you're able to please share with us create a video of your cinematic moment and share with

244
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.170
us so we can see what corners you've come up with.

245
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.270
Champion take that on now when you're done.

246
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.790
I will see you in the next video.
