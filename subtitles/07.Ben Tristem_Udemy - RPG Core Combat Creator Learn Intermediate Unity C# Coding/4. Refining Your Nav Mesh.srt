1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,750
In this video we're gonna make sure we know how nav mesh works by looking at the different values that

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,150
we can change and setting up a little scenario where we implement a nav mesh obstacle.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,600
We change our buildings to static.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,580
We have some trees.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,250
We have the player effortlessly figure out how to Pathfinder through the obstacles and up a slope to

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,060
get to the target.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,400
So let's jump in and more deeply understand our nav mesh.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,340
To start with a quick reminder that one of the best places to get information is the unity documentation

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,050
and I'm showing you here the advance nav mesh base settings which we'll be talking about a bit in this

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:36,680
video.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,970
It's a great place to go to read if you have if I've said something that you haven't quite understood

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,120
or you want just more depth to what we're talking about.

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:47,810
This is the best place to go to for pretty much anything if you go into Google and search for unity

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:54,410
docs and then whatever it is you're interested in for example nav mesh obstacle.

15
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:00,380
We're going to be talking about in this video a little bit then unity docs unity manual nav mesh obstacle

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,340
find that there and then it gives you a whole bunch of information on that so obviously you can surf

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,640
around through here through the the navigation system within the unity manual but just such a rich rich

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,580
place to get information is in the unity docs and many lectures I will give you links to the topics

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,760
we've been talking about.

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,810
I'll give you the link to the unity Doc against the lecture.

21
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,120
Just something to have a look out for.

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,620
But pretty sure you know how to use google to search for yourself if you can't find a link for me.

23
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,590
Okay so let's have a look at our NAV mesh.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,710
I'm going to click on my terrain and then navigation and you can see we've got the bits of blue we've

25
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,600
got jagged edges and we've got bits where the blue is not there.

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,760
So let's talk about that.

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,320
If you click on the bake button you can see a couple of values.

28
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:49,710
The agent radius which is literally how close or how far the nav mesh is to the obstacles in your world.

29
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,890
So if we make this really high but probably like that re bake then you can see the distance from our

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,240
obstacles is quite massive it makes this kind of odd little shape in the middle here.

31
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,370
I put it back down to just control undo if I put it to say point 1.

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,310
That's control Z not control undo There's no undo button if you click back on it's at point 1 then you

33
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,440
should see it's gonna take a little bit of time and then you can see when we can look at our building

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,030
it's really really close.

35
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,680
Which means that our player is probably gonna call it a little bit into the building so we want to have

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,000
something since we play around with it wait until you have your character actually complete so you can

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,460
see how fat your character is and how wide the arms are so it doesn't actually look like it's walking

38
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,950
through the building so it makes sense.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,320
Okay.

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,690
Now why is it that these buildings have the nerve mesh correctly calculated but these buildings do not.

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,640
It's because these buildings have been flagged as static so click on Inspector click on the building

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,350
you can see up in the very top right corner of the Inspector there's a tick tick box against static

43
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,090
if you click on the little pull down next to the words static you can see these are the things that

44
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,820
can or cannot be static or you can turn on and off static so navigation static is the one we're interested

45
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,490
in but usually it's holistically everything's static or nothing static seeing like on nothing and then

46
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,500
none of these things will be static sorry.

47
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,710
Or you can click on everything and it's all static and things like lighting and what else we got in

48
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:21,810
here patching and reflection promos of these we don't even need to worry about at all but static means

49
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,950
it's not moving.

50
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:30,540
It means we just want it to be a static not moving blob in the world and that way the never net navigation

51
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,780
mesh will say well it's never going to move so I can bake it into the navigation mesh so these ones

52
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,360
here this building you can see that static is not clicked on so it's going to click on that.

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,590
That's one way to do it and then back to my navigation window click on bake and then you can see around

54
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,050
here we have our navigation mesh he's taking that into consideration and we can't walk in this bit just

55
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,700
in here.

56
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,230
Interesting little artifact on the top which I'll talk about in a moment.

57
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,740
Now if you wanna make sure that all of your objects are static click on all of the things that we need

58
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,430
to have static and don't don't I'm just hung now control while I click through these.

59
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,510
So I think all of my world assets then I can back on the inspector.

60
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,440
You can see how it's got next to static here it's it's got this little dash which means some things

61
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,650
are static and some are not to click that so it's a tick and now everything should be static back over

62
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,680
to navigation when we click on break all of these including the trees will have a appropriate navigation

63
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,220
mesh calculation been made to it.

64
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,820
Awesome.

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,740
And the other couple of things I wanted to show you in this video you can see over here on my mountain

66
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:43,060
that we have some navigation mesh and some not navigation mesh and that's changed by the slope.

67
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,680
So you see here the maximum slope.

68
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,230
And as I move this the little angle indicator he goes up and down have it really low.

69
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:55,680
It means that only very gentle slopes can be worked up so if I bake this all of this mountain you can't

70
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,740
walk up it because it's too steep for the player.

71
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,750
I couldn't possibly walk up that hill if you put it all the way up to maximum then you can nearly walk

72
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,830
up the side of a cliff.

73
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:11,490
So most of these particularly this one over here you can see it is now walkable despite the fact it's

74
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,050
pretty steep.

75
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:18,900
I put it back to 45 and then back again you can see part of that there is too steep for the player to

76
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,250
walk up you're going to advanced a couple of settings in here.

77
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,950
The voxel size is just going to show how detailed things are.

78
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,810
And you don't play around with it too much but basically the more voxel as per agent radios the more

79
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,420
fidelity the more finesse you had to so free.

80
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,290
It's currently set to a default.

81
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,520
If you click on the manual voxel size the higher the number here the less fidelity we have.

82
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,490
So if I put that to one you can see here it's now showing point five voxel per agent radius based on

83
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,740
that and it makes everything just a little bit more macro which is not too bad in a way I think it simplifies

84
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,490
it a lot.

85
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,380
It's it's saying here's a nice big smooth edge when we're having lots of little fiddly diddly bits but

86
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,470
if you want to have more and more fidelity like over here for instance now if we try to walk there the

87
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:14,900
player could not make that if I put my target over this side of the building and I put my player where

88
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,170
are you player put my player over here.

89
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,340
You can see when I click on play.

90
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,280
Hopefully it'll show up on the camera might have to click back to scene view.

91
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,540
Yep.

92
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,950
It's gonna go the whole way around the house because it can't get through this bit here.

93
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:35,410
But if I change my voxel size back to the point one or so that it was actually a point one 555 so point

94
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,030
1 7 7 7 I think it was looks pretty good.

95
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,780
And then click bake.

96
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:47,890
Now you can see that there is a path there because of the fidelity of our vessels per agent radius and

97
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,930
then the other important thing in here you can see we've got these weeds sort of on top of our buildings

98
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,890
that's because there's a flat part that the player could potentially walk on but you can see there's

99
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,340
no way to get up there and we don't want to have any sort of weird accidental clicking on the top of

100
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:07,510
the building and what's happening there is that it's saying that the the space is large enough for us

101
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,490
to have a region.

102
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,930
So the minimum region.

103
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,270
So the minimum region is smaller than whatever this region here is.

104
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,850
So if I put this up to 10 and bake we'll see how that goes.

105
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,420
Then it gets rid of that as saying whatever size this was was too small to have nav mesh on top of it

106
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,610
can they see some other areas like on the top of this hill over here house put up say 30 as the minimum

107
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,460
region back again then that is no longer there.

108
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,610
That was too small an area and generally if you've got a world that's mostly continuous then you're

109
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,440
not going to have any problems having a pretty high minimum region area but it'll cut out some of those

110
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,450
just little fiddly like if there a little bit of a spot in there that was okay and a little bit of a

111
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,690
spot in there it'll cut those out just kind of makes it a little bit cleaner.

112
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,010
So I gotta put this back to say 20 I think that's not too bad and then re bake.

113
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,420
Okay.

114
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:01,180
There's another thing that's really super interesting if you see my box just here it is currently when

115
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,140
we click on inspect it it's currently flagged as static.

116
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,410
But what if I wanted my box to move.

117
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,490
So what if I wanted to as the player walk through a trigger volume down here the box I don't know falls

118
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,540
off the roof and lands in the way of the player in the player then has to go random or the enemies have

119
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,640
to run around it.

120
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,940
So I'm going to click off static because it's no longer static.

121
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,750
If I was to rebate my nav may she could see that it wouldn't impact the nav mesh because it doesn't

122
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,690
think it's something that is is statically baked into the scene.

123
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:37,690
And if I go onto Mike Craig click on my quite add component and add a nav mesh obstacle.

124
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:45,190
This one's really cool nav mesh obstacle and click on the carve carve means that it will carve a chunk

125
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,800
out of the nav mesh.

126
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,360
I've clicked on carve and go back to navigation doing you have to click on bait.

127
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:57,100
You can see that as I move this around underneath the crate there's gonna be a gap in the nav mesh.

128
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,530
So this is an area that if I was to say you know what I want to have the crate there the play is going

129
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,480
to avoid that.

130
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,930
You know I'm going to have it here let's make it dramatic size this by having it even bigger so we can

131
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:14,510
see this effect as I move it around so I move it to there and then move my target all the way over to

132
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,900
here.

133
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,120
Click on Play this through this dynamically back into scene I get going around that way.

134
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,730
Now you can look which while you're trying to go see how the player is readjusting where it's trying

135
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,590
to get to.

136
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,160
As I move that nav mesh obstacle which is really fun and really cool.

137
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,210
Lots of great stuff that you can do that.

138
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:37,390
So speaking lots of great stuff let's create an interesting pass I want you to double the speed of your

139
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,910
player if you can remember how to do that create a path where the player walks around a static object

140
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,620
avoids another mesh obstacle that you've placed in its path you can move it around and manually if you

141
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,930
want to be sneaky to walk through a clump of trees to make sure that we've got the Fidelity right and

142
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,380
to walk up a hill to make sure that your slope setting is as you want it.

143
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,000
So just take a couple of minutes to play around with your sandbox to set that up and I'll see you back

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,080
here when you done OK.

145
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,470
Move our target over somewhere where we've just put on the navigation.

146
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,190
OK.

147
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,620
I do want to change the slope of that hill there.

148
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,610
I'll put it just here.

149
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,550
This is a good one.

150
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,460
See what happens if we've got those two little weed navigation bits here.

151
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,920
That one's obviously too steep and that's too steep as well.

152
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,490
Cool.

153
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,080
I could fiddle around my voxel size to get rid of those but I want to see how the play goes when we've

154
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,720
got a little bit of difficult situation for it.

155
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,380
He's so moved the house there go through the trees.

156
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,330
This is cool.

157
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,900
Another tree just there.

158
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,950
Maybe give the tree to make one more.

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And remember always we need to go back to base click on bake again.

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,610
Great.

161
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,540
Now let's see.

162
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,920
Actually I'll change the camera.

163
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,940
Change the camera.

164
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,490
So find the camera.

165
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,720
Main camera.

166
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,220
Game Object align with view.

167
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,460
And I mentioned doubling our speed so I'm going to click on my player back a bit Inspector scroll down

168
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,160
to nav mesh.

169
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,310
Agent change the speed to seven you can make yours whatever you want.

170
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,390
I'm making mine seven.

171
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,670
Click on play.

172
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,220
You should walk through the trees.

173
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,520
Yep.

174
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,490
Around that box they're just out effortlessly through the trees and up the slope to the target that

175
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,750
we got.

176
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,190
So we've got our nav mesh.

177
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,340
I'm pretty happy with this.

178
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,300
We'll have to do some fine tuning when we have our enemies in there and when we have a whole bunch more

179
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:18,930
obstacles.

180
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,120
But for now I think we've gone through nav mesh enough it's time to get to the next type of functionality

181
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,660
where we can click and move our player.

182
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,710
So great work in this video and I'll see you again soon.
