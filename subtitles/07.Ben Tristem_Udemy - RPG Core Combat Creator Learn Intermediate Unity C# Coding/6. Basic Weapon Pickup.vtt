00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.260
This is an exciting lecture because we can run over pick ups like this blowing and give our player with

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.830
an pick up which we could do for any sort of weapon our heart desires in the middle of the video.

3
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.170
You'll see me make a big old mistake and then take ages to try to figure out what's going on.

4
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.900
Maybe you'll figure it out before I do that just a little warning to see if you've got you thinking

5
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.620
hats on.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.540
See if you can figure out what Rick does wrong before Rick does it wrong.

7
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.720
Okay let's jump in and get started.

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.900
Okay let's start by going through what we're doing in this video in terms of picking up and equipping

9
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.580
weapons.

10
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.710
We need to expose equipping as a public method.

11
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.020
We need to differentiate the concept of default weapon or starting weapon with that of current weapons

12
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.470
so that we can be cycling through current weapon as we pick up our pick ups.

13
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.320
We need to create a weapon pick up and we need to update the player's weapon in their hand using the

14
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.790
pick ups weapon type.

15
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.950
So first things first let's go open up our fighter script.

16
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.390
I'm gonna give you a few questions just a little quiz.

17
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.880
One of those pop quiz time.

18
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.550
So the first thing first question I've got for you is where is our fighter class.

19
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.900
Would we need to change from private to public.

20
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.860
A method that will equip our weapon I to scroll through the fighter class.

21
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.890
Have a look see if you can figure out where that is.

22
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.690
What part of this do we need to change to make public.

23
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.040
OK.

24
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.890
So if you've gone through and looked at you probably see that spawn weapon this is where we're creating

25
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.390
the weapon.

26
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.010
We need to change his name is no longer spawning weapon is it.

27
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.990
It's equipping weapon the spawning is actually taken care of in the weapon class.

28
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:44.080
So let's rename spawn weapon to equip weapon and change from private to public.

29
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.270
That will allow us on our pick up class which will create shortly to Cole equipped weapon and when we're

30
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.770
equipping the weapon what do we need to do.

31
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.870
What information do we need when something publicly calls equip weapon.

32
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.390
We need to know the weapon types of weapon weapon and let's scroll all the way up to the top of our

33
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.380
class.

34
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.930
So instead of weapon we're going to have a default weapon as the very first weapon that the player starts

35
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.240
with its default weapon is now and then when we're equipping weapon at start we need to pass in what

36
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.670
we pass in default weapon and now Next we need a concept of what the current weapon is.

37
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:27.650
So let's make a new variable which will be our weapon type current weapon and again will initialize

38
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.780
that now.

39
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.200
Okay.

40
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.690
We've taken care of what we do when we equip the weapon at Star.

41
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.650
For a start the game.

42
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.530
What do we need to do what do we need to change here in.

43
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.800
Equipped weapon.

44
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.900
What do we no longer need.

45
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.000
What is no longer relevant and what do we need to add in here for equipped weapon when we no longer

46
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.250
need to protect against.

47
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.230
No because there won't be situations I believe where we don't have any weapon for the player we're going

48
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.050
to have a weapon for sure.

49
00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.160
Now we do need to add an extra line in here just saying what what is the weapon going to equal the current

50
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.250
weapon equals what equals weapon.

51
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.490
The weapon that we've just passed in whenever we call this equipped weapon and now there's two other

52
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.040
places in this script that need a little bit of an update.

53
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.510
Can you figure out where they are and bit of a hint.

54
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.270
Visual Studio is probably telling you where they also see if you can scroll around and figure out what

55
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.580
else we need to update.

56
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.790
OK.

57
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.560
Just scrolling down I can see weapon.

58
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.500
We no longer have weapon we have what current weapon and similarly just below here.

59
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.460
We don't need a weapon we need current weapon because we've updated that.

60
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.850
OK.

61
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.300
Just a little bit of a refactor they're trying to make it a little bit more interactive and a bit more

62
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.840
interesting for you on a refactor that can sometimes be a little bit dull.

63
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.640
OK.

64
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.900
Here's another little pop quiz for you see if you can figure out how to add a game object into our world

65
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.800
that we can use as our weapon pick up OK.

66
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.560
Where do we start.

67
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.720
Well the first thing I'm going to do is create a pickup folder.

68
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.140
Doesn't have to be the first place you start but I'm going to start here.

69
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.490
Pick up pick ups pick ups folder.

70
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.070
Okay.

71
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.970
Then just in terms of organization I'm going to right click Create something call this pick ups so that

72
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.670
I can put all of my pick ups in this one spot.

73
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.220
Then underneath that right click and create another empty I call this my.

74
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.010
Or call it a sword pick up okeydokey.

75
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.490
Got a sword pick up here.

76
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.280
I got a prefab this sword pick up by dragging it down into my pickups photo a double click on sword

77
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.070
pick up from within here I want to actually put a sword in here so let's scroll around where do we find

78
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.720
our sword under prefabs all the way down the bottom sword drag that's what's underneath my sword pick

79
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.040
up.

80
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.940
So we now have that prefab in there that we're linking into our sword prefab.

81
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.510
Excellent.

82
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.250
I can't see it at the moment on click f oh that zoomed us in nicely.

83
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.320
I think I'm going to want to make it bigger.

84
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.160
So let me just for now make these two two and two.

85
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.530
OK.

86
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.660
I think I want to add my sword laying down and maybe stepping out of the ground now I'll have it laying

87
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.070
down.

88
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:10.450
So it's gonna change on my sword here I'm going to rotate it says lying flat will make it minus 90 blink

89
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.320
and then in our game it's kind of disappeared because underground that's fine.

90
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.610
Looks a good size jump back out of now sword pick up prefab and move it around so it's in a spot where

91
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.150
we can actually see it manipulate it is pretty huge.

92
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.840
Now we're going to jump back in.

93
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:33.090
Change my size a little bit on the y axis I going to make one point five.

94
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.490
Okay.

95
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.670
Thanks a little bit smaller I think that looks okay for now.

96
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.780
Now well in sword pick up what else we need to have on here well we need to have some sort of collision

97
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.380
so we know to pick it up I'm going to do a sphere collider I think vehicle lighter that looks like it's

98
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.330
okay it's placed it down the handle pivot so I need to make it a little bit bigger were probably about

99
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.290
Yeah maybe.

100
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.800
And then just slide it around so it's

101
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.100
in the middle of the sword.

102
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.500
Okay.

103
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.160
I think that's it.

104
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.660
When I run over that is gonna be good looking sharp as far as pickups go.

105
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.980
Okay.

106
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.690
What's the next thing we need to do with our pickup.

107
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.080
Okay we need to add some logic for our pickup.

108
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.400
So while I mean my sword prefab here I'm gonna add a component and I will call this weapon pickup making

109
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.050
a new script new script create an ADD and then while I remember back over into assets now just drag

110
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:34.710
that into the right location with and pick up can go in to need to drill down into combat.

111
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.890
I believe the combat okay.

112
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.970
We're getting really close.

113
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.700
Let's go ahead and open up our new weapon pick up that we've just created.

114
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.880
Oh can you know what I think this is a good time for a challenge actually so let's have a challenge

115
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.490
to create the weapon pick up logic here are the hints for you to use on frigate enter as we do to check

116
00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:00.210
that it is the player that is entering the collision and not say an enemy or something else Cole the

117
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.460
equipped weapon that we've just exposed and pass in the appropriate weapon.

118
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:12.420
So make sure you create a field that we can pass in the weapon and then to destroy the pick up game

119
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.290
object.

120
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.040
Okay so there is your challenge to create a pick up.

121
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.850
Give it your best shot and I'll see you back here when you're done.

122
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.060
I can get rid of all this stuff in here the start and update methods and the first thing we want to

123
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:32.790
do is namespace this I'm going to cut out the information I have here and name space it will be RPG

124
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:40.440
dot combat and within there will paste what we just removed okay weapon pick up model behavior excellent

125
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:47.640
and top of that class I'm going to expose a field serialize field this will be weapon just call it weapon

126
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.920
will initialize that at no and then what do we want to do next.

127
00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:01.530
Well we want to have a hour on trigger enter so on trigger into collider excellent just rearrange my

128
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.970
curly braces great.

129
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.790
So with this other we can find out whether it is the player or not.

130
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:17.060
So if the other dot game object dot what dot tag equals rent what are these talking quotation marks.

131
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.220
We go.

132
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.500
Capital P plan make sure it's a capital pay or else it won't be happy with you and make sure you have

133
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.390
two equal signs not just one.

134
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:25.430
There we go.

135
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.200
If it is the player that's colliding then first of all we want to equip the weapon what do we just create

136
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.330
in here in fighter fighter fighter fighter our way do we equip.

137
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:43.530
Here is a quick weapon and passing in the weapons so we will say other dot get component.

138
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.530
What's the component.

139
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:54.870
It's gonna be the fighter component and recalling equip weapon passing in what was passing in this weapon

140
00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:02.260
that we have serialized and then we want to destroy a just simply this game object.

141
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.900
So in other words whatever this script is attached to.

142
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.380
Okay it looks pretty good.

143
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:15.610
Let's go back over into our sword pick up our sword pick up should have on it the weapon pick up great

144
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:16.730
what sort of weapon do we want.

145
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.920
Well let's have the sword.

146
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.520
There it is right.

147
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.430
They should have all the sword information.

148
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.880
Excellent.

149
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.200
And then we need to make sure I always forget this step is is trigger is clicked on.

150
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.800
That is pretty important when we're making a trigger.

151
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.250
Okay.

152
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.050
Click on play have the player running around as a player starting with a weapon.

153
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.970
No runs over the sword blink.

154
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.910
Nothing happens.

155
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.020
Okay let's investigate.

156
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.210
This is excellent when nothing has happened.

157
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.250
Okay so I've posed a video it's taken some time to figure out what the heck have I done wrong here because

158
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.800
when I run over my sword it won't pick up.

159
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.480
I've gone through and looked at my enemies made sure they're all assigned to an arm and they all have

160
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.960
a weapon type that's not causing a problem.

161
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.530
Make sure that the player has the unarmed as the default weapon.

162
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:01.810
Yep.

163
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.260
The enemies have unarmed as default weapon great.

164
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.220
That's not it.

165
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.320
Have a look at my logic in here for weapon sorry for weapon pickup.

166
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.210
This looks pretty good.

167
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:16.740
If the play is running over it I tested it by putting in a debug line in here and that wasn't coming

168
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.440
up so I know that the issue is the the collision moment isn't even happening.

169
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.290
And then when we look at collision moment not even happening what's important.

170
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.330
While the sword needs to have a trigger.

171
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.650
Yes it does.

172
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.360
What does the player need.

173
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:36.020
The player needs a rigid body and the player didn't have a rigid body so I've gone into character.

174
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:41.440
Open up prefab and just added a rigid body in here rigid body and I've turned off.

175
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.670
Use gravity because we don't need gravity at the moment.

176
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:50.190
So obviously you just click on Add component and add a rigid body which I now have so that when I come

177
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.810
back into the scene here we've got a who took a while for me to figure that out.

178
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.550
That was one of those I went through every other thing before I thought about rigid body and then blink.

179
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:00.210
There we go.

180
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.190
Our planet now run over the sword.

181
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.580
We'll just make sure that we haven't broken the enemy's I can still go over there and click on them

182
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.880
and yet putting bouncing we can have our battle Excellent.

183
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.960
So we've created pick up so we're done in this lecture and I'll see you in upcoming video.
