00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,160
Hello again my friend welcome to the next section of the course in this section we are implementing

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,900
weapons.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,690
Sam has been working his patootie off to get in a whole bunch of really cool basic weaponry for us when

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,130
I run into this next level you can see I've got a sword now.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,210
What's really cool when I run a little bit to the right you'll see what the enemy is doing.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,130
He is shooting an arrow at us which is really cool very exciting.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,960
If I run up to the enemy I've got a different animation for the sword.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,520
Super cool the player can run over pickups and with the pickups we can do things like throw a fireball.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,720
So that's switched my weapon to a fireball which is casting call it a weapon.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,790
In this instance casting a weapon fireball so we can switch between weapons when we run over pickups

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,640
we're not implementing full inventory in this section or even in this part of the course.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,710
For now we want to make sure that we can have different weapons that we just run over on the ground.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,800
Different animations different ways of killing the enemies and different ways of the enemies to hit

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,760
us as well.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,090
So let's jump in and create some weapons for our game.
