00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,790
Hello again my friend in this video we're gonna use Unity's nav mesh system.

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,800
You can see the blue stuff there to have our player move to a target in our scene.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,440
So let's jump in and get started soon we'll set out the functionality where we click to move our player.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,950
But for now we're going to make it a little bit automated and to do that we'll have a target that we

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,080
just make our player walk towards.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,520
So in my scene I'm going to create a new object 3D object.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,160
Make this a sphere and we'll call it Target.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,740
Here we go.

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,350
Target.

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:34,940
Target.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,090
I'm going to move just away from the player some way doesn't really matter have it down at ground level

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,250
so there's no issues that make you a little bit bigger so we can see it nice and easily.

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,010
There we go.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,090
Looks fine.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,730
OK.

16
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:51,320
Next up we want to just make sure that our camera is going to see the action at the moment if we look

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,250
through our camera or is it main camera you can see our view put down here it's looking at now and I

18
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,420
what the ground or something.

19
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,780
If while I'm selected on my camera I move it around you can see that update.

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,070
There's my play I just there the camera is pointing at the player.

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,150
So what I'll do is get my scene view in a spot where I like it so I'm in the scene tab.

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,380
Just move around a little bit.

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,660
That's where I can see most the action go on.

24
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,660
And then while the main camera is selected got the game object and align with view means that the camera

25
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,350
will be moved so that we see exactly what I see in my scene view here.

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,550
So when I rotate around a little bit you can see that my camera's now being moved to that spot where

27
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,140
I was looking at just a second ago.

28
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,620
This is what we see in our camera when we click play on the game.

29
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,040
OK.

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,610
Now for the most important part of this video we need a nav mesh so go to window find a I and open up

31
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,400
navigation in here we've got four tabs mostly we're going to focus on the bike tab for the moment and

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,750
if we have a look in our scene look at your terrain and your buildings and stuff.

33
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,600
When you click the bike tab take a moment and then a lot of the place turns blue this blue stuff is

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,610
our navigation mesh.

35
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:05,060
This is where our navigation agent is going to walk and say I can walk here and walk here I'm not walk

36
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,680
there and you can see I'll explain this in the next video we'll go into a little bit more depth on how

37
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,810
to fine tune and control and what's going on but you can see here there's this line around my building

38
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,800
that says well the player can't walk through there there's no navigation mesh so we're not going about

39
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,350
a walk into that particular area.

40
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,850
Similarly we can't walk on the side of the mountains because there is no navigation mesh there.

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,030
So this is a way for the player to say Okay where can I go I can walk anywhere on the blue I have to

42
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,880
avoid spots where there is no blue.

43
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:40,190
And for this particular lecture we're going to say let's just walk from here to the target point on

44
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,360
the map at any point in time you can just click rebate again so if I clear it all goes away.

45
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,780
And then there is no navigation mesh at the moment if I click bike then it just rebates it again.

46
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,010
And as we tweak and tune stuff in the next video you'll see that slight changes take place in our navigation

47
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,940
mesh.

48
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,650
The other thing we need to do is click on our player.

49
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,680
Back to inspect.

50
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,380
Make sure you not so accidentally clicked on the navigation tab.

51
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,160
And we're going to add a new component so click on Add component and type in nav mesh.

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,960
Agent C.C. nav mesh agent click to add that nav mesh agent has a bunch of different cool stuff speed

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,260
angular speed acceleration etc..

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,360
This is what's driving the game object that the nav mesh agent has been placed on.

55
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,710
So we now have our player with a nav mesh agent that's going to move it and it's going to move it where

56
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,950
you guessed it it's going to move it along the nav mesh and we're going to do that as a challenge.

57
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:39,080
And this is a challenge where I think if you know this stuff then it should be a good meaty challenge.

58
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,660
If you don't know this stuff I'm going to give you a couple of hints.

59
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,010
So they should be out of figured out.

60
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:50,120
So what I'd like you to do is create a mover dot see script and attach that to the player and then to

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:58,100
serialize within this script serialize a transform target variable that we can assign our target game

62
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:05,450
object to and then within the Update method you can have one line where we want to get the nav mesh

63
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:13,240
agent component so get component and set its dot destination value as the target's current position.

64
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,530
Okay.

65
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,590
So if you're feeling a little bit advanced that's the challenge.

66
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,890
That's a good intermediate challenge for an intermediate course.

67
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,200
Starting off with something meaty hopefully.

68
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,740
But if you look at that and say I've got no idea.

69
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,730
Not a problem.

70
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,660
Here are the hints.

71
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,470
So if that's enough jump in take on that challenge if you want the hints here they are the hints are

72
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:39,740
the target is currently at Target dot position and we use get component nav mesh agent dot destination.

73
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:47,360
So basically you're assigning the value of target position to the nav mesh agent's destination.

74
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,000
And just as one last clue you may need to add the unity dot a I namespace.

75
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,370
Okay.

76
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,690
Sorry.

77
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,330
There's enough clues in there that you should be out to piece it together pretty straightforwardly.

78
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,220
If not no worries we'll go through it together.

79
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,680
But give it your best shot.

80
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,190
As if you've not been through courses before.

81
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,730
The most important part of our courses is taking on the challenge.

82
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,450
So I implore you whether you think this is really easy or really difficult.

83
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,780
Jump in nonetheless.

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,940
Give it your best shot.

85
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,670
And once you have given it your best shot really thought about it.

86
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,510
I'll see you back here and I'll show you my solution okay.

87
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,880
So I think this is a pretty straightforward script to create.

88
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,110
I will start off by giving myself a script photo to keep ourselves nice and neat so create folder scripts

89
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:38,820
and within my scripts folder I will right click Create C sharp script and call this mover okay mover

90
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,380
while I'm here.

91
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,260
I often forget this step and I feel dumb afterwards I'm going to attach it to grab it and drag it over

92
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,610
onto player so that now is a move a component on the player.

93
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,880
Great double click.

94
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,290
Open up move it this will be our first real time in visual studio code.

95
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,110
Okay.

96
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,670
And you can see how warnings come up again about dot net core debugging.

97
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,890
This is not something we need to worry about so I'm going to x out of this dialogue go over to the settings

98
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,680
which is in the bottom left corner you see the code there click on that scroll up to the settings and

99
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,670
from here while clicked on the settings Tab I'm going to search for C L I that will show me under extensions.

100
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:22,520
So here on the left hander extensions C sharp configuration click on that and then suppress dot net

101
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,980
install warnings so click the checkbox there and our warning should be never more again seen.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,470
Okay.

103
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,060
Closed the settings tab and then back over to move to get rid of the start method just leaving update

104
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:42,740
and at the start of our class I'm going to serialize field serialize field and this will be of type

105
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,640
transform.

106
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,270
This will be called target and then within our update pretty straight forward we're going to say get

107
00:06:50,270 --> 00:07:01,630
component and then in our angle braces it's the nav mesh agent we're getting parentheses dot destination

108
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:10,650
and that equals what it equals target dot position so it's basically saying change the destination for

109
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,410
the nav mesh agent to the target position.

110
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,760
Now we're getting a red squiggly line.

111
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,390
What's that mean.

112
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:20,460
Well usually it means we're missing a namespace that's mouse over it could not be found yet.

113
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,730
So up the top here we're using Unity engine and I know this song is going to be dot a I semicolon.

114
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,490
And then our squiggly line is gone.

115
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,270
Save this up.

116
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,980
Back over into unity.

117
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:37,690
Now we have on our player just checked that we did a sign that I think I even made mention that I often

118
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,150
forgot.

119
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:38,350
Yep.

120
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,610
So a mover is a component on their call.

121
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:48,770
Now we find the target we assign our target bop bop bop bop down into our Target Field.

122
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,890
That means the player should walk to our target.

123
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,070
We've set up our camera.

124
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,380
Yes there it is.

125
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh some nice shadows and everything click on play and there we go walking from a to b point.

126
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,510
Excellent.

127
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:10,010
That's the foundations that's the fundamentals of using the nav mesh and applying an F mesh agent to

128
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,190
move from a certain point to another point in the next video.

129
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,350
We're going to get a little bit more complicated and just play around with obstacles with static and

130
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:25,010
to look at the different variations we can have without nav mesh training so great work in this video.

131
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,360
And I'll see you on the next video.
