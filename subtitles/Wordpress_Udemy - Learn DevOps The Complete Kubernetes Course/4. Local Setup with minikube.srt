Let's set up Kubernetes locally using minikube. Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally.

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,570
Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside Linux VM.

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,440
It's aimed on users, who want to test it out, or use it for development.

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,410
It cannot spin up a production cluster.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,540
It's a one node machine with no high availability.

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,920
Now the good news, it works on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. So, you can use it on your PC whatever you're running.

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,710
You will need visualization software installed to run minikube.

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:46,860
For instance, you can use Virtual Box, which is free and can be downloaded from "http://virtualbox.org".

9
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,980
You can download minikube from this URL, you can just copy paste from the procedure documents,

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,500
or you could just type it on from this video.

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,800
To launch a cluster you just need to enter in a shell in Linux, in a terminal on Mac OS, or in power shell, or CMD in the windows, and minikube starts.

12
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,720
If you are using Windows, you first have to go into the directory where you download minikube and

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,400
then you can start a minikube, with this minikube start command.

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,520
I will show you that in a demo in the next lecture.
