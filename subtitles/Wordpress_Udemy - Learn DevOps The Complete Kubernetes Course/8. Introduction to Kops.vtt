00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.110
In this lecture, I will show you the same setup, but this time on AWS. I'm going to use a tool called kops.

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.790
To set up Kubernetes on AWS.

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.150
You can use a tool called kops.

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.970
Kops stands for Kubernetes Operations.

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.090
The tool allows you to do production great Kubernetes installations, upgrades, and management.

6
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.740
I will use this tool to start a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

7
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.140
There's also a legacy tool called "kube-up.sh".

8
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.620
This was a simple tool to bring up a cluster, but is now deprecated.

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.530
It doesn't create a production ready environment.

10
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:50.740
Kops only works on Mac or Linux, so if you're on Windows, you will need to boot a virtual machine first.

11
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.460
You can use a "Vagrant", just a piece of software, to quickly boot up a Linux box.

12
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.480
You can download "VirtualBox" from "http://virtualbox.org", and "Vagrant" from "http://vagrandup.com".

13
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.530
I guess you will need both virtual box for visualization and vagrants to spin up a new Linux Box.

14
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.780
Once downloaded, to boot up a new Linux VM, just type this in your CMD or power shell.

15
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.230
So, you just look for a tool CMD or power shell in the Windows and you first create a new directory.

16
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.970
We can call it "ubuntu", you "cd" into this directory.

17
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:32.300
You type "Vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64", and then you type in "vagrant up",

18
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.790
and this bring up a new Linux machine, a new ubuntu machine that you can use.

19
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.900
I will show you the details in the next demo, because vagrant works on Linux, Mac, or Windows.
