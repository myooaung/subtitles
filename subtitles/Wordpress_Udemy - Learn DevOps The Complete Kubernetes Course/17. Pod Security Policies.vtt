<v Edward>Pod security policies.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.400  -->  00:00:06.020
Pod security policies enable you
3

3

00:00:06.020  -->  00:00:07.830
to control the security aspects
4

4

00:00:07.830  -->  00:00:10.790
of the pods' creation and updates.
5

5

00:00:10.790  -->  00:00:15.190
For example, you can deny using privileged mode in pods.
6

6

00:00:15.190  -->  00:00:18.189
So if someone then starts a pod using privileged mode,
7

7

00:00:18.189  -->  00:00:20.550
the pod will not be scheduled
8

8

00:00:20.550  -->  00:00:22.960
because it's not allowed to run a pod
9

9

00:00:22.960  -->  00:00:25.150
in privileged mode anymore.
10

10

00:00:25.150  -->  00:00:27.930
You can also control what volumes can be mounted.
11

11

00:00:27.930  -->  00:00:30.510
For example, can it use a config map, a secret
12

12

00:00:30.510  -->  00:00:31.903
or is that denied?
13

13

00:00:32.970  -->  00:00:34.300
And then an interesting one,
14

14

00:00:34.300  -->  00:00:39.110
make sure containers only run within a UID/GID range
15

15

00:00:39.110  -->  00:00:42.780
or make sure that containers cannot run as root.
16

16

00:00:42.780  -->  00:00:45.100
So you can add this extra layer of protection
17

17

00:00:45.100  -->  00:00:49.740
to make sure none of your containers can run as a root.
18

18

00:00:49.740  -->  00:00:52.440
Or then even specify that particular pods
19

19

00:00:52.440  -->  00:00:56.900
have to run within a certain UID/GID range.
20

20

00:00:56.900  -->  00:00:58.860
So UID is the user ID
21

21

00:00:58.860  -->  00:01:01.680
and GID is the group ID.
22

22

00:01:01.680  -->  00:01:03.410
So basically you can influence
23

23

00:01:03.410  -->  00:01:06.950
what user ID and GID in Linux
24

24

00:01:06.950  -->  00:01:09.033
in the container needs to be used.
25

25

00:01:11.240  -->  00:01:14.180
The pod security policy is an admission controller
26

26

00:01:14.180  -->  00:01:16.293
that can be enabled at cluster startup.
27

27

00:01:17.210  -->  00:01:18.730
The pod security admission controller
28

28

00:01:18.730  -->  00:01:22.090
will be invoked at pod creation or modification.
29

29

00:01:22.090  -->  00:01:24.460
So when you create a pod or modify one,
30

30

00:01:24.460  -->  00:01:27.020
then it will check whether you are allowed
31

31

00:01:27.020  -->  00:01:28.430
to run this kind of pod
32

32

00:01:28.430  -->  00:01:30.600
and if not, it will not get scheduled.
33

33

00:01:30.600  -->  00:01:32.570
It will determine whether the pod meets
34

34

00:01:32.570  -->  00:01:34.440
the pod security policy based
35

35

00:01:34.440  -->  00:01:36.000
on the security context defined
36

36

00:01:36.000  -->  00:01:37.940
within the pod specification.
37

37

00:01:37.940  -->  00:01:40.797
So basically if you enable privileged mode,
38

38

00:01:40.797  -->  00:01:42.430
but you're not allowed to use it,
39

39

00:01:42.430  -->  00:01:44.203
the pod will not be scheduled.
40

40

00:01:45.770  -->  00:01:47.720
The pod security policy admission controller
41

41

00:01:47.720  -->  00:01:49.420
is currently not enabled
42

42

00:01:49.420  -->  00:01:52.750
by default in Kubernetes 1.16.
43

43

00:01:52.750  -->  00:01:55.580
It probably will be in the future.
44

44

00:01:55.580  -->  00:01:57.700
In the next demo, I'll show you how to enable it
45

45

00:01:57.700  -->  00:01:59.360
and create a PodSecurityPolicy
46

46

00:01:59.360  -->  00:02:02.200
to implement some extra security controls
47

47

00:02:02.200  -->  00:02:04.483
for new pods that are then created.
48

48

00:02:05.450  -->  00:02:08.664
You'll typically need at least two PodSecurityPolicies.
49

49

00:02:08.664  -->  00:02:12.280
One for the system processes because some of then need
50

50

00:02:12.280  -->  00:02:14.990
to run privileged or as root
51

51

00:02:14.990  -->  00:02:17.070
and then one for the pods users want
52

52

00:02:17.070  -->  00:02:19.140
to schedule which should be tighter
53

53

00:02:19.140  -->  00:02:23.420
than system policies, for example, deny privileged pods.
54

54

00:02:23.420  -->  00:02:25.783
And that I will show you in the next demo.
