00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:01.810
<v Edward>In this demo I'm going to show you</v>
2

2

00:00:01.810  -->  00:00:04.230
the difference between the livenessProbe
3

3

00:00:04.230  -->  00:00:05.663
and the readinessProbe.
4

4

00:00:06.880  -->  00:00:08.760
In the previous lecture I showed you
5

5

00:00:08.760  -->  00:00:10.453
how to use the livenessProbe.
6

6

00:00:11.420  -->  00:00:14.029
Let's have a look at the script again.
7

7

00:00:14.029  -->  00:00:16.930
Helloworld-healthcheck.
8

8

00:00:16.930  -->  00:00:20.750
Here we have the livenessProbe defined
9

9

00:00:20.750  -->  00:00:24.573
and httpGet on slash within the app.
10

10

00:00:25.430  -->  00:00:26.340
Let's have a look
11

11

00:00:27.370  -->  00:00:31.160
between a difference of this check and the other check.
12

12

00:00:31.160  -->  00:00:33.143
If you do kubectl, great,
13

13

00:00:34.230  -->  00:00:36.490
of helloworld-healthcheck
14

14

00:00:36.490  -->  00:00:39.040
and immediately afterwards we do a watch
15

15

00:00:40.176  -->  00:00:42.676
of the pods, kubectl get pods.
16

16

00:00:48.250  -->  00:00:52.380
Then you will see that the pod is immediately ready.
17

17

00:00:52.380  -->  00:00:55.920
So it's now running and it became immediately ready.
18

18

00:00:55.920  -->  00:00:59.210
It didn't wait for any check to perform.
19

19

00:00:59.210  -->  00:01:02.690
So it means it's immediately serving requests.
20

20

00:01:02.690  -->  00:01:05.560
The readinessProbe is different from the livenessProbe
21

21

00:01:05.560  -->  00:01:10.560
because it will first wait until the readinessProbe succeeds
22

22

00:01:10.890  -->  00:01:13.343
and only then it will start serving requests.
23

23

00:01:14.250  -->  00:01:15.480
Let's have a look at
24

24

00:01:17.126  -->  00:01:20.693
the helloworld-liveness-readiness.yml.
25

25

00:01:21.660  -->  00:01:24.430
Here I have also a readinnesProbe.
26

26

00:01:24.430  -->  00:01:27.640
Works exactly in the same way as a livenessProbe
27

27

00:01:27.640  -->  00:01:30.430
to define it in the yaml file.
28

28

00:01:30.430  -->  00:01:32.143
You can also use the httpGet.
29

29

00:01:34.050  -->  00:01:35.140
But the difference is
30

30

00:01:36.560  -->  00:01:39.730
when we do a create of this one
31

31

00:01:39.730  -->  00:01:41.970
and then we do a watch
32

32

00:01:45.820  -->  00:01:48.580
you will see now the container is creating.
33

33

00:01:48.580  -->  00:01:51.540
Now it is running but it's not ready yet.
34

34

00:01:51.540  -->  00:01:53.830
First this initial delay needs to pass.
35

35

00:01:53.830  -->  00:01:56.270
Then the check will be executed once,
36

36

00:01:56.270  -->  00:01:58.250
and only when the check is executed,
37

37

00:01:58.250  -->  00:02:01.960
and they came back successful then the pod will be ready,
38

38

00:02:01.960  -->  00:02:04.093
and it will be ready to serve requests.
39

39

00:02:05.560  -->  00:02:07.410
Only now it is ready.
40

40

00:02:07.410  -->  00:02:09.420
So that's the difference between the liveness
41

41

00:02:09.420  -->  00:02:11.250
and the readinessProbe.
42

42

00:02:11.250  -->  00:02:14.563
So let me show you again this file.
43

43

00:02:16.410  -->  00:02:19.570
So here we have the initialDelaySeconds, 15 seconds,
44

44

00:02:19.570  -->  00:02:22.380
and then the readinessProbe started checking.
45

45

00:02:22.380  -->  00:02:24.960
And only then when it had a success back
46

46

00:02:24.960  -->  00:02:27.820
then the pod was ready and the pod IP
47

47

00:02:27.820  -->  00:02:29.540
is added to the service,
48

48

00:02:29.540  -->  00:02:32.450
and the service will redirect traffic to that pod.
49

49

00:02:32.450  -->  00:02:36.360
If the readinessProbe fails for some reason,
50

50

00:02:36.360  -->  00:02:39.070
then the IP address will also be removed
51

51

00:02:39.070  -->  00:02:42.090
from the service and no traffic will reach this pod
52

52

00:02:42.090  -->  00:02:45.940
until the readinessProbe gives a success again.
53

53

00:02:45.940  -->  00:02:48.460
If used in combination with a livenessProbe
54

54

00:02:48.460  -->  00:02:51.410
and we use the same path then what's gonna happen is
55

55

00:02:51.410  -->  00:02:53.830
it will be removed from the service
56

56

00:02:53.830  -->  00:02:56.160
and the container will be restarted to make sure
57

57

00:02:56.160  -->  00:02:57.710
that the container works again.
58

58

00:02:58.570  -->  00:03:00.090
And a container will be restarted
59

59

00:03:00.090  -->  00:03:01.910
because that's what the livenessProbe does.
60

60

00:03:01.910  -->  00:03:04.823
If the probe fails it will restart the container.
61

61

00:03:06.240  -->  00:03:08.890
So that's it for the liveness and the readinessProbe.
