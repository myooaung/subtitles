00:00:00.350  -->  00:00:02.100
<v Edward>In this lecture I will show you how</v>
2

2

00:00:02.100  -->  00:00:04.053
to create your own helm charts.
3

3

00:00:05.190  -->  00:00:09.500
You can create helm charts to deploy your own applications.
4

4

00:00:09.500  -->  00:00:11.240
It's the recommended way to deploy
5

5

00:00:11.240  -->  00:00:13.143
your application on Kubernetes.
6

6

00:00:14.240  -->  00:00:17.860
Packaging the app using helm, allows you to deploy the app
7

7

00:00:17.860  -->  00:00:21.833
in one command, instead of using kubectl create or apply.
8

8

00:00:23.010  -->  00:00:26.460
Helm allows for upgrades and rollbacks.
9

9

00:00:26.460  -->  00:00:29.223
Your helm chart is also version controlled.
10

10

00:00:30.940  -->  00:00:33.700
To create the files necessary for a new chart, you can enter
11

11

00:00:33.700  -->  00:00:37.870
the commands helm create and then the name of your chart.
12

12

00:00:37.870  -->  00:00:42.400
Here for example, mychart, and this will create a directory
13

13

00:00:42.400  -->  00:00:45.030
called mychart, and in this directory
14

14

00:00:45.030  -->  00:00:47.850
it will create the files that you need.
15

15

00:00:47.850  -->  00:00:51.133
It will create a chart.yaml, values.yaml,
16

16

00:00:52.000  -->  00:00:53.603
and a folder templates.
17

17

00:00:54.930  -->  00:00:57.990
In chart.yaml, you'll find some metadata
18

18

00:00:57.990  -->  00:01:01.040
like the apiVersion, the appVersion, the description,
19

19

00:01:01.040  -->  00:01:03.950
the name of your chart, and the version of your chart.
20

20

00:01:03.950  -->  00:01:07.450
This is just some basic information that you can fill out.
21

21

00:01:07.450  -->  00:01:11.290
The values.yaml contains the values that you want to use
22

22

00:01:11.290  -->  00:01:14.270
in your chart using yaml format.
23

23

00:01:14.270  -->  00:01:17.333
I will show you the default one, in the next demo.
24

24

00:01:18.220  -->  00:01:21.440
The default one is already quite long, and it contains
25

25

00:01:21.440  -->  00:01:25.140
things like the image name, the image tag, that you define
26

26

00:01:25.140  -->  00:01:28.760
in the values.yaml and can then use in the templates.
27

27

00:01:28.760  -->  00:01:31.360
So then let's have a look at the templates folder.
28

28

00:01:31.360  -->  00:01:33.650
In the templates folder, you will find things
29

29

00:01:33.650  -->  00:01:36.520
like deployment.yaml, service.yaml,
30

30

00:01:36.520  -->  00:01:39.600
and those are files that you are familiar with.
31

31

00:01:39.600  -->  00:01:42.210
These are the Kubernetes yaml files,
32

32

00:01:42.210  -->  00:01:44.540
but you can use variables in them.
33

33

00:01:44.540  -->  00:01:47.190
You can use a templating mechanism to create dynamic
34

34

00:01:47.190  -->  00:01:50.706
yaml files, and helm will interpret these, and when you
35

35

00:01:50.706  -->  00:01:55.706
do helm install, it will install these yaml files.
36

36

00:01:56.260  -->  00:01:58.970
In the next demo I will show you a little bit more detail,
37

37

00:01:58.970  -->  00:02:00.650
and then I will also show you
38

38

00:02:00.650  -->  00:02:02.880
an example chart that I've created.
