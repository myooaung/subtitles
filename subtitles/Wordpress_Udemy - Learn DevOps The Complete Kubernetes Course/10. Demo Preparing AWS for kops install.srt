1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,000
<v Instructor>So you can go to github.com/kubernetes/kops</v>
2

2

00:00:05,015  -->  00:00:09,807
here there is downloaded the latest release
3

3

00:00:09,807  -->  00:00:14,807
and you can download the kops-linux-amd64.
4

4

00:00:17,384  -->  00:00:19,140
Copy link address
5

5

00:00:20,480  -->  00:00:24,755
and then I can download this
6

6

00:00:24,755  -->  00:00:29,755
kops-linux-amd64 to this machine.
7

7

00:00:29,760  -->  00:00:34,760
This is downloaded, I can do change mod kops-linux-amd64,
8

8

00:00:35,965  -->  00:00:39,226
plus executable flag, so that I can execute it,
9

9

00:00:39,226  -->  00:00:43,076
and I can move this to /usr/local/bin,
10

10

00:00:43,076  -->  00:00:45,775
I have to use a sudo.
11

11

00:00:45,775  -->  00:00:50,034
And then I'm going to download python-pip
12

12

00:00:50,034  -->  00:00:54,720
because python-pip will allow me to install AWS,
13

13

00:00:54,720  -->  00:00:57,347
the AWS command line utility, which I will also need
14

14

00:00:57,347  -->  00:01:00,467
before I can set up this cluster on AWS.
15

15

00:01:01,625  -->  00:01:06,567
So, this is installed, so I should be able to do pip install
16

16

00:01:06,567  -->  00:01:10,033
aws command line utility.
17

17

00:01:12,640  -->  00:01:14,760
And this is gonna give me the command line utility
18

18

00:01:14,760  -->  00:01:17,853
called aws, that I'll then be able to use.
19

19

00:01:18,850  -->  00:01:23,420
So then I'll type aws, I can now execute commands with aws.
20

20

00:01:23,420  -->  00:01:26,733
If you don't have an AWS account yet, you have to open one.
21

21

00:01:27,848  -->  00:01:31,940
AWS.Amazon.com, create an AWS account and,
22

22

00:01:31,940  -->  00:01:32,840
when you create a new account,
23

23

00:01:32,840  -->  00:01:35,053
you will automatically get the free tier.
24

24

00:01:36,328  -->  00:01:41,328
Once you create a new AWS account, you will see this screen,
25

25

00:01:42,230  -->  00:01:44,020
the AWS Management Console.
26

26

00:01:44,020  -->  00:01:47,033
You can go to Services,
27

27

00:01:48,800  -->  00:01:50,960
and then go to IAM,
28

28

00:01:50,960  -->  00:01:53,903
to manage access to AWS resources.
29

29

00:01:56,430  -->  00:02:01,430
On the left you can click Users, and then Add user,
30

30

00:02:01,455  -->  00:02:06,303
to add a new user that will be used by us to configure,
31

31

00:02:06,303  -->  00:02:10,630
so that kops can access our AWS account.
32

32

00:02:10,630  -->  00:02:14,870
User name can be kops, it can be really anything
33

33

00:02:14,870  -->  00:02:18,160
that you want, and we're going to select
34

34

00:02:18,160  -->  00:02:21,230
Programmatic access, so we get an access key ID
35

35

00:02:21,230  -->  00:02:23,221
and secret key, that we then can configure
36

36

00:02:23,221  -->  00:02:25,533
using the AWS command line utility.
37

37

00:02:28,710  -->  00:02:30,840
Now we can add this user to a group.
38

38

00:02:30,840  -->  00:02:33,359
So, for example, you can create a new group administrator,
39

39

00:02:33,359  -->  00:02:36,909
or attach existing permissions.
40

40

00:02:36,909  -->  00:02:40,229
Probably the easiest is to add existing permissions,
41

41

00:02:40,229  -->  00:02:45,153
this Administrator Access, that you can then give this user.
42

42

00:02:46,060  -->  00:02:47,648
You can also choose to create an admin group
43

43

00:02:47,648  -->  00:02:50,408
and then give that group Administrator Access
44

44

00:02:50,408  -->  00:02:53,859
and assign that group to this user.
45

45

00:02:53,859  -->  00:02:56,620
And that you can do in the first step Add user to group,
46

46

00:02:56,620  -->  00:02:59,709
here we are just attaching the policy directly.
47

47

00:02:59,709  -->  00:03:02,930
We're not going to add tags, at this point,
48

48

00:03:02,930  -->  00:03:06,930
and then we can review our user.
49

49

00:03:06,930  -->  00:03:09,478
So user name's gonna be kops, for Programmatic access,
50

50

00:03:09,478  -->  00:03:13,350
and it's going to have administrative access.
51

51

00:03:13,350  -->  00:03:14,633
We can create this user.
52

52

00:03:16,174  -->  00:03:18,475
This user was successfully created,
53

53

00:03:18,475  -->  00:03:21,347
so now we have the AWS access key ID.
54

54

00:03:21,347  -->  00:03:23,444
And then, when you click here on Show,
55

55

00:03:23,444  -->  00:03:26,550
then it will show the Secret access key,
56

56

00:03:26,550  -->  00:03:30,240
which we need to configure the AWS command line utility.
57

57

00:03:30,240  -->  00:03:31,703
Those need to copy/paste.
58

58

00:03:34,680  -->  00:03:38,738
We go into the shell, of our VM, where we installed AWS
59

59

00:03:38,738  -->  00:03:39,780
the command line utility,
60

60

00:03:39,780  -->  00:03:43,051
and we're going to type aws configure.
61

61

00:03:43,051  -->  00:03:45,451
It asks for the AWS Access Key
62

62

00:03:45,451  -->  00:03:49,340
and for the AWS secret access key,
63

63

00:03:49,340  -->  00:03:52,593
both are printed when you were creating this user.
64

64

00:03:54,520  -->  00:03:56,910
You can specify a default region, or an output format,
65

65

00:03:56,910  -->  00:03:57,845
but that's not necessary.
66

66

00:03:57,845  -->  00:04:02,845
So that's it, now, what the AWS utility did actually
67

67

00:04:04,036  -->  00:04:08,660
created these files in .aws.
68

68

00:04:08,660  -->  00:04:11,780
And our credentials are now configured so,
69

69

00:04:11,780  -->  00:04:13,167
we can now use AWS.
70

70

00:04:14,950  -->  00:04:17,109
Next, I'm gonna go back to the Welcome screen
71

71

00:04:17,109  -->  00:04:19,185
and I'm gonna go to S3.
72

72

00:04:19,185  -->  00:04:23,753
S3 is an object storage, you can compare it with Google
73

73

00:04:23,753  -->  00:04:25,547
Drive, or a DropBox.
74

74

00:04:25,547  -->  00:04:28,107
And we're going to create a new Bucket.
75

75

00:04:28,107  -->  00:04:33,107
And this Bucket is going to be used for our kops-state.
76

76

00:04:33,436  -->  00:04:36,997
And I'm just going to add some random string at the end,
77

77

00:04:36,997  -->  00:04:40,593
which you also should do and you also should make it random,
78

78

00:04:40,593  -->  00:04:45,028
because this Bucket Name needs to be unique in Amazon,
79

79

00:04:45,028  -->  00:04:46,274
in that region.
80

80

00:04:46,274  -->  00:04:48,740
This region, that you specify here,
81

81

00:04:48,740  -->  00:04:49,795
is going to be the region
82

82

00:04:49,795  -->  00:04:52,247
where you want to deploy your cluster.
83

83

00:04:52,247  -->  00:04:55,776
So, if you want to deploy your cluster in Ireland,
84

84

00:04:55,776  -->  00:04:57,594
you should choose the Ireland region.
85

85

00:04:57,594  -->  00:04:59,228
So, depending on where you are,
86

86

00:04:59,228  -->  00:05:01,417
you can choose a different Bucket.
87

87

00:05:01,417  -->  00:05:03,768
If you don't know what region to choose,
88

88

00:05:03,768  -->  00:05:08,768
there's a tool cloudping.info you do with HTTP Ping.
89

89

00:05:09,464  -->  00:05:13,094
And, for me Europe and Frankfurt are the closest ones.
90

90

00:05:13,094  -->  00:05:15,510
I'm gonna go with Ireland,
91

91

00:05:15,510  -->  00:05:17,960
you're going to do this from a different location so,
92

92

00:05:17,960  -->  00:05:19,619
you're going to see different results.
93

93

00:05:19,619  -->  00:05:23,746
I'm going to choose Ireland, I'm going to click Create,
94

94

00:05:23,746  -->  00:05:27,218
and now I have my kops Bucket.
95

95

00:05:27,218  -->  00:05:32,218
Next is the DNS, so kops is also going to set up DNS
96

96

00:05:32,830  -->  00:05:35,620
for us but, we need to set up a domain for that,
97

97

00:05:35,620  -->  00:05:36,820
a sub domain.
98

98

00:05:36,820  -->  00:05:39,443
You can use Route 53 for that.
99

99

00:05:40,860  -->  00:05:44,207
Route 53 allows you to do DNS management.
100

100

00:05:44,207  -->  00:05:48,030
Kops expect you to enter a sub domain and kops will manage
101

101

00:05:48,030  -->  00:05:50,580
that sub domain for you but, you already need to create
102

102

00:05:50,580  -->  00:05:55,517
this zone in Route 53, so that kops can manage this for you.
103

103

00:05:55,517  -->  00:06:00,170
You can either register a new domain name, here on Amazon,
104

104

00:06:00,170  -->  00:06:01,820
or even somewhere cheap, where you can get one
105

105

00:06:01,820  -->  00:06:02,713
for a couple of bucks.
106

106

00:06:02,713  -->  00:06:07,050
There are also free solutions, so you don't spend money
107

107

00:06:07,050  -->  00:06:11,460
for a domain name, there's a .tk and there's also a provider
108

108

00:06:11,460  -->  00:06:12,630
that give you sub domains,
109

109

00:06:12,630  -->  00:06:15,150
that you then can use in Route 53.
110

110

00:06:15,150  -->  00:06:17,550
So, you don't need to spend money if you don't want,
111

111

00:06:17,550  -->  00:06:18,431
if you don't have a domain name
112

112

00:06:18,431  -->  00:06:19,970
it's probably the easiest way
113

113

00:06:19,970  -->  00:06:21,351
to just go for something free.
114

114

00:06:21,351  -->  00:06:23,019
Have a look at the procedure document,
115

115

00:06:23,019  -->  00:06:25,031
I have listed some free solutions there.
116

116

00:06:25,031  -->  00:06:29,050
And I have my own domain name so, I am going to get start
117

117

00:06:29,050  -->  00:06:32,450
here with DNS Management and we'll create a Hosted Zone.
118

118

00:06:32,450  -->  00:06:37,450
So, even if you have your own domain name, or if you opt
119

119

00:06:37,810  -->  00:06:40,100
for one of the free solutions, you still need to create
120

120

00:06:40,100  -->  00:06:41,460
this Hosted Zone.
121

121

00:06:41,460  -->  00:06:43,248
And this is actually gonna cost you some money,
122

122

00:06:43,248  -->  00:06:46,300
right now this cost you half a dollar per month,
123

123

00:06:46,300  -->  00:06:47,711
to create a Hosted Zone.
124

124

00:06:47,711  -->  00:06:49,969
So, if you don't want to spend any money at all,
125

125

00:06:49,969  -->  00:06:51,920
you might just wanna run MiniKube,
126

126

00:06:51,920  -->  00:06:55,018
maybe kops is not the solution for you.
127

127

00:06:55,018  -->  00:06:57,212
So, I'm going to click Create Hosted Zone
128

128

00:06:57,212  -->  00:07:02,212
and I'm going to use kubernetes.newtech.academy.
129

129

00:07:03,000  -->  00:07:07,240
I have a domain in newtech.academy so, what I will do is,
130

130

00:07:07,240  -->  00:07:11,432
I will make sure that kubernetes.newtech.academy
131

131

00:07:11,432  -->  00:07:15,222
is going to forward to Route 53.
132

132

00:07:15,222  -->  00:07:19,631
And, to make it forward, I need to specify these values
133

133

00:07:19,631  -->  00:07:21,750
here, and those are going to be different for you,
134

134

00:07:21,750  -->  00:07:25,593
as nameservers for this sub domain.
135

135

00:07:25,593  -->  00:07:29,900
My domain is host.namecheap so, I have to go to namecheap,
136

136

00:07:29,900  -->  00:07:34,213
tell namecheap kubernetes.newtech.academy
137

137

00:07:34,213  -->  00:07:38,310
is hosted by Route 53, these are the nameservers.
138

138

00:07:38,310  -->  00:07:41,411
You will easily find it if you're buying a domain name,
139

139

00:07:41,411  -->  00:07:44,063
it's quite straightforward to make those changes.
140

140

00:07:45,360  -->  00:07:48,180
Just to show you how it works with namecheap,
141

141

00:07:48,180  -->  00:07:50,802
you have something called Advanced DNS,
142

142

00:07:50,802  -->  00:07:55,802
and here I added four new records for kubernetes,
143

143

00:07:56,220  -->  00:07:59,090
for this domain name, so that I have sub domain
144

144

00:07:59,090  -->  00:08:02,095
kubernetes.newtech.academy and they point
145

145

00:08:02,095  -->  00:08:05,320
to the Route 53 nameservers.
146

146

00:08:05,320  -->  00:08:10,286
So, I did Add New record, NS Records, kubernetes as a host,
147

147

00:08:10,286  -->  00:08:13,272
and then whatever nameserver that you will see.
148

148

00:08:13,272  -->  00:08:15,750
So, if you do this yourself,
149

149

00:08:15,750  -->  00:08:18,780
don't take these nameservers but, take the ones that you see
150

150

00:08:18,780  -->  00:08:21,335
when you add a hosted record in Amazon.
151

151

00:08:21,335  -->  00:08:24,284
If you use something else than namecheap,
152

152

00:08:24,284  -->  00:08:27,330
for instance a free .tk domain name,
153

153

00:08:27,330  -->  00:08:29,550
then this will look a little bit different but,
154

154

00:08:29,550  -->  00:08:31,060
it's the same principle.
155

155

00:08:31,060  -->  00:08:34,443
You will have to add an NS record for a domain,
156

156

00:08:34,443  -->  00:08:36,835
or a subdomain, to be able to make this work.
157

157

00:08:36,835  -->  00:08:41,577
Once we set up the DNS, kops is going to manage the DNS
158

158

00:08:41,577  -->  00:08:44,286
for us, using Route 53.
159

159

00:08:44,286  -->  00:08:47,937
So now, we have done all the preparation and we can finally
160

160

00:08:47,937  -->  00:08:51,069
start launching our cluster, using kops,
161

161

00:08:51,069  -->  00:08:54,513
and that I will show you in the next demo.
