00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:09,020
This lecture is about Daemons Sets. Daemons Sets ensure that every single node in the Kubernetes cluster runs the same pod resource.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:16,760
This is useful if you want to ensure that a certain pod that is running on every

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,350
single Kubernetes node goes unnoticed.

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,160
When a node is added to the cluster, a new pod will be started automatically.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,810
Same when the node is removed the pod will not be rescheduled on another node.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
You have four nodes.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,730
You will run four pods one on each node.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,060
You remove one node.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,410
You will then run triples instead of four. That fourth pod will not be rescheduled.

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,160
So you always have the same amount of pods as you have

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,730
the amount of nodes. The typical use cases, logging aggregators,

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:57,230
so when you want to have one logging aggregator per node, where our pods send their logs. 

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,040
Monitoring, again,

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,490
if you want a monitor per node then typically only want one pod that is going to do the monitoring

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,890
for physical nodes.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,220
Load Balancers, Reverse Proxies, API Gateways.

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:18,950
There are third party API gateways, like linkerd, that also use daemon sets to run just one pod per node

18
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:25,140
that you have in your kubernetes cluster and in general running a daemon that only need one pot instance

19
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:32,270
per physical instance, then you're going to use daemon sets. This is an example of a Daemon Set specification, which is very simple.

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,240
You're going to use the API version extensions if you want beta.

21
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,750
And the kind is DaemonSet and all the rest is exactly the same as the previous definitions 

22
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,400
that you are used.

23
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,650
You have other data and then you have the spec. In the spec

24
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:54,980
you define a template where you have your pod specifications. I am not going to do a daemon now or daemon sets,

25
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,980
it will come back later on in the course.
