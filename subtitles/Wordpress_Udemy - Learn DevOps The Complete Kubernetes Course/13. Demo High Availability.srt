00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,710
I'm going to show you how kops can run multiple masters.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,690
I'm logged in here in my ubuntu-xenial and

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,060
you can answer arguments to kops to run multiple masters.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,570
Have a look at this command for instance. "kops create cluster".

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,690
Then we have the name, the state which is S3, and then the zones, 

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,430
you can actually specify multiple zones.

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,590
This is going to make it a little bit more complex when launching volumes, because pods that use EBS volumes

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,940
they need to be launched in the same zone.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,760
But Kubernetes labels nodes, so you can easily use nodes like they are running pods.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,790
You will have therefore a cluster that spans multiple zones.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,860
Still the same region but multiple zones.

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,390
You can increase the "node-count" or you can leave it at two.

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,800
If you leave it at two, you will launch only two zones, if you increase it to three

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,280
or more, you will cover out regions. The "node-size" is still the same, the "master-size" is the same,  

15
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,280
"dns-zone" is "kubernetes.newtech.academy",

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,400
and then here, "master-zones".

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,760
So, here you specify three "master-zones", which will mean that you have threes masters running in each zone.

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:22,840
So, we're going to go ahead and create this cluster and then we go to preview the change that we will make.

19
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:30,350
What I'm going to do is I'm going to show you the configuration of what is going to happen.

20
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:37,160
So, here we have the node configuration the instance groups.

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,890
So, you see here "miniSize: 2", "maxSize: 2", "t2.micro", and we have three zones.

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,710
If you still only want to launch your slave nodes you could just remove "b" and "c" here.

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,800
Then the master nodes that's a master, "master-eu-west-1a".

24
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:01,320
It's going to be our first master of size 1.

25
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,740
Then we can have

26
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,930
a second master, "master-eu-west-1b", and then you are going to have a third master.

27
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:16,350
So, even if a full zone fails, our master will still be working.

28
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:22,680
And if your cluster spans multiple zones, then you cluster will also be able to still keep on working, even if one of them

29
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,070
completely fails.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,560
So that's it for this demo.

31
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,550
As you can see kops has ways to edit the configuration files, to make some changes, and to make your own

32
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,500
custom cluster.
