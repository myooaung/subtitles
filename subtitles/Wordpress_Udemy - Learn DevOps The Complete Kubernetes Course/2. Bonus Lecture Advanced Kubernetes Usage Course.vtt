<v Edward>What do you do when you finish this course?</v>

2

00:00:03.020  -->  00:00:06.230 line:15% 
Let me briefly go over the other courses that I have
3

3

00:00:06.230  -->  00:00:08.450 line:15% 
and in particular, two Kubernetes courses
4

4

00:00:08.450  -->  00:00:11.143 line:15% 
that you can still take after doing this one.
5

5

00:00:12.000  -->  00:00:14.777 line:15% 
You can find my other courses on this URL
6

6

00:00:14.777  -->  00:00:17.970 line:15% 
and you can use the coupon code Bonus_Lecture

8

8

00:00:22.040  -->  00:00:25.270
So these are all my courses available.
9

9

00:00:25.270  -->  00:00:27.122
The ones that are going to be interesting for you
10

10

00:00:27.122  -->  00:00:30.373
is the Learn DevOps: Advanced Kubernetes Usage
11

11

00:00:30.373  -->  00:00:34.213
and the Learn DevOps: On-Prem or Cloud Agnostic Kubernetes.
12

12

00:00:35.120  -->  00:00:38.090
These build on this first course
13

13

00:00:38.090  -->  00:00:39.344
and many more lectures
14

14

00:00:39.344  -->  00:00:42.003
so that you can learn more about Kubernetes.
15

15

00:00:43.477  -->  00:00:45.920
This is the course overview of the advanced course
16

16

00:00:45.920  -->  00:00:48.400
where I will be talking about centralized logging,
17

17

00:00:48.400  -->  00:00:52.100
authentication, authorization, package management,
18

18

00:00:52.100  -->  00:00:54.040
the job resource and scheduling,
19

19

00:00:54.040  -->  00:00:56.470
deploying on Kubernetes with Spinnaker.
20

20

00:00:56.470  -->  00:00:59.710
So Spinnaker is a tool to deploy on Kubernetes.
21

21

00:00:59.710  -->  00:01:01.650
I'm going to talk about Linkerd,
22

22

00:01:01.650  -->  00:01:03.050
Federdation, and monitoring.
23

23

00:01:04.300  -->  00:01:07.350
And in the On-Prem or Cloud Agnostic Kubernetes
24

24

00:01:07.350  -->  00:01:09.550
the focus is not on cloud,
25

25

00:01:09.550  -->  00:01:11.950
but all the other deployments.
26

26

00:01:11.950  -->  00:01:14.600
So these are cloud agnostic deployments.
27

27

00:01:14.600  -->  00:01:18.334
So we're going to introduce you to Kubernetes using kubeadm.
28

28

00:01:18.334  -->  00:01:20.692
I'm going to talk about operators,
29

29

00:01:20.692  -->  00:01:25.100
Rook; this can provide you with self storage
30

30

00:01:25.100  -->  00:01:26.270
within your cluster
31

31

00:01:26.270  -->  00:01:27.811
and when you're not in the cloud you need
32

32

00:01:27.811  -->  00:01:30.543
some independent storage.
33

33

00:01:31.620  -->  00:01:33.260
Manage TLS certificates,
34

34

00:01:33.260  -->  00:01:37.190
this lecture is also included in this course.
35

35

00:01:37.190  -->  00:01:39.700
Authentication with Dex (OIDC)
36

36

00:01:39.700  -->  00:01:43.740
to use GitHub or LDAP for authentication
37

37

00:01:43.740  -->  00:01:45.330
within your cluster.
38

38

00:01:45.330  -->  00:01:49.450
We're talking about Istio, Calico, Vault,
39

39

00:01:49.450  -->  00:01:51.510
and OpenShift Origin.
40

40

00:01:51.510  -->  00:01:52.770
The other courses that are available
41

41

00:01:52.770  -->  00:01:55.490
that are interesting are Jenkins
42

42

00:01:55.490  -->  00:01:58.460
if you wanna build pipelines using Jenkins.
43

43

00:01:58.460  -->  00:02:01.350
You can also deploy your apps using Jenkins
44

44

00:02:01.350  -->  00:02:03.110
on Kubernetes.
45

45

00:02:03.110  -->  00:02:06.260
Spinnaker, if you want to use Spinnaker to deploy your apps.
46

46

00:02:06.260  -->  00:02:09.010
Spinnaker can also be integrated with Jenkins.
47

47

00:02:09.010  -->  00:02:10.610
So you can do your build with Jenkins
48

48

00:02:10.610  -->  00:02:12.750
and then you can do deployment with Spinnaker.
49

49

00:02:12.750  -->  00:02:15.633
It's a tool that was developed by Netflix.
50

50

00:02:16.630  -->  00:02:19.690
And Prometheus for monitoring and alerting.
51

51

00:02:19.690  -->  00:02:24.373
This one goes in depth how to install and use Prometheus.
52

52

00:02:25.428  -->  00:02:27.300
In the advanced course there's also
53

53

00:02:27.300  -->  00:02:28.401
a lecture about Prometheus,
54

54

00:02:28.401  -->  00:02:32.400
but here we really go into the Prometheus details.
55

55

00:02:32.400  -->  00:02:35.740
Then there's Infrastructure Automation with Terraform.
56

56

00:02:35.740  -->  00:02:37.680
If you're deploying on the cloud
57

57

00:02:37.680  -->  00:02:39.590
you definitely want to use Terraform
58

58

00:02:39.590  -->  00:02:42.410
to describe your infrastructure.
59

59

00:02:42.410  -->  00:02:44.220
You can also deploy EKS.
60

60

00:02:44.220  -->  00:02:46.530
It'll just EKS with Terraform
61

61

00:02:46.530  -->  00:02:48.241
so you can deploy a Kubernetes cluster
62

62

00:02:48.241  -->  00:02:51.053
all described in Terraform code.
63

63

00:02:52.030  -->  00:02:52.890
That's it.
64

64

00:02:52.890  -->  00:02:57.060
Don't forget the coupon code is Bonus underscore Lecture.
65

65

00:02:57.060  -->  00:02:59.883
Use the coupon code to get the lowest price available.
66

66

00:03:00.820  -->  00:03:02.520
Just one more thing I want to tell you
67

67

00:03:02.520  -->  00:03:04.060
before you move on.
68

68

00:03:04.060  -->  00:03:06.790
If your company is looking to use Kubernetes,
69

69

00:03:06.790  -->  00:03:11.110
you might want expert advice when implementing Kubernetes.
70

70

00:03:11.110  -->  00:03:14.600
With Kubeops we are providing consultancy services
71

71

00:03:14.600  -->  00:03:18.540
