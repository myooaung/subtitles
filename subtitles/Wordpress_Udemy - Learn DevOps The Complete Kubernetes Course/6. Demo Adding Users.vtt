00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.310
In this demo, I will show you how to add users. I am going to show it using minikube,

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:16.060
but you can also use, any other cluster, to add users on. I am going to use minikube ssh into my cluster.

3
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.390
This is where the actual Kubernetes cluster is running.

4
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.390
And I'm going to create a new key and certificate for my new user.

5
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:33.060
You can find these commands in the procedural documents, so you don't have to type them over.

6
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.180
First, I'm going to create a new key, "edward.pem", and then I'm going to create a new certificate request,

7
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.250
and here I specify my log in my group.

8
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:56.290
Then, comes the important part, I'm going to use "ca.certificate", and the "ca.key" to create a new certificate that is signed by my authority.

9
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.010
And by using it this way, I'll be able to use the certificate to authenticate to the API server.

10
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.170
So, there our key and the certificates.

11
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:19.000
So, let me just "cat" these files, and those I need to copy to files on my host system.

12
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.200
Som I just log out, you can use "control+D" for that.

13
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:35.290
And then, "/.kube/config", has two files, that it's using I can change these to my key and my certificate.

14
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.140
I just need to copy and paste the contents of the files into those two new files.

15
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.520
So, this goes into minikube, "edward.key"--

16
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.420
Yes, "edward.key".  

17
00:01:48.420 --> 00:02:00.100
"/.minikube/edward.key", and then, it's going to contain the key.

18
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:10.290
And then, we have the certificates. And this are just going to be the certificates.

19
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:22.360
So, now I have the same files, and if I do, "kubectl get node", I am actually using these two files, 

20
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.770
I can check this using, "kubectl config-view". 

21
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.780
I still have a certificate authority. Yes, I changed that one.

22
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.230
I have a key.

23
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.550
I have a certificate and a key that I'm using for authentication to this API.

24
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.720
So, that's it for every user that you want to create, you can just create new keys and new certificates.

25
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.870
If you're in a corporate environment, then you're probably going to implement your own way of authentication,

26
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.840
because you will use something like Active Directory LDAP.

27
00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.710
Have a look at the documentation, you can use for instance the proxy to implement your own authentication mechanism,

28
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.930
and then you can use some corporate gateway to make sure that the authentication is handled.

29
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.630
It is perfect if you just have a few users or you don't have already your own authentication mechanism.

30
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.630
So, that's it for this demo.
