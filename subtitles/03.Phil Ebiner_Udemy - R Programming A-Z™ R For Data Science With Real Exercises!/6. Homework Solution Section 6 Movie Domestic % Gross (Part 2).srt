1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:08,189
Alright, so now we're going to start on

2

00:00:08,189  -->  00:00:09,870
visualization process. What do you do

3

00:00:09,870  -->  00:00:12,509
first? First we're going to prepare the

4

00:00:12,509  -->  00:00:16,859
plots data and aesthetics layers

5

00:00:16,859  -->  00:00:19,560
right. The foundation of our plot

6

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:21,750
we're going to say P is going to be

7

00:00:21,750  -->  00:00:24,150
equal to or is going to contain. This

8

00:00:24,150  -->  00:00:26,070
object is going to contain GGplot

9

00:00:26,070  -->  00:00:29,130
data equals mov2, right? That's our

10

00:00:29,130  -->  00:00:31,380
filter data set aesthetics and let's

11

00:00:31,380  -->  00:00:32,910
set this aesthetics right away. The ones that

12

00:00:32,910  -->  00:00:35,040
we're going to be for sure for the whole

13

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:37,559
plot here because as you can see we

14

00:00:37,559  -->  00:00:38,730
actually have a few letters we've got

15

00:00:38,730  -->  00:00:40,559
them box plots and then we've got the

16

00:00:40,559  -->  00:00:43,530
jitter in the background but for both of

17

00:00:43,530  -->  00:00:46,200
them for everything we see over here X

18

00:00:46,200  -->  00:00:48,780
is always equals to genre and Y is always

19

00:00:48,780  -->  00:00:50,700
equals to cross percentage US.

20

00:00:50,700  -->  00:00:51,989
Now you can't say the same thing about

21

00:00:51,989  -->  00:00:54,780
size or color because the box plots

22

00:00:54,780  -->  00:00:58,440
don't have, are not colored by studio and

23

00:00:58,440  -->  00:01:00,539
their size is not affected by budget. So

24

00:01:00,539  -->  00:01:01,829
that's why we're not going to include

25

00:01:01,829  -->  00:01:04,530
those aesthetics in the base or in the

26

00:01:04,530  -->  00:01:06,390
foundation of our plot. We're only going

27

00:01:06,390  -->  00:01:08,100
to include the two aesthetics that are

28

00:01:08,100  -->  00:01:10,380
definitely going to stay constant. So genre

29

00:01:10,380  -->  00:01:13,049
and cross percentage US studio, so how

30

00:01:13,049  -->  00:01:14,340
we're going to do this? We're going to

31

00:01:14,340  -->  00:01:19,560
say x equals genre and then what do we

32

00:01:19,560  -->  00:01:21,780
want? We want to just go to the top here,

33

00:01:21,780  -->  00:01:23,970
we've got the name of the column here

34

00:01:23,970  -->  00:01:27,210
right so genre and y equals

35

00:01:27,210  -->  00:01:30,000
gross percentage US. So if I run that, if I try

36

00:01:30,000  -->  00:01:31,650
plotting it I'll get nothing because

37

00:01:31,650  -->  00:01:34,439
obviously we don't have a geometry. So now

38

00:01:34,439  -->  00:01:36,689
let's add a geometry right. So we'll

39

00:01:36,689  -->  00:01:39,119
start by adding the simplest geometry

40

00:01:39,119  -->  00:01:43,320
that we know is P plus geom underscore

41

00:01:43,320  -->  00:01:44,280
point.

42

00:01:44,280  -->  00:01:46,890
Alright so if I run this, you'll see that

43

00:01:46,890  -->  00:01:50,399
I get these just points aligned with the

44

00:01:50,399  -->  00:01:52,140
categorical variables over here at the

45

00:01:52,140  -->  00:01:53,850
bottom and already you can see that

46

00:01:53,850  -->  00:01:55,380
we've got the action-adventure animation

47

00:01:55,380  -->  00:01:57,719
comedy and drama. So the correct five

48

00:01:57,719  -->  00:01:59,759
genre is that we were after so our

49

00:01:59,759  -->  00:02:02,610
filter work. Alright so obviously geom

50

00:02:02,610  -->  00:02:04,380
point is not what we need. Let's try

51

00:02:04,380  -->  00:02:07,649
box plot, geom box plot. You can see that

52

00:02:07,649  -->  00:02:10,140
there is our box plot that's a good start

53

00:02:10,140  -->  00:02:12,000
that's already looking similar to what

54

00:02:12,000  -->  00:02:13,210
we have here

55

00:02:13,210  -->  00:02:15,040
but at the same time you can see these

56

00:02:15,040  -->  00:02:17,590
black dots. So let's just pay attention

57

00:02:17,590  -->  00:02:20,650
to that, let's quickly make a note of that in

58

00:02:20,650  -->  00:02:23,170
our heads that these dots are actually

59

00:02:23,170  -->  00:02:25,990
part of the box plot geometry. As you can

60

00:02:25,990  -->  00:02:28,270
see, we don't have any point or other

61

00:02:28,270  -->  00:02:30,610
type of layer and so basically these

62

00:02:30,610  -->  00:02:33,250
outliers are part of the box plot and

63

00:02:33,250  -->  00:02:35,560
we'll need that information just now

64

00:02:35,560  -->  00:02:37,750
when we're fixing up our chart in a

65

00:02:37,750  -->  00:02:39,010
couple of steps from here.

66

00:02:39,010  -->  00:02:40,930
Alright so we've got the box plot let's

67

00:02:40,930  -->  00:02:44,380
add the jitter right, so in the

68

00:02:44,380  -->  00:02:47,200
background, we saw jitter so let's add

69

00:02:47,200  -->  00:02:50,350
that. So if I run that you can see we've

70

00:02:50,350  -->  00:02:51,910
got the jitter but in this case it's on

71

00:02:51,910  -->  00:02:54,430
top right we want to put the jitter in

72

00:02:54,430  -->  00:02:58,210
the background so let's do that. They've

73

00:02:58,210  -->  00:02:59,560
got a box on top but now they're

74

00:02:59,560  -->  00:03:01,330
covering the jitter so let's give the

75

00:03:01,330  -->  00:03:03,370
box plot some transparency do you

76

00:03:03,370  -->  00:03:06,580
remember how to give transparency? It's alpha

77

00:03:06,580  -->  00:03:08,680
parameter we're going to set it to 0.7.

78

00:03:08,680  -->  00:03:10,420
Now notice that we're not

79

00:03:10,420  -->  00:03:12,160
creating an aesthetic here we're not

80

00:03:12,160  -->  00:03:14,620
well if alpha is an aesthetic but we're

81

00:03:14,620  -->  00:03:16,390
not mapping it to anything, so we're not

82

00:03:16,390  -->  00:03:19,450
using the aes function because we're

83

00:03:19,450  -->  00:03:21,220
actually just setting it to a certain

84

00:03:21,220  -->  00:03:23,500
values 0.7 for all of the box

85

00:03:23,500  -->  00:03:26,380
plot and because we are specifying this

86

00:03:26,380  -->  00:03:28,990
alpha inside the brackets for box geom

87

00:03:28,990  -->  00:03:30,430
box but it's only going to be applicable

88

00:03:30,430  -->  00:03:31,780
to these layers, it's not going to be

89

00:03:31,780  -->  00:03:33,010
applicable to the jitter layer.

90

00:03:33,010  -->  00:03:35,770
Alright so if I run that, we can see that

91

00:03:35,770  -->  00:03:37,810
the box plots are a bit transparent now

92

00:03:37,810  -->  00:03:39,190
which is good.

93

00:03:39,190  -->  00:03:41,620
Alright so now we want to add size and

94

00:03:41,620  -->  00:03:43,450
colors to the points. Remember something

95

00:03:43,450  -->  00:03:46,210
that we didn't do here because the size

96

00:03:46,210  -->  00:03:47,800
and color are only applicable to the

97

00:03:47,800  -->  00:03:49,390
jitter layer and that's what we want to

98

00:03:49,390  -->  00:03:51,400
do. So we're going to add it here, we're

99

00:03:51,400  -->  00:03:53,230
going to use the aesthetic function

100

00:03:53,230  -->  00:03:55,630
because what are we doing? We're mapping,

101

00:03:55,630  -->  00:03:58,330
we're not setting, we're mapping. So size

102

00:03:58,330  -->  00:04:00,610
equals with the size equal to budget

103

00:04:00,610  -->  00:04:04,570
and color equals studio now studio we

104

00:04:04,570  -->  00:04:06,370
remember that that is the correct name

105

00:04:06,370  -->  00:04:08,680
but let's check with the the name for

106

00:04:08,680  -->  00:04:11,680
budget is in our data set. This is kind

107

00:04:11,680  -->  00:04:14,410
of the consequence of not changing the

108

00:04:14,410  -->  00:04:17,830
names of your columns.

109

00:04:17,830  -->  00:04:21,370
Okay well it's not enough space so we

110

00:04:21,370  -->  00:04:24,070
would do something like str, just run

111

00:04:24,070  -->  00:04:26,110
that quickly and finally here so there

112

00:04:26,110  -->  00:04:26,650
you go budget meal.

113

00:04:26,650  -->  00:04:30,009
That's the one we need, so size

114

00:04:30,009  -->  00:04:31,930
equals budget meal so I can start with

115

00:04:31,930  -->  00:04:34,240
that, you'll see the size increase good

116

00:04:34,240  -->  00:04:36,789
and now I can add here as well

117

00:04:36,789  -->  00:04:40,750
color equals studio so if I run this

118

00:04:40,750  -->  00:04:45,070
you'll see that the color has appeared

119

00:04:45,070  -->  00:04:47,259
and also this to your filter work

120

00:04:47,259  -->  00:04:48,940
because we only have the six students

121

00:04:48,940  -->  00:04:50,620
that we are after.

122

00:04:50,620  -->  00:04:52,539
So there we go, that's that's a good

123

00:04:52,539  -->  00:04:54,250
start where else do we need?

124

00:04:54,250  -->  00:04:55,389
The other thing I wanted to show you

125

00:04:55,389  -->  00:04:57,520
here is that you can still see these

126

00:04:57,520  -->  00:04:59,139
black dots right, you can see there's

127

00:04:59,139  -->  00:05:01,600
that black dot there's this 2 those

128

00:05:01,600  -->  00:05:04,449
3 and there's that 1 and in fact

129

00:05:04,449  -->  00:05:08,560
these are part of the box plots not

130

00:05:08,560  -->  00:05:11,380
these are not part of the jitter as you

131

00:05:11,380  -->  00:05:14,169
remember we saw in that first time when

132

00:05:14,169  -->  00:05:15,760
we just added the box plot layer they

133

00:05:15,760  -->  00:05:17,800
were already there and you can see that

134

00:05:17,800  -->  00:05:20,530
this green point is in fact the same dot

135

00:05:20,530  -->  00:05:22,750
but it's just jitter to the right and

136

00:05:22,750  -->  00:05:25,690
here for every dot in the box plot for

137

00:05:25,690  -->  00:05:27,400
every outline there's a dot that is

138

00:05:27,400  -->  00:05:30,009
already added by the jitter. So in fact

139

00:05:30,009  -->  00:05:31,330
what we need to do is we need to get rid

140

00:05:31,330  -->  00:05:33,340
of these outlines we don't want to see

141

00:05:33,340  -->  00:05:35,260
them because they're already present

142

00:05:35,260  -->  00:05:37,630
through the jitter layer. How do we do

143

00:05:37,630  -->  00:05:40,810
that? Well in the geom box plot there's a

144

00:05:40,810  -->  00:05:44,080
parameter called outlier dot color and

145

00:05:44,080  -->  00:05:46,630
we just need to set it to N/A so meaning

146

00:05:46,630  -->  00:05:49,090
we don't want a color at all and as you

147

00:05:49,090  -->  00:05:51,280
can see those dots have disappeared now

148

00:05:51,280  -->  00:05:53,229
and there's no duplication of

149

00:05:53,229  -->  00:05:54,909
information on our chart.

150

00:05:54,909  -->  00:05:57,039
Ok good so what we're going to do now is

151

00:05:57,039  -->  00:05:59,380
we're going to save this into all save

152

00:05:59,380  -->  00:06:02,020
in quotation marks because uh we just

153

00:06:02,020  -->  00:06:04,539
going to kind of create a new object which

154

00:06:04,539  -->  00:06:06,760
will contain this whole visualization

155

00:06:06,760  -->  00:06:08,590
that right. So if I just call Q here

156

00:06:08,590  -->  00:06:10,810
then you'll see that the visualization

157

00:06:10,810  -->  00:06:13,060
is ready and now we can proceed

158

00:06:13,060  -->  00:06:15,370
with the final finishing touches because

159

00:06:15,370  -->  00:06:16,840
we're nearly done here.

160

00:06:16,840  -->  00:06:18,909
It's that quick. So we're just going to

161

00:06:18,909  -->  00:06:21,070
do the non data ink part, we're going to

162

00:06:21,070  -->  00:06:26,349
say Q move just all right Q of q+ so

163

00:06:26,349  -->  00:06:28,180
just give it some little adjustments

164

00:06:28,180  -->  00:06:31,810
will say xlab is the bottom axis also

165

00:06:31,810  -->  00:06:34,570
xlab is going to be called genre then

166

00:06:34,570  -->  00:06:38,050
we'll say ylab is going to be called

167

00:06:38,050  -->  00:06:41,379
gross percentage US just like in the

168

00:06:41,379  -->  00:06:44,860
chart that we saw and GGtitle which is

169

00:06:44,860  -->  00:06:46,870
the title of the whole plot is going to be

170

00:06:46,870  -->  00:06:51,819
called domestic gross what wasn't there. This

171

00:06:51,819  -->  00:06:57,580
percentage by genre right okay so if I

172

00:06:57,580  -->  00:07:02,590
run all of this and then I plot Q you'll

173

00:07:02,590  -->  00:07:04,389
see that all of these titles have now

174

00:07:04,389  -->  00:07:06,370
appeared and that's a good start.

175

00:07:06,370  -->  00:07:08,770
Now what we have to do is fix up the

176

00:07:08,770  -->  00:07:11,650
theme layer or add a theme layer we're

177

00:07:11,650  -->  00:07:15,310
going to say q is q + and now we just

178

00:07:15,310  -->  00:07:18,099
want to make these bigger add the colors

179

00:07:18,099  -->  00:07:19,930
change the font and so on.

180

00:07:19,930  -->  00:07:22,419
So how do we do this? Theme and inside

181

00:07:22,419  -->  00:07:25,060
theme we're going to start by changing

182

00:07:25,060  -->  00:07:27,940
the colors right? So we'll say,

183

00:07:27,940  -->  00:07:38,229
access.title.x is element text , color this is the access title which is genre and its blue here

184

00:07:38,229  -->  00:07:40,719
we'll say blue and the size,

185

00:07:40,719  -->  00:07:42,190
well this is kind of method of

186

00:07:42,190  -->  00:07:45,490
experimentation in this case very excited

187

00:07:45,490  -->  00:07:49,300
study but you could sit like 20 or 25

188

00:07:49,300  -->  00:07:51,130
and would be I think close enough.

189

00:07:51,130  -->  00:07:53,259
Alright so that's the x-axis, let's do

190

00:07:53,259  -->  00:07:56,169
the same thing for the y-axis. The colors

191

00:07:56,169  -->  00:07:58,870
blue, size 30 exactly the same.

192

00:07:58,870  -->  00:08:02,529
Ok so now we want axis not title but

193

00:08:02,529  -->  00:08:05,529
instead we want the text so that's these

194

00:08:05,529  -->  00:08:08,860
little mark here 80,60,40,20 as you can

195

00:08:08,860  -->  00:08:10,479
see they're a bit bigger there than we

196

00:08:10,479  -->  00:08:13,659
have and the color is still black so we

197

00:08:13,659  -->  00:08:15,610
don't need color we just need the size

198

00:08:15,610  -->  00:08:18,669
and it started to 20 and same thing for

199

00:08:18,669  -->  00:08:19,750
Y.

200

00:08:19,750  -->  00:08:22,360
Ok so let's quickly run that and see how

201

00:08:22,360  -->  00:08:24,879
we go, we'll just get rid of this comma for now.

202

00:08:24,879  -->  00:08:27,580
Around that you'll see that already

203

00:08:27,580  -->  00:08:28,990
it's getting better.

204

00:08:28,990  -->  00:08:31,300
The only thing is we haven't changed the

205

00:08:31,300  -->  00:08:33,370
size of our plot titles so let's do that

206

00:08:33,370  -->  00:08:37,240
quickly plot dot title equals element

207

00:08:37,240  -->  00:08:41,169
text color it's actually black so

208

00:08:41,169  -->  00:08:42,849
we don't need to change the color or

209

00:08:42,849  -->  00:08:47,079
just a size equals 40 and then also the

210

00:08:47,079  -->  00:08:49,390
legends right? The legend title and which

211

00:08:49,390  -->  00:08:50,089
text,

212

00:08:50,089  -->  00:08:53,990
so or I mean the text of the different

213

00:08:53,990  -->  00:08:56,540
names or categories in the legend so you

214

00:08:56,540  -->  00:09:00,139
can see here this is bigger and the size

215

00:09:00,139  -->  00:09:01,999
all of the text is actually will just

216

00:09:01,999  -->  00:09:04,759
actually changed as well. So legend dot

217

00:09:04,759  -->  00:09:08,720
title is going to be let's copy this and

218

00:09:08,720  -->  00:09:12,589
say 20 and here finally we'll say legend

219

00:09:12,589  -->  00:09:17,329
dot text so if I run this what do we get?

220

00:09:17,329  -->  00:09:19,819
Ok it looks much better so what do we

221

00:09:19,819  -->  00:09:22,189
still notice? We notice that the font is

222

00:09:22,189  -->  00:09:24,470
different so here is the standard font.

223

00:09:24,470  -->  00:09:27,709
Here it's comic sans ms. How can we fix

224

00:09:27,709  -->  00:09:30,290
that? Well one way to fix it is to in

225

00:09:30,290  -->  00:09:33,529
every single one of these two say comma

226

00:09:33,529  -->  00:09:38,660
family equals comic sans ms right? That's

227

00:09:38,660  -->  00:09:40,970
one way of doing it and which is to run

228

00:09:40,970  -->  00:09:42,980
that one you'll see that the plot title

229

00:09:42,980  -->  00:09:44,809
has changed and now we have to do the

230

00:09:44,809  -->  00:09:46,850
same for every single one of them but

231

00:09:46,850  -->  00:09:49,430
that would take quite some time. So I'm

232

00:09:49,430  -->  00:09:51,230
going to show you a shortcut instead of

233

00:09:51,230  -->  00:09:53,360
typing it up every single time

234

00:09:53,360  -->  00:09:56,779
what we can do is we can say text equals

235

00:09:56,779  -->  00:10:01,399
and then the same thing element text and

236

00:10:01,399  -->  00:10:03,230
in here will say family equals comic

237

00:10:03,230  -->  00:10:06,589
sans ms and this will apply to all of

238

00:10:06,589  -->  00:10:09,800
the titles and text on our plots. So if I run

239

00:10:09,800  -->  00:10:11,809
this, you'll see that they have all

240

00:10:11,809  -->  00:10:14,569
changed to comic sans ms. Okay viola!

241

00:10:14,569  -->  00:10:16,819
Nearly finished just one time final

242

00:10:16,819  -->  00:10:19,370
touch over here budget meal I needs to

243

00:10:19,370  -->  00:10:23,089
be changed to budget dollar millions or

244

00:10:23,089  -->  00:10:25,339
m and how do we do that? Well this is

245

00:10:25,339  -->  00:10:27,139
another thing that we haven't discussed

246

00:10:27,139  -->  00:10:29,509
yet but it's actually very simple so

247

00:10:29,509  -->  00:10:35,329
final touch so Q dollar labels, dollar

248

00:10:35,329  -->  00:10:38,509
size and we need to assign it

249

00:10:38,509  -->  00:10:40,999
we're doing it to assign it we want to

250

00:10:40,999  -->  00:10:44,779
say quotation marks budget dollar M.

251

00:10:44,779  -->  00:10:48,050
So if I run that and I look at you now as

252

00:10:48,050  -->  00:10:51,230
you can see the name of this label has

253

00:10:51,230  -->  00:10:53,839
changed name of legends has changed.

254

00:10:53,839  -->  00:10:56,120
Alright so there we go, that's how we

255

00:10:56,120  -->  00:10:58,129
solve this challenge. I hope you enjoyed

256

00:10:58,129  -->  00:11:00,799
this walk through and I look forward to

257

00:11:00,799  -->  00:11:01,850
seeing you next time

258

00:11:01,850  -->  00:11:10,990
until then, happy coding.
