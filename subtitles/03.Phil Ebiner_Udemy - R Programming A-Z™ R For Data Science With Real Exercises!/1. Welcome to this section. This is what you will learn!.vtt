00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.250
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:02.250  -->  00:00:04.350
R programming. In this section we're

3

00:00:04.350  -->  00:00:06.509
talking about advanced visualization. Now

4

00:00:06.509  -->  00:00:08.099
we've already touched on visualization

5

00:00:08.099  -->  00:00:10.740
here and there we've talk about the matplot

6

00:00:10.740  -->  00:00:12.150
function when we were working with

7

00:00:12.150  -->  00:00:14.280
matrices and we've talked about the

8

00:00:14.280  -->  00:00:16.890
Q plot function. Now in this section we

9

00:00:16.890  -->  00:00:19.020
will be learning about the GGplot

10

00:00:19.020  -->  00:00:21.750
function and the GGplot function is the main

11

00:00:21.750  -->  00:00:24.359
function in the GGplot 2 package. It

12

00:00:24.359  -->  00:00:26.220
allows you for a lot of flexibility and a

13

00:00:26.220  -->  00:00:28.109
lot of control when you're working with

14

00:00:28.109  -->  00:00:30.510
your charts and graphs. As you'll see, will

15

00:00:30.510  -->  00:00:31.920
create some very interesting, very

16

00:00:31.920  -->  00:00:34.500
powerful visualization and you'll learn a lot

17

00:00:34.500  -->  00:00:37.110
about this function. Now a word of notice

18

00:00:37.110  -->  00:00:40.200
is that we opted out of working with the

19

00:00:40.200  -->  00:00:42.989
base package right away or the base

20

00:00:42.989  -->  00:00:45.000
visualization function and that is because

21

00:00:45.000  -->  00:00:48.120
personally I find that the GGplot 2

22

00:00:48.120  -->  00:00:49.800
package provides so much more

23

00:00:49.800  -->  00:00:52.260
flexibility and so many more options

24

00:00:52.260  -->  00:00:55.079
when working with visualizations that you

25

00:00:55.079  -->  00:00:57.480
will never even want to go back to the

26

00:00:57.480  -->  00:00:59.609
base package so I decided that it's

27

00:00:59.609  -->  00:01:01.829
there's not much point in wasting time

28

00:01:01.829  -->  00:01:03.420
on learning something that we're not

29

00:01:03.420  -->  00:01:05.909
going to be using in the long run and

30

00:01:05.909  -->  00:01:07.350
also you should know that there are

31

00:01:07.350  -->  00:01:10.020
other packages in R that help you and

32

00:01:10.020  -->  00:01:13.049
allow you to visualize your data but

33

00:01:13.049  -->  00:01:15.930
personally I prefer GGplot2 so we'll

34

00:01:15.930  -->  00:01:17.729
stick to that one in this section of the

35

00:01:17.729  -->  00:01:19.860
course and I look forward to seeing you

36

00:01:19.860  -->  00:01:21.420
on the first tutorial. Let's dive

37

00:01:21.420  -->  00:01:27.110
straight into it.
