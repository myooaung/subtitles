1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,770
Hello and welcome into the section on

2

00:00:07,770  -->  00:00:09,360
advanced visualization.

3

00:00:09,360  -->  00:00:11,460
I've got another very exciting data set

4

00:00:11,460  -->  00:00:13,799
prepared for us today and it's called

5

00:00:13,799  -->  00:00:15,900
the movie ratings data set.

6

00:00:15,900  -->  00:00:18,359
We're going to be visualizing ratings of

7

00:00:18,359  -->  00:00:21,510
movies, Hollywood movies mostly between

8

00:00:21,510  -->  00:00:24,449
2007 and 2011 and we're going to create

9

00:00:24,449  -->  00:00:26,910
lots of different great and outstanding

10

00:00:26,910  -->  00:00:29,070
and fascinating charts and plots and

11

00:00:29,070  -->  00:00:31,380
graphs and that way we'll learn a lot

12

00:00:31,380  -->  00:00:33,360
and have fun at the same time.

13

00:00:33,360  -->  00:00:35,760
Alright let's check out this challenge.

14

00:00:35,760  -->  00:00:38,910
So you have been approached as an analytics

15

00:00:38,910  -->  00:00:41,550
consultant by a movie reviews website.

16

00:00:41,550  -->  00:00:44,309
They are writing up an article analyzing

17

00:00:44,309  -->  00:00:46,800
movie ratings by critics and audience as

18

00:00:46,800  -->  00:00:48,360
well as movie budgets for the years

19

00:00:48,360  -->  00:00:50,460
2007-2011. This is

20

00:00:50,460  -->  00:00:52,050
the first time they're doing this

21

00:00:52,050  -->  00:00:54,210
analysis and they don't know exactly

22

00:00:54,210  -->  00:00:55,649
what they need.

23

00:00:55,649  -->  00:00:57,870
Don't you love those situations when

24

00:00:57,870  -->  00:00:59,820
somebody comes up to you and says I have

25

00:00:59,820  -->  00:01:01,530
some data, analyze it, I don't know

26

00:01:01,530  -->  00:01:02,940
exactly what I need.

27

00:01:02,940  -->  00:01:05,220
Yeah this is one of them. They have asked

28

00:01:05,220  -->  00:01:06,990
you to look into the data and provide

29

00:01:06,990  -->  00:01:09,119
them with five graphs that tell a story

30

00:01:09,119  -->  00:01:11,460
about the data. However, there is one

31

00:01:11,460  -->  00:01:14,010
chart the CEO specifically requested. A

32

00:01:14,010  -->  00:01:15,780
diagram showing how the correlation

33

00:01:15,780  -->  00:01:18,479
between audience and critic ratings has

34

00:01:18,479  -->  00:01:21,180
evolved throughout the years by genre.

35

00:01:21,180  -->  00:01:23,729
This is in addition to the other five

36

00:01:23,729  -->  00:01:25,770
see the next page for the CEO's vision.

37

00:01:25,770  -->  00:01:27,570
So it sounds like a pretty complicated

38

00:01:27,570  -->  00:01:29,939
chart so the CEO decided to explain it

39

00:01:29,939  -->  00:01:33,000
with a picture. Here's the picture, audience

40

00:01:33,000  -->  00:01:34,680
rating, critic rating, like you know

41

00:01:34,680  -->  00:01:37,170
how CEO's are sometimes quickly scribbles

42

00:01:37,170  -->  00:01:38,729
something on a paper give it to you and

43

00:01:38,729  -->  00:01:40,920
then you go and have to figure it out on

44

00:01:40,920  -->  00:01:42,689
your own what exactly that they want,

45

00:01:42,689  -->  00:01:44,729
where where are the years here? What are the

46

00:01:44,729  -->  00:01:48,119
genres? What is that question mark? Well this

47

00:01:48,119  -->  00:01:50,820
is a one of those very ambiguous type of

48

00:01:50,820  -->  00:01:53,189
projects but it doesn't matter because

49

00:01:53,189  -->  00:01:55,380
we will still prow through it and we

50

00:01:55,380  -->  00:01:57,360
will learn a lot along the way.

51

00:01:57,360  -->  00:01:59,549
Ok so that was a challenge, let's move on

52

00:01:59,549  -->  00:02:02,040
to where to get the data. So in order to

53

00:02:02,040  -->  00:02:04,829
get the data set we need to go to

54

00:02:04,829  -->  00:02:08,069
superdatascience.com/rcourse and if

55

00:02:08,069  -->  00:02:11,350
you scroll down, here we've got section 6

56

00:02:11,350  -->  00:02:14,470
advanced visualization. So section 6

57

00:02:14,470  -->  00:02:16,540
challenge was that presentation with

58

00:02:16,540  -->  00:02:19,600
awesome picture from the CEO and we've

59

00:02:19,600  -->  00:02:21,520
got movie ratings here so that's the csv

60

00:02:21,520  -->  00:02:24,460
file that we'll need and I actually want

61

00:02:24,460  -->  00:02:27,310
to show you inside the file, so this is

62

00:02:27,310  -->  00:02:29,230
what it looks like once you open it and

63

00:02:29,230  -->  00:02:31,480
here we've got one, two, three, four, five,

64

00:02:31,480  -->  00:02:33,970
six columns. If you scroll down, there's

65

00:02:33,970  -->  00:02:36,430
quite a lot of movies. I wonder how many

66

00:02:36,430  -->  00:02:39,520
of them you have seen. So it just try see

67

00:02:39,520  -->  00:02:41,020
if there's a couple that you've since I've

68

00:02:41,020  -->  00:02:44,350
seen zombieland for example. So 562

69

00:02:44,350  -->  00:02:46,480
movies in here and they have different

70

00:02:46,480  -->  00:02:49,540
genres, comedy, action, thriller, drama,

71

00:02:49,540  -->  00:02:52,360
horror even. So we had quite a few

72

00:02:52,360  -->  00:02:55,030
different genres and also we've got the

73

00:02:55,030  -->  00:02:56,620
rating so we've got the run to

74

00:02:56,620  -->  00:02:59,590
modest rating and actually it might sound a

75

00:02:59,590  -->  00:03:01,420
bit confusing but the higher the rating

76

00:03:01,420  -->  00:03:02,800
it's actually good it doesn't mean they

77

00:03:02,800  -->  00:03:04,330
get more rotten amount. That means,

78

00:03:04,330  -->  00:03:06,130
just that's the name of the rating but

79

00:03:06,130  -->  00:03:08,530
the higher the better and then so that's

80

00:03:08,530  -->  00:03:10,420
the critics rating so basically critics

81

00:03:10,420  -->  00:03:12,190
they review the movie and they give

82

00:03:12,190  -->  00:03:15,130
their expert opinion on the movie and so

83

00:03:15,130  -->  00:03:17,020
basically they're rated and then once

84

00:03:17,020  -->  00:03:19,000
sufficient number of people have

85

00:03:19,000  -->  00:03:20,650
actually seen from the general public

86

00:03:20,650  -->  00:03:23,110
they also rate that movie and then so

87

00:03:23,110  -->  00:03:25,270
you can can you compare them. So here the

88

00:03:25,270  -->  00:03:27,280
movie was rated 40 by the critics but 71

89

00:03:27,280  -->  00:03:29,290
out of a hundred by the audience so

90

00:03:29,290  -->  00:03:30,970
sometimes they match, sometimes they

91

00:03:30,970  -->  00:03:32,260
don't. That's one of the things that we're

92

00:03:32,260  -->  00:03:34,690
going to explore. Another column we have

93

00:03:34,690  -->  00:03:36,190
budget, so what was the budget of the

94

00:03:36,190  -->  00:03:38,170
movie. It'lll be interesting to see, does

95

00:03:38,170  -->  00:03:41,050
budget actually affect the ratings and

96

00:03:41,050  -->  00:03:42,490
year of your release

97

00:03:42,490  -->  00:03:44,410
so that's another variable that we'll be

98

00:03:44,410  -->  00:03:47,590
using so comparing year-by-year. There we

99

00:03:47,590  -->  00:03:49,510
go, that's our six columns and that's our

100

00:03:49,510  -->  00:03:51,700
data set go ahead and download that and

101

00:03:51,700  -->  00:03:53,800
we will connect to it in the next

102

00:03:53,800  -->  00:03:55,060
tutorial and I look forward to seeing you

103

00:03:55,060  -->  00:03:55,390
then.

104

00:03:55,390  -->  00:04:07,719
Until next time, happy coding.
