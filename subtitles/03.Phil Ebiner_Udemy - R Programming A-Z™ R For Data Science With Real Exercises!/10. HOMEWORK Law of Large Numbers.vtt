00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:08.099
Hello and first off congratulations on

2

00:00:08.099  -->  00:00:10.200
completing this first section of the

3

00:00:10.200  -->  00:00:12.269
course. Some things may have been new,

4

00:00:12.269  -->  00:00:14.160
some things may have been familiar but

5

00:00:14.160  -->  00:00:16.080
still you powered through it and you got

6

00:00:16.080  -->  00:00:18.449
to the end and that is a great

7

00:00:18.449  -->  00:00:20.130
accomplishment because that sets you up

8

00:00:20.130  -->  00:00:22.470
for a great start into the world of R

9

00:00:22.470  -->  00:00:24.449
programming. So go ahead and give

10

00:00:24.449  -->  00:00:26.880
yourself a pat on the back for that and

11

00:00:26.880  -->  00:00:28.680
so what do we have today? Well today, we'll

12

00:00:28.680  -->  00:00:30.840
have a homework exercise an exercise

13

00:00:30.840  -->  00:00:33.030
that will allow us to consolidate all of

14

00:00:33.030  -->  00:00:34.590
the knowledge that we learned in this

15

00:00:34.590  -->  00:00:37.200
section and moreover on top of all that

16

00:00:37.200  -->  00:00:38.670
knowledge we will overlay some

17

00:00:38.670  -->  00:00:40.530
statistics and we'll talk about the law

18

00:00:40.530  -->  00:00:42.329
of large numbers and we'll talk about

19

00:00:42.329  -->  00:00:45.210
the normal distribution and why is that?

20

00:00:45.210  -->  00:00:47.670
Well that's because as a data scientist

21

00:00:47.670  -->  00:00:50.010
working in R or a data analyst working

22

00:00:50.010  -->  00:00:52.620
on R, inevitably you're going to have to

23

00:00:52.620  -->  00:00:55.530
know how to leverage the power of R to

24

00:00:55.530  -->  00:00:59.730
assess represent a portray statistical

25

00:00:59.730  -->  00:01:01.260
concepts, so to apply statistical

26

00:01:01.260  -->  00:01:04.500
concepts to your work and this is going

27

00:01:04.500  -->  00:01:07.229
to be a great first step for us in that

28

00:01:07.229  -->  00:01:09.659
direction. So I'm pretty excited to share

29

00:01:09.659  -->  00:01:11.490
this exercise a few let's get straight

30

00:01:11.490  -->  00:01:14.280
into it. So what is the law of large

31

00:01:14.280  -->  00:01:14.970
numbers?

32

00:01:14.970  -->  00:01:17.729
Well without further a do this is the law

33

00:01:17.729  -->  00:01:20.009
of large numbers, it might seem a bit

34

00:01:20.009  -->  00:01:21.900
complicated when it's written down but

35

00:01:21.900  -->  00:01:24.509
in reality it's very simple and in fact

36

00:01:24.509  -->  00:01:27.150
it is so easy and yet so simple that it

37

00:01:27.150  -->  00:01:29.640
is one of my favorite concepts in fact

38

00:01:29.640  -->  00:01:31.590
it's one of my favorite concepts in life.

39

00:01:31.590  -->  00:01:33.180
I apply the law of large numbers

40

00:01:33.180  -->  00:01:36.210
everywhere where I can and you will see

41

00:01:36.210  -->  00:01:39.180
why just a second when we go through it

42

00:01:39.180  -->  00:01:40.920
and understand what exactly this means.

43

00:01:40.920  -->  00:01:42.450
Alright so to understand the law of

44

00:01:42.450  -->  00:01:45.329
large numbers, what we have to first take

45

00:01:45.329  -->  00:01:47.100
into account is the scenario the

46

00:01:47.100  -->  00:01:49.770
environment that this law is of being

47

00:01:49.770  -->  00:01:52.619
presented to us in and that scenario is

48

00:01:52.619  -->  00:01:55.649
let's imagine that we have a sample that

49

00:01:55.649  -->  00:01:57.180
we are observing and we're measuring

50

00:01:57.180  -->  00:01:59.909
some value in that sample. A good example

51

00:01:59.909  -->  00:02:02.280
is coin tosses, so let's say we have

52

00:02:02.280  -->  00:02:04.469
endpoint tosses that's what this is

53

00:02:04.469  -->  00:02:06.240
better over here and stands for and

54

00:02:06.240  -->  00:02:08.220
let's say it's a hundred coin tosses we

55

00:02:08.220  -->  00:02:10.830
are observing a hundred coin tosses and

56

00:02:10.830  -->  00:02:12.450
the value that we're measuring is

57

00:02:12.450  -->  00:02:13.660
whether each

58

00:02:13.660  -->  00:02:17.320
when is heads or tails so let's say one

59

00:02:17.320  -->  00:02:21.160
is heads and 0 is tails then this X is

60

00:02:21.160  -->  00:02:23.500
that measured value so x is 1 if it's

61

00:02:23.500  -->  00:02:26.740
heads x is 0 if its tail's and what this

62

00:02:26.740  -->  00:02:30.070
X with the index and and this dash at

63

00:02:30.070  -->  00:02:32.530
the top means is it means we're taking

64

00:02:32.530  -->  00:02:35.350
the average of X across the sample of n,

65

00:02:35.350  -->  00:02:38.140
so we did a hundred coin tosses and we

66

00:02:38.140  -->  00:02:40.990
measured how many heads they are and we

67

00:02:40.990  -->  00:02:42.670
average that out across the whole sample

68

00:02:42.670  -->  00:02:46.000
so maybe we had like 43 heads and we

69

00:02:46.000  -->  00:02:48.340
divided that by hundred so basically

70

00:02:48.340  -->  00:02:52.750
this X this value would be 0.43, So what

71

00:02:52.750  -->  00:02:53.920
is on the right over here

72

00:02:53.920  -->  00:02:56.380
well on the right we've got the expected

73

00:02:56.380  -->  00:02:59.080
value of x theoretical value of x

74

00:02:59.080  -->  00:03:01.840
or if you're selecting a sample from a

75

00:03:01.840  -->  00:03:05.080
population then this would be the exit

76

00:03:05.080  -->  00:03:07.690
the value of x in the population but we

77

00:03:07.690  -->  00:03:09.040
go long go into that right now let's

78

00:03:09.040  -->  00:03:10.720
just talk about the coin tosses example

79

00:03:10.720  -->  00:03:12.460
for now. So we know that theoretically

80

00:03:12.460  -->  00:03:15.910
when you toss a coin head is if it's a

81

00:03:15.910  -->  00:03:18.280
fair coin of course the probability of

82

00:03:18.280  -->  00:03:19.720
getting heads fifty percent probability

83

00:03:19.720  -->  00:03:21.640
of getting kelsey is 50 cent,

84

00:03:21.640  -->  00:03:23.050
so that means out of a hundred coin

85

00:03:23.050  -->  00:03:26.140
tosses they expected number of heads is

86

00:03:26.140  -->  00:03:30.490
50. So the expected value of x is 0.5

87

00:03:30.490  -->  00:03:33.760
and so what this whole or presents now

88

00:03:33.760  -->  00:03:36.370
now we can assess it or understand it is

89

00:03:36.370  -->  00:03:40.000
that when n is approaching infinity so

90

00:03:40.000  -->  00:03:43.660
as n grows as a sample size grows you're

91

00:03:43.660  -->  00:03:46.959
actually measured value converges to the

92

00:03:46.959  -->  00:03:50.320
expected value of that measurement. So

93

00:03:50.320  -->  00:03:51.430
let's say that again

94

00:03:51.430  -->  00:03:53.350
the average of the actually measured

95

00:03:53.350  -->  00:03:56.980
value across just sample converges to

96

00:03:56.980  -->  00:04:00.190
the expected value of that measurement

97

00:04:00.190  -->  00:04:04.270
when N approaches infinity so as your

98

00:04:04.270  -->  00:04:06.459
sample growth and that is very important

99

00:04:06.459  -->  00:04:08.470
to understand and the best way to

100

00:04:08.470  -->  00:04:10.959
actually understand it is to look at a

101

00:04:10.959  -->  00:04:12.910
specific example. Let's have a look so

102

00:04:12.910  -->  00:04:15.640
let's say we have 10 coin tosses so if

103

00:04:15.640  -->  00:04:18.190
you could cause a toss a coin 7, 10 times

104

00:04:18.190  -->  00:04:20.290
you might get seven heads and 3 tails

105

00:04:20.290  -->  00:04:23.020
that's not out of the no, that's totally you

106

00:04:23.020  -->  00:04:24.430
can totally imagine that happening and

107

00:04:24.430  -->  00:04:26.620
happens all the time so in that case you

108

00:04:26.620  -->  00:04:27.250
get a 70 to

109

00:04:27.250  -->  00:04:30.100
30 which is quite far away from 50 to 50

110

00:04:30.100  -->  00:04:32.200
right, now if you toss a coin a hundred

111

00:04:32.200  -->  00:04:32.830
times.

112

00:04:32.830  -->  00:04:34.690
Yes a few coin tosses might be out of

113

00:04:34.690  -->  00:04:37.000
the nor but you might get like

114

00:04:37.000  -->  00:04:40.030
something 52-48 maybe you might get 43

115

00:04:40.030  -->  00:04:44.020
and 57 something that and here in this

116

00:04:44.020  -->  00:04:46.660
case you for it it's 52-percent 40 upset

117

00:04:46.660  -->  00:04:49.330
already much closer to 50 50 if you toss

118

00:04:49.330  -->  00:04:50.980
a coin a thousand times you might get

119

00:04:50.980  -->  00:04:55.390
502 -598 or somewhere thereabouts and now

120

00:04:55.390  -->  00:04:57.850
you're getting even closer to 50 50 so

121

00:04:57.850  -->  00:04:59.620
as you can see as the number of coin

122

00:04:59.620  -->  00:05:02.110
toss increases your getting closer and

123

00:05:02.110  -->  00:05:04.750
closer and closer to that theoretical

124

00:05:04.750  -->  00:05:08.560
50 to 50 and that is exactly what the law of

125

00:05:08.560  -->  00:05:10.419
large numbers says and as you can see

126

00:05:10.419  -->  00:05:12.910
it's a very intuitive concept and it's

127

00:05:12.910  -->  00:05:15.190
just written in mathematical terms and

128

00:05:15.190  -->  00:05:17.860
it has that mathematical foundation to

129

00:05:17.860  -->  00:05:18.460
it.

130

00:05:18.460  -->  00:05:20.140
Alright so, that is the law of large

131

00:05:20.140  -->  00:05:22.120
numbers now what else we're going to

132

00:05:22.120  -->  00:05:24.070
need is we're going to need the normal

133

00:05:24.070  -->  00:05:25.630
distribution, so let's have a look at the

134

00:05:25.630  -->  00:05:27.940
normal distribution. Now previously in

135

00:05:27.940  -->  00:05:31.150
this section we had a tutorial where we

136

00:05:31.150  -->  00:05:34.390
were generating random numbers using the

137

00:05:34.390  -->  00:05:36.490
R norm function well the arm

138

00:05:36.490  -->  00:05:37.990
function uses the normal distribution

139

00:05:37.990  -->  00:05:40.090
and we already kind of good and

140

00:05:40.090  -->  00:05:41.290
acquainted with it.

141

00:05:41.290  -->  00:05:43.000
So what is exactly the normal

142

00:05:43.000  -->  00:05:43.990
distribution and if you've already

143

00:05:43.990  -->  00:05:45.850
encountered the normal distribution or

144

00:05:45.850  -->  00:05:47.260
you're very comfortable with that is

145

00:05:47.260  -->  00:05:49.060
fantastic but we'll just quickly revise

146

00:05:49.060  -->  00:05:51.250
a couple of concepts that we're going to

147

00:05:51.250  -->  00:05:54.340
be using in this exercise. So the normal

148

00:05:54.340  -->  00:05:56.020
distribution looks like this and what is

149

00:05:56.020  -->  00:05:58.419
this curve showing us. 
So we won't even

150

00:05:58.419  -->  00:06:00.610
bother with the y axis because the

151

00:06:00.610  -->  00:06:03.070
actual integrated numbers are already

152

00:06:03.070  -->  00:06:05.680
represented here on the chart and all

153

00:06:05.680  -->  00:06:07.840
it's saying is that that function R

154

00:06:07.840  -->  00:06:10.780
norm that we're using journey and number

155

00:06:10.780  -->  00:06:12.550
well remember that it generates a number

156

00:06:12.550  -->  00:06:14.320
somewhere around 0 so it could have been

157

00:06:14.320  -->  00:06:16.390
like a bit further away from there could

158

00:06:16.390  -->  00:06:18.850
be between minus 1 and 1 minus 2 into so

159

00:06:18.850  -->  00:06:20.860
but as we got further away from zero

160

00:06:20.860  -->  00:06:23.350
the likelihood of a number being

161

00:06:23.350  -->  00:06:25.479
generated there was lower and lower and

162

00:06:25.479  -->  00:06:27.820
lower all the time. So that is exactly

163

00:06:27.820  -->  00:06:30.490
what this bell curve is representing

164

00:06:30.490  -->  00:06:33.010
it's telling us that once for

165

00:06:33.010  -->  00:06:34.870
specifically for that function that

166

00:06:34.870  -->  00:06:36.310
function generates a number and

167

00:06:36.310  -->  00:06:38.110
likelihood of the probability of that

168

00:06:38.110  -->  00:06:40.330
number of being in this

169

00:06:40.330  -->  00:06:42.819
interval between 0 and 1 in this case is

170

00:06:42.819  -->  00:06:44.530
1 Sigma but let's just imagine that

171

00:06:44.530  -->  00:06:46.659
Sigma is equal to one so the likelihood

172

00:06:46.659  -->  00:06:48.879
of the number that's generated being

173

00:06:48.879  -->  00:06:51.280
between 0 and 1 is 34.1 percent.  The

174

00:06:51.280  -->  00:06:54.129
likelihood of it being between minus 1 and 0

175

00:06:54.129  -->  00:06:56.500
is that you want 34.1 percent so basically

176

00:06:56.500  -->  00:06:59.169
you have the probabilities here that any

177

00:06:59.169  -->  00:07:00.909
number you generate with that R norm

178

00:07:00.909  -->  00:07:03.639
function falls inside one of these

179

00:07:03.639  -->  00:07:06.189
segments and that's all it's about so

180

00:07:06.189  -->  00:07:08.469
this is how the normal distribution work

181

00:07:08.469  -->  00:07:11.139
so if you take a thousand normally

182

00:07:11.139  -->  00:07:13.030
distributed variables with a mean of

183

00:07:13.030  -->  00:07:14.770
zero so this is the mean where the

184

00:07:14.770  -->  00:07:17.050
middle of the bell curve is and also

185

00:07:17.050  -->  00:07:20.500
Sigma is your standard deviation so if

186

00:07:20.500  -->  00:07:22.629
you take a thousand normally distributed

187

00:07:22.629  -->  00:07:25.120
variables random normally distributed

188

00:07:25.120  -->  00:07:27.699
variables that have a mean of zero and a

189

00:07:27.699  -->  00:07:30.129
standard deviation of one then they will

190

00:07:30.129  -->  00:07:34.120
fall like this into the interval between

191

00:07:34.120  -->  00:07:37.330
like- million to a million, so this is

192

00:07:37.330  -->  00:07:39.460
how it will look and most of them will

193

00:07:39.460  -->  00:07:41.289
be between minus 1 and 1 some will be

194

00:07:41.289  -->  00:07:43.539
over here some will be here and as you

195

00:07:43.539  -->  00:07:45.400
get for the way it gets less and less

196

00:07:45.400  -->  00:07:47.770
and less. So that's how the normal

197

00:07:47.770  -->  00:07:48.759
distribution works

198

00:07:48.759  -->  00:07:50.199
what are we going to use the normal

199

00:07:50.199  -->  00:07:52.360
distribution for and how is this going

200

00:07:52.360  -->  00:07:54.580
to be combined with the law of Legends.

201

00:07:54.580  -->  00:07:56.529
Well what are we going to do in this

202

00:07:56.529  -->  00:07:58.960
tutorial in this exercise is we're going

203

00:07:58.960  -->  00:08:01.629
to test the law of large numbers

204

00:08:01.629  -->  00:08:03.310
how cool is that we're going to actually

205

00:08:03.310  -->  00:08:05.680
assess whether the law of large numbers

206

00:08:05.680  -->  00:08:09.490
is correct it if it holds in a one of

207

00:08:09.490  -->  00:08:10.719
the specific examples that we're going

208

00:08:10.719  -->  00:08:11.860
to be looking at here is the

209

00:08:11.860  -->  00:08:13.629
distribution as you can see it's quite a

210

00:08:13.629  -->  00:08:15.190
statistical approach that we're taking

211

00:08:15.190  -->  00:08:17.710
quite a statistical exercise but we're

212

00:08:17.710  -->  00:08:20.800
going to be using R to prove that the

213

00:08:20.800  -->  00:08:22.750
law of large numbers hold to confirm

214

00:08:22.750  -->  00:08:25.569
that the law of large numbers holds. So

215

00:08:25.569  -->  00:08:27.310
pretty exciting isn't it let's get

216

00:08:27.310  -->  00:08:31.240
straight to the exercise so the exercise

217

00:08:31.240  -->  00:08:34.089
is test the law of large numbers for

218

00:08:34.089  -->  00:08:36.789
and random normally distributed numbers

219

00:08:36.789  -->  00:08:39.820
with mean of zero and standard deviation

220

00:08:39.820  -->  00:08:42.610
equal to 1 and to do that how do you do

221

00:08:42.610  -->  00:08:45.100
that well create an R script that will

222

00:08:45.100  -->  00:08:47.440
count how many of these numbers fall

223

00:08:47.440  -->  00:08:50.829
between minus 1 and 1 and divide by the

224

00:08:50.829  -->  00:08:53.830
total quantity of n. Ok let that sink

225

00:08:53.830  -->  00:08:56.860
and you know that the expected value of

226

00:08:56.860  -->  00:09:01.510
x is 68.2 percent, now let's see how do

227

00:09:01.510  -->  00:09:03.490
we know that well we're trying to

228

00:09:03.490  -->  00:09:06.370
measure how many of our randomly

229

00:09:06.370  -->  00:09:08.710
generated numbers will fall between

230

00:09:08.710  -->  00:09:10.150
minus 1 and 1

231

00:09:10.150  -->  00:09:12.550
well we know that that is these two

232

00:09:12.550  -->  00:09:15.970
areas of the normal distribution and if

233

00:09:15.970  -->  00:09:19.960
you add these two up 34.1 % + 34 .1%

234

00:09:19.960  -->  00:09:23.650
you'll get 68.2 percent, so that is where

235

00:09:23.650  -->  00:09:25.600
the 68 42-percent come from

236

00:09:25.600  -->  00:09:27.580
so you know that theoretically out of

237

00:09:27.580  -->  00:09:29.350
these numbers that you generate which

238

00:09:29.350  -->  00:09:31.960
are there any of them 68.2 percent of

239

00:09:31.960  -->  00:09:34.450
them should fall into that interval

240

00:09:34.450  -->  00:09:38.350
minus 1 to 1. Now what we need to do is

241

00:09:38.350  -->  00:09:40.390
check to test the law of large numbers

242

00:09:40.390  -->  00:09:42.250
what we need to do is check that the

243

00:09:42.250  -->  00:09:46.300
mean of Xn so the measured value of

244

00:09:46.300  -->  00:09:48.910
the actual values so the mean of the

245

00:09:48.910  -->  00:09:52.390
actual measured value across your sample

246

00:09:52.390  -->  00:09:54.850
approaches the expected value which is

247

00:09:54.850  -->  00:09:57.550
over here as you rerun your script while

248

00:09:57.550  -->  00:10:00.070
increasing and so you can imagine n has

249

00:10:00.070  -->  00:10:02.440
to be and input parameter that you can

250

00:10:02.440  -->  00:10:04.150
input into your script at the very top

251

00:10:04.150  -->  00:10:06.160
and you can change it so you might start

252

00:10:06.160  -->  00:10:08.200
with n equal to hundred and you want to

253

00:10:08.200  -->  00:10:11.080
see what the mean will be then you might

254

00:10:11.080  -->  00:10:12.820
want to change into a thousand and you

255

00:10:12.820  -->  00:10:14.140
want to see what I mean will be then

256

00:10:14.140  -->  00:10:16.120
change it to 10,000 and so on and you

257

00:10:16.120  -->  00:10:17.770
want to test that the law of large

258

00:10:17.770  -->  00:10:20.200
numbers holds and what that means is as

259

00:10:20.200  -->  00:10:23.020
you will increase and this mean

260

00:10:23.020  -->  00:10:25.210
so the actual measurement mean of the

261

00:10:25.210  -->  00:10:27.610
actual measurement will be approaching

262

00:10:27.610  -->  00:10:30.340
the expected value closer and closer and

263

00:10:30.340  -->  00:10:32.950
closer. So there you go that's a fun

264

00:10:32.950  -->  00:10:35.470
exercise and that's what we're going to

265

00:10:35.470  -->  00:10:37.690
be doing I hope this all makes sense

266

00:10:37.690  -->  00:10:40.900
it's going to be pretty exciting and if

267

00:10:40.900  -->  00:10:43.960
you are confident that you can give us a

268

00:10:43.960  -->  00:10:46.090
goal right now give us a shot then stop

269

00:10:46.090  -->  00:10:47.980
this video and go for it

270

00:10:47.980  -->  00:10:49.600
go ahead and attempt to create the

271

00:10:49.600  -->  00:10:52.690
script and it requires all the knowledge

272

00:10:52.690  -->  00:10:55.120
that we learned in this section so

273

00:10:55.120  -->  00:10:56.590
you'll have a loop will have an if

274

00:10:56.590  -->  00:10:58.000
statement and so on,

275

00:10:58.000  -->  00:10:59.470
if you'd like to stick around and I 'm

276

00:10:59.470  -->  00:11:01.120
going to give you a hit now so you could

277

00:11:01.120  -->  00:11:03.430
attempt this and come back and check out

278

00:11:03.430  -->  00:11:06.280
the hint if you need some guidance but

279

00:11:06.280  -->  00:11:07.540
what I want to give you

280

00:11:07.540  -->  00:11:09.519
it is because there's one thing that we

281

00:11:09.519  -->  00:11:11.920
didn't actually talk about in this

282

00:11:11.920  -->  00:11:13.570
section that you will need so it's kind

283

00:11:13.570  -->  00:11:15.970
of an intuitive thing but I  would like

284

00:11:15.970  -->  00:11:17.860
to share it with you just to make sure

285

00:11:17.860  -->  00:11:20.350
that you have all the knowledge required

286

00:11:20.350  -->  00:11:23.050
for this exercise so here we go here's a

287

00:11:23.050  -->  00:11:25.000
hint hint number one actually is going

288

00:11:25.000  -->  00:11:26.589
to be to him so we'll start with hint

289

00:11:26.589  -->  00:11:28.810
number one in number one

290

00:11:28.810  -->  00:11:31.810
so you're going to have to have a or

291

00:11:31.810  -->  00:11:33.819
you're going to need a loop which looks

292

00:11:33.819  -->  00:11:35.380
like this well there's many ways to

293

00:11:35.380  -->  00:11:37.269
solve this challenge but in my

294

00:11:37.269  -->  00:11:39.310
solution. I have a loop which looks like

295

00:11:39.310  -->  00:11:41.500
this and the thing that we did not

296

00:11:41.500  -->  00:11:44.050
actually cover in this section is how to

297

00:11:44.050  -->  00:11:47.050
generate multiple normally distributed

298

00:11:47.050  -->  00:11:49.509
random variables and in that case you

299

00:11:49.509  -->  00:11:52.089
need to use Rnorm a hundred or ten

300

00:11:52.089  -->  00:11:54.040
thousand or ten thousand or whatever

301

00:11:54.040  -->  00:11:56.649
number of variables you need so is

302

00:11:56.649  -->  00:11:58.149
that's why I say it's kind of intuitive

303

00:11:58.149  -->  00:12:00.069
because basically when you put one in

304

00:12:00.069  -->  00:12:02.050
here you get one variable if you say

305

00:12:02.050  -->  00:12:04.000
Rnorm a hundred you'll get a vector of a

306

00:12:04.000  -->  00:12:07.750
hundred of these variables and then at

307

00:12:07.750  -->  00:12:09.519
some point once you finish the code you

308

00:12:09.519  -->  00:12:11.290
can just replace hundred everywhere in

309

00:12:11.290  -->  00:12:12.819
your code or a thousand everything your

310

00:12:12.819  -->  00:12:14.560
code with the number and then put a

311

00:12:14.560  -->  00:12:16.959
parameter up over here and which you can

312

00:12:16.959  -->  00:12:19.569
then quickly change into rerun this

313

00:12:19.569  -->  00:12:22.000
script, so this is what the loop is going

314

00:12:22.000  -->  00:12:23.139
to look like they're going to be the

315

00:12:23.139  -->  00:12:25.510
main loop and the other thing I wanted

316

00:12:25.510  -->  00:12:27.190
to mention here is for those of you

317

00:12:27.190  -->  00:12:29.290
coming from a background in other

318

00:12:29.290  -->  00:12:31.930
programming languages so this took me

319

00:12:31.930  -->  00:12:34.990
quite a some time to get my head around

320

00:12:34.990  -->  00:12:37.810
is that I in this case so in other

321

00:12:37.810  -->  00:12:40.300
programming languages I is basically a

322

00:12:40.300  -->  00:12:44.050
counter variable like it goes 1 2 3 4 5

323

00:12:44.050  -->  00:12:47.019
and then you use start from 00 105

324

00:12:47.019  -->  00:12:50.230
and then you use I to access elements of

325

00:12:50.230  -->  00:12:53.380
the array well in our in this way when

326

00:12:53.380  -->  00:12:55.360
you write your loop like this what

327

00:12:55.360  -->  00:12:58.240
happens is I becomes the variable itself

328

00:12:58.240  -->  00:13:00.850
so it's not and just an index it's

329

00:13:00.850  -->  00:13:03.610
actually loop cycling through the

330

00:13:03.610  -->  00:13:05.319
random number of variables that you're

331

00:13:05.319  -->  00:13:06.880
going to generate, so in this case that

332

00:13:06.880  -->  00:13:10.509
they generate variable 75, 43 and so on.

333

00:13:10.509  -->  00:13:12.759
So then i will be equal to seven the

334

00:13:12.759  -->  00:13:14.620
next time I will be equal to five and I

335

00:13:14.620  -->  00:13:16.899
will be equal to 43 so basically don't

336

00:13:16.899  -->  00:13:20.290
try to use I as an index in this cycle

337

00:13:20.290  -->  00:13:20.980
in the loop.

338

00:13:20.980  -->  00:13:23.260
I is the variable itself so that's

339

00:13:23.260  -->  00:13:25.630
that's kind of just for people who are

340

00:13:25.630  -->  00:13:26.829
coming from other programming background

341

00:13:26.829  -->  00:13:30.070
because well this took me awhile to get

342

00:13:30.070  -->  00:13:30.850
used to,

343

00:13:30.850  -->  00:13:32.470
alright so there goes that was hint

344

00:13:32.470  -->  00:13:34.600
number one now you can confidently go

345

00:13:34.600  -->  00:13:36.550
and attempt this exercise because you

346

00:13:36.550  -->  00:13:39.220
have all of the knowledge that is

347

00:13:39.220  -->  00:13:43.209
required for it and finally if you still

348

00:13:43.209  -->  00:13:44.380
have trouble

349

00:13:44.380  -->  00:13:46.899
not a worry it is the first exercise and

350

00:13:46.899  -->  00:13:49.600
you are just learning R it's all ok we

351

00:13:49.600  -->  00:13:51.670
will you will get better and better as

352

00:13:51.670  -->  00:13:52.870
we go through the course because that's

353

00:13:52.870  -->  00:13:54.639
that's what I say that learning

354

00:13:54.639  -->  00:13:56.260
programming language solve and practice so

355

00:13:56.260  -->  00:13:57.880
that's why I have hit number two

356

00:13:57.880  -->  00:13:59.260
prepared for you

357

00:13:59.260  -->  00:14:02.769
so this is in number two and number two

358

00:14:02.769  -->  00:14:05.350
is a fill in the blanks exercise so this

359

00:14:05.350  -->  00:14:07.540
is how my solution looks like once again

360

00:14:07.540  -->  00:14:09.699
they can be multiple ways to solve this

361

00:14:09.699  -->  00:14:10.449
challenge

362

00:14:10.449  -->  00:14:12.160
this is what mine looks like I've were

363

00:14:12.160  -->  00:14:14.589
blanked out some of the things some of

364

00:14:14.589  -->  00:14:17.380
the key elements of the code so go ahead

365

00:14:17.380  -->  00:14:21.070
and copy this into your R studio

366

00:14:21.070  -->  00:14:23.920
and just fill in these blank using the

367

00:14:23.920  -->  00:14:25.300
knowledge that you developed in this

368

00:14:25.300  -->  00:14:27.459
course, so go back to tutorial on loops

369

00:14:27.459  -->  00:14:30.760
on if on variables and so on and try to

370

00:14:30.760  -->  00:14:33.760
fill in the gaps here to complete this

371

00:14:33.760  -->  00:14:36.550
code and then give it a go try running

372

00:14:36.550  -->  00:14:38.589
it and try finishing the challenge and

373

00:14:38.589  -->  00:14:40.810
seeing what happens as you increase and

374

00:14:40.810  -->  00:14:44.470
over here and that's it so this is the

375

00:14:44.470  -->  00:14:47.170
challenge this is the exercise of best

376

00:14:47.170  -->  00:14:49.750
of luck with it and at the very end of

377

00:14:49.750  -->  00:14:51.790
the course there will be a section with

378

00:14:51.790  -->  00:14:53.980
the solutions to homework exercises, so

379

00:14:53.980  -->  00:14:55.029
once you've done

380

00:14:55.029  -->  00:14:57.010
join me in that tutorial for this

381

00:14:57.010  -->  00:14:59.019
specific exercise where we will go

382

00:14:59.019  -->  00:15:00.310
through a challenge and will actually

383

00:15:00.310  -->  00:15:02.319
test the law of large numbers together

384

00:15:02.319  -->  00:15:05.170
and that's it for today I look forward

385

00:15:05.170  -->  00:15:06.220
to seeing you next time

386

00:15:06.220  -->  00:15:11.559
until then, happy coding!
