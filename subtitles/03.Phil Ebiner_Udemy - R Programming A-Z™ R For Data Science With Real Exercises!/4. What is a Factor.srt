00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,960
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:06,960  -->  00:00:08,519
R programming and today we're talking

3

00:00:08,519  -->  00:00:11,040
about factors, so first things first

4

00:00:11,040  -->  00:00:13,049
I've got an image in front of us and

5

00:00:13,049  -->  00:00:14,969
this image will be like our map. It will

6

00:00:14,969  -->  00:00:16,800
be guiding us through this section so we know

7

00:00:16,800  -->  00:00:19,890
what layer of the visualization process

8

00:00:19,890  -->  00:00:21,630
we're talking about in the current tutorial

9

00:00:21,630  -->  00:00:23,160
and as you can see here, today we're

10

00:00:23,160  -->  00:00:24,840
talking about the data layer so the

11

00:00:24,840  -->  00:00:26,430
very first layer we're going to be

12

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:28,080
fiddling around with our data set, so

13

00:00:28,080  -->  00:00:30,779
let's dive straight into it. We got R

14

00:00:30,779  -->  00:00:33,030
studio open up here and let's load the

15

00:00:33,030  -->  00:00:34,770
data set so first of all get working

16

00:00:34,770  -->  00:00:37,800
directory, minus correct but for practice sake

17

00:00:37,800  -->  00:00:40,079
let's say set working directory and

18

00:00:40,079  -->  00:00:42,239
let's set it to what we want.

19

00:00:42,239  -->  00:00:43,890
Check it again and remember on windows

20

00:00:43,890  -->  00:00:45,390
it's a bit different.

21

00:00:45,390  -->  00:00:48,300
Alright now we're going to read the data

22

00:00:48,300  -->  00:00:50,969
set and it's going to be read dot CSV

23

00:00:50,969  -->  00:00:55,559
and here we can say movie ratings dot

24

00:00:55,559  -->  00:00:59,129
CSV. If I run that and I look at the

25

00:00:59,129  -->  00:01:01,980
top rows we'll see that we've got the top

26

00:01:01,980  -->  00:01:04,229
rows here. Let's make some space.

27

00:01:04,229  -->  00:01:06,360
Alright great the six columns are here.

28

00:01:06,360  -->  00:01:08,729
Where these dots coming from,

29

00:01:08,729  -->  00:01:10,170
well if we look at the original file

30

00:01:10,170  -->  00:01:11,729
you'll see that there are spaces, the

31

00:01:11,729  -->  00:01:14,159
percentage signs, dollar signs, brackets and

32

00:01:14,159  -->  00:01:15,869
all those symbols cannot be included in

33

00:01:15,869  -->  00:01:19,020
names so R studio replaces them with

34

00:01:19,020  -->  00:01:20,670
and dots.

35

00:01:20,670  -->  00:01:22,710
Ok so we want to fix it up obviously

36

00:01:22,710  -->  00:01:24,119
it's not convenient to work with the

37

00:01:24,119  -->  00:01:27,060
names of columns like that so let's go

38

00:01:27,060  -->  00:01:29,490
ahead and use column names of favorite

39

00:01:29,490  -->  00:01:32,430
function and run that so you've got the

40

00:01:32,430  -->  00:01:34,020
column names here and as we know we can

41

00:01:34,020  -->  00:01:36,780
actually assign value or vector to column

42

00:01:36,780  -->  00:01:39,420
names, so let's type up a vector. We're

43

00:01:39,420  -->  00:01:41,369
going to say the film will keep the

44

00:01:41,369  -->  00:01:44,880
first to the same, film and genre and then

45

00:01:44,880  -->  00:01:48,060
we're going to say critic rating. The

46

00:01:48,060  -->  00:01:51,299
next will be audience rating right and

47

00:01:51,299  -->  00:01:53,100
they're about to budget and let's

48

00:01:53,100  -->  00:01:54,810
remember that budget is in million so

49

00:01:54,810  -->  00:01:56,909
let's put that in here as well and

50

00:01:56,909  -->  00:02:00,240
finally what year around that now and I

51

00:02:00,240  -->  00:02:05,189
look at the top rows you see that now

52

00:02:05,189  -->  00:02:06,570
everything's beautiful.

53

00:02:06,570  -->  00:02:08,580
Let's just check the bottom rows as we

54

00:02:08,580  -->  00:02:10,229
normally do just to make sure that

55

00:02:10,229  -->  00:02:11,790
everything is consistent everything

56

00:02:11,790  -->  00:02:12,860
looks good. It hasn't

57

00:02:12,860  -->  00:02:14,990
been shifted or anything great! Now

58

00:02:14,990  -->  00:02:17,300
let's look at the structure and what do

59

00:02:17,300  -->  00:02:18,950
we see here? Well this is the point where

60

00:02:18,950  -->  00:02:20,930
we start talking about factors you can

61

00:02:20,930  -->  00:02:23,180
see that we've got two columns that are

62

00:02:23,180  -->  00:02:25,340
actually recognizes factors and what

63

00:02:25,340  -->  00:02:26,150
does that mean?

64

00:02:26,150  -->  00:02:27,800
Well it's factor in R, it's very simple

65

00:02:27,800  -->  00:02:29,330
concept it's basically a categorical

66

00:02:29,330  -->  00:02:31,610
variable. It's a way R works with

67

00:02:31,610  -->  00:02:33,650
categorical variables and as you can see

68

00:02:33,650  -->  00:02:35,810
here there are numbers so there are levels

69

00:02:35,810  -->  00:02:38,030
here and there are numbers so what happens

70

00:02:38,030  -->  00:02:40,100
is R looks through your column. Finds

71

00:02:40,100  -->  00:02:41,990
all the different words that there

72

00:02:41,990  -->  00:02:43,700
exists their action adventure, romance,

73

00:02:43,700  -->  00:02:46,580
comedy, thriller, horror and so on and

74

00:02:46,580  -->  00:02:48,800
assigns each word a number. So if we look

75

00:02:48,800  -->  00:02:50,090
at the top, you'll see here a

76

00:02:50,090  -->  00:02:52,310
comedy-adventure, action-adventure and

77

00:02:52,310  -->  00:02:54,770
R has assigned the numbers 3,2,1,2 so

78

00:02:54,770  -->  00:02:57,080
comedy-adventure, action-adventure. We

79

00:02:57,080  -->  00:02:59,870
don't really mind in which way R

80

00:02:59,870  -->  00:03:01,340
assigns these numbers because we're

81

00:03:01,340  -->  00:03:03,110
never going to be using these variables

82

00:03:03,110  -->  00:03:05,989
all this column for numerical operations

83

00:03:05,989  -->  00:03:08,239
anyway it's just for us it's easier to

84

00:03:08,239  -->  00:03:10,010
understand words, for computers it's

85

00:03:10,010  -->  00:03:11,690
easier to understand numbers and that's

86

00:03:11,690  -->  00:03:14,989
how R just just stores these factors for

87

00:03:14,989  -->  00:03:17,540
us and the giveaway here is that it's a

88

00:03:17,540  -->  00:03:19,790
factor in also the word levels, it always

89

00:03:19,790  -->  00:03:21,860
gives away a factor it tells you what

90

00:03:21,860  -->  00:03:23,989
levels exist in that factor.

91

00:03:23,989  -->  00:03:26,390
Alright so that's our interest to factor.

92

00:03:26,390  -->  00:03:28,549
It's pretty simple concept

93

00:03:28,549  -->  00:03:30,470
let's look at summary for movies now.

94

00:03:30,470  -->  00:03:33,440
Let's see what we have there so we've

95

00:03:33,440  -->  00:03:35,540
got film, that's the name of the film. It's

96

00:03:35,540  -->  00:03:37,340
also recognizes the factors. You can see

97

00:03:37,340  -->  00:03:39,410
here but we're not going to be using the

98

00:03:39,410  -->  00:03:41,720
name of the film at all because we're

99

00:03:41,720  -->  00:03:44,750
actually interested in the trends and

100

00:03:44,750  -->  00:03:47,000
averages and you know all these

101

00:03:47,000  -->  00:03:48,590
aggregations of our data rather than

102

00:03:48,590  -->  00:03:51,110
individual film. Genre, yes we're

103

00:03:51,110  -->  00:03:52,760
interested in genre's category and

104

00:03:52,760  -->  00:03:54,230
that's good that it's recognized as a

105

00:03:54,230  -->  00:03:56,150
factor then we've got critic rating so

106

00:03:56,150  -->  00:03:59,030
you can see that the minimum 09 sound

107

00:03:59,030  -->  00:04:01,940
maximum average 47 average for audience

108

00:04:01,940  -->  00:04:04,310
ratings a bit higher so audience seems

109

00:04:04,310  -->  00:04:06,560
to be a bit more forgiving to movies

110

00:04:06,560  -->  00:04:08,930
then budget so you can see that there

111

00:04:08,930  -->  00:04:11,120
was actually a movie that had a bunch of

112

00:04:11,120  -->  00:04:13,910
300 million dollars which is an insane

113

00:04:13,910  -->  00:04:16,400
amount and finally we get to year what

114

00:04:16,400  -->  00:04:18,620
we see here is that R is treating year

115

00:04:18,620  -->  00:04:20,690
just like it is treating these three

116

00:04:20,690  -->  00:04:23,630
columns, so it's saying all the minimum

117

00:04:23,630  -->  00:04:26,040
has got an average. It's got a maximum

118

00:04:26,040  -->  00:04:28,050
but do we really want that? Like let's

119

00:04:28,050  -->  00:04:29,940
ask that question, do we really

120

00:04:29,940  -->  00:04:31,560
year to be a numeric variable? We're

121

00:04:31,560  -->  00:04:32,790
going to be adding them and we're going

122

00:04:32,790  -->  00:04:34,680
to be averaging the model. We're going to

123

00:04:34,680  -->  00:04:37,170
be doing any arithmetic operations here.

124

00:04:37,170  -->  00:04:38,820
Well the answer to that is no. We want

125

00:04:38,820  -->  00:04:40,920
year to be a categorical variable. We

126

00:04:40,920  -->  00:04:42,960
want a year to be just like genre.

127

00:04:42,960  -->  00:04:45,990
So we can group by year, so we can

128

00:04:45,990  -->  00:04:48,090
color things by year, so we can compare

129

00:04:48,090  -->  00:04:51,180
year to another year and so on so we

130

00:04:51,180  -->  00:04:54,780
want a year to be a factor that's what

131

00:04:54,780  -->  00:04:56,400
we're saying and right now we're going

132

00:04:56,400  -->  00:04:58,110
to learn how to do that. How to convert a

133

00:04:58,110  -->  00:05:00,150
non-factor in numeric variable into a

134

00:05:00,150  -->  00:05:01,860
factor numeric variable because the

135

00:05:01,860  -->  00:05:05,400
thing is that R, when it sees words, it

136

00:05:05,400  -->  00:05:07,470
chooses to recognize them as factors

137

00:05:07,470  -->  00:05:09,780
because there's no not many other

138

00:05:09,780  -->  00:05:12,210
options and when these numbers by

139

00:05:12,210  -->  00:05:13,620
defaulted things that you're going to be

140

00:05:13,620  -->  00:05:15,600
using them as numbers but years we're

141

00:05:15,600  -->  00:05:16,950
not going to be using as numbers. So

142

00:05:16,950  -->  00:05:19,590
let's see how we can convert a years in

143

00:05:19,590  -->  00:05:21,660
factor. So the function that we need is

144

00:05:21,660  -->  00:05:23,460
actually called factor, it's a pretty

145

00:05:23,460  -->  00:05:25,830
straightforward name and all you have to

146

00:05:25,830  -->  00:05:28,470
do is put your vector inside the

147

00:05:28,470  -->  00:05:32,310
function and if we run that of course I

148

00:05:32,310  -->  00:05:35,610
need to give tell it which data set we're

149

00:05:35,610  -->  00:05:37,950
using movies year. So if you run that,

150

00:05:37,950  -->  00:05:40,560
you'll see that that is of variable like

151

00:05:40,560  -->  00:05:42,930
our vector and now it has been converted

152

00:05:42,930  -->  00:05:45,180
into factions giveaways here that has

153

00:05:45,180  -->  00:05:48,510
levels. So it's got all these levels and

154

00:05:48,510  -->  00:05:50,880
that's exactly what we want so the last

155

00:05:50,880  -->  00:05:55,080
step would be to take this actual column

156

00:05:55,080  -->  00:05:56,610
in the data set so this is a column in

157

00:05:56,610  -->  00:05:59,640
the data set and assign it the new

158

00:05:59,640  -->  00:06:03,060
vector which is produced from that same

159

00:06:03,060  -->  00:06:06,180
column by factorizing it. So it gets a

160

00:06:06,180  -->  00:06:08,130
bit of a tricky operation but actually

161

00:06:08,130  -->  00:06:09,180
pretty straightforward.

162

00:06:09,180  -->  00:06:10,770
We're just taking the column and well here

163

00:06:10,770  -->  00:06:12,450
we are converting the column into a

164

00:06:12,450  -->  00:06:14,580
factor so here we've got a vector which

165

00:06:14,580  -->  00:06:16,590
is a factor here and we're then

166

00:06:16,590  -->  00:06:19,320
assigning this into that same column

167

00:06:19,320  -->  00:06:21,990
which used to be, so if we run that now

168

00:06:21,990  -->  00:06:25,980
if I look at summary movies you'll see

169

00:06:25,980  -->  00:06:30,060
that movies is no longer a numeric variable. It's

170

00:06:30,060  -->  00:06:31,830
a factor and we can actually prove that

171

00:06:31,830  -->  00:06:36,300
if we go into str for structure movies run

172

00:06:36,300  -->  00:06:38,190
that you can see that it's a factor with

173

00:06:38,190  -->  00:06:40,050
five levels. So there's five different

174

00:06:40,050  -->  00:06:42,210
years in the data set. There we go, that's

175

00:06:42,210  -->  00:06:44,490
how we work with factors. Very very

176

00:06:44,490  -->  00:06:47,460
simple things but it's always important

177

00:06:47,460  -->  00:06:51,360
to at the very start set exactly what you

178

00:06:51,360  -->  00:06:52,560
want from your data. Do you want to

179

00:06:52,560  -->  00:06:54,360
variable to be a factor? Do you wanted to be a

180

00:06:54,360  -->  00:06:56,129
numeric variable or do you want to be

181

00:06:56,129  -->  00:06:58,409
completely something different. So those

182

00:06:58,409  -->  00:06:59,819
are the important things because then

183

00:06:59,819  -->  00:07:01,680
going forward through this section we're

184

00:07:01,680  -->  00:07:03,270
going to be relying on that quite

185

00:07:03,270  -->  00:07:05,340
heavily and I look forward to seeing in

186

00:07:05,340  -->  00:07:06,270
the next tutorial.

187

00:07:06,270  -->  00:07:18,220
Until then, happy coding.
