00:00:02,470  -->  00:00:07,090
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:07,090  -->  00:00:09,309
R Programming and today we're going to

3

00:00:09,309  -->  00:00:12,340
recap on what we learned in this section

4

00:00:12,340  -->  00:00:14,560
about data frames. Alright in this

5

00:00:14,560  -->  00:00:17,019
section we learned number 1, we saw how

6

00:00:17,019  -->  00:00:18,910
to import data into R. That was a

7

00:00:18,910  -->  00:00:20,710
very exciting tutorial and for me

8

00:00:20,710  -->  00:00:21,999
personally it's quite exciting because

9

00:00:21,999  -->  00:00:24,579
up until this section has been quite

10

00:00:24,579  -->  00:00:26,769
challenging supplying a data sets

11

00:00:26,769  -->  00:00:29,800
for our learning because we didn't know

12

00:00:29,800  -->  00:00:32,230
how to import data into R and I had to supply

13

00:00:32,230  -->  00:00:34,239
the data sets through R code and

14

00:00:34,239  -->  00:00:36,280
existing vectors and code that you would

15

00:00:36,280  -->  00:00:38,050
have to run, but now that we've learned

16

00:00:38,050  -->  00:00:41,050
how to import data into R we, going

17

00:00:41,050  -->  00:00:44,230
forward we can use csv files and we can

18

00:00:44,230  -->  00:00:46,900
just import the data into R so its

19

00:00:46,900  -->  00:00:48,670
much more convenient and I was very

20

00:00:48,670  -->  00:00:50,830
excited to finally get this topic cut off

21

00:00:50,830  -->  00:00:52,510
because ultimately when you're working

22

00:00:52,510  -->  00:00:55,150
with R in your day-to-day job or in

23

00:00:55,150  -->  00:00:56,530
your hobbies you're going to be

24

00:00:56,530  -->  00:00:59,740
importing data as csv files or other

25

00:00:59,740  -->  00:01:01,870
types of file. So its always important

26

00:01:01,870  -->  00:01:03,910
to know these things and in this

27

00:01:03,910  -->  00:01:07,120
specific case we looked at how to first

28

00:01:07,120  -->  00:01:09,909
of all import data using the read csv

29

00:01:09,909  -->  00:01:12,640
function and then choosing the file that

30

00:01:12,640  -->  00:01:15,820
we want manually and also then we saw how

31

00:01:15,820  -->  00:01:18,310
we can change the working directory, so

32

00:01:18,310  -->  00:01:22,060
whether you're on Windows or Mac now you

33

00:01:22,060  -->  00:01:24,580
know how to change the working directory

34

00:01:24,580  -->  00:01:27,400
of your R studio, so that then you can

35

00:01:27,400  -->  00:01:29,710
actually type in the name of the file

36

00:01:29,710  -->  00:01:31,450
into your code. So that was quite

37

00:01:31,450  -->  00:01:33,700
exciting tutorial, then we moved on to

38

00:01:33,700  -->  00:01:35,799
exploring data sets. So I show you

39

00:01:35,799  -->  00:01:38,020
some of the tricks that I used to

40

00:01:38,020  -->  00:01:39,549
explore data sets because it's always

41

00:01:39,549  -->  00:01:41,110
important to get acquainted with the

42

00:01:41,110  -->  00:01:43,479
data set and also check for errors and

43

00:01:43,479  -->  00:01:44,770
some of the functions that I recommend

44

00:01:44,770  -->  00:01:48,430
using R head to check the top six rows

45

00:01:48,430  -->  00:01:50,229
or whatever number of rows you specify

46

00:01:50,229  -->  00:01:53,229
tail to check the bottom rows, then the

47

00:01:53,229  -->  00:01:54,970
summary to get the summary of all the

48

00:01:54,970  -->  00:01:57,280
columns in your data set and the str for

49

00:01:57,280  -->  00:02:00,490
structure to get the overall structure

50

00:02:00,490  -->  00:02:02,680
of your data set and see what type of

51

00:02:02,680  -->  00:02:04,750
columns it has and some just sample

52

00:02:04,750  -->  00:02:08,349
values from there. So that's what we did

53

00:02:08,349  -->  00:02:10,269
for exploring data sets, then we

54

00:02:10,269  -->  00:02:12,099
learned how to use the dollar sign. So

55

00:02:12,099  -->  00:02:14,680
the dollar sign is very specific to data

56

00:02:14,680  -->  00:02:16,060
frames. It allows you

57

00:02:16,060  -->  00:02:19,060
to its kind of a shortcut to accessing

58

00:02:19,060  -->  00:02:21,430
the columns by their names because

59

00:02:21,430  -->  00:02:24,130
usually in a data frame columns would

60

00:02:24,130  -->  00:02:26,620
have names because that's how data

61

00:02:26,620  -->  00:02:28,870
is normally stored in its source and

62

00:02:28,870  -->  00:02:30,580
then you can just say that data

63

00:02:30,580  -->  00:02:32,769
frames, name dollar sign and then the

64

00:02:32,769  -->  00:02:35,290
column name that way it's a very quick

65

00:02:35,290  -->  00:02:37,750
approach to accessing separate columns

66

00:02:37,750  -->  00:02:40,330
in your data frame. That way it's a

67

00:02:40,330  -->  00:02:41,860
very quick approach to accessing

68

00:02:41,860  -->  00:02:44,349
separate columns in your data frame. Next

69

00:02:44,349  -->  00:02:46,030
we talked about basic operations

70

00:02:46,030  -->  00:02:48,250
with your data frames, so here we saw

71

00:02:48,250  -->  00:02:51,549
that we could look at different columns

72

00:02:51,549  -->  00:02:52,959
we could add them, we could perform

73

00:02:52,959  -->  00:02:54,489
mathematical operations with them, we

74

00:02:54,489  -->  00:02:56,290
could add columns into data frames,  we

75

00:02:56,290  -->  00:02:58,030
could get rid of columns from data

76

00:02:58,030  -->  00:03:01,330
frames by just setting them to null and

77

00:03:01,330  -->  00:03:03,430
things like that. So very simple things

78

00:03:03,430  -->  00:03:05,709
operations of data frames and they

79

00:03:05,709  -->  00:03:07,569
were pretty straightforward and quite

80

00:03:07,569  -->  00:03:10,269
made quite a lot of sense and also by

81

00:03:10,269  -->  00:03:12,519
the way in these tutorials we also

82

00:03:12,519  -->  00:03:14,470
talked about factors so that was all

83

00:03:14,470  -->  00:03:16,630
kind of first encounter with factors and

84

00:03:16,630  -->  00:03:18,610
that they have different levels and

85

00:03:18,610  -->  00:03:20,560
we'll talk more about factors further

86

00:03:20,560  -->  00:03:22,180
down in the course but it was good to

87

00:03:22,180  -->  00:03:24,700
know how R stores categorical

88

00:03:24,700  -->  00:03:27,070
variables because we did have a couple

89

00:03:27,070  -->  00:03:29,410
of those in our data sets. Then we talked

90

00:03:29,410  -->  00:03:31,030
about filtering a data frame it's a

91

00:03:31,030  -->  00:03:32,290
very important topic but at the same

92

00:03:32,290  -->  00:03:34,540
time like even though it may have seemed

93

00:03:34,540  -->  00:03:37,209
to be a bit complicated, it's not at all

94

00:03:37,209  -->  00:03:39,310
and we saw that in that tutorial that

95

00:03:39,310  -->  00:03:41,170
filtering a data frame is you just

96

00:03:41,170  -->  00:03:43,569
create a logical variable which is the

97

00:03:43,569  -->  00:03:45,940
filter and then you use that to filter

98

00:03:45,940  -->  00:03:47,560
out the rows and in fact you can

99

00:03:47,560  -->  00:03:49,209
actually combine the two so all it

100

00:03:49,209  -->  00:03:51,190
all filled, fits in one line and that's

101

00:03:51,190  -->  00:03:52,989
what filtering data frame's all about,

102

00:03:52,989  -->  00:03:55,120
selecting the roads you want based on

103

00:03:55,120  -->  00:03:58,090
some certain criteria and then we had an

104

00:03:58,090  -->  00:03:59,980
introduction to Q plot so it was just

105

00:03:59,980  -->  00:04:02,709
basically a quick tutorial to see what

106

00:04:02,709  -->  00:04:04,510
kind of function it is and what it is

107

00:04:04,510  -->  00:04:07,180
capable of doing. Kind of like a teaser

108

00:04:07,180  -->  00:04:09,069
of what's coming up in the next section

109

00:04:09,069  -->  00:04:10,480
when we'll be talking a lot about the

110

00:04:10,480  -->  00:04:13,269
visualization. Then we actually use Q plot

111

00:04:13,269  -->  00:04:16,090
to solve the challenge. We built a beautiful

112

00:04:16,090  -->  00:04:18,250
scatter plot that told a wonderful

113

00:04:18,250  -->  00:04:21,250
story about internet usage and birth

114

00:04:21,250  -->  00:04:25,090
statistics and that was the deliverable

115

00:04:25,090  -->  00:04:27,070
that we were after. So basically we solve

116

00:04:27,070  -->  00:04:29,860
the challenge but then we got an

117

00:04:29,860  -->  00:04:31,990
additional challenge and some additional

118

00:04:31,990  -->  00:04:33,909
data, so we moved on to the next part

119

00:04:33,909  -->  00:04:35,979
of the section. Where we were building

120

00:04:35,979  -->  00:04:38,650
data frames, we use the data dot frame

121

00:04:38,650  -->  00:04:40,960
function which is kind of very similar

122

00:04:40,960  -->  00:04:45,729
to C bind. So combining a set of

123

00:04:45,729  -->  00:04:48,729
vectors into a matrix using as if they

124

00:04:48,729  -->  00:04:50,680
were columns data frame does a

125

00:04:50,680  -->  00:04:52,270
similar thing but it combines the

126

00:04:52,270  -->  00:04:54,819
vectors into a data frame and also here

127

00:04:54,819  -->  00:04:57,039
we learned how to specify the names of

128

00:04:57,039  -->  00:04:59,199
the columns of the data frame right

129

00:04:59,199  -->  00:05:01,870
away in the data frame function. So a

130

00:05:01,870  -->  00:05:04,599
shortcut that allows us to avoid using

131

00:05:04,599  -->  00:05:06,699
the column names function and that's

132

00:05:06,699  -->  00:05:08,080
something that you will definitely see

133

00:05:08,080  -->  00:05:10,300
in other people's cause just because

134

00:05:10,300  -->  00:05:12,430
that's the normal convention of doing

135

00:05:12,430  -->  00:05:14,289
things. Then we talked about merging

136

00:05:14,289  -->  00:05:15,969
data frames we just emerged function

137

00:05:15,969  -->  00:05:18,430
and that's a way to join to data

138

00:05:18,430  -->  00:05:21,939
frames together based on one column that

139

00:05:21,939  -->  00:05:24,250
they share so one column that they have

140

00:05:24,250  -->  00:05:24,879
in common.

141

00:05:24,879  -->  00:05:26,259
You can merge the two data frames

142

00:05:26,259  -->  00:05:28,870
together to get a bigger data frame with

143

00:05:28,870  -->  00:05:30,909
the data from the two first data

144

00:05:30,909  -->  00:05:32,889
frames. So that that is a very important

145

00:05:32,889  -->  00:05:34,960
thing to know and there is so much more

146

00:05:34,960  -->  00:05:37,539
to emerging in R. So that is just like us

147

00:05:37,539  -->  00:05:39,190
getting introduction to emerging when

148

00:05:39,190  -->  00:05:41,919
you do encounter merging in your

149

00:05:41,919  -->  00:05:43,990
day-to-day work it's always a good idea

150

00:05:43,990  -->  00:05:46,089
to go and learn more about this topic

151

00:05:46,089  -->  00:05:48,430
because you can create inner joins you,

152

00:05:48,430  -->  00:05:50,020
can create outer joins, you can get

153

00:05:50,020  -->  00:05:52,300
different types of joints we just did

154

00:05:52,300  -->  00:05:54,430
the very basic joint and you already saw

155

00:05:54,430  -->  00:05:57,550
that it's very simple. So it's very easy

156

00:05:57,550  -->  00:05:59,409
to get up to speed just depends on what

157

00:05:59,409  -->  00:06:01,240
you will need for your day-to-day row

158

00:06:01,240  -->  00:06:02,979
but it's very good that we have already

159

00:06:02,979  -->  00:06:05,620
covered off the basics of merging in the

160

00:06:05,620  -->  00:06:09,009
section and then we talked about you

161

00:06:09,009  -->  00:06:11,169
Q plot again. So we covered also some

162

00:06:11,169  -->  00:06:13,839
interesting parts of Q plot like we

163

00:06:13,839  -->  00:06:15,370
talked about shapes, we talked about

164

00:06:15,370  -->  00:06:17,680
setting transparency so the Alpha

165

00:06:17,680  -->  00:06:20,289
parameter and we talked about changing

166

00:06:20,289  -->  00:06:22,750
the title of our plot and if you enjoyed

167

00:06:22,750  -->  00:06:24,310
that you'll definitely enjoy the next

168

00:06:24,310  -->  00:06:25,719
section of the course because we'll be

169

00:06:25,719  -->  00:06:28,569
talking about visualization all the time.

170

00:06:28,569  -->  00:06:31,900
It will be all dedicated to building

171

00:06:31,900  -->  00:06:34,120
stunning visualizations that will

172

00:06:34,120  -->  00:06:36,159
captivate your audience. So I hope you

173

00:06:36,159  -->  00:06:37,959
enjoyed this section and you learned a

174

00:06:37,959  -->  00:06:39,849
lot about data frames. Data frames are

175

00:06:39,849  -->  00:06:41,620
indeed our door into the world of

176

00:06:41,620  -->  00:06:43,280
analytics and data science because

177

00:06:43,280  -->  00:06:47,420
that is basically how you store the

178

00:06:47,420  -->  00:06:49,340
data you're analyzing in R and

179

00:06:49,340  -->  00:06:50,930
that's how you work with it in this

180

00:06:50,930  -->  00:06:53,720
programming language and remember to do

181

00:06:53,720  -->  00:06:56,210
the quiz for this section to have a

182

00:06:56,210  -->  00:06:58,639
quick self-assessment and of course as

183

00:06:58,639  -->  00:07:01,400
always I have another interesting

184

00:07:01,400  -->  00:07:03,620
homework challenge prepared for you. I'm

185

00:07:03,620  -->  00:07:05,810
sure you're going to enjoy that and get

186

00:07:05,810  -->  00:07:09,350
some valuable hands-on time with R

187

00:07:09,350  -->  00:07:11,360
programming and I look forward to seeing

188

00:07:11,360  -->  00:07:12,440
you in the next tutorial,

189

00:07:12,440  -->  00:07:24,509
until then happy coding.
