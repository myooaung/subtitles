00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.529
Hello and welcome to the fourth section

2

00:00:07.529  -->  00:00:10.019
of the R programming course. Are you

3

00:00:10.019  -->  00:00:12.540
pumped? Because I am super pumped I 'm

4

00:00:12.540  -->  00:00:14.400
super excited about this section. I have

5

00:00:14.400  -->  00:00:16.619
prepared an awesome data set for

6

00:00:16.619  -->  00:00:18.029
you guys and we're going to learn a lot

7

00:00:18.029  -->  00:00:20.609
about R while performing a very

8

00:00:20.609  -->  00:00:22.439
exciting challenge.

9

00:00:22.439  -->  00:00:25.500
Ok basketball trends, project brief what

10

00:00:25.500  -->  00:00:26.310
do we have here?

11

00:00:26.310  -->  00:00:28.800
Well first of all for those of you who

12

00:00:28.800  -->  00:00:30.869
don't know what the NBA is, I understand a

13

00:00:30.869  -->  00:00:33.360
lot of you guys know what the NBA is but

14

00:00:33.360  -->  00:00:35.219
still we have students from all over the

15

00:00:35.219  -->  00:00:37.890
world so the NBA is the national

16

00:00:37.890  -->  00:00:40.590
basketball association in America and

17

00:00:40.590  -->  00:00:43.050
that is the main basketball league and

18

00:00:43.050  -->  00:00:44.940
most of the players that you've heard of

19

00:00:44.940  -->  00:00:47.820
like firing Michael Jordan, they play and

20

00:00:47.820  -->  00:00:50.100
played in the NBA. So we're going to be

21

00:00:50.100  -->  00:00:52.829
analyzing the NBA players.

22

00:00:52.829  -->  00:00:54.660
Alright what we're going to do you here?Well

23

00:00:54.660  -->  00:00:57.120
we're going to take the top ten paid

24

00:00:57.120  -->  00:00:58.949
players right now.

25

00:00:58.949  -->  00:01:00.180
There they are on your screen the

26

00:01:00.180  -->  00:01:02.640
highest-paid players of the 2015-2016

27

00:01:02.640  -->  00:01:05.129
season and there they are, their salaries.

28

00:01:05.129  -->  00:01:06.570
This is all publicly available

29

00:01:06.570  -->  00:01:09.270
information and we're going to take all

30

00:01:09.270  -->  00:01:11.070
these 10 players and we're going to

31

00:01:11.070  -->  00:01:13.979
analyze how have they been playing over

32

00:01:13.979  -->  00:01:15.960
the past 10 years.

33

00:01:15.960  -->  00:01:17.340
Imagine that we're going to take data

34

00:01:17.340  -->  00:01:19.439
for the past 10 years and we are going to look

35

00:01:19.439  -->  00:01:22.110
at how they've been playing in those

36

00:01:22.110  -->  00:01:24.479
years. So your goal for this challenge is

37

00:01:24.479  -->  00:01:27.750
to simply investigate trends and

38

00:01:27.750  -->  00:01:30.210
patterns that you see in their

39

00:01:30.210  -->  00:01:31.470
performance over the past 10 years

40

00:01:31.470  -->  00:01:33.659
because ultimately they haven't always

41

00:01:33.659  -->  00:01:35.670
been at the top 10 players right? Let's

42

00:01:35.670  -->  00:01:37.619
see how they got there. Let's see how

43

00:01:37.619  -->  00:01:39.420
they have been improving and was being

44

00:01:39.420  -->  00:01:42.030
changing about their game and so on and

45

00:01:42.030  -->  00:01:44.520
don't worry if you don't know anything

46

00:01:44.520  -->  00:01:46.979
about basketball I was in a very similar

47

00:01:46.979  -->  00:01:49.259
situation but you will literally

48

00:01:49.259  -->  00:01:50.939
understand everything as we go through, I

49

00:01:50.939  -->  00:01:52.829
will make sure to cover off all of the

50

00:01:52.829  -->  00:01:55.079
basic knowledge that we'll need and we will

51

00:01:55.079  -->  00:01:57.149
have heaps of fun. So let's quickly have

52

00:01:57.149  -->  00:01:58.860
a look at the stats that we'll be

53

00:01:58.860  -->  00:02:01.979
analyzing. Here we've got stats for one

54

00:02:01.979  -->  00:02:04.170
of the players and the basketball fans

55

00:02:04.170  -->  00:02:06.810
can you guess who this player is and

56

00:02:06.810  -->  00:02:08.849
here you can see this player stats for

57

00:02:08.849  -->  00:02:12.000
his full professional career and what I

58

00:02:12.000  -->  00:02:13.650
have outlined in red are the stats

59

00:02:13.650  -->  00:02:16.260
that I'll be looking at. Alright so going

60

00:02:16.260  -->  00:02:17.939
from left to right, here we've got the

61

00:02:17.939  -->  00:02:20.909
years that we'll be looking at, 2005-2006

62

00:02:20.909  -->  00:02:24.450
is the first season and 2014-2015 is the

63

00:02:24.450  -->  00:02:29.800
final season will be looking at. Why aren't we looking at the current 2015-16 season?

64

00:02:29.909  -->  00:02:31.439
Well that is because at the time of

65

00:02:31.439  -->  00:02:33.750
making this video this season isn't yet

66

00:02:33.750  -->  00:02:35.700
finished. So I didn't want to look at

67

00:02:35.700  -->  00:02:37.349
data that's the for incomplete

68

00:02:37.349  -->  00:02:39.930
season if you're a hardcore basketball

69

00:02:39.930  -->  00:02:41.819
fan page you want to have the most

70

00:02:41.819  -->  00:02:43.319
up-to-date data and when you're watching

71

00:02:43.319  -->  00:02:45.420
this video this season is finished then

72

00:02:45.420  -->  00:02:47.400
feel free also we finish this section

73

00:02:47.400  -->  00:02:49.470
you can go back and just modify the data

74

00:02:49.470  -->  00:02:51.359
and by then you will know how to do that

75

00:02:51.359  -->  00:02:53.670
and then you can just re updated and

76

00:02:53.670  -->  00:02:55.319
performance the same analysis or whatever

77

00:02:55.319  -->  00:02:57.569
analysis you may wish to with the new

78

00:02:57.569  -->  00:02:59.400
data it's all possible after this

79

00:02:59.400  -->  00:03:01.889
section. You will know how to do it.

80

00:03:01.889  -->  00:03:03.930
Alright so then we'll be looking at

81

00:03:03.930  -->  00:03:06.870
this column. This is the total games

82

00:03:06.870  -->  00:03:09.030
played by this player in each of those

83

00:03:09.030  -->  00:03:11.970
seasons then here we've got MPG which

84

00:03:11.970  -->  00:03:15.239
stands for minutes per game and we won't

85

00:03:15.239  -->  00:03:17.129
be looking at minutes per game that's

86

00:03:17.129  -->  00:03:19.500
one of the tables that we'll derive. We'll

87

00:03:19.500  -->  00:03:21.510
actually have an input table of the

88

00:03:21.510  -->  00:03:24.180
total minutes that player played in that

89

00:03:24.180  -->  00:03:27.239
whole season and then here we've got FG

90

00:03:27.239  -->  00:03:28.680
percentage I know this all looks

91

00:03:28.680  -->  00:03:31.199
complicated but it really isn't. So the

92

00:03:31.199  -->  00:03:33.419
FG stands for field goals. So how

93

00:03:33.419  -->  00:03:36.329
many basketball did that person a throw

94

00:03:36.329  -->  00:03:38.459
into the hoop during the game. So not

95

00:03:38.459  -->  00:03:40.349
when they get penalties but actually

96

00:03:40.349  -->  00:03:41.549
while they're playing, so either two

97

00:03:41.549  -->  00:03:44.579
points or three points. How many what is

98

00:03:44.579  -->  00:03:46.409
the accuracy of that player? Once again

99

00:03:46.409  -->  00:03:48.449
we won't be looking at this exact table.

100

00:03:48.449  -->  00:03:50.459
This is one of the tables we'll derive

101

00:03:50.459  -->  00:03:52.829
and that is part of our challenge, we

102

00:03:52.829  -->  00:03:55.169
will have a table on the actual number

103

00:03:55.169  -->  00:03:57.750
of field goals and we will have a table

104

00:03:57.750  -->  00:04:00.569
on the number of field goal attempt. So

105

00:04:00.569  -->  00:04:02.400
basically if you divide one number by

106

00:04:02.400  -->  00:04:03.540
the other than you'll get this

107

00:04:03.540  -->  00:04:06.419
percentage and finally here we've got

108

00:04:06.419  -->  00:04:09.629
the points per game, once again this is

109

00:04:09.629  -->  00:04:12.569
the number of points that a player

110

00:04:12.569  -->  00:04:15.359
scored in that whole seasons per game

111

00:04:15.359  -->  00:04:18.449
but we will have a table of the total

112

00:04:18.449  -->  00:04:20.190
number of points the person has

113

00:04:20.190  -->  00:04:22.529
scored in that season. So there we go,

114

00:04:22.529  -->  00:04:25.260
we'll have lots of input data you'll see

115

00:04:25.260  -->  00:04:27.420
that's going to be quite a lot of it,

116

00:04:27.420  -->  00:04:29.100
it's going to be enormous compared to

117

00:04:29.100  -->  00:04:31.860
what we've seen before but nevertheless

118

00:04:31.860  -->  00:04:33.600
we'll follow through it and this is one of

119

00:04:33.600  -->  00:04:35.400
the beauties of this section because now

120

00:04:35.400  -->  00:04:37.590
we're ready to jump into the world of

121

00:04:37.590  -->  00:04:39.840
R and analysis and data because we've

122

00:04:39.840  -->  00:04:42.090
done all the foundations of programming,

123

00:04:42.090  -->  00:04:44.700
fundamentals of R and now is the time

124

00:04:44.700  -->  00:04:45.960
for the fun stuff.

125

00:04:45.960  -->  00:04:48.570
Ok so this is what we're doing, where do

126

00:04:48.570  -->  00:04:49.440
you get the data?

127

00:04:49.440  -->  00:04:52.950
Well let me show you. If you go to as

128

00:04:52.950  -->  00:04:56.220
previously, you go to www.superdatascience.com/rcourse

129

00:04:56.220  -->  00:05:00.330
right? So if

130

00:05:00.330  -->  00:05:02.880
you go to this website as we did in the

131

00:05:02.880  -->  00:05:04.830
previous sections and you go to scroll

132

00:05:04.830  -->  00:05:08.490
down to section 4 matrices then the data

133

00:05:08.490  -->  00:05:11.010
set is this second file over here. So the

134

00:05:11.010  -->  00:05:12.390
first file is the challenge that is that

135

00:05:12.390  -->  00:05:15.840
presentation that we just looked at and

136

00:05:15.840  -->  00:05:17.340
the basketball data set that's what

137

00:05:17.340  -->  00:05:18.240
we're going to be using throughout the

138

00:05:18.240  -->  00:05:20.190
course, then these will come later when

139

00:05:20.190  -->  00:05:22.740
we're finishing this section.

140

00:05:22.740  -->  00:05:25.020
Ok so once you've downloaded this file

141

00:05:25.020  -->  00:05:26.730
let me show you what it looks like

142

00:05:26.730  -->  00:05:28.440
inside. This is what, this is what it

143

00:05:28.440  -->  00:05:30.120
looks like inside and to get here what

144

00:05:30.120  -->  00:05:31.290
you need to do is once you've downloaded

145

00:05:31.290  -->  00:05:35.010
it you need to unzip the file and what

146

00:05:35.010  -->  00:05:36.990
you will see is first this will be the

147

00:05:36.990  -->  00:05:38.700
zip file to downloaded. Once you unzip it,

148

00:05:38.700  -->  00:05:41.250
it'll be just the basketball,

149

00:05:41.250  -->  00:05:44.070
s4-basketballdata.r file so just

150

00:05:44.070  -->  00:05:46.560
open it just like the way I just did so

151

00:05:46.560  -->  00:05:48.870
open a file from our student and open this

152

00:05:48.870  -->  00:05:51.090
file and once you have the file this is

153

00:05:51.090  -->  00:05:52.530
what it will look like. So I've got some

154

00:05:52.530  -->  00:05:54.690
comments, I wrote you a little comment over

155

00:05:54.690  -->  00:05:55.440
here.

156

00:05:55.440  -->  00:05:57.360
Welcome to the world of basketball data.

157

00:05:57.360  -->  00:05:58.920
I'm sure you will enjoy this section of

158

00:05:58.920  -->  00:06:01.800
the R programming course and I sure am

159

00:06:01.800  -->  00:06:04.680
sure you will enjoy it. So here you've

160

00:06:04.680  -->  00:06:06.060
got some instructions for the data set

161

00:06:06.060  -->  00:06:07.950
but I won't bore you by reading all of this.

162

00:06:07.950  -->  00:06:09.270
I'll just tell you what you have to do,

163

00:06:09.270  -->  00:06:12.840
all you have to do is once you have got

164

00:06:12.840  -->  00:06:15.990
this file, just click control A if you're in

165

00:06:15.990  -->  00:06:18.390
a windows machine or command A if you're

166

00:06:18.390  -->  00:06:20.190
on a Mac and select everything basically,

167

00:06:20.190  -->  00:06:22.200
select all of the lines. It's lots and lots

168

00:06:22.200  -->  00:06:24.840
of lines here, you see like we're not

169

00:06:24.840  -->  00:06:26.130
going to go through them right now.

170

00:06:26.130  -->  00:06:28.470
What's what's going on but we're just

171

00:06:28.470  -->  00:06:30.570
going to execute them, so just run these

172

00:06:30.570  -->  00:06:35.040
lines, command enter or control enter and

173

00:06:35.040  -->  00:06:36.780
once you run these lines what you'll see

174

00:06:36.780  -->  00:06:37.760
is you

175

00:06:37.760  -->  00:06:40.400
get the data. So basically this script

176

00:06:40.400  -->  00:06:42.620
is used to supply your data. That's

177

00:06:42.620  -->  00:06:45.140
because we haven't had studied how to

178

00:06:45.140  -->  00:06:47.960
import data from files and so on and it's

179

00:06:47.960  -->  00:06:49.490
bit early for us that will come later in

180

00:06:49.490  -->  00:06:50.870
the course but don't worry we'll get

181

00:06:50.870  -->  00:06:52.490
there but for now this is just the

182

00:06:52.490  -->  00:06:54.950
easiest way for us to get the data into

183

00:06:54.950  -->  00:06:57.200
our environment, so once you have the

184

00:06:57.200  -->  00:06:58.730
data, there we go.

185

00:06:58.730  -->  00:07:01.220
It's all populated, I know if this might

186

00:07:01.220  -->  00:07:04.130
look like a lot and it might look a bit

187

00:07:04.130  -->  00:07:06.440
overwhelming at first but don't worry

188

00:07:06.440  -->  00:07:07.670
that's what data science is about

189

00:07:07.670  -->  00:07:10.160
there'll be lots and lots of data and our

190

00:07:10.160  -->  00:07:13.070
goal is to learn how to manage it and

191

00:07:13.070  -->  00:07:16.820
how to analyze it right? So let's go to a

192

00:07:16.820  -->  00:07:19.820
new file because once we loaded this

193

00:07:19.820  -->  00:07:21.260
data we don't really have to

194

00:07:21.260  -->  00:07:23.060
continue that script right? That's the

195

00:07:23.060  -->  00:07:25.940
beauty of R studio that this data

196

00:07:25.940  -->  00:07:27.560
has been loaded into the environment and

197

00:07:27.560  -->  00:07:30.020
we can use it in a brand new script so

198

00:07:30.020  -->  00:07:32.150
in order not to play around with this

199

00:07:32.150  -->  00:07:35.540
script. Just create a new one and we

200

00:07:35.540  -->  00:07:38.930
will start our section here so we're not

201

00:07:38.930  -->  00:07:41.240
going to do any programming in this

202

00:07:41.240  -->  00:07:42.920
tutorial per se. This tutorial was just to

203

00:07:42.920  -->  00:07:44.840
show you the data but what I did want to

204

00:07:44.840  -->  00:07:46.880
show you is just an example of one of

205

00:07:46.880  -->  00:07:49.220
the elements of data that we have. So

206

00:07:49.220  -->  00:07:50.780
let's say we want to look at the

207

00:07:50.780  -->  00:07:52.400
salaries. We've already seen the salaries.

208

00:07:52.400  -->  00:07:53.270
Let's say we want to look at salary.

209

00:07:53.270  -->  00:07:54.920
We see that there's an object here

210

00:07:54.920  -->  00:07:57.530
called salary so if we just type in salary

211

00:07:57.530  -->  00:08:01.100
as we know and run this, what we will get,

212

00:08:01.100  -->  00:08:03.140
let me just make some more space here

213

00:08:03.140  -->  00:08:06.530
because this is a big object and they

214

00:08:06.530  -->  00:08:07.820
were go it fits. So what we'll

215

00:08:07.820  -->  00:08:10.160
get is the salaries of these players so

216

00:08:10.160  -->  00:08:11.870
here are the top 10 players that are the

217

00:08:11.870  -->  00:08:13.400
top 10 now once again they haven't

218

00:08:13.400  -->  00:08:15.620
always been the top 10 but we want to

219

00:08:15.620  -->  00:08:18.230
see how they have been progressing

220

00:08:18.230  -->  00:08:19.760
throughout their careers in the past 10

221

00:08:19.760  -->  00:08:23.270
years. So the players are top-10 paid

222

00:08:23.270  -->  00:08:26.720
players right now we we have a table on

223

00:08:26.720  -->  00:08:29.420
all of their salaries. So what their

224

00:08:29.420  -->  00:08:32.240
salary was back in 2005, 2006, 2007

225

00:08:32.240  -->  00:08:35.419
and all the way up to 2014.

226

00:08:35.419  -->  00:08:37.669
Now what you might say is that the Kirill,

227

00:08:37.669  -->  00:08:39.229
we haven't learned how to deal with

228

00:08:39.229  -->  00:08:40.640
tables yet

229

00:08:40.640  -->  00:08:42.349
and in fact this table has a name it's a

230

00:08:42.349  -->  00:08:44.780
matrix and that's correct, we don't know

231

00:08:44.780  -->  00:08:46.940
how to deal with matrices yet. We know

232

00:08:46.940  -->  00:08:48.350
how to deal with vectors but not

233

00:08:48.350  -->  00:08:49.420
matrices

234

00:08:49.420  -->  00:08:52.120
and that's exactly what we will attend

235

00:08:52.120  -->  00:08:54.279
to in the next tutorial. We will talk

236

00:08:54.279  -->  00:08:56.019
about matrices and we'll learn

237

00:08:56.019  -->  00:08:58.839
everything about them and we will learn

238

00:08:58.839  -->  00:09:01.149
how to build matrices and that is the

239

00:09:01.149  -->  00:09:02.860
goal of this section, to learn how to

240

00:09:02.860  -->  00:09:05.019
operate with matrices so that's kind of

241

00:09:05.019  -->  00:09:08.470
like a step up from a vector and on that

242

00:09:08.470  -->  00:09:10.420
note let's finish this tutorial

243

00:09:10.420  -->  00:09:12.550
go ahead and load the data into your

244

00:09:12.550  -->  00:09:14.560
machines and I will see you on the next

245

00:09:14.560  -->  00:09:27.320
tutorial and until then, happy coding!
