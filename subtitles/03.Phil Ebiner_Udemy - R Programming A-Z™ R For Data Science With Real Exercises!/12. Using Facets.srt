00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,200
Hello and welcome back to the course on R

2

00:00:07,200  -->  00:00:10,050
programming and today we're moving a step up.

3

00:00:10,050  -->  00:00:13,650
Today we're talking about facets. Facets

4

00:00:13,650  -->  00:00:17,580
layering of our visualization process so

5

00:00:17,580  -->  00:00:20,220
let's move into R studio and get

6

00:00:20,220  -->  00:00:22,230
started with facets.

7

00:00:22,230  -->  00:00:25,109
Ok so what we're going to look at? Well

8

00:00:25,109  -->  00:00:27,090
let's start by looking at our histogram

9

00:00:27,090  -->  00:00:29,939
that created quite a while ago so it's

10

00:00:29,939  -->  00:00:32,820
going to be R, S, T, U, V is going to be

11

00:00:32,820  -->  00:00:35,190
our letter today and we're going to

12

00:00:35,190  -->  00:00:38,309
recreate that histogram ggplot data

13

00:00:38,309  -->  00:00:42,930
equals movies aesthetic whoops x equals

14

00:00:42,930  -->  00:00:46,469
budget millions around that. That's how

15

00:00:46,469  -->  00:00:48,930
V and I will say V let's add some

16

00:00:48,930  -->  00:00:53,520
geometry, geom histogram, binwidth equals

17

00:00:53,520  -->  00:00:57,750
10 aesthetics. We want to fill remember

18

00:00:57,750  -->  00:00:59,550
want to connect the filled, so maybe let's

19

00:00:59,550  -->  00:01:00,840
create like this one out.

20

00:01:00,840  -->  00:01:03,420
I just create that that's how histogram

21

00:01:03,420  -->  00:01:06,720
now we want to say comma aesthetics fill

22

00:01:06,720  -->  00:01:10,170
equals is genre. Alright that gives us

23

00:01:10,170  -->  00:01:12,659
this blurry,

24

00:01:12,659  -->  00:01:15,390
that's the word. A very blurry histogram

25

00:01:15,390  -->  00:01:18,240
so we want to add some boarders to it

26

00:01:18,240  -->  00:01:20,549
and we do that with color and what are

27

00:01:20,549  -->  00:01:22,290
we doing now? We're going to map or we're

28

00:01:22,290  -->  00:01:23,729
going to set the color. If we want to

29

00:01:23,729  -->  00:01:26,820
color to be consistent for all of these

30

00:01:26,820  -->  00:01:27,869
bars.

31

00:01:27,869  -->  00:01:29,939
That's right, we we just want to set the

32

00:01:29,939  -->  00:01:31,920
color and we set our choosing the

33

00:01:31,920  -->  00:01:34,590
aesthetics function so we just say color

34

00:01:34,590  -->  00:01:36,720
equals black. I hope you can see how

35

00:01:36,720  -->  00:01:39,210
mapping and setting is playing out in

36

00:01:39,210  -->  00:01:42,210
this whole section so far. So there we go

37

00:01:42,210  -->  00:01:45,210
we've got this kind of comical looking

38

00:01:45,210  -->  00:01:48,360
chart which is fine which I kind of like

39

00:01:48,360  -->  00:01:50,369
how it looks. So there we go, that's our

40

00:01:50,369  -->  00:01:52,890
bar plot or histogram but at the same

41

00:01:52,890  -->  00:01:55,200
time it's not very legible right so you

42

00:01:55,200  -->  00:01:57,420
can see what's going on with the action

43

00:01:57,420  -->  00:01:59,280
over here maybe you can see a bit what's

44

00:01:59,280  -->  00:02:01,320
going on with the comedy but with the

45

00:02:01,320  -->  00:02:03,930
drama this town of kind of histograms

46

00:02:03,930  -->  00:02:06,540
they are hard to read because the the drama

47

00:02:06,540  -->  00:02:09,360
wasn't because of the drama because

48

00:02:09,360  -->  00:02:11,760
there because the drama is the drama,

49

00:02:11,760  -->  00:02:12,690
horror,

50

00:02:12,690  -->  00:02:15,270
the romance that all of these categories

51

00:02:15,270  -->  00:02:17,790
they're split so far apart from each other.

52

00:02:17,790  -->  00:02:20,820
So soon as you get further way this is

53

00:02:20,820  -->  00:02:24,360
green bar or maroon, is that maroon? No sea

54

00:02:24,360  -->  00:02:26,820
green color bar. This sea green color bar,

55

00:02:26,820  -->  00:02:28,290
they're far away so you can't really

56

00:02:28,290  -->  00:02:30,600
visually compare them that easily.

57

00:02:30,600  -->  00:02:32,550
So what would be better and would be

58

00:02:32,550  -->  00:02:35,220
actually great if it is if we had a

59

00:02:35,220  -->  00:02:37,890
histogram for every one of these genres

60

00:02:37,890  -->  00:02:39,870
and is that possible?

61

00:02:39,870  -->  00:02:42,210
Well of course that's possible. How do we

62

00:02:42,210  -->  00:02:45,390
do that? Let's let's look at that facets.

63

00:02:45,390  -->  00:02:47,400
We're going to use facets to do that.

64

00:02:47,400  -->  00:02:50,820
That's basically what it is, so facets

65

00:02:50,820  -->  00:02:53,070
allow you to create lots of charts.

66

00:02:53,070  -->  00:02:55,620
Let's copy this and we're going to say

67

00:02:55,620  -->  00:02:59,340
plus so we're adding another layer and

68

00:02:59,340  -->  00:03:01,890
this layer is going to be a facet grid,

69

00:03:01,890  -->  00:03:04,800
so we're saying facet underscore grid

70

00:03:04,800  -->  00:03:07,140
and we're going to say, so this is how to

71

00:03:07,140  -->  00:03:09,810
use facets and we might take a bit of

72

00:03:09,810  -->  00:03:12,390
time to get used to but what you have

73

00:03:12,390  -->  00:03:14,730
inside a facet is you've got this tilde

74

00:03:14,730  -->  00:03:16,800
operator and on the left you have

75

00:03:16,800  -->  00:03:19,830
something that is zzz, and on the

76

00:03:19,830  -->  00:03:21,900
right you have a dot right or the other

77

00:03:21,900  -->  00:03:22,650
way around.

78

00:03:22,650  -->  00:03:24,030
On the left you have a dot and then

79

00:03:24,030  -->  00:03:25,770
on the right, you have zzz depending on

80

00:03:25,770  -->  00:03:27,120
whether you want columns or rows.

81

00:03:27,120  -->  00:03:29,310
So let's try this way, let's say genre

82

00:03:29,310  -->  00:03:32,850
tilde dot right? So we want genre

83

00:03:32,850  -->  00:03:36,000
and then we're just running because it's

84

00:03:36,000  -->  00:03:37,830
either, so this way

85

00:03:37,830  -->  00:03:39,450
what are we getting? We're getting genre

86

00:03:39,450  -->  00:03:43,830
is the rows right? So the rows, the one

87

00:03:43,830  -->  00:03:45,930
the one on the left represents rows and

88

00:03:45,930  -->  00:03:47,820
the one on the right is column and then

89

00:03:47,820  -->  00:03:49,709
on the columns, you just want nothing. You

90

00:03:49,709  -->  00:03:50,519
just want

91

00:03:50,519  -->  00:03:52,860
that's why you put the dot so genre in

92

00:03:52,860  -->  00:03:54,840
the rows and the columns you just want

93

00:03:54,840  -->  00:03:57,900
one column and just you know that's all

94

00:03:57,900  -->  00:03:58,800
you want.

95

00:03:58,800  -->  00:04:02,040
So that's we've got these histograms the

96

00:04:02,040  -->  00:04:03,840
only problem here is that these are so

97

00:04:03,840  -->  00:04:05,610
small you can read them at all because

98

00:04:05,610  -->  00:04:09,209
this one is using up the whole axis and

99

00:04:09,209  -->  00:04:11,370
the axis is uniform across all of

100

00:04:11,370  -->  00:04:13,350
these histograms so how do we fix that?

101

00:04:13,350  -->  00:04:15,180
Well very easy, all you have to do is

102

00:04:15,180  -->  00:04:17,010
just after this at another parameter and

103

00:04:17,010  -->  00:04:20,190
say scales equals in quotation marks to

104

00:04:20,190  -->  00:04:22,350
say free. It's just something you need to

105

00:04:22,350  -->  00:04:24,479
remember if you want to free up your

106

00:04:24,479  -->  00:04:25,090
scales.

107

00:04:25,090  -->  00:04:28,810
On that, you'll see that beautiful so

108

00:04:28,810  -->  00:04:31,419
each one of them has its own scale and

109

00:04:31,419  -->  00:04:33,520
from zero to eight, zero to five, they're

110

00:04:33,520  -->  00:04:37,060
like 215 or something that and basically

111

00:04:37,060  -->  00:04:39,940
now you can tell where which ones are

112

00:04:39,940  -->  00:04:42,760
skewed where. So this is the budget so a

113

00:04:42,760  -->  00:04:44,770
lot of money for for instance for action

114

00:04:44,770  -->  00:04:46,630
movies is going around like that, 30

115

00:04:46,630  -->  00:04:48,280
mark but then there is this hump over here

116

00:04:48,280  -->  00:04:51,160
and the hump over here and then like here

117

00:04:51,160  -->  00:04:52,870
it's pretty much all normal distribution.

118

00:04:52,870  -->  00:04:55,960
Here you've got a bit of a longer tail,

119

00:04:55,960  -->  00:04:57,880
here the action movies of course have

120

00:04:57,880  -->  00:04:59,979
the longest tail and they have the

121

00:04:59,979  -->  00:05:01,479
highest budget as well.

122

00:05:01,479  -->  00:05:04,330
Ok so that is our facets, that's the

123

00:05:04,330  -->  00:05:07,450
start of facets. Now let's apply our

124

00:05:07,450  -->  00:05:11,229
facets to scatter plots. Alright what's

125

00:05:11,229  -->  00:05:14,229
a scatterplot? So V let's use

126

00:05:14,229  -->  00:05:16,810
another letter today. Let's say W, because

127

00:05:16,810  -->  00:05:19,000
we're working for different plot. Now we're

128

00:05:19,000  -->  00:05:21,160
saying ggplot and we're going to say

129

00:05:21,160  -->  00:05:24,370
data equals movies and then I'm going to

130

00:05:24,370  -->  00:05:28,120
say aesthetics x equals this is our

131

00:05:28,120  -->  00:05:31,030
fairest scatterplot which we've created

132

00:05:31,030  -->  00:05:33,789
like a thousand times already

133

00:05:33,789  -->  00:05:36,910
audience rating comma and here we're

134

00:05:36,910  -->  00:05:40,630
going to say color equals genre. Alright,

135

00:05:40,630  -->  00:05:44,950
W is ready, now let's say add some points

136

00:05:44,950  -->  00:05:49,270
geom point and that's right away

137

00:05:49,270  -->  00:05:53,020
set the size to 3 but math said it it's a

138

00:05:53,020  -->  00:05:54,729
bit bigger size three.

139

00:05:54,729  -->  00:05:57,310
Well now, let's go ahead and do some

140

00:05:57,310  -->  00:06:01,660
fascinating facets. So here as we know, we'll

141

00:06:01,660  -->  00:06:05,680
say plus facet underscore grid then

142

00:06:05,680  -->  00:06:08,380
we'll say genre until the dot.

143

00:06:08,380  -->  00:06:12,250
So let's run that, ok beautiful how about

144

00:06:12,250  -->  00:06:15,520
we do a similar thing but instead of on

145

00:06:15,520  -->  00:06:16,630
the left

146

00:06:16,630  -->  00:06:18,340
genre and on the left and the right

147

00:06:18,340  -->  00:06:19,720
we'll just a year.

148

00:06:19,720  -->  00:06:22,750
How about that? What happens then uh-huh

149

00:06:22,750  -->  00:06:25,030
so here we've got year. That's also

150

00:06:25,030  -->  00:06:27,520
beautiful and you kind of see where this

151

00:06:27,520  -->  00:06:29,530
is all going, so we've got genre on the

152

00:06:29,530  -->  00:06:31,870
left, dot on the right. On the left, here on

153

00:06:31,870  -->  00:06:33,640
the right where is this all going Kirill?

154

00:06:33,640  -->  00:06:37,990
Well this is all going to a new great

155

00:06:37,990  -->  00:06:38,590
thing I'm going

156

00:06:38,590  -->  00:06:40,600
do. We're gonna say genre tilde

157

00:06:40,600  -->  00:06:44,950
year, so what is going to give us? Viola!

158

00:06:44,950  -->  00:06:48,640
How cool is that? If this doesn't

159

00:06:48,640  -->  00:06:52,330
look cool, then you don't have a heart. I'm

160

00:06:52,330  -->  00:06:54,460
joking. If it doesn't look, oh that's

161

00:06:54,460  -->  00:06:56,530
totally fine but I think it looks pretty

162

00:06:56,530  -->  00:06:59,350
cool. So we've got the years in the

163

00:06:59,350  -->  00:07:02,860
columns and the genres in the rows that

164

00:07:02,860  -->  00:07:04,810
is amazing. Let's let's make it even

165

00:07:04,810  -->  00:07:07,360
better. Let's add another layer now that

166

00:07:07,360  -->  00:07:09,190
we know all about layering and we know

167

00:07:09,190  -->  00:07:11,050
so many different types of layers

168

00:07:11,050  -->  00:07:12,730
let's add it smoother. It doesn't matter

169

00:07:12,730  -->  00:07:14,470
if you add it here or you add it after the

170

00:07:14,470  -->  00:07:16,870
facet grid. We just add it here

171

00:07:16,870  -->  00:07:20,140
whoops geom smooth and then we just say

172

00:07:20,140  -->  00:07:23,230
plus, so if I run these what do we get, what do

173

00:07:23,230  -->  00:07:27,430
we get haha. How amazing is that?

174

00:07:27,430  -->  00:07:29,080
So now we have a smoother inside of each

175

00:07:29,080  -->  00:07:31,030
one and we can look at these all the

176

00:07:31,030  -->  00:07:32,440
beautiful trends.

177

00:07:32,440  -->  00:07:36,070
I think that's already a great great

178

00:07:36,070  -->  00:07:40,030
start and what else did we want to do

179

00:07:40,030  -->  00:07:40,720
here?

180

00:07:40,720  -->  00:07:43,360
Well the last thing is let's just add

181

00:07:43,360  -->  00:07:46,390
the budget as a size so here we're just

182

00:07:46,390  -->  00:07:48,460
going to say instead of three we're just

183

00:07:48,460  -->  00:07:50,110
going to say don't forget the aesthetic

184

00:07:50,110  -->  00:07:51,820
now because we want to map the side

185

00:07:51,820  -->  00:07:54,760
instead of setting it budget millions

186

00:07:54,760  -->  00:07:55,630
right?

187

00:07:55,630  -->  00:07:59,890
Run, give it a second. Okay,

188

00:07:59,890  -->  00:08:03,340
viola! So pretty isn't it? So you've

189

00:08:03,340  -->  00:08:05,740
got the size and represents the budget

190

00:08:05,740  -->  00:08:08,950
you've got the points which is a credit

191

00:08:08,950  -->  00:08:10,240
rating the audience rating that the

192

00:08:10,240  -->  00:08:13,060
smoother you've got the color and you've

193

00:08:13,060  -->  00:08:14,740
got facet grid. So we've combined

194

00:08:14,740  -->  00:08:16,300
quite a lot of concept that we learned

195

00:08:16,300  -->  00:08:19,870
into this one amazing chart and now what

196

00:08:19,870  -->  00:08:22,480
we want to do is it's nearly ready so

197

00:08:22,480  -->  00:08:24,520
remember that the chart I said the

198

00:08:24,520  -->  00:08:25,870
we're going to improve that chart number

199

00:08:25,870  -->  00:08:28,480
one when it was just by itself. So this

200

00:08:28,480  -->  00:08:34,360
is number one but still will improve and

201

00:08:34,360  -->  00:08:36,760
how can we improve this already amazing

202

00:08:36,760  -->  00:08:37,960
chart?

203

00:08:37,960  -->  00:08:40,540
Well what you'll find is that that the

204

00:08:40,540  -->  00:08:42,790
x-axis looks ok so it goes from

205

00:08:42,790  -->  00:08:45,910
somewhere around 0-100 but the y-axis

206

00:08:45,910  -->  00:08:47,860
for some reason goes from minus 50 to

207

00:08:47,860  -->  00:08:50,740
150 so if we zoom in here you'll see

208

00:08:50,740  -->  00:08:51,740
that it goes from

209

00:08:51,740  -->  00:08:54,890
minus 150-150 so here as well minus 50 to

210

00:08:54,890  -->  00:08:56,990
150 and why is that? Well that's because

211

00:08:56,990  -->  00:08:58,880
of these bands so sometimes when there's

212

00:08:58,880  -->  00:09:01,760
uncertainty these bands become wide and

213

00:09:01,760  -->  00:09:04,370
it just means the confidence interval

214

00:09:04,370  -->  00:09:06,980
and confidence bands actually and

215

00:09:06,980  -->  00:09:08,870
because they're stretching out the chart

216

00:09:08,870  -->  00:09:10,490
the chart is stretching out so what we

217

00:09:10,490  -->  00:09:12,050
need to learn is we need to learn how to

218

00:09:12,050  -->  00:09:15,260
zoom into our chart so that it's always

219

00:09:15,260  -->  00:09:17,810
between 0 and a hundred and that's what

220

00:09:17,810  -->  00:09:19,250
we're going to learn on the next

221

00:09:19,250  -->  00:09:19,940
tutorial.

222

00:09:19,940  -->  00:09:21,890
What a great segue. I look forward to

223

00:09:21,890  -->  00:09:23,510
seeing you next time and until then

224

00:09:23,510  -->  00:09:35,309
happy coding.
