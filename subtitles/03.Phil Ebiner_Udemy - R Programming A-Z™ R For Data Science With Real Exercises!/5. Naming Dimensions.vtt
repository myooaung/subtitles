00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.020
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:07.020  -->  00:00:09.000
R programming. Today we've got a pretty

3

00:00:09.000  -->  00:00:10.559
cool topic ahead of us,

4

00:00:10.559  -->  00:00:12.990
we're talking about naming dimensions

5

00:00:12.990  -->  00:00:15.809
and so what is this all about? Well let's

6

00:00:15.809  -->  00:00:17.250
dive straight into it.

7

00:00:17.250  -->  00:00:19.410
Let's imagine that we have a matrix and

8

00:00:19.410  -->  00:00:22.710
matrix of 15 elements and all these 27

9

00:00:22.710  -->  00:00:25.410
numbers and 1, 0 so how do we access the 0,

10

00:00:25.410  -->  00:00:26.820
Well from what we already know, it's

11

00:00:26.820  -->  00:00:28.410
pretty simple right?

12

00:00:28.410  -->  00:00:30.330
All you have to do is type in the name

13

00:00:30.330  -->  00:00:32.009
of the matrix which is a in this case

14

00:00:32.009  -->  00:00:34.739
and then in square brackets the number

15

00:00:34.739  -->  00:00:37.110
of the row, third row, fourth column and

16

00:00:37.110  -->  00:00:39.930
you'll get your 0 but what we're

17

00:00:39.930  -->  00:00:42.030
exploring today is a fact that in R

18

00:00:42.030  -->  00:00:44.040
you can actually give your rows and

19

00:00:44.040  -->  00:00:46.230
columns name. So you can rename that and

20

00:00:46.230  -->  00:00:47.940
you can rename that. Let's start with the

21

00:00:47.940  -->  00:00:48.989
columns. Let's have a look at an example,

22

00:00:48.989  -->  00:00:51.840
Let's say we don't want to use those

23

00:00:51.840  -->  00:00:53.489
numbers anymore and we want to give our

24

00:00:53.489  -->  00:00:56.879
calls names. We'll call them p,q,r,s and t

25

00:00:56.879  -->  00:00:59.399
and in this case, if we have a matrix

26

00:00:59.399  -->  00:01:01.620
like this with names columns, how would

27

00:01:01.620  -->  00:01:03.510
we access 0 now?

28

00:01:03.510  -->  00:01:05.909
Well it's also pretty simple, all you

29

00:01:05.909  -->  00:01:08.490
have to do is type in the name of the

30

00:01:08.490  -->  00:01:10.650
matrix the number of the row and the

31

00:01:10.650  -->  00:01:12.840
name of the column this time and make

32

00:01:12.840  -->  00:01:15.150
sure to put it in quotation marks

33

00:01:15.150  -->  00:01:17.460
because it's a name and you call it out

34

00:01:17.460  -->  00:01:19.380
the column by name so you need the

35

00:01:19.380  -->  00:01:21.390
quotation marks. So this way, you will

36

00:01:21.390  -->  00:01:23.759
access the zero and now let's have a look

37

00:01:23.759  -->  00:01:26.520
at the rows. Let's say these names

38

00:01:26.520  -->  00:01:29.250
disappear, the current generic ones and

39

00:01:29.250  -->  00:01:30.990
we give it some interesting names like

40

00:01:30.990  -->  00:01:34.290
Hello X and best. Now bear in mind here

41

00:01:34.290  -->  00:01:37.140
that, you can use a word and letter even

42

00:01:37.140  -->  00:01:39.090
a number but of course the number will

43

00:01:39.090  -->  00:01:41.340
be represented as the character of the

44

00:01:41.340  -->  00:01:43.680
number not just the number itself and in

45

00:01:43.680  -->  00:01:45.750
this case if you want access 0, we would

46

00:01:45.750  -->  00:01:48.119
type in A and best in quotation marks

47

00:01:48.119  -->  00:01:50.880
and S in quotation marks. So we're

48

00:01:50.880  -->  00:01:53.009
calling out the row and the column by

49

00:01:53.009  -->  00:01:55.229
their names. Now what I wanted to point

50

00:01:55.229  -->  00:01:56.969
out here is that all three of these

51

00:01:56.969  -->  00:01:59.310
approaches for accessing the zero are

52

00:01:59.310  -->  00:02:01.770
actually correct because the numeration

53

00:02:01.770  -->  00:02:03.509
of the rows and the columns is going to

54

00:02:03.509  -->  00:02:05.579
stick with the matrix forever regardless

55

00:02:05.579  -->  00:02:07.680
what you do with the matrix the rows and

56

00:02:07.680  -->  00:02:09.300
columns are always going to have numbers

57

00:02:09.300  -->  00:02:11.190
so whichever one of these two approaches

58

00:02:11.190  -->  00:02:13.560
you use is actually going to be correct

59

00:02:13.560  -->  00:02:15.180
and in fact is a fourth approach as you

60

00:02:15.180  -->  00:02:17.220
can guess one we haven't outlined here

61

00:02:17.220  -->  00:02:20.160
yet is when you call out the row by its

62

00:02:20.160  -->  00:02:22.650
name and the column by its number. So its the

63

00:02:22.650  -->  00:02:24.450
fourth approach here, although can you

64

00:02:24.450  -->  00:02:26.010
tell you what is wrong in this

65

00:02:26.010  -->  00:02:27.300
representation?

66

00:02:27.300  -->  00:02:29.190
That's correct, we forgot the quotation

67

00:02:29.190  -->  00:02:31.620
marks so let's put them back in place. So

68

00:02:31.620  -->  00:02:34.739
there we go, four approaches to access a 0 in a

69

00:02:34.739  -->  00:02:37.319
named matrix and of course doesn't have

70

00:02:37.319  -->  00:02:39.030
to be a zero you can access pretty much

71

00:02:39.030  -->  00:02:41.819
virtually any element in this manner.

72

00:02:41.819  -->  00:02:43.680
Alright so now that we've looked at

73

00:02:43.680  -->  00:02:45.959
matrices, let's have a look at vectors

74

00:02:45.959  -->  00:02:48.239
because surely if we have such a great

75

00:02:48.239  -->  00:02:50.970
and cool concept for matrices, it has to be

76

00:02:50.970  -->  00:02:52.620
something similar for vectors and that's

77

00:02:52.620  -->  00:02:53.220
correct.

78

00:02:53.220  -->  00:02:54.540
Here we've got a vector of five elements

79

00:02:54.540  -->  00:02:57.209
and it's not a named vector it is just a

80

00:02:57.209  -->  00:02:59.069
standard vector where the elements have

81

00:02:59.069  -->  00:03:01.980
their numbers 1,2,3,4,5. Now what we can do is

82

00:03:01.980  -->  00:03:04.470
give these elements names and therefore

83

00:03:04.470  -->  00:03:06.299
turning the vector into named vector.

84

00:03:06.299  -->  00:03:09.630
Let's use the names a b c d and e for

85

00:03:09.630  -->  00:03:11.910
simplicity and how would we access to 0

86

00:03:11.910  -->  00:03:12.900
in this case?

87

00:03:12.900  -->  00:03:14.760
Well it's also pretty straightforward,

88

00:03:14.760  -->  00:03:17.010
you can either just say v4 because

89

00:03:17.010  -->  00:03:18.450
that's the fourth element or you can say

90

00:03:18.450  -->  00:03:20.910
V and in quotation marks

91

00:03:20.910  -->  00:03:23.160
d because that element now has a name

92

00:03:23.160  -->  00:03:25.079
which is d and this brings us to the end

93

00:03:25.079  -->  00:03:27.000
of this tutorial. I look forward to

94

00:03:27.000  -->  00:03:28.350
seeing you next time and until then,

95

00:03:28.350  -->  00:03:39.479
happy coding.
