00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,170
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:07,170  -->  00:00:09,150
R programming and today we're going to

3

00:00:09,150  -->  00:00:11,759
finally get to analyze the NBA data. I

4

00:00:11,759  -->  00:00:13,440
hope you're pretty excited about today's

5

00:00:13,440  -->  00:00:15,630
tutorial and to start off what we're

6

00:00:15,630  -->  00:00:17,460
going to do is we're going to have a

7

00:00:17,460  -->  00:00:19,230
look at what we created last time

8

00:00:19,230  -->  00:00:21,600
because that is going to help us a lot

9

00:00:21,600  -->  00:00:23,970
during today's tutorial and last time we

10

00:00:23,970  -->  00:00:27,000
created our own very first function. This

11

00:00:27,000  -->  00:00:29,070
function is called myplot and it

12

00:00:29,070  -->  00:00:31,980
requires two parameters: data and rows.

13

00:00:31,980  -->  00:00:34,350
The first parameter is compulsory makes

14

00:00:34,350  -->  00:00:36,210
sense because R function can't operate

15

00:00:36,210  -->  00:00:39,000
without any data and rows isn't

16

00:00:39,000  -->  00:00:41,129
compulsory because it has a default

17

00:00:41,129  -->  00:00:42,870
value so if you don't supply the rows

18

00:00:42,870  -->  00:00:44,190
that you want to visualize it will just

19

00:00:44,190  -->  00:00:47,489
visualize all of the values. Now here you

20

00:00:47,489  -->  00:00:49,620
can see what this function does, it takes

21

00:00:49,620  -->  00:00:51,750
any data to supply and replaces it

22

00:00:51,750  -->  00:00:54,120
over here and the rows that you supply

23

00:00:54,120  -->  00:00:57,780
get replaced here and here as well and so

24

00:00:57,780  -->  00:01:00,449
what the function does is it first

25

00:01:00,449  -->  00:01:04,379
subsets the data that you supply based

26

00:01:04,379  -->  00:01:06,659
on the rows that you require and here

27

00:01:06,659  -->  00:01:09,330
we are using that very important feature

28

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:11,130
of subsetting in R that we talked about

29

00:01:11,130  -->  00:01:14,189
in one of the previous tutorials then we

30

00:01:14,189  -->  00:01:16,500
are plotting the data with the matplot

31

00:01:16,500  -->  00:01:18,659
function and we're using the legend

32

00:01:18,659  -->  00:01:20,850
function to create a legend and so here

33

00:01:20,850  -->  00:01:22,350
I've got an example. I'm going to plot

34

00:01:22,350  -->  00:01:24,990
the games of the top ten paid NBA

35

00:01:24,990  -->  00:01:26,939
players for the past 10 years just by

36

00:01:26,939  -->  00:01:29,280
running this one line and as you can see

37

00:01:29,280  -->  00:01:32,549
there we go that's a plot. So now we're

38

00:01:32,549  -->  00:01:35,130
going to do is we're going to move on to

39

00:01:35,130  -->  00:01:37,920
analyzing and driving insights and I 'm

40

00:01:37,920  -->  00:01:39,720
going to go to this new tab. So I've

41

00:01:39,720  -->  00:01:42,119
prepared some code here already and I

42

00:01:42,119  -->  00:01:44,220
invite you to follow along, so as we run

43

00:01:44,220  -->  00:01:46,920
these lines just code them up in your

44

00:01:46,920  -->  00:01:49,590
R studio. I decided not to write them

45

00:01:49,590  -->  00:01:51,689
up one by one because we're kind of

46

00:01:51,689  -->  00:01:55,470
moving now from the stage where we're

47

00:01:55,470  -->  00:01:57,149
learning R and learning all these

48

00:01:57,149  -->  00:01:59,310
things that we need for this analysis to

49

00:01:59,310  -->  00:02:01,350
actually performing the analysis. So the

50

00:02:01,350  -->  00:02:03,750
focus today is going to be on analytics

51

00:02:03,750  -->  00:02:06,659
and on data science and you know doing

52

00:02:06,659  -->  00:02:09,119
the analysis in smart thought through

53

00:02:09,119  -->  00:02:10,289
way so that's what we're going to be

54

00:02:10,289  -->  00:02:12,750
talking about most of the day today. So

55

00:02:12,750  -->  00:02:13,440
let's

56

00:02:13,440  -->  00:02:16,260
get started, myplot salary. What are we

57

00:02:16,260  -->  00:02:18,030
going to plot here? First thing I was

58

00:02:18,030  -->  00:02:20,610
interested to see was how have the

59

00:02:20,610  -->  00:02:22,770
salaries of these players been changing?

60

00:02:22,770  -->  00:02:25,530
So how did they actually get here to

61

00:02:25,530  -->  00:02:28,350
being the top 10 players paid players as

62

00:02:28,350  -->  00:02:30,390
you can see Kobe Bryant was always quite

63

00:02:30,390  -->  00:02:32,400
up there at his has, has been

64

00:02:32,400  -->  00:02:34,380
growing up until the previous season

65

00:02:34,380  -->  00:02:39,810
2014, 2015 and his record was over 30

66

00:02:39,810  -->  00:02:43,710
million dollars for one year of playing

67

00:02:43,710  -->  00:02:47,130
and then here we've got the rest so you

68

00:02:47,130  -->  00:02:49,380
can see that the Joe Johnson started quite

69

00:02:49,380  -->  00:02:51,060
above but then the rest caught up with

70

00:02:51,060  -->  00:02:52,920
him and now they're all sitting over

71

00:02:52,920  -->  00:02:54,060
here, so that's how the salaries have

72

00:02:54,060  -->  00:02:57,300
been changing. Now, let's a plot how much

73

00:02:57,300  -->  00:03:00,690
they get paid per game. So salary divided by game and

74

00:03:00,690  -->  00:03:02,550
this is where I first ran into this

75

00:03:02,550  -->  00:03:06,000
conundrum that we've got some anomalies

76

00:03:06,000  -->  00:03:08,190
here. What happened here? So why is who's

77

00:03:08,190  -->  00:03:10,980
this Kobe Bryant and Derek Rose, so why

78

00:03:10,980  -->  00:03:12,690
are they getting paid so much per game?

79

00:03:12,690  -->  00:03:15,450
As we saw previously their salaries are

80

00:03:15,450  -->  00:03:17,070
comparable to the others.

81

00:03:17,070  -->  00:03:19,050
Well the reason here is that both of

82

00:03:19,050  -->  00:03:20,910
these players were actually injured in

83

00:03:20,910  -->  00:03:25,110
that 2013-14 season and that's why per

84

00:03:25,110  -->  00:03:26,970
game, they didn't play that many games. So

85

00:03:26,970  -->  00:03:29,400
their salary per game is quite high and

86

00:03:29,400  -->  00:03:32,310
same thing salary per field goals. So

87

00:03:32,310  -->  00:03:34,830
what we could do from a data analytics

88

00:03:34,830  -->  00:03:36,720
point of view? We could we remove these

89

00:03:36,720  -->  00:03:39,840
anomalies and then continue for analysis.

90

00:03:39,840  -->  00:03:41,850
However digging further into the

91

00:03:41,850  -->  00:03:44,370
basketball data, I found that these

92

00:03:44,370  -->  00:03:46,739
players put so much effort into their

93

00:03:46,739  -->  00:03:48,660
game that they get injured quite a lot.

94

00:03:48,660  -->  00:03:50,730
So we would see discrepancies like this

95

00:03:50,730  -->  00:03:52,739
throughout the whole data set and more

96

00:03:52,739  -->  00:03:54,690
where we wouldn't see them they would be

97

00:03:54,690  -->  00:03:57,209
still skewing our data found us

98

00:03:57,209  -->  00:03:59,610
knowing it so therefore visualizing

99

00:03:59,610  -->  00:04:01,620
salary and ingame statistics together

100

00:04:01,620  -->  00:04:04,110
might not be the best option and the

101

00:04:04,110  -->  00:04:06,660
reason for that is that salary is not

102

00:04:06,660  -->  00:04:07,890
affected by injuries,

103

00:04:07,890  -->  00:04:10,860
whereas in game statistics R and so

104

00:04:10,860  -->  00:04:12,660
the players get paid regardless of

105

00:04:12,660  -->  00:04:14,190
whether they're playing or not they have

106

00:04:14,190  -->  00:04:16,799
contract but their statistics such as

107

00:04:16,799  -->  00:04:19,049
games played field goals and so on. They do

108

00:04:19,049  -->  00:04:21,150
get affected, so from an analytical point

109

00:04:21,150  -->  00:04:23,550
of view unless we can somehow exclude

110

00:04:23,550  -->  00:04:24,680
those

111

00:04:24,680  -->  00:04:26,810
at the effect of injuries. We shouldn't

112

00:04:26,810  -->  00:04:29,479
visualize salaries and ingame statistics

113

00:04:29,479  -->  00:04:31,820
together. So let's go and look at the

114

00:04:31,820  -->  00:04:34,940
in-game matrix, let's plot the minutes

115

00:04:34,940  -->  00:04:36,770
played and what do we see here?

116

00:04:36,770  -->  00:04:39,289
Well here we see how many minutes each

117

00:04:39,289  -->  00:04:41,810
of the players played in the

118

00:04:41,810  -->  00:04:45,860
past 10 years. Ok and let's plot points, so

119

00:04:45,860  -->  00:04:48,229
what we see here is another thing like

120

00:04:48,229  -->  00:04:50,120
we know that Derrick Rose is for instance a

121

00:04:50,120  -->  00:04:53,180
great player and he was MVP and 2010-11

122

00:04:53,180  -->  00:04:55,610
season but here we can see that the

123

00:04:55,610  -->  00:04:58,460
points that he brought to his team dropped

124

00:04:58,460  -->  00:04:59,210
over here.

125

00:04:59,210  -->  00:05:01,820
What same with Kobe Bryant but

126

00:05:01,820  -->  00:05:03,530
the reason for that is that both these

127

00:05:03,530  -->  00:05:05,360
players are injured over here. So once

128

00:05:05,360  -->  00:05:07,280
again we can see that injuries are

129

00:05:07,280  -->  00:05:09,710
affecting our visualization. So how do we

130

00:05:09,710  -->  00:05:12,590
fix that from like how to approach it as

131

00:05:12,590  -->  00:05:14,990
data scientists and actually how do we

132

00:05:14,990  -->  00:05:16,849
take injuries out of the equation?

133

00:05:16,849  -->  00:05:19,400
Well we know that injuries affect all

134

00:05:19,400  -->  00:05:21,229
in-game statistics right, so if you don't

135

00:05:21,229  -->  00:05:22,880
attend the game you're injured you don't

136

00:05:22,880  -->  00:05:24,349
attend the game but you also don't score

137

00:05:24,349  -->  00:05:26,330
goals. So what we can do is we can

138

00:05:26,330  -->  00:05:29,120
normalize in-game matrix by in-game

139

00:05:29,120  -->  00:05:31,130
matrix and this that's what I have here.

140

00:05:31,130  -->  00:05:34,250
So if we take field goals and divide

141

00:05:34,250  -->  00:05:36,020
them per game rather than just plotting

142

00:05:36,020  -->  00:05:38,720
field goals by themselves, if we plot

143

00:05:38,720  -->  00:05:41,150
that then you will see that now we can

144

00:05:41,150  -->  00:05:42,830
actually compare them so even though

145

00:05:42,830  -->  00:05:44,990
some players were injured, some players

146

00:05:44,990  -->  00:05:48,380
were not the your divide your calculating

147

00:05:48,380  -->  00:05:50,449
how many goals scored per game so

148

00:05:50,449  -->  00:05:52,039
actually per game that that they attended.

149

00:05:52,039  -->  00:05:54,650
Now injuries do sometimes affect and quite

150

00:05:54,650  -->  00:05:55,880
often affect players even when they're

151

00:05:55,880  -->  00:05:57,800
playing but already we are extracting or

152

00:05:57,800  -->  00:06:00,530
where mitigating some of that effect

153

00:06:00,530  -->  00:06:02,360
that injuries have on our visualization

154

00:06:02,360  -->  00:06:05,419
and so now you can go ahead and compare

155

00:06:05,419  -->  00:06:07,970
their goals per game that player score

156

00:06:07,970  -->  00:06:10,520
and as you can see back in the day Kobe

157

00:06:10,520  -->  00:06:13,759
Bryant had a crazy amount of 13 per game

158

00:06:13,759  -->  00:06:16,940
and now it's quite, is dropped quite a

159

00:06:16,940  -->  00:06:20,060
lot and right now in the lead we've got

160

00:06:20,060  -->  00:06:23,449
Lebron, Lebron James with about just over

161

00:06:23,449  -->  00:06:26,840
nine goals per game on average. That's not

162

00:06:26,840  -->  00:06:28,849
points, that's actually goals.

163

00:06:28,849  -->  00:06:31,669
Ok and now let's visualize another

164

00:06:31,669  -->  00:06:34,550
normalized matrix let's visualize field

165

00:06:34,550  -->  00:06:37,279
goals per field goal attempts. I think that

166

00:06:37,279  -->  00:06:38,360
one will be pretty interesting.

167

00:06:38,360  -->  00:06:40,550
So if we look at that this is

168

00:06:40,550  -->  00:06:42,229
basically the accuracy of the players, so

169

00:06:42,229  -->  00:06:44,990
how many goals did they make divided by the

170

00:06:44,990  -->  00:06:47,060
how many attempts do they make? So

171

00:06:47,060  -->  00:06:50,030
here you can see right away that Dwight

172

00:06:50,030  -->  00:06:53,479
Howard is up there up at the top and way

173

00:06:53,479  -->  00:06:55,159
above all other players in terms of

174

00:06:55,159  -->  00:06:57,860
accuracy and he is the fifth highest

175

00:06:57,860  -->  00:07:00,919
paid player in the NBA currently. So what

176

00:07:00,919  -->  00:07:02,360
does that mean? Well that means that

177

00:07:02,360  -->  00:07:05,780
basically out of the balls that he

178

00:07:05,780  -->  00:07:07,939
throws at the net, about 60-percent

179

00:07:07,939  -->  00:07:10,610
nearly six percent actually and in a

180

00:07:10,610  -->  00:07:14,029
goal. So let's see how he's going in

181

00:07:14,029  -->  00:07:16,189
terms of actual attempts, so we know that

182

00:07:16,189  -->  00:07:18,620
his attempts to convert very well but

183

00:07:18,620  -->  00:07:21,620
how many attempts per game does he have?

184

00:07:21,620  -->  00:07:25,159
Let's look at this visualization, here we

185

00:07:25,159  -->  00:07:27,439
see that Dwight Howard is actually at

186

00:07:27,439  -->  00:07:28,819
the very bottom.

187

00:07:28,819  -->  00:07:30,529
Alright he was at the top for

188

00:07:30,529  -->  00:07:34,580
conversion of or successful attempts. Now

189

00:07:34,580  -->  00:07:37,009
he's at the bottom for the actual number

190

00:07:37,009  -->  00:07:39,770
of attempts per game and therefore it

191

00:07:39,770  -->  00:07:41,990
makes sense that he doesn't actually

192

00:07:41,990  -->  00:07:44,330
score that many points per game. Even

193

00:07:44,330  -->  00:07:45,860
though that his accuracy is quite high

194

00:07:45,860  -->  00:07:48,409
because he makes a few attempts, he

195

00:07:48,409  -->  00:07:50,300
doesn't score that many point and so

196

00:07:50,300  -->  00:07:51,800
that's an inside we could derive right

197

00:07:51,800  -->  00:07:55,069
away and probably basketball player

198

00:07:55,069  -->  00:07:56,449
people with a lot of knowledge about

199

00:07:56,449  -->  00:07:58,759
basketball could comment on this and could

200

00:07:58,759  -->  00:08:00,440
say why exactly he doesn't make that

201

00:08:00,440  -->  00:08:02,810
many attempts? Maybe he's on the court in a

202

00:08:02,810  -->  00:08:05,629
position that is not designed to make

203

00:08:05,629  -->  00:08:08,539
that many attempts or maybe it's not the

204

00:08:08,539  -->  00:08:11,719
case maybe he he can start making more

205

00:08:11,719  -->  00:08:13,490
attempts and then because his accuracy is so

206

00:08:13,490  -->  00:08:14,719
high maybe he'll start scoring more

207

00:08:14,719  -->  00:08:17,360
goals. So that's something to look into,

208

00:08:17,360  -->  00:08:20,240
that requires more was as it's called

209

00:08:20,240  -->  00:08:22,400
domain knowledge. So knowledge about

210

00:08:22,400  -->  00:08:25,669
basketball, now we're going to move on to

211

00:08:25,669  -->  00:08:27,379
some more interesting observations and

212

00:08:27,379  -->  00:08:29,539
let's say minutes played per game. So I

213

00:08:29,539  -->  00:08:31,039
thought this was quite interesting,

214

00:08:31,039  -->  00:08:32,839
you can see that the minutes played per

215

00:08:32,839  -->  00:08:35,449
game for these top 10 players has been

216

00:08:35,449  -->  00:08:37,519
dropping over all. So you can see the trend

217

00:08:37,519  -->  00:08:39,289
here, it's going down and I couldn't

218

00:08:39,289  -->  00:08:41,329
explain that, I couldn't explain why. So I'll

219

00:08:41,329  -->  00:08:43,039
understand if it was for one or two

220

00:08:43,039  -->  00:08:45,800
players but over all these players seem

221

00:08:45,800  -->  00:08:48,410
to play less minutes per game on average

222

00:08:48,410  -->  00:08:51,170
as we move from earlier years in their

223

00:08:51,170  -->  00:08:52,340
career to later years

224

00:08:52,340  -->  00:08:53,900
and that would be interesting to find

225

00:08:53,900  -->  00:08:57,710
out why. Ok so at the same time if we

226

00:08:57,710  -->  00:08:59,210
plot the games you can see that they

227

00:08:59,210  -->  00:09:01,040
have in the number of games that it may

228

00:09:01,040  -->  00:09:02,720
be playing is actually pretty consistent, it's

229

00:09:02,720  -->  00:09:04,340
not that they're playing more games and

230

00:09:04,340  -->  00:09:05,570
therefore they're playing less minutes.

231

00:09:05,570  -->  00:09:06,950
They're playing pretty much the same

232

00:09:06,950  -->  00:09:09,260
number of games but they're playing less

233

00:09:09,260  -->  00:09:10,640
minutes per game. So that's that's an

234

00:09:10,640  -->  00:09:11,720
interesting one.

235

00:09:11,720  -->  00:09:13,970
Ok so time is valuable but since

236

00:09:13,970  -->  00:09:16,640
they're less on the court, less minutes

237

00:09:16,640  -->  00:09:18,680
per game on the court, their times value, let's

238

00:09:18,680  -->  00:09:20,840
see who uses that time most efficiently

239

00:09:20,840  -->  00:09:23,570
so who scored the most field goals per

240

00:09:23,570  -->  00:09:26,270
minute played? Let's run that one and

241

00:09:26,270  -->  00:09:28,220
here we can see that it's actually Kevin

242

00:09:28,220  -->  00:09:34,400
Durant. He is quite young and so he when

243

00:09:34,400  -->  00:09:36,800
I was gathering this data I noticed that

244

00:09:36,800  -->  00:09:39,470
he joined the NBA quite recently

245

00:09:39,470  -->  00:09:42,200
ago like relatively recently. So he's

246

00:09:42,200  -->  00:09:46,310
young and you can see that his goals for

247

00:09:46,310  -->  00:09:48,470
a minute played have been increasing

248

00:09:48,470  -->  00:09:52,250
with time. So looks like, I've seen

249

00:09:52,250  -->  00:09:54,020
a few articles calling him the rising

250

00:09:54,020  -->  00:09:56,360
star, so we'll see how it goes but so far

251

00:09:56,360  -->  00:09:57,920
the data does confirm that he's

252

00:09:57,920  -->  00:10:01,520
using his time on the court valuably and

253

00:10:01,520  -->  00:10:02,660
that's what we're seeing and also we've

254

00:10:02,660  -->  00:10:03,920
seen kind of two groups which in some

255

00:10:03,920  -->  00:10:05,600
players are here and we've seen some

256

00:10:05,600  -->  00:10:08,360
players over here. So other players that

257

00:10:08,360  -->  00:10:11,210
fall into this group Kevin Durant, Dwyane

258

00:10:11,210  -->  00:10:14,840
Wade,  Carmello, Anthony and Lebron

259

00:10:14,840  -->  00:10:17,150
James very interesting to see this type

260

00:10:17,150  -->  00:10:19,280
of grouping and finally one more

261

00:10:19,280  -->  00:10:22,310
interesting visualization that I found was

262

00:10:22,310  -->  00:10:24,950
points divided by field goal. So it's kind of

263

00:10:24,950  -->  00:10:28,340
player style. So impossible you can score

264

00:10:28,340  -->  00:10:30,440
a two-point goal or you can score a

265

00:10:30,440  -->  00:10:32,240
three-point goals and also you'll see

266

00:10:32,240  -->  00:10:34,310
that some of the the averages here

267

00:10:34,310  -->  00:10:35,780
actually above three points, that's

268

00:10:35,780  -->  00:10:38,150
because our field goals or our points

269

00:10:38,150  -->  00:10:40,610
data includes both gold, field goals

270

00:10:40,610  -->  00:10:43,700
and also includes the free shots that

271

00:10:43,700  -->  00:10:45,830
they get. So we would need to subtract

272

00:10:45,830  -->  00:10:48,140
the free shots points from points to

273

00:10:48,140  -->  00:10:50,750
exclude that effect but unfortunately we

274

00:10:50,750  -->  00:10:53,360
don't have that data in, in our data set,

275

00:10:53,360  -->  00:10:55,460
so let's just bear with this. We can still

276

00:10:55,460  -->  00:10:58,640
see that player's style, player playing

277

00:10:58,640  -->  00:11:00,950
style is changing with time. So a good

278

00:11:00,950  -->  00:11:02,900
example that jumps out right away is

279

00:11:02,900  -->  00:11:04,470
Kevin Durrant. You can see that first

280

00:11:04,470  -->  00:11:07,410
he used to score less points per field

281

00:11:07,410  -->  00:11:10,110
goal so he was going for the two-point

282

00:11:10,110  -->  00:11:12,540
shots more and then he started scoring

283

00:11:12,540  -->  00:11:14,520
more points so that means you started

284

00:11:14,520  -->  00:11:15,960
great for the more for the three-point

285

00:11:15,960  -->  00:11:19,290
shots or he was getting more free

286

00:11:19,290  -->  00:11:21,450
throws and then it dropped and then it went

287

00:11:21,450  -->  00:11:24,120
up. So it's interesting to see how some

288

00:11:24,120  -->  00:11:25,920
of the players have a change in style

289

00:11:25,920  -->  00:11:28,080
like that or Kobe Bryant for instance

290

00:11:28,080  -->  00:11:30,720
like the average dropped and then it

291

00:11:30,720  -->  00:11:34,140
started going up again or what's another

292

00:11:34,140  -->  00:11:36,660
one here we can see Chris Bosh, you can

293

00:11:36,660  -->  00:11:38,850
see that his average was dropping

294

00:11:38,850  -->  00:11:41,130
consistently and then started growing. So it would

295

00:11:41,130  -->  00:11:43,740
be interesting to see what is the cause

296

00:11:43,740  -->  00:11:46,800
of these changes are these trail about

297

00:11:46,800  -->  00:11:49,710
their trainers telling them to change

298

00:11:49,710  -->  00:11:52,080
the style or other trends in the

299

00:11:52,080  -->  00:11:55,380
basketball sport that change over time

300

00:11:55,380  -->  00:11:57,000
and things like that would be

301

00:11:57,000  -->  00:12:00,630
interesting to observe that. Ok so there

302

00:12:00,630  -->  00:12:04,110
we go, that's some analysis of the stats

303

00:12:04,110  -->  00:12:07,290
that we have and what you can do is you

304

00:12:07,290  -->  00:12:09,480
can perform a take a similar approach

305

00:12:09,480  -->  00:12:12,210
and explore some other things because

306

00:12:12,210  -->  00:12:13,830
there's so many things that we haven't

307

00:12:13,830  -->  00:12:16,800
explored yet here. You can just try and

308

00:12:16,800  -->  00:12:19,260
normalized different various matrices by

309

00:12:19,260  -->  00:12:21,630
different matrices and a plot some of

310

00:12:21,630  -->  00:12:23,430
these things and find some inside of

311

00:12:23,430  -->  00:12:25,260
your own and see what you're able to

312

00:12:25,260  -->  00:12:27,270
discover. I hope you found this tutorial

313

00:12:27,270  -->  00:12:29,520
interesting and exciting and I look

314

00:12:29,520  -->  00:12:30,840
forward to seeing you next time.

315

00:12:30,840  -->  00:12:42,950
Until then, happy coding!
