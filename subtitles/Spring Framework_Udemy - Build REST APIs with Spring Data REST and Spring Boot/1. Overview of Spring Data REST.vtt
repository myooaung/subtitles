00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.340
For those who have skipped the previous season, let me give you an overview of what we have done so

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:12.300
far here in our bicycle database via one schema that is university and inside that we are one table

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.390
that is student and that is having two records.

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.470
Now the ones being given an insight that we have one entity class, which is representing the student

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.400
table, OK?

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.290
And for this entity class, we are one repository that is student repository.

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.190
We have developed a couple of apps using the controller.

8
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.330
That is one controller.

9
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.280
And this is very simple IPAs.

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.280
OK, like getting all the students getting by Idi Couriered updated daily does one.

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.710
How using this data DP.

12
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.600
Let me go to our service here.

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.320
See did by calling the meter fined by the unfeigned board.

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.970
OK using this student repository?

15
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.500
Don't worry.

16
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.180
Along with this lecture, you will get the source code OK so you can download it and import in your

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.110
local machine.

18
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.830
So this is what we have done so far.

19
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.240
Now let's move ahead.

20
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.850
So let's come to our problem statement, OK?

21
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.610
That why we need to go forward a spring date arrest.

22
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.180
OK, so let's have a look at here what we are doing, OK?

23
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.460
We are very busy and simple recipes, OK for our current operations.

24
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.270
And if we go to our service here, we don't have any business logic.

25
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.380
Very simple, OK.

26
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.220
We are saving the record or updating the record, leading the record, or we are getting by it or getting

27
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.940
all the records.

28
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.510
OK.

29
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.880
So this is without any business logic.

30
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.210
But still, we need to write this piece of code right in our controller, having the mapping at the

31
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.720
DB meter and inside the inside service, this piece of code.

32
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.030
So very simple APIs.

33
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.280
But still, we need to write this piece of code.

34
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.820
So here comes spring day to rest.

35
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.760
OK, so spring the provides out of the configuration.

36
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.710
All these things having the APIs that mappings and their TDP methods.

37
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.270
We don't need controller and service layer while working with spring guitarist.

38
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.600
Yes, you will understand this in the upcoming lectures.

39
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.870
OK?

40
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.680
But this is our problem statement that when you have the busy IPAs, OK, basically for your crud operations,

41
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.580
then why?

42
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.030
We need to hold this piece up for this one controller and this student service so that you can go for

43
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.080
spring guitarist.

44
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.090
And that's what we will cover in the upcoming lectures.

45
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.380
OK.

46
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.580
So this is our problem statement.

47
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.080
So what we will do will be having this spring board application aside so that we can compare it with

48
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.690
the spring data research application that we are going to develop in the upcoming lectures.

49
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.980
OK.

50
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.200
So we will be having this spring wood application outside, and in the next lecture, we will create

51
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.680
another spring wood application with spring day to rest.

52
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.880
So from the next lecture, we will get started with the spring guitarist.

53
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.320
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

54
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.760
Thank you very much.
