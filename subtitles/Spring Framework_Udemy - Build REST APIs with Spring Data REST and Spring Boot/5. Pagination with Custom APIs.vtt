00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.150
Below we have done Oprah, this customer base.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.160
Now look at this eBay.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.280
Here we are having awkwardly between first name and last name column and we are reading multiple records.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.010
And that's why we have written diverse list, top student basically list double what A.D. class?

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.020
No, I was putting what application is already running, so let's jump to Bozeman and call this EPA

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.330
OK?

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.800
In the response, we got boost, one didn't say, OK, that's fine, let's come down at the bottom.

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.210
See here.

9
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.620
We don't help page object.

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.780
OK, that means for this custom EPA, we don't help business in place.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.670
OK, so this is the behavior being that addressed what our customer base.

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.100
It is not providing the Beijing isn't by default.

13
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.010
OK, now let's call this EPA OK, this we have already seen right in one of the previous lectures that

14
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.880
we are getting the story and it is OK.

15
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.600
Depending on the bid size, come down.

16
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.010
See here.

17
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.360
We hope Beijing isn't in place.

18
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.050
OK.

19
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.280
And this EPA is being automatically provided by spring guitarist.

20
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.550
So for this, EPA's spring guitarist is providing the Beijing isn't, but for our customer base, it

21
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.390
is not providing.

22
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.720
So let's say we want to how that what our customer base.

23
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.880
So that's what we are going to do in this lecture.

24
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.150
OK?

25
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.690
We want to show business and for our customer base, whatever we how we'll get inside this repository

26
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.250
or any other repository.

27
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.950
Obviously for this EPA, right, we don't need business, and because we are just returning one record.

28
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.580
And that's why we have a return type as object of our entity, Glass.

29
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.930
So here it's been.

30
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.170
But let's say for this EPA, we want to help business.

31
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.970
And so let's go for it.

32
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.070
Stop this particular replication.

33
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.050
And here in this matter, we need to add one more method parameter, OK?

34
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.330
That is what biddable interface.

35
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.540
See, this is from spring data domain.

36
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.900
OK.

37
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.880
Don't make a mistake while importing.

38
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.010
So this we need to do OK.

39
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.330
Provide the instance of this one biddable.

40
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.710
Now we need to change the return playbook instead of list of our individuals.

41
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.530
We need to have done a big job over individuals.

42
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.710
This is an interface provided by spring data.

43
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.700
See this one.

44
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.360
Now we are all set.

45
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.140
So let's run, I was putting what replication and jump to Bozeman?

46
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.610
This is our be right.

47
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.420
Let's call it.

48
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.740
We got the response come down at the bottom.

49
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.720
See, now we have support of business and for our customers being.

50
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.920
See, other things will remain theme, OK?

51
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.690
So, for example, buzzing the bid number in the query parameter zero one two.

52
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.040
So this will remain theme and this we have already seen in the previous lectures, right?

53
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.020
So I am not repeating it or here.

54
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.460
So let me read more this.

55
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.040
OK, now we are good quality again.

56
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.230
Now let's try to have them.

57
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.610
So I think my first name?

58
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.090
OK.

59
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.630
So for example, for our custom API, we want to start by which build first name.

60
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.380
So provided.

61
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.830
OK.

62
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.000
Say, for example, ascending again, ascending Derrickson.

63
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.730
My bed.

64
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.000
OK, this is another query, parameters and person, not description.

65
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.720
Yes.

66
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.760
See now the records are God sorted by first name will support our custom base, so our thing is provided

67
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.550
OK, but we need to have the business and that configuration.

68
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.150
We need to do manually how using this possible interface and we need to have the written type as bid

69
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.240
interface and then type up our entity glass.

70
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.190
This one like this.

71
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.120
So this is how you can help business and for the customer base while working with spring guitarist.

72
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.890
That's all for now.

73
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.650
And we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

74
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.090
Thank you very much.
