00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.890
In this lecture, we will see how to delete the record using spring guitarist.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.110
So let's them blow a database.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.320
As of now, we have three records in a Western table.

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.840
Now let's say we want to delete this particular record that is equal to four.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.240
OK, so let's see how to do this.

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.010
Selector added The matter is delayed and this will remain seem OK.

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.200
We don't require anybody.

8
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.540
OK, so this will remain same.

9
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.250
This is our EPS.

10
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.550
And then as part variable, you need to pass the ID.

11
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.210
OK?

12
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.030
Basically, idea of the record that you want to delete, call this API as I was putting what application

13
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.820
is already running?

14
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.490
See who's it for?

15
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.450
No content, OK.

16
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.630
That means we have successfully deleted the record.

17
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.190
OK, this is the indication.

18
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.280
Great, it is one see now we just two records, OK?

19
00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.440
That third record of it was having it equal to what God delighted how we call this EPA OK?

20
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.380
At the debate, delete one who is providing this spring guitarist.

21
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.620
OK, you can compare this with our other application where we did this manually.

22
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.830
You know, what's been controller?

23
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.610
Come down, compare with this one, okay, let's run.

24
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.850
And here we are calling it bad.

25
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.200
OK, but now this is our spring guitarist, so we don't do anything OK in this particular application,

26
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.900
spring guitarist is doing all these things OK.

27
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.770
Providing this IPAs will be delayed.

28
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.520
So this is how you can delete the record using spring guitarist.

29
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.230
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

30
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.730
Thank you very much.
