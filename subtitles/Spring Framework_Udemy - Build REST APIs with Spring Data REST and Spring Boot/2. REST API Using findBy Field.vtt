00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.680
In this lecture, we will get started with the customer base.

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.360
So, for example, we want to get started and it is very immolate equal to this one, OK?

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.100
John at Gmail dot com.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.610
So what do we do with this equality under the table name?

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:22.650
Using the very close our column name is email right and value is John at Gmail dot com right?

6
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.780
And integrity, and we got the strong details.

7
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.130
Now we want to have the same thing with that is debate.

8
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.010
So we want to have one by using which our consumers can get to spend.

9
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.030
It is using the email I.D. OK.

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.630
They can pass the email I.D. as very parameter in the guidebook.

11
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.750
So this is what we want to achieve.

12
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.680
So let's go to his ideas.

13
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.880
And this is the entity glass of student employed student Adela.

14
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.710
And here we have email filled.

15
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.040
That is my the email column.

16
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.600
Now let's go to the repository for it.

17
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.610
And that is student repository.

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.950
Now here, we need to use the find my methods, which are provided by GP.

19
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.960
OK, so here does type fine by and just press control plus space.

20
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.910
It will give you some suggestions.

21
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.380
Find by email.

22
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.370
Find by first name.

23
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.230
Point by IED.

24
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.530
Find by last name.

25
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.240
OK, so select this one.

26
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.320
Find by email.

27
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.860
See, these are the automatic suggestions provided by your ID here.

28
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.180
We are using SD as OK.

29
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.030
You might be using the intelligencia, so if it is not showing you the automatic citizens, then try

30
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.780
to change the ID.

31
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.610
Or maybe different words than, OK.

32
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.810
Let me show you.

33
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.930
I'm using this word as DIA's for Dot.

34
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.010
And this is working fine for me, OK, without installing any plug in or without any configuration.

35
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.260
OK?

36
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.600
This automatic suggestions are being fine with me with ideas for Dot 8.0.

37
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.880
OK, now let's come to this one.

38
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.880
So here, right my email address, if you get it, then we will get the ones to it is, let's say we

39
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.560
have those kind of configuration.

40
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.710
OK, so we can change this to only one object, OK?

41
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.300
That is basically one recorder from this one table so that we will get us one object onboard A.D. Glass

42
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.460
and let's so this method is public.

43
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.550
See, this depends OK on your data structure, what you have in your database, if it is possible.

44
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.190
So, for example, you are finding by first name, then obviously you need least obsidian because it

45
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.120
may be possible that you can have multiple problems with the same first name.

46
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.280
Then you can go for list least student.

47
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.670
OK, so it all depends what you have in your database.

48
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.220
Here we are assuming that email ID is unique for every student, and that is obvious.

49
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.110
OK, so now this is our GDP.

50
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.650
Yes, we don't need to do anything.

51
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.870
Spring guitarist will expose this method as GDP.

52
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.530
Let's test it out.

53
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.070
I don't know what spring would application jump to postmen.

54
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.360
OK.

55
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.610
This is our student EPA, right?

56
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.130
Let me read more this yes, OK.

57
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.740
Using this, we are getting those student details, right?

58
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:12.440
According to the paid sites, now after this, OK, that you are less certain than our method this one.

59
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.610
Find my copy.

60
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.890
This one exactly the same one.

61
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.160
OK, don't make any mistake.

62
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.910
And then less, not less, but very parameter.

63
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.180
OK?

64
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.680
This one e-mail so this we need to pass.

65
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.150
Like this one, OK?

66
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.150
John at Gmail dot com.

67
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.000
So this is our goodbye.

68
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.370
And for that, we have one input, right, email.

69
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.640
So this value we need to pass is very parameter and this is exactly same as this method parameter,

70
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.880
OK?

71
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.490
Don't make any mistake called API.

72
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.190
See, we got the story and it is where it equal to 18 compared with this one, OK?

73
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.990
We are just getting one record.

74
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.700
18 joins Mitzie.

75
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:54.910
And this is hideous.

76
00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.280
We have already seen date using this, we can get the department and subject table details for that

77
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.930
particular student, right?

78
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.860
That's what we got.

79
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.530
So for example, this one, all this one.

80
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.980
See, this is the department, OK, to which it is belonging or which subjects the student is learning,

81
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.120
called labor.

82
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.790
These are the subjects using the hideous your consumer again, how to sell navigation.

83
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.770
And this is the oldest in right?

84
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.980
So this is our custom EPA find by email and how we achieve this one.

85
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.300
Using the GP, right, by writing this matter.

86
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.270
Find by email.

87
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.430
In the same way, we can have another debate as well, OK, let's hear.

88
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.180
Find by and then first name.

89
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.660
OK, this one, let's say, at least top student, OK, so it is possible there are multiple students

90
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.010
with the same first name.

91
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.920
See if this automatic suggestion is not working.

92
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.020
OK, then you don't need to worry about it.

93
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.920
You just need to type, find bite and then you're feeling, OK.

94
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.680
Here it is.

95
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.350
Email, but make sure it is in the camel case all you need to make the uppercase OK, what here?

96
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.720
See, this one is our field, right?

97
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.700
So make this in the upper keys.

98
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.750
Find my email and this is your input.

99
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.170
OK?

100
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.770
To get the record from the database, let's sell this public.

101
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.190
OK, that's it wrong.

102
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.310
I was putting what application?

103
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.210
Let me copy this meter jump to sportsmen.

104
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.110
Here we need to pass.

105
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.200
Very parameter.

106
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.760
OK.

107
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.390
Copy this method parameter the same, we need to possess Griddy parameter, what here?

108
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.210
Simple example, John called API.

109
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.820
See, we got those it's OK.

110
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.250
Let's try another one with the Peter.

111
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.350
It's equal to two, Peter.

112
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.160
OK.

113
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.920
Let me read more this is equal to two bitter see this one.

114
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.380
This is what we are getting what here.

115
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.270
There are other methods as well, OK?

116
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.050
You can explore yourself.

117
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:08.480
So this is how you can help the custom EPA using the Find Buy method, which is provided by GP.

118
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.200
So that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

119
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.610
Thank you very much.
