00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.080
So far, we have seen how to pad the records from the sequel table using.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.710
Now let's say we want to insert the record into the sequel table, so that's what we will see in this

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.340
lecture.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.830
So for example, we want to insert a new record into the roundtable.

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.890
So for that, we will use the spring date ADP and obviously we will not write any native sequel query.

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.380
So to understand this, what we will do is that we will create the Post API and what details we need

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.800
to parse to create disciplined firstname lastname in email that we need to parse in our request mail

8
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.320
or in the format of Jason for our post dpa.

9
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.170
And we don't need to parse that reveals value.

10
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.590
Why?

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.710
Because this is Auto-enrolment Byte my sequence database.

12
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.680
OK, so these three fields value we need to parse in the request payload in the format of JSON for our

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.460
Post API.

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.810
So let's say the Post API inside our Struan controller.

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.890
So using the annotation at Borst mapping.

16
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.910
OK, so the Euphrates Slice create.

17
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.920
So this will return the newly created student, OK, let me do maximize.

18
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.630
Student create student.

19
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.240
The same class we will use to get the rigorous payload using the add request body, in addition.

20
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.360
Student.

21
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.780
Now from here, we will call the service.

22
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.880
OK, so let's go to one service, create another matter.

23
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.430
This will also retain the student object, create student.

24
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.240
And here.

25
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.520
We will get this object, OK, whatever, basically we are passing in the format of this and nobody

26
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.850
crisp bill or now using this repository.

27
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.330
OK.

28
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.920
All the meter seal.

29
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.460
And we need to pass the object of our entity Glass.

30
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.190
So here we go, and the glass is strewn.

31
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.230
OK, so pass it.

32
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.230
This one.

33
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.570
Now, let's go to this amateur.

34
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.080
So this is accepting the object of Entity Glass and returns is OK after inserting into the particular

35
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.240
square table, see, it's there was a given entity and returning the incidence of it, OK, so we can

36
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.020
return this one.

37
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.410
So this will insert the new record investment table and also will return the newly created record.

38
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.540
We need the idea for its value, right?

39
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.870
That is automatically generated by Michael database, OK.

40
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.850
So that also will be written by it.

41
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.050
So this we need to call from our controller.

42
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.760
Student surveys.

43
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.910
And passed the object.

44
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.380
Now we're all good with our EPA, so let's I don't know what spring would application until then.

45
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.060
Jump ball postmen, OK.

46
00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.920
So this is our create EPA.

47
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.970
Gender, you are a student slash create, and this is a deep post, OK?

48
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.940
Copy this decision to save the dying body roll and select the JASON.

49
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.340
Say the first name is Peter.

50
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.650
Last name is Mark.

51
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.160
Do you any values OK, but don't provide it feels value, OK?

52
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.670
Now, call this EPA.

53
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.480
See, they got a successful response to the rocket, and this is just just it is OK, just now we inserted

54
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.570
personalities in our musical database, OK?

55
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.330
So let's created this table to verified.

56
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.090
See it equal to three.

57
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.000
This is automatically generated, OK?

58
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.670
Peter, Mark, Peter, D.M. dot com.

59
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.280
OK, now let's go to a Western service.

60
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.710
See, we just called it the sale meter and parcel of the object of A.D. glass.

61
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.460
That's it.

62
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.460
We haven't brought any negatives sequel committee.

63
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.010
We haven't redone any insert into video games or industry.

64
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.420
No.

65
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.980
We just have use it ISO provided by GPA.

66
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.860
That's it.

67
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.650
Jibia will do the work for us, and it will generate the natives equal greatly for us.

68
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.400
OK, we don't need to worry about it.

69
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.320
This is all you need to do.

70
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.320
Using the repository called Damasio Method and past the object of A.D. Glass.

71
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.150
And this will return the newly created record.

72
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.750
OK.

73
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.900
In our example, where ID equal to three?

74
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.540
So this is how you can insert the record into the sequel table using GP.

75
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.280
So that's all for now and will proceed further in the next lecture.

76
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.600
Thank you very much.
