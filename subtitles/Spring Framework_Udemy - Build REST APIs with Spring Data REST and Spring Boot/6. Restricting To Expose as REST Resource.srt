1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,680
No Springwood application.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:08,610
We held three and any classes and three repositories using this entity, classes and repositories spring,

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,610
that arrest is exposing them as a resource resource.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,710
So this is the default behavior right now, let's say for the particular table.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,800
We don't want to expose it as a resource resource.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,170
So that's what we are going to do in this lecture.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,510
So, for example, we don't want to expose department people as a resource.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,080
So let's see how to do it, OK?

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,800
So go to its repository.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,130
You know what?

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:32,640
Example?

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:33,930
This is one, right?

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,400
Department repository.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,380
How dangerous it is, rest resorts, this one, OK?

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,800
And exported attribute equal to falls.

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,060
That's it.

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,370
Now let's renovate Springwood Obligation.

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,570
Jump to browser.

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,660
And it this you are all for our application.

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,710
Let me see now we have two resources one force, one table and another one for subjects landing table.

21
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,950
We don't have recipes for our department table.

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,470
Basically spinning that arrest is not providing any recipe for our department table.

23
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,150
Why?

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,430
Because we how this an addition on top of this repository for the department.

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,710
But it is the resource exporter equal to falls.

26
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,610
So this is very helpful because it may be possible that you how many tables in your school database.

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,450
And it is not always necessary that you want to expose all of them as rest a resource so that you can

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,770
use this annotation at rest resource exporting equal to false.

29
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,070
So this is how you can restrict resources by working with spring guitarist.

30
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,780
That's all for now.

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,360
And we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

32
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,800
Thank you very much.
