1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,630
In this lecture, we will see how to update the record using the rest API provided by spring guitarist.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,620
So here our Q&amp;A is less students.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,180
OK, so that was the.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,510
We just need to change the ATP methodology, select the pod because we want to update the record.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,480
OK, now let's go to our chat room table.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,080
And here we have three records now say, for example, we want to update us and it is where it's equal

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,560
to four.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,160
OK.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,650
This particular record we want to update.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,990
So if we need to possess part variable less for like this one?

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,530
Now, let's come to regress payload that we need to pass in the parliament of dissent.

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:47,480
So for example, we want to change this first name from Peter to Peter one.

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,250
OK.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,750
Other attributes we don't want to update.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,700
Basically, other column values we don't want to update OK for this particular record.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,860
But still, we need to pass this one.

17
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:05,240
While calling the debate or debate to update the record called this disappear because the success response?

18
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,970
See first name Peter one.

19
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,620
Let's verify in the database.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,460
See, the first name got changed up from Peter to Peter.

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,000
One.

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,380
But look at the request below.

23
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:23,080
We still need to pass other attributes, even if we don't want to update this attribute values.

24
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:29,500
OK, now let's not pass this one and say, for example, we want to go back to Peter.

25
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,000
OK, Rhonda Peter one.

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,060
Call this EPA check the response.

27
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,960
These values got nullified taking the database.

28
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,640
See, for these two columns now, values got update, it is not obviously this has got changed, OK

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,210
from Peter one to Peter, but look at this column values, OK?

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,000
This two column values got nullified.

31
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:52,920
Why?

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,570
Because we are not passing these two values.

33
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:55,890
OK?

34
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,930
These two last name and email, you know, what exists or in the form of decent.

35
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,370
So this is the iPad of, OK, that whatever fills you, how you need to pass all the values, even if

36
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,430
you are bleeding, that feels value if you are not updating it.

37
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,350
Still, you need to pass it if you don't provide these attributes so that you don't want to update than

38
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,610
it will consider that you want to update those attributes as null values.

39
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:28,470
OK, so this is the put that is provided by spring day to rest, and this is how you can update the

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,920
record.

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,020
So that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,550
Thank you very much.
