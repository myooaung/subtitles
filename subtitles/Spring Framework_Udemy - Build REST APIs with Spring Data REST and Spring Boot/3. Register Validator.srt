1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,000
In the previous lecture, we created this validator.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,120
Now let's register it with spring guitarist.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,850
So we already have one configuration class, right?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,810
This one that we are implementing repository, it is configured.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,810
So here we need to order it one more method.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,820
So let's go to this interface.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,830
Now, let's come down.

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,670
This is the matter.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,230
OK.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,340
This one we need to order, I configured very decent repository event listener.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,590
Read this one, OK.

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,800
All right, this matter to add validators manually.

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,560
So copy this metadata from here.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,330
And all right.

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,880
What he had in our class public, Margaret, with at or right?

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,050
Bring this brocades, let me do maximize.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,170
Now, using the object of this listener, OK, we need to call the meter at validator, so here.

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,290
Called the matter at a validator.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,820
Now let's go to this matter.

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,900
So this matter has two metal parameters, OK?

21
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,430
The first one is event type of setting and another one is type of validator.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,320
In the previous lecture, we have already created the class right, which is implementing validator

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,590
interface so that we need to provide order here so that classes right this one right validator Ambien

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,740
saw here, whatever it.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,910
So this is the instance of.

26
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,750
Validator IPL and possible here.

27
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,820
Now, let's come to even part, so here we are creating this brand, right?

28
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,930
So before we create the student, we want to impose validation.

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,050
So our event will be before create.

30
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,760
So we need to provide like this in the formidable Sting.

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,270
Make sure you provide exactly like this, OK, following the camel case, be in the lower case and see

32
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,320
in the upper case.

33
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,850
Now we have created a validator and registered it with spring guitarist.

34
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,490
So in the next lecture, we will test it out.

35
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,780
That's all for now and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

36
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,280
Thank you very much.
