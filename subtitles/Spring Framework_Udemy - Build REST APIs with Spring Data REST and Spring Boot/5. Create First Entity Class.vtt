00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.360
In my physical database, we house table now while working with the GPA, you need to remember one thing

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.530
that we are not going to write any sequel query in our spring wood application.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.450
So here we hosted roundtable.

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.670
So this will be represented by Java Glass and that is called as Andy Douglas.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.490
And that's what we are going to create in this lecture.

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.630
So this table will be represented by Douglas, and these columns will be represented by the fields that

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.030
we will define inside the entity class.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.510
So let's create the entity class for this student table.

9
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.520
So good with ideas, and here will create a separate package or give whatever entity class.

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.580
So let's sell a separate package.

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.280
Give it name is and did he?

12
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.880
Now, create Douglas.

13
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.420
SERE student.

14
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.220
Now, the very first thing is, we need to tell that this is not the normal Podio class, but this is

15
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.080
an entity class, OK, so that we need to define using the identity annotation.

16
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.350
Make sure this is from Java Expert Assistance Package.

17
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.340
OK, select this one.

18
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.440
Now which table?

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.300
This is representing student table, right?

20
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.690
So that we need to define using the add table annotation.

21
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.390
This is also from Dalet persistence.

22
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.000
OK, and the table name is student.

23
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.950
So by this introduction, we seeing that this is not the normal Portugal's class, but this is an entity

24
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.280
glass.

25
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.250
And by this generation, we are seeing that this glass is representing this green table in our mythical

26
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.790
database.

27
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.920
Now we have four columns that ID, first name, last name in email, so we need to define the four fields

28
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.090
in our entity class.

29
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.080
And remember one thing, OK, we need to have the appropriate data.

30
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.560
So here illegal means having the database begin.

31
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.560
OK, so we will go for long day today and for these three, OK, that'd be how Vermeer did today.

32
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.770
We will go for starting today B number and d d class.

33
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.400
So let's sell this for.

34
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.260
You know what?

35
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.100
And ridiculous?

36
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.450
Let's do it quickly.

37
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.990
So private, long, Eddie.

38
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.090
First name.

39
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.380
Last name.

40
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.770
And emit.

41
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.900
Let's go getters and setters for this piece.

42
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.860
Source.

43
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.150
For all the hills and centrist new controls it.

44
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.340
Go for it, yes, go on the top.

45
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.500
So here we have this feels right, like, say, for example, first name.

46
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.430
So this will represent the first named column that we have in this debate.

47
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.230
OK, so we need to do this mapping how using the add column annotation over this field, use the notation

48
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.770
ET column.

49
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.160
This is also from the Java expert assistance provided the colony that is first underscored name.

50
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.380
The same thing we need to do for last name is, well, OK, copied what here?

51
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.360
So this is representing last column up A. But, OK, now look at this stuff, it's OK, it's animal.

52
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.950
And here we go.

53
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.660
Column says it, animal.

54
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.240
So these are exactly merging, OK?

55
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.800
This bill's idea animal are exactly merging with our column names.

56
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.270
So here it's fine if we don't provide a contaminant and like this one, OK?

57
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.120
So, for example, at Admit.

58
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.710
This one, it's been OK if we don't provide this one.

59
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.780
Because this email field is exactly matching with this email column.

60
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.350
OK.

61
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.200
And same for ideas with ideas the colony.

62
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.280
And here we go.

63
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.080
I'd feel so it's fine, OK?

64
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.540
Still, if you want to, you can provide at column annotation, but here it's exactly matching.

65
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.820
So I'm not using the add column annotation.

66
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.840
Yes.

67
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.030
For first name and last name, it is required.

68
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.420
Why?

69
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.310
Because here we have failed us.

70
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.110
First name, OK, obviously in the camel case and our column name is first underscored name.

71
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.700
Same for the last name is with.

72
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.680
So this is kind of mismatch.

73
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.840
So we need to use that.

74
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.600
Add column annotation, no investment table.

75
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.660
We have this ID column, which is primary great so that we need to define using the Ad ID in addition.

76
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.310
This is also from the Java Export Assistance Package, OK?

77
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.760
Make sure you are using the right package while doing the import.

78
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.570
See, this in addition is required OK for you or into the class, you need to have one field that is

79
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.830
having the unique value.

80
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.000
So here we go.

81
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.360
It will be know, right?

82
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.310
It's a primary key.

83
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.020
So obviously that is unique identifier because each row is having that different value.

84
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.210
So this is a very unique identifier.

85
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.970
If you don't provide this ad I.D. annotation for any of your fields, OK, then spring data GPA will

86
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:48.600
not work.

87
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.110
OK.

88
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.120
So make sure you have this annotation.

89
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.670
Now we know, right?

90
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.860
We have this column is auto enrolment, right?

91
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.480
So that we need to define using the ad generated value.

92
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.430
And steadily equal to generation type, but identity.

93
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.700
So this is over, entity, glass window, Java.

94
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.240
So whenever we need to refer to Table, we will use the student less and whenever we need to refer any

95
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.090
of these columns, OK, we will use the appropriate field.

96
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.910
So for example, we want to refer to first name column.

97
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.040
So we will refer to first name field.

98
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.770
Likewise, what other columns and features of it?

99
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.400
OK.

100
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.680
So this is the package inside which we have entity class so that we need to define.

101
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.250
You know what I mean?

102
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.760
Class.

103
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.240
OK?

104
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:45.220
Using the annotation as entities can add entity, scan and provide duplicates like this one.

105
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.830
See, this annotation is required.

106
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.280
You need to provide the package, which is contained in your entry classes.

107
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.010
As of now, we just have one entity class that is to render Java and that is inside this particular

108
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.520
package.

109
00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.060
OK.

110
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.800
So Springwood will and I'll work with this being that AGP and we'll scan this package.

111
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.780
And here we have defined the add and diddy and table annotations.

112
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.550
So this is the first one, the glass, which is representing strewn tabletop musical database.

113
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.260
So that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

114
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.670
Thank you very much.
