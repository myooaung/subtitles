1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,630
Bill, now we have seen recipes which are automatically provided by spring guitarist, but that is not

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,920
always the Huskies, right?

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,880
He might have some requirements that is automatically bloated.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,530
IPAs are not sufficient.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,960
So for example, we want to have one debate in which we want to pass.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,260
Melody of this is very parameter.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,770
And in return, we want to help students.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,030
It is.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:31,020
Or let's say we want to have one year debate in which we want to get all those students whose first

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,070
name is John.

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,370
Well, let's say we have another scenario in that we want to get all those students whose first name

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:38,910
is John.

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,440
And last name is Smith.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,250
OK, so what we do in the sequel, Grady V. and Grady date between the two columns, plus niman last

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:47,520
name.

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,330
So this kind of requirements we might help and whatever.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,690
Automatically generated recipes by putting guitarist are not sufficient, so we need to have the custom

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,170
IPAs.

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,320
So this is what we are going to do in the upcoming lectures.

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,470
Let me clarify, OK.

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,710
We are not going to hold the risk controller to develop this custom space.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,490
We will use the DPA.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,870
So if you are already working with the GPA, then you might be aware find my methods, which are provided

24
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,850
by GPA.

25
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,800
So say, for example, if you want to get the record right by email I.D. So what we do in the sequel

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,750
where email equal to this one.

27
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,520
But we are using the GPA.

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,920
OK, so we are not writing the sequel grades in our Springwood application so we can use the find my

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,900
method to find my full name.

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,400
So here, find my email.

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,070
So, for example, finding my first name.

32
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:38,910
OK.

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,430
So whatever field you have that you need to put up to the point about and those matters are provided

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,420
by GPA.

35
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,330
We just need to write the methods in the repository.

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Let's say we want to go and gritty.

37
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,390
So what we do in the Jeep, you find my first name and last name.

38
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,920
So that will apply the ambiguity between the first name and last name columns.

39
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,460
So this kind of methods we need to write in the repository.

40
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,760
So Spring Guitarist will use these methods and will expose them as recipes.

41
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,240
OK, so our duty is to just write the methods in the repository.

42
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:13,810
That's it.

43
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,870
The rest of the things will be provided by Spring Day guitarist.

44
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,850
And that's why we don't need rest controller for developing the custom APIs.

45
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,080
So this is what we are going to do, and we will get started from the next lecture.

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,400
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

47
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,720
Thank you very much.
