00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.770
Now we have Springwood Obligation and also we are having the bicycle database.

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.930
So what we need to do here is we need to establish the Conexant from of a springboard application to

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.010
bicycle database.

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.100
Don't worry, we don't need to write any court order here.

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.430
We just need to set couple of properties.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.430
And that's it.

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.900
So let's go for it.

8
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.630
So this is always been an open application or properties file.

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.360
And here we need to set the couple of properties.

10
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.750
So the very first is splendored datasource.

11
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.900
But you are in.

12
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.350
Yes, this one.

13
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.930
So, Judy, busy calling my sequel.

14
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.930
We are having the Mitsuko database, right?

15
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.760
Colin Zealousness, we have my sequel database in our local machine.

16
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.850
And by default, my sequel runs on three three six port slurs.

17
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.040
And here we need to provide my sequel schema.

18
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.170
So let's go to Mexico database.

19
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.320
So here the schema is university, right?

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.890
So copied and provide it here now.

21
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.960
We need to provide the username and password for our midcycle database, OK, so the first is username.

22
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.590
For me, it is rude and password is also the root.

23
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.680
See, this username and password may be different for you.

24
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.950
OK, this is what my local machine, so whatever you provided while doing the installation of a bicycle

25
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.210
that you need to provide username and password for your local bicycle database, OK?

26
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.340
For me, it is rude and rude.

27
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.490
Now, let's I don't know what's between what obligation to verify that everything is good.

28
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.300
Ron, this spring, and this is over meaningless by default spring, whatever he gets will run on.

29
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.830
88.

30
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.680
OK, see get got started on Port 80 80.

31
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.970
So now we are all good.

32
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.580
If you have done any mistake, OK, while giving these properties, your whatever application itself

33
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.270
will not start.

34
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.190
OK, so now we are good.

35
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.430
So now we have a daily physical activity over bicycle database from our spinning board application,

36
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.930
so that's all for now, and we'll proceed further.

37
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.990
The next lecture?

38
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.400
Thank you very much.
