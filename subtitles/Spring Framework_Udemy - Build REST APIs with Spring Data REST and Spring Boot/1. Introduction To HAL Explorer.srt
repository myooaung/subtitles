00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,150
Bill, now we have seen recipes using spring that arrest and in the response we are getting this kind

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,530
of hyper media links.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,840
So this is hitting us concept, right?

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,710
And we are having hell as the implementation of hit you is.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,100
Now here we are using postmen to call over wristbands.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,860
So here comes Hal Explorer.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,570
So what happens, OK?

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,290
Hal Explorer provides a nice UI within our application.

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,700
With that, we can heat our wristbands so that we don't need any third party.

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,550
Just like postman or any other is plain to call our wristbands.

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:42,170
So Health Explorer provides a nice UI to call over wristbands, and we don't need to code anything OK.

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,750
We don't need to write code to get this.

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,210
You know, HAL Explorer provides that.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,970
And on top of it, we can consider HAL Explorer as documentation about our wristbands.

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,910
If you are working with swagger or open API, then you can compare it with HAL Explorer.

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,000
So it had exploded within of replicates, and we can have you, I, to call our recipes.

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:11,620
And also we can consider it does raise debate documentation now how to use the explorer so that we see

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,970
in the next lecture.

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,350
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

20
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,730
Thank you very much.
