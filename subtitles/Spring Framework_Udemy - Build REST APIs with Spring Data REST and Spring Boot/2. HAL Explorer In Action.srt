1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,210
Let's get started with Health Explorer for Health Explorer.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,110
We just need to add one dependency, another bombed-out eczema, and that is something that arrest her

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,740
explorer.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,530
So at this dependency in the bombed out example?

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,460
And that's it.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,480
We don't need to do any other configuration and no code is required.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,180
So now we are good with Health Explorer.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,170
So let's run over Springwood Application Build, then jump to browser.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,550
Now, this is the you are in for everybody guessing, right?

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,970
Look on Horst $882 EPA.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,270
So this you are in.

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,170
See, now we are getting nice you.

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,750
So this is provided by Health Explorer.

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,210
See, we don't have any code, OK, you know, what's being good application for this UI?

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,740
So this is provided by Health Explorer.

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,670
Here it is, listing down the resources, students, departments and subjects, and there are different

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,490
added methods.

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:52,780
OK?

19
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,160
This is the biggest post board, but don't delete.

20
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,960
Now, let's get the students OK, so click on this.

21
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,150
Did the biggest request.

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,630
So this is the URL for the EPA.

23
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,150
Here we can pass the bid.

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,920
No bid size starting projection, OK?

25
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,780
And this is that it didn't matter.

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,600
So this is if you want to, you can put OK.

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,860
Click on this go.

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:16,910
Come down.

29
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,390
See, we got a response.

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,930
So this is similar to what we used to get with the postman.

31
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,700
OK, now here we are getting that dense runs because our size is 10.

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,230
So click on this one.

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,960
And this is that it is for that particular student.

34
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,190
Come down.

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,980
This is the self navigation links for the consumer.

36
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,480
OK, using the headers and we hope, help for its implementation.

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,370
Let's say we want to get the department it is for this particular student.

38
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,490
So click on this at Typekit for the department.

39
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,420
Click on this one.

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,730
Go on the top.

41
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,840
See, now we are getting that department.

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,830
It is for this particular student that render it equal to 11.

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,540
So this is the EPA.

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,440
We are calling.

45
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,990
And here you can have the ADP headers while calling the rest API.

46
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,960
Let's go back to the homepage.

47
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,210
It's less AP.

48
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,340
Now, using this added post began, Kerry had decided disappeared, right?

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,510
So click on this one.

50
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,910
This is the EPA and see, these are the details we need to parse.

51
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,740
OK, for this to post EPA Department email, first name, last name in subject landing.

52
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,920
Here we can pass our request bill or in the form of Jason and click on Google.

53
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,790
So that will create the student.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,010
So basically that will create the record in the.

55
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,580
So this kind of things you can try out yourself, OK?

56
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,380
You can explore these options.

57
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,440
That'd be good.

58
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,160
Pause board bed, then delete metals.

59
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,600
With her explorer, your consumer will get the idea that what he or she needs to pass while calling

60
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,440
the EPA.

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,320
So this is kind of a rest API documentation.

62
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,980
Earlier there was HAL browser, but now it is deprecated and the newer one is HAL Explorer.

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,160
So this is your information, OK?

64
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,700
Hal Browser is now deprecated, and the newer version is HAL Explorer.

65
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,130
So that's all about HAL Explorer, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

66
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,330
Thank you very much.
