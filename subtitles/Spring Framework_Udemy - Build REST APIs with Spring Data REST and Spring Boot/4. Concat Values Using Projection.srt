1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,470
Below we have seen projection and here we helpless projection using which we are exposing pupils in

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,060
an email of the student.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,870
Now let's say there is a consumer with asking for the full name of the student in the decent response.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,230
That means first name space, last name.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,330
So the consumer is asking for the new attribute qualities.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,140
Pull them in the decent response.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,420
So let's see, how do I do this with projection?

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,700
So inside our projection, let's say a one meter signature with written Dipper's string say, for example,

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,750
get full name.

10
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,160
We don't have any look at his full name inside our student class.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,090
That's fine.

12
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,830
Now to achieve this, we need to consider the values first name and last name, right?

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,430
These two values, we need to conclude so that we do using the added value, in addition, that is provided

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,570
by spring framework.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:03,950
So on top of this matter, how to add value in addition, import it now using the spending experts and

16
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,510
language will achieve this, OK?

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,140
So with double quotes has and is.

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,760
And they don't target.

19
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,220
So this target is basically object to what entity, class, which entity class, the entity class for

20
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,810
which we how these projects and so, you know, for example, the entity classes student.

21
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,740
OK, go inside this class here we held these two bills, right?

22
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,790
First name and last name.

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,650
And these two values we want to get and we have the object of this class, right?

24
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,750
So we can access these two pills right inside our projection using the object.

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,340
Dot first name like this?

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,440
OK, now at the space, OK, using content and in the same way, we need to have that last name.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,690
So copy this and this is now.

28
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,430
Last name?

29
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,480
That's it.

30
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,550
I don't know what's being what application.

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,710
Until then, jump to Bossman.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,800
All this EPA to get US warrants and apply the projection using this very parameter.

33
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,240
All these EPA.

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,090
See, now we are getting this new attribute in the U.S. response.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,180
Full name Peter Spears mark that means first name Spears last name.

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,540
OK.

37
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,850
And this is applicable for all the records.

38
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:26,470
See, from where it is coming from, this project said OK, first projects and this is the matter will

39
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,770
again matter signature.

40
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,900
And here we are doing the content.

41
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,120
OK, first name Spears last name.

42
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,300
So this is how you can connect the values while working with projects on.

43
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,740
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further the next lecture.

44
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,160
Thank you very much.
