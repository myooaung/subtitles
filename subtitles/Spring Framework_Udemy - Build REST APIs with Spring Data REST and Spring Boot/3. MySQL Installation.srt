00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:09,200
Hello and welcome back in this lecture, we will download and install Mike Wall in our local machine

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,850
in this course.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,460
We are going to use Mike Wall as the database connecting to our spring wood application.

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:23,270
So here is the official website of my sequel just got here and download the music well, according to

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,350
your operating system.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,970
So this includes my cycle server and my cycle workbench.

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:36,020
My cycle server is required because we are going to run the database in our local machine and to execute

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,370
the queries on that server.

9
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,390
We need you.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,350
That is my cycle workbench to execute the queries.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,920
So download and install, according to her operating system after installing it.

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,430
If you are a Windows user, then go inside your program files.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,060
You will see this folder green created Michael go inside the physical server inside the bin.

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,900
Here you will see one that is my security to start the my server in our local machine.

15
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,180
We need to run this easy fight file, so just click and it will start.

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,490
The music was there were in our local machine.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,800
If this is not working for you, then there is another option as well.

18
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,750
The search for the services and inside the services.

19
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,790
Go for Michael.

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,060
You see or here, just right click and start.

21
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,190
So this will start the equals surrounding our local scene.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,440
If you take the properties, it is pointing to only my second deed or the file you see.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,570
That's what we just now thin.

24
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,080
So now my the robot is running in our local machine.

25
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,230
So let's connect to it using my physical workbench.

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,440
So open the bicycle workbench.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,340
And you need to make the connection.

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,710
Localised, you can you can accent anything almost is localized.

29
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,550
This is the by default port for the local music conservatory.

30
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,300
Three 06.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,640
Rudy the username and password whatever you give during the installation.

32
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,920
Click on the disconnect, then see.

33
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,040
This is successful, so we are good toward here.

34
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,280
Just click audio to connect to local database.

35
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,110
So here are the default schemas provided by my sequel that Spain, as we proceed in the course, will

36
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,140
create another schema for our microservices.

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,870
So make sure before the next lecture, you download and install my wall in your local machine.

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,270
So that's all for now.

39
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,000
We'll proceed further in the next lecture.

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,260
Thank you very much.
