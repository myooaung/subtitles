00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.170
In the upcoming lectures, I will cover the basics of spring data you see before we jump to spring guitarist

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.130
is to develop the recipes you need to have the basic knowledge of GP.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.800
Now it may be possible that you are already aware of Jibia, then that's completely fine.

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.920
You can skip this section and jump to the next one.

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.440
But here you need to understand one thing OK, you are already aware of Depew, but it may be possible

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.040
that other people who are taking this course are not aware of.

7
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.040
So for them, I'm covering the basics of GP, so I hope you will understand this, OK?

8
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.640
If you already know Jibia that Spain jump to the next six, and for those who are not aware of it,

9
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.710
I will just cover the basics of GP.

10
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.590
See, GP was completely separate topic.

11
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.700
OK, so it's not possible to cover all things about GP in this course.

12
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.590
So I will just cover the basics of GP and then we will jump to spring guitarist.

13
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.360
Now, before we jump to spring AGP, let me give you a short introduction about it.

14
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.530
So here GPA stands for Java Persistence API.

15
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:15.900
The main purpose of GPA is to deal with any of the sequel databases, be it Michael Equal or equal Postgres

16
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.830
or any of those sequel database to perform the grand operations or the particular table from $0 application

17
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.340
or the Springwood Application, write the sequel queries, right?

18
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.380
But what if we don't want to write the sequel queries in our spring board application?

19
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.830
So there comes JP using the GPA.

20
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.290
We can avoid the sequel queries in our spring wood application while working with GPA.

21
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.940
There are two important things.

22
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.590
One is Entity Glass and another one is a repository.

23
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.460
See, each IPO cycle table will be represented by Entity Glass and inside the Entity Glass.

24
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.600
You will be having the fields and that will represent the columns that you have inside the particular

25
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.200
table.

26
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.880
Okay, and for each entity glass, you will be having one repository.

27
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.230
So this is the V.

28
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.490
For the second table, you will be having the Entity Glass and water entity glass.

29
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.410
You will be having one repository.

30
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.200
So using this entity, glass and repository, you can perform the crud operations or the particular

31
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.960
table that you have in your second database.

32
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.280
While working with Libya, whenever you need to refer to the table, you will refer to the entity Glass.

33
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.530
And whenever you need to refer to the particular column, you will refer to the particular field that

34
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.360
you have inside your entity glass.

35
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.250
Don't worry how to hold the entity glass and how to use the repository.

36
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.980
All the things you will learn in the upcoming lectures.

37
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.170
In the upcoming lectures, you will learn how to perform the Kroto operations using spring.

38
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.320
That.

39
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.890
Yes, this is the introduction to Jibia and will proceed further in the next lecture.

40
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.270
Thank you very much.
