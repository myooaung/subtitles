00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.510
Now we have student into glass, which is representing one table that we have in our bicycle database,

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.030
see by working with Jibia.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.430
We need to have a repository and using that only we can perform the current operations or the particular

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.850
table.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.520
So here we have 380 class, right?

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.070
So let's create the student repository.

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.240
So for a repository, let's say a separate package.

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.050
First, create the package repository.

9
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.920
Now, let's clear the repository, and that will be an interface.

10
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.880
OK, so let's create the new Interface C student repository.

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.590
Mark, this with add repository, in addition.

12
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.110
This one from the spring framework.

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.650
And here we need to extend deep repository.

14
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.410
This one led me to maximize so that you can have a better look.

15
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.790
See here we need to provide two things, OK.

16
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.470
One is either entity Glass.

17
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.550
So here in our example, which one does $2.4, right?

18
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.320
So this one's related to glass.

19
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.380
And the second is unique identifiers data type.

20
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.750
So let's go to our entity glass.

21
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.850
Which one is our unique identifier?

22
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.330
OK.

23
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.330
The one which we market it at ID and a decent rate.

24
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.320
So this is the.

25
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.180
What is the data type of it?

26
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.010
Long, so copied.

27
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.920
Go to our repository and provide it or here.

28
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.880
OK.

29
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.390
So this is one repository for which entity, class student and what is the day-to-day for our unique

30
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.990
identifier.

31
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.660
Long.

32
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.070
OK?

33
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.230
And this is what student table?

34
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.770
OK.

35
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.710
So for each musical table, you will be having one entity class, and for that entity glass, you will

36
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.300
be having one repository.

37
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.470
So using this repository and this entity class, they can perform the crud operations over the student

38
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.180
data that we have in our my school database.

39
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.540
OK.

40
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.420
In the upcoming lectures, you received how to use this repository and all.

41
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.040
OK.

42
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.140
So this is our repository.

43
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.990
So we need to provide this package.

44
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.410
OK.

45
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.430
And we need to enable the repository for our spring wood application.

46
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.390
So this is our main class, and let's enable.

47
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.120
GP repositories and provide the package, OK, this is the package which is containing a lot of repositories

48
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.000
as of now, we just have one repository which one student repository that's just now we created, right?

49
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.950
So while working with Libya, you need to remember one thing for each sequel table, you will be having

50
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.940
an identity class.

51
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.180
And for that and the deals, you will be having one repository and using that repository identity class,

52
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.930
you can perform the current operations over the people here.

53
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.800
In our example, we'll screen table for that.

54
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.060
We have Entity Class $1.0 and we have repository as student repository.

55
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.640
See, for always being good application.

56
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.670
We need to enable the DP repository OK using this annotation.

57
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.570
If you don't provide this one, then spinning data DP will not work.

58
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.430
So make sure you have these annotation and this we have already seen in the previous lecture.

59
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.430
So now we are all good with the entity, class and repository, and from the next lecture we will get

60
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.560
started with the spinning data DP.

61
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.330
So that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

62
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.710
Thank you very much.
