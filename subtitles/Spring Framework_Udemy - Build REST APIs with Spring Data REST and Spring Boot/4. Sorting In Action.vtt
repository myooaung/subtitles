00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.440
In this lecture, BBC How to you sorting while working with spring guitarist so here in our bicycle

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.030
database, the Austrian table?

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.060
Now let's see here we want to start student.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.680
It is by first name caller.

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.390
Then what we do in the sequel?

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:16.320
OK.

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.730
Order by then.

8
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.660
Our column name, right?

9
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.510
So here first name and brand equity.

10
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.230
So now we are sorting this and it is by first name column, OK?

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.990
And by default, the director then is ascending.

12
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.810
And if we want to sort by first name in the descending order, OK, then we do like this right in the

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.040
sequel database.

14
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.660
Now let's do the same thing while working with spring guitarist.

15
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.250
Let's jump to Bossman.

16
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.970
This is the EPA we're calling right to get this it.

17
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.390
And depending on the pitch size, we are getting the details.

18
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.930
So let's call this EPA of a spring board application is already running.

19
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.310
OK, so called EPA.

20
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.730
And we got 10 records, OK, because our page sizes 10.

21
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.510
Now let's apply, citing what he had OK while working with spring guitarist and that we need to do using

22
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.680
that query parameter.

23
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.090
So here in the URL, we need to pass one query parameter chart.

24
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.720
OK.

25
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.910
So Article two now here by which column we want to sort by first name column, right?

26
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.880
So let's go to our entity class $1.0.

27
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.170
Open this one.

28
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.550
Here we have map it a first name column with this will right first name.

29
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.030
So this we need to parse, OK, we don't need to parse the colony.

30
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.440
Don't make a mistake, OK?

31
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.940
We need to pass this bill.

32
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.750
OK, with which we have done the mapping et column, in addition.

33
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.850
So this we need to pass word here.

34
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.480
That's it.

35
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.290
Called EPA.

36
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.720
See, let's compare with this one, OK?

37
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.850
Don't provide anything, what here?

38
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.120
Now compare 24, 14 13.

39
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.930
Sorry.

40
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.450
24, 14, 23 and 13, right?

41
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.970
So 24.

42
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.690
Then we are getting 14, 23 and 13 and so on.

43
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.780
So here also by default, the direct sun is ascending.

44
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.660
But let's say we want to help descending that accent.

45
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.620
So under your field, OK, how the comma and provide like this one DSC for the descending called IPA?

46
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.190
Let's compare with our second one.

47
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.500
OK?

48
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.930
17 for 17.

49
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.030
So it's equal to 17 for seven in 10.

50
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.720
So while working with spring, that arrest, if you want to add to the sorting, then this is all you

51
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.200
need to do.

52
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.650
You need to pass one query parameter that is sort equal to your field, whatever you have again, mapping

53
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.580
with your column in all and the direction by default sending.

54
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.800
So if you want us ending that X and then you don't need to provide anything or here, this is fine.

55
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.350
OK?

56
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.600
By default, these are sending.

57
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.970
But if you want descending, then you need to provide explicitly, OK, so call this one.

58
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.270
Now here, our bid sizes tent, right, so along with this sorting set, for example, we want to help

59
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.170
Biagini, isn't it?

60
00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.200
Let's see.

61
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.020
We want to get that topic.

62
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.420
So on that, we should get phone records, right?

63
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.210
Because our bid says it's 10 and total, we have 24 records.

64
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.560
OK.

65
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.830
So in this great, if we say, then we should get these four records on the part of it.

66
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.280
So let's sales starting and bidding isn't together.

67
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.210
So after this, OK, we need to pass another query parameter garbage number equal to three.

68
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.220
That means to write zero based index called API 13 23 49 24.

69
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.740
See, this is what we are getting on the top of Page Portal for records.

70
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.160
So if you want, you can help businessmen starting together as well, OK?

71
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.160
And this we have already seen in the previous lectures, right?

72
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.320
So now the focus is on this part.

73
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.130
This one?

74
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.440
From here to here.

75
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.980
OK, so to do the sorting while working with spring guitarist.

76
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.270
This is what you need to do.

77
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.430
So that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

78
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.870
Thank you very much.
