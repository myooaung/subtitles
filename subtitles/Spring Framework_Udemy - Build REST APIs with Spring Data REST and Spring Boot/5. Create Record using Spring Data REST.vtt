00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.940
In this lecture, we will see how to create the record industrial table using spinning data arrest.

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.440
So the theme you are able use OK, that is provided by spring guitarist.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.420
That is less students, OK?

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.500
The more decide.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.220
We are not getting the student by it.

6
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.730
OK, Jane, these two had to be pushed and we need to pass the details in the apartment of Jason.

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.020
OK.

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.110
That is basically what expelled student leaders.

9
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.880
So let me copy this, OK?

10
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.000
We don't need to pass the ID of its value body.

11
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.200
Come down.

12
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.110
OK, roll.

13
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.860
Select the Jason.

14
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.900
And.

15
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.450
So, for example, first name Peter.

16
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.350
OK.

17
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.280
Mark, see, for example, email Peter D.M. dot com, that's it, took it over.

18
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.550
Springwood application is already running and in the database.

19
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.170
As of now, we have two records.

20
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.060
Let's call this post-debate.

21
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.470
We got the success responsi.

22
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.020
It's equal to four.

23
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.310
And this details we can verify in the database.

24
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.150
See these records got inserted into this Brundibar, OK, where it equal to for first name Peter Mark,

25
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.580
Peter, D.M. dot com.

26
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.730
OK, this is the Post API.

27
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.750
Obviously, we don't have a controller.

28
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.320
OK, now just compare with the manual one, OK that we have done in one of the previous lectures.

29
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.230
This one, see, we have the controller mapping.

30
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.960
We are calling the zero matter.

31
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.210
But here we don't need to do anything.

32
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.570
And that's the beauty of spring data.

33
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.140
Rest.

34
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.450
So enjoy this and I will see you in the next lecture.

35
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.710
Thank you very much.
