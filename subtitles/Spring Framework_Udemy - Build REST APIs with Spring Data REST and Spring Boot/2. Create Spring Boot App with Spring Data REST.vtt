00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.440
Let's get started by creating the springboard application of it, spring there to rest.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.630
So in those days, click on the file new spring starter project say the project name is spring guitarist.

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.180
This is the group and this is the artifact, and this is the package inside which we are going to have

4
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.290
the main glass.

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.580
What our spring wood application.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.780
Click on the next.

7
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.000
When I'm recording this lecture, the latest version of the Spring Wood is 2.6 Daughtry, and this is

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.750
what we will use.

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.300
OK, now let's say a couple of dependencies.

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.820
So the very first is spring data, Depew.

11
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.520
Now we are using the physical database, so the musical driver.

12
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.610
Now, search for spring data, rest and select this one.

13
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.170
It is repositories.

14
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.530
So as of now, three dependencies are required to spring that ADP spring guitarist and equal driver.

15
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.600
See, once we learn spring guitarist with Spring that Adebiyi, then you can use it with any other database,

16
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.860
OK?

17
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.370
Say, for example, you have MongoDB database, so that will be spring data, MongoDB.

18
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.730
So that also you can use the spring data rest here.

19
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.290
In this course, we are going with the spring data, with the spring data rest.

20
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.900
So click on the next and finish.

21
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.610
Wait for the project to get built.

22
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.030
Here is our Springwood obligation.

23
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.620
Open the pond and examine.

24
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.330
See the opening date AGP Spring guitarist and musical driver, this is the test dependency, but look

25
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.990
at over here.

26
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.080
We don't have a spring wood starter vibe dependency.

27
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.720
And the reason is very simple we are not going to hold the controller in our Springwood application

28
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.720
when we are using the spring day to rest, OK?

29
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.900
And that's why we don't have a spring Woodstock vibe dependency.

30
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.320
What here?

31
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.510
Because we are using this spring guitarist.

32
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.680
So this is our point, good example.

33
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.930
Let's close it now.

34
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.420
You know what, my second database, we have this table, so we need a glass and repository.

35
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.000
Also, we need to have the Conexant put them over Springwood application to Michael database and that

36
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.210
we have already done OK in this application.

37
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.150
So to save the time, copy the entity and repository.

38
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.820
From here.

39
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.180
Based inside this one.

40
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.200
And application plot properties copy this, what the database.

41
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.070
This is our spring guitarist obligation put over here.

42
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.600
In spring, the tourist obligation, we don't need controller and service lawyer.

43
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.880
We just need A. Douglas, OK.

44
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.140
And repository.

45
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.820
And one thing we need to change, right?

46
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.410
We're here for the component skin, not the component skin, but the it can in enable JP repository

47
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.060
this one, OK.

48
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.840
This is required for the main class for our spring data rest application.

49
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.380
That's it.

50
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.200
We don't need controller layer and we don't need service layer for our spring guitarist application.

51
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.990
So we are all set with our spring guitarist obligation, and we'll test it out in the next lecture.

52
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.370
Thank you very much.
