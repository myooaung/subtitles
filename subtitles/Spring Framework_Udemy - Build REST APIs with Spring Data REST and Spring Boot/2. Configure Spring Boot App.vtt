1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.450
Now we have three tables inside university schema.

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:10.170
So we need three entity glasses and three repositories in our Springwood application, just like we

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.590
have entity class and Depository for Rentable.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.640
We need entity, class and repository for department and subjects learning to operate.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.990
So let's go for it.

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.450
This is our Springwood application, and we have a separate package for entity classes, right?

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.230
So here create the Entity Class Sport Department Table.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.610
So, for example, class name is Department Dot Gela.

9
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.670
The very first thing is, we need to mark this with Andy.

10
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.500
And the table name we need to provide using a table, in addition.

11
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.430
This is department.

12
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.360
Now inside the department table, how many columns we have to read it in department.

13
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.830
So let's go to Phil's.

14
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.230
Heidi?

15
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.670
And this is Department NI.

16
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.980
Let's map them, look at it.

17
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.220
In addition to this unique identifier for this table, and this is generated value.

18
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.450
Or let's copy from here, OK?

19
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.930
From just went Entity Glass.

20
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.200
Yes.

21
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.160
And.

22
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.230
This one, right, we need to have that column, in addition.

23
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.090
The column name is department and has good name, and we need to get us in status.

24
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.620
Select all generate controls set up to permit.

25
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.440
So this is our entity, Glass Department or Darla.

26
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.540
And it is representing Department Security Bill that we have in our Mitsuko database, OK?

27
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.430
Now, in the same way, let's do another entity class.

28
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.120
That is.

29
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.620
Subjects learning.

30
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.930
OK, let me copy this one to save the time.

31
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.140
On top of this one, the table name.

32
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.840
Copy from here.

33
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.580
They read long I.D.

34
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.110
Subject name and what are we have Max opt in in Serenity, right?

35
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.360
So let's map these columns.

36
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.780
Integer marks of 10.

37
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.740
What are there to be help student I.D. contemplate?

38
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.740
So this is basically the foreign guy, and we need to define our relationship using spending data so

39
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.420
that we will do in the next lecture.

40
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.770
See here.

41
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.880
Also, we have relationship right department data that we haven't met yet.

42
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.790
See, because this be newly added right department.

43
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.390
And this is also foreign key so that we need to define the relationship using splinted ADP, how to

44
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.250
do it, that we will see in the next lecture.

45
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.490
OK?

46
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.750
So leave this relationship for now splendored in this department.

47
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.440
So this we have in subjects learning its subject name and Mark's opting.

48
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.600
Okay, so.

49
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.450
Well, the top copy this one.

50
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.170
For this.

51
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.150
Here, Margaret, a column in addition.

52
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.010
This is subject name column.

53
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.230
The next is opt in boat.

54
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.020
So let's copy this one.

55
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.540
Marks obtained.

56
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.070
Have the getters and setters.

57
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.780
Select all standard format and save it.

58
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.260
So this is our entity, Glass, and it is representing subjects landing table that we have in our Mitsuko

59
00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.740
database.

60
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.790
OK, so now we need repository has a right each repository for this particular entity glasses.

61
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.820
OK, just like we have this one repository.

62
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.310
So first, let's say a repository for department entity Glass.

63
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.140
OK, so inside this package, create a new interface department repository.

64
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.010
Marked this with add repository, in addition.

65
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.130
And we need to extend.

66
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.340
GPA repository.

67
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.090
Right?

68
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.320
The first one is over entity class that is department or.

69
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.670
And the data that I put out a unique identifier, okay, go to department or $0 and this one.

70
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.120
OK.

71
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.130
Long data they provided.

72
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.090
And so it.

73
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.260
Now, let's say another repository, okay, for subjects learning.

74
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.430
For this one, let me copy create a new interface.

75
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.800
Repository.

76
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.640
Mark, this with a repository.

77
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.520
The same thing extends a repository.

78
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.620
OK.

79
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.200
Subjects learning every day, class and data type long.

80
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.050
Embodied, and so it.

81
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.570
So for department people, we have department or entity, glass and department repository in the same

82
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.100
way for subjects landing table.

83
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.420
We have subjects learning their doorway into the glass and its repository.

84
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.730
OK, so three tables, we have a three entity, classes and three repositories.

85
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.150
So what we are left is to define this relationship.

86
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.660
OK?

87
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.220
Many to one from subject was done.

88
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.230
It is many to one.

89
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.380
And also from department, it is many to one.

90
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.530
So how to define the relationship by working with splendid ADP that we will see in the next lecture?

91
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.540
So that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

92
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.920
Thank you very much.
