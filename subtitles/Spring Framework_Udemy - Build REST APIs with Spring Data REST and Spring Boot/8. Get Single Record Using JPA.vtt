00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.800
In the previous lecture, we have seen how to get all the records from the sequel table using Jibia.

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.760
Now in this lecture, we will see how to get single record from the sequel table using DP.

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.770
So here we use roundtable.

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.300
For example, we want to get strong details about it equal to one.

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.430
So what sequel we write?

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.990
Select Star from Sprint that is equal to say, for example one.

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.410
OK, execute this query and we got the result.

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.680
OK?

9
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.250
So this is one particular record where it equal to one.

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.170
So this is and that is equal.

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.180
But in between, all right, we are not going to write any native sequel query.

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.960
OK, so let's see how creative this kind of sequel we're using.

13
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.070
And for that, we will develop the guidebook.

14
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.360
So let's go to one controller.

15
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.900
And here we will add another JTB.

16
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.150
At Get Mapping.

17
00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.060
OK, public, see, now we are getting only one particular rule.

18
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.120
OK, one record and we know, right, one record means one object.

19
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.980
What entity?

20
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.340
Glass.

21
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.160
So here return date will be student.

22
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.610
So, for example, method name is get by ID.

23
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.930
OK, let's do the mapping for our GDP, so let's get my I.D. and I.D. value, we will possess part variable,

24
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:29.150
OK, and we know right how to get the part variable value using that part variable, in addition long

25
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.420
ID.

26
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630
Now from here, we will call the service.

27
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.380
So let's jump to service here.

28
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.330
Let me copy this, OK?

29
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.350
And here at.

30
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.860
Student, get by.

31
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.150
Now using this repository, OK, all the metal find.

32
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.900
This one fine by 80.

33
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.460
OK.

34
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.790
And here we will get it, will you?

35
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.880
And the same, we will pass using the repository and this will OK, this will be done optional or what

36
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.240
entity?

37
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.560
Glass.

38
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.770
So here we will get as optional analog.

39
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.040
OK, so we need to call the metal get.

40
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.550
OK, so this will give us object top and glass that it ruined our Java.

41
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.580
So this method we will call from our controller.

42
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.120
Student surveys.

43
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.050
All the metal bars I'd devalue, that's it and redone it.

44
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.580
So now we're all good with this debate, so let's test it out.

45
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.520
I don't know what spring would application till then.

46
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.520
Let some two horsemen let me copy this.

47
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.200
You are OK for our GDP.

48
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.210
And here.

49
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.400
Get my I.D. OK?

50
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.520
Part variable, for example, ID equal to one called API.

51
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.820
And we got the response.

52
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.080
Pass, though, ID equal to to see on the record that we have in a West roundtable.

53
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.410
OK, so here we haven't brought any negatives equal.

54
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.320
We just call this metallic provided by a fine body.

55
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.620
And we got the object double what entity?

56
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.950
Glass.

57
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.100
That is nothing but one particular rule in August one.

58
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.250
OK, now you may be thinking, OK, that what it does in the background, what what's equal credit is

59
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.760
generating?

60
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.120
If we want to see it again, then that also you can do it OK?

61
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.720
You just need to have the one property to have the securities donated by GPA in your logs, OK?

62
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.530
And that property you need to set in your application what properties and that is springboard GPA,

63
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.130
not source equal equal to true.

64
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.910
OK.

65
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.710
This property you need to set.

66
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.620
Now let's add another Springwood application again.

67
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.210
Clear the logs and all our AP from postmen because the success response.

68
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.800
See, this is the sequel query led me to maximize civic I.D..

69
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.470
OK.

70
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.070
Email.

71
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.700
This is the column name, OK, first name, last name, these are the column names indisputable as last

72
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.530
name from student and then.

73
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.670
Rent is equal to whatever we provided, OK, so this is the net is equal to originated by Jibia.

74
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.450
OK.

75
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.560
When it is done reading when we are calling this method, OK, fine by.

76
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.160
You can call this eBay.

77
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.590
OK, get Alston's, and that also you can verify in the console that what natives are called very being

78
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.400
donated by.

79
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.960
Obviously, for this one, it will be select from student book.

80
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.300
And here we select staff from Student Vet ID equal to this value, whatever we are providing.

81
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.890
So this is the property you need to set in the application or properties.

82
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.220
If you want to see the sequel, which is being donated by GP for your reference only.

83
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.450
I read it OK, but let me comment it out.

84
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.450
If you want, you can have this property get uncommitted.

85
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.270
So this is how you can get single record using Depew.

86
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.500
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

87
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.910
Thank you very much.
