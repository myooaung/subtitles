00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.890
Spring guitarist is using this entity, Glass, to provide the decent response.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.260
Look at this, Justin responds, OK.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.380
These are the Jeison attributes.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.340
Or you can say key first name.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.000
Last name, OK.

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.360
So from where it is coming from, this feels OK.

7
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.960
Whatever we have inside this entity, class student, whatever.

8
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.940
Now here we are following camel case, obviously, because we are working with our right.

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.160
So this is how we provide variable name or filename, right in camel case first name.

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.500
So sometimes what happens?

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.140
OK, in the design response, we want to have a decent guy like, for example, first under scrutiny

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.190
or any other.

13
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.070
Basically, we want to customize this particular Jason.

14
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.620
OK, so let's see how to do this.

15
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.410
So this we can achieve using the Dickson Library.

16
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.300
It may be possible that you are already aware of this, OK, but still I will explain for those who

17
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.760
are not aware of it and to use this library, we don't need to add any dependency in our PubMed or text

18
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.010
email.

19
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.420
OK.

20
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.500
This is already coming with Springwood and spring guitarist dependencies.

21
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.520
So for this say, for example, we want to change Jason.

22
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:15.010
OK, so on top of this field, use the notation Jason property OK and provide your keys, for example.

23
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.540
First under scrutiny.

24
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.770
That's it.

25
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.080
I don't know what's happening, what obligation.

26
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.970
Now, jump to sportsmen and call this EPA.

27
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.590
See, doesn't get changed, OK?

28
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.970
Antelope Camel case.

29
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.660
Now we're first under scrutiny for all the students, OK, and this will be applicable for all the apes.

30
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.600
Let's get this done by I.D..

31
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.260
Okay.

32
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.080
ID equal to one.

33
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.710
See.

34
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.720
So this is not only applicable to your Jason response, OK?

35
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.640
It is applicable for your request below as well for your right to board paused and Petitpas.

36
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.910
OK, so you need to keep this in mind.

37
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.190
So this is how you can change the Jason Guy while working with spring guitarist.

38
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.690
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

39
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.250
Thank you very much.
