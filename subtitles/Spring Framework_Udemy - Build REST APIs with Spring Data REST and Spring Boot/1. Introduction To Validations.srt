Bill, now we have seen recipes using spring guitarist, but here we don't have any validation in place.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,780
So for example, this first name column in this table is having not null consent.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, let's say consumer is buzzing null value for this bill, OK, in the Jason Pot, the first name,

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,250
which is our basically the crispy lord.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,110
So in that case, what will happen?

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,410
Obviously, the record will not get inserted into the table, so consumers will get some Sekula-Gibbs

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,200
on something like consent violated, right?

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,810
But that is not the proper way to handle it.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,990
We should have proper validation and we should be returning proper error message to alert consumers

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,300
that, Hey, you are doing this thing wrong, you need to pass the value for a first name or whatever

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,800
other validations you want to put.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,310
So this is what we are going to do in the upcoming lectures that how to how the validations while working

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,720
with spending data arrest.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,310
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,720
Thank you very much.
