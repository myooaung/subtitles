Hello and welcome back to hit the recipe as we need a rest land right in this cause.

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.220
We are going to use force man to hit the wrist EPAs.

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.580
If you are familiar with any other Eastland like Erdogan's or Eastland or any other tool, you can go

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.940
for it.

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.190
But in this cause, we are going with postmen to hajduk wristbands.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.260
So this is the official website of Postman.

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.210
Download the postman according to your operating system and install in your local machine.

8
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.990
After installing policemen, open it and you will see the screen like this.

9
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.190
So here we can fire recipes that different delivery methods provided or here geared toward paused and

10
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.490
delayed.

11
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.950
And here we can provide the oral query params and also we can provide the body as well.

12
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.040
That is basically what payload in the apartment of Jason.

13
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.800
So download and install the postman will proceed further in the next lecture.

14
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.150
Thank you very much.
