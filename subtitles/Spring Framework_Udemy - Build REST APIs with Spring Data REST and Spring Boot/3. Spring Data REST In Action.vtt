00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.040
Let's run our Springwood application.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.720
So this will get started on board ADHD delay then led some to browser, and there you are, a localized

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.500
ADHD.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.530
Let me do maximize.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.450
See, this is the response being provided by spring guitarist, OK?

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.520
And you see a couple of links were here.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.850
The very first is this one slams students.

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.150
So, you know what's happening, application, we have NTD class, right, student Dot Java.

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.730
So what spring guitarist arrest is doing, OK?

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.240
It is using this entity class and it is exposing you.

11
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.290
Does raise is typifies how using this and did it last name?

12
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.550
So what it is doing slash students or here you see, say, for example, you have another entity, Class

13
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.370
four Department Department or Java, then spring guitarist will expose it has less departments.

14
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.940
OK.

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.950
Same for another entity class.

16
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.970
But here we just have one entity class student dot dalla.

17
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.360
So using this API, we can perform the ground operations over the student table that we have in our

18
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.360
bicycle database.

19
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.940
See, you know what, Springwood application, we don't have any degrees mapping for students.

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.860
Even we don't know this controller, right?

21
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.990
But still, we can see this API.

22
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.620
Why?

23
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.170
Because putting that arrest is providing it OK.

24
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.000
It generates it automatically.

25
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.650
So let's copy this one, OK and go to postmen.

26
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.500
It did Typekit, OK.

27
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.510
This one less students.

28
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.940
Call it.

29
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.070
Check the response.

30
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.660
This is the colleagues and students.

31
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.330
This is for a student.

32
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.480
This is second one.

33
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.910
So basically, it is returning all the students that we have in the student table.

34
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.720
OK.

35
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.200
So this is you can compare it, whatever we created manually.

36
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.230
OK, let me go to here this one.

37
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.380
Get all students and we are calling them.

38
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.980
Find all.

39
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.220
OK, so spring that addressed internally uses this OK, and it is exposing automatically this goodbye

40
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.020
to get all the records for the particular table here.

41
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.890
In our example, it is student, but OK, using the slang students.

42
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.720
And look, this one.

43
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.740
You know what?

44
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.950
Decent response it is providing hyper media links.

45
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.420
That means our recipes are supporting had you as principal.

46
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.280
OK, who is doing it for us?

47
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.520
Spring guitarist is doing OK, so now we can say I did.

48
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.600
Our recipes are following hideous principles because it is providing this hyper media links.

49
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.640
See, this is the first student verified equal to one come down illegal equal to do so in the decent

50
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.560
response itself.

51
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.870
OK?

52
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.060
Your consumer can navigate to this one.

53
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.090
So, for example, let me copy this one, OK?

54
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.310
And put out here, call it, so now we are getting the particulars to it is OK that it's equal to one.

55
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.850
So here we are parsing the ideas, but variable.

56
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.940
Now you can compare this one.

57
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.950
What we did manually, OK, this one, get by it.

58
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.380
And we were passing the I.D. value as part variable and we were using the Find My ID.

59
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.880
OK, so now spring, the OK is using this matter and exposing this GDP.

60
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.450
This one getting the record by I.D..

61
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.400
On top of it, we have support of headwaiter as well, OK, we don't need to do anything for that.

62
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.670
Spinning guitarist will handle it now.

63
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.080
See this one.

64
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.370
It is providing support, opportunism and sorting has been paid.

65
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.990
No bid size and sorting.

66
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.540
But this we will cover in the upcoming lectures.

67
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.840
OK?

68
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.550
For now, what we will do is in the upcoming lectures, we will perform the current operations over

69
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.000
the student table using this IPAs as students.

70
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.650
OK?

71
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.810
These apps are being provided by spring guitarist.

72
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.530
OK, let me copy this one, so I close it.

73
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.820
Not the copy.

74
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.090
OK, so here we don't have a controller at all.

75
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.450
OK, so this application, we just know for reference to compare, because here we are doing all things

76
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.050
manually.

77
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.230
You get controller calling defined by ID and find all your spending guitarist is doing this, OK?

78
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.030
We don't need to worry about it.

79
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.430
Let's go to browser and this one profile one, so this one is containing the metadata information regarding

80
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.920
overspeeding, data re-establishes and whatever is the opposite of being exposed to by spinning guitarist

81
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.440
what our application does now.

82
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.110
You know, we have these students OK, if you have any other entity class that also metadata information,

83
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.190
you can take with this one.

84
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.560
So this is the advantage of using spring guitarist and will proceed further and the next lecture.

85
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.000
Thank you very much.
