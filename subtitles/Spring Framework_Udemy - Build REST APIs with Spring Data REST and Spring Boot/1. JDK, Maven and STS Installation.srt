00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello and welcome back in this lecture, you will download and set up, dedicate a page, Marian and

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,950
Spring to suit in our local muslin.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,940
So first, let's go with Gideon.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,920
That is our development kit, and this is the official website of Warrigal.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,650
And from here, you can download Adjudicate.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,880
In this course I'm going to use Dedicated, which is coming at free cost by Oracle because this is our

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,360
personal and development use.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,210
All you can say educational use.

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,870
If you want to use her words and then dedicated, you can go with open JDK that is coming under the

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,980
open source license.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:45,310
So it's up to you in this course, I'm going to use dedicate so download to dedicate according to your

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,220
operating system, Linux, Windows or Mac.

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,730
It's up to you, so download and install in your local machine.

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,060
Now the next thing is buildable.

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,580
So in this course, we are going to use the Apache Marvin.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,120
If you are familiar with Gradle, you can go for it as well.

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,000
So this is the official website of the bottom of it.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,520
And from here, you can download Apache Marvin, whatever latest was and you can see you can go for

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:09,670
it.

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,050
So download according to your operating system and install in your local machine.

21
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,200
The next thing is it.

22
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,230
You can go with eclipse in Delhi, the idea, NetBeans, whatever you prefer.

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,160
It's up to you.

24
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,420
In this course, I'm going to use a stylus that is spring --.

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,300
So this is the official website of ideas.

26
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,760
And here you can download ideas according to your operating system, Linux, Mac or Windows.

27
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,600
It's up to you.

28
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,970
If you are familiar with the intelligencia and you want to go for it, it's up to you in this course,

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,920
I am going to use the stairs, so I would recommend download and install ideas in your local machine

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,350
from the official website of Sidious.

31
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,860
So download and install these three softwares in your local machine, according to your operating system,

32
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,320
after downloading and installing.

33
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,890
If you are a Windows user, then search for the environment variables and here you see a system environment

34
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,490
variables.

35
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,910
In the advanced tab, you will see environment variables.

36
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,660
So here we need to create two new environment variables.

37
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,350
The first is yellow home, which is basically part two over JDK, and the name is double.

38
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:24,570
And this is the part to JDK, whatever it is in your local machine, at what location it is being installed

39
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,490
and make sure you are not giving the bin directly in this port deal.

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,850
JDK only you need to give.

41
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:38,610
The second is and to whom the name is M2M, and this is where your apartment is installed and make sure

42
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,680
you are not giving the bin directly in the part.

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,470
So after creating this tool, new environment variables, the next thing is we need to set in the existing

44
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,970
part, an environment variable.

45
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,760
So this will be already exist in your machine.

46
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,850
So just edit it and put your two environment variables like this person.

47
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,090
They dollar home percentage lesbian and same for your mom and pop them two homes lesbian.

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,780
So this is all you need to do.

49
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:13,320
Download, dedicate a page, Marvin and stills and install them after that, create the two environment

50
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,340
variables and set those in your path environment variable like this.

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,940
So make sure you are doing this before we start the next lecture.

52
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,920
So that's all for now.

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,620
We'll proceed further in the next lecture.

54
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,180
Thank you very much.
