00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.670
Let's get started with the projection.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.460
So for that, we need to have an interface.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.590
So let's created where inside the same package that we have over ended glasses audit some package.

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.190
So this is the thing, okay?

5
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.160
You need to keep in mind when you are working with projects that you need to create the projections

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.190
inside the same package that you have your entity.

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.520
Glasses audit some packages that only it will work.

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.140
Otherwise, it will not work.

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.680
Springwood will scan your entity glass package and its sub packages for the projection.

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.050
OK.

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.140
So to save the time, I'm not creating another package.

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.910
So I'm creating what here, OK?

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.930
The same package is over and he declares, Let's clear the interface.

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.810
Give it name is first projection.

15
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.840
The first thing is we need to mark this as a projection.

16
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.900
This is from the spring guitarist in the narration.

17
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.850
See now let's say this project Sonny's bought our student AIBA's, OK, so that we need to provide using

18
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.990
that type attribute.

19
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.840
So for a student which is of an entity, class student or class, right, so that we need to provide

20
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.100
like this inside the tapes, let's give a name to this projection using the name attribute name equal

21
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.280
to say, for example, first projects and.

22
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.780
Now, let's see under these projects, and we want to expose only to films Edy animal idea of this.

23
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.410
OK, so this is of an entity class.

24
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.720
This is the get method right for the ideal.

25
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.530
So copy methods signature and provide like this.

26
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.560
You can type manually as well, OK for melody.

27
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.630
Sting, get e-mail my bed.

28
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.950
Good email.

29
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.420
We just need to provide the method signature, OK, not the body.

30
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.380
That's it.

31
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.250
This is our first projects and let's help another projects and OK.

32
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.950
And in that we will expose to Phil's I.D. and first name of the student.

33
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.230
OK?

34
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.300
So let me copy this and give it name is second projection.

35
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.970
So this is second projection.

36
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.290
Open it.

37
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.530
In the name or here, second prediction, I'd in first name.

38
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.160
OK.

39
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.800
First thing.

40
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.550
That's it.

41
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.830
So in the first projects in which two build, we are exposing and immolating of this.

42
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.730
And in the second projection, IDI and firstname of this region.

43
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.920
So now we have to project sons.

44
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.230
So in the next victim will test it out.

45
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.580
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

46
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.900
Thank you very much.
