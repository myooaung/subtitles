1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.470
Let's define secure relationship using Jibia.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.450
So he had investment table, we have column department 80 and this is basically the foreign key and

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.790
that is primary your department table.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.460
So let's define this relationship using.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.790
So go to student Adalah.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.020
This is our identity class, right?

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.330
Come down and here now if you look at this table, OK, this is basically the column, OK?

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.990
Basically the primary key of our parent table, which is department table.

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.290
And what is the entity class we have department or tolerate?

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.850
So let's define field or type department.

11
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.760
OK.

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.950
Department like this one, and we need to map it column.

13
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.370
Join Parliamentary in, OK?

14
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.870
And the column name is department and has got it.

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.420
Now, what is the relationship from student to department, it is many to one, right, so that we need

16
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.410
to define using.

17
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.050
Many to one, in addition, this one.

18
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.000
Let's get us into this.

19
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.450
Don't forget this one, OK?

20
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.400
Standard getters and setters for this period.

21
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.410
Format and Soviet it well on the top.

22
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.550
So this is the relationship that we have defined, see here this department, it is not the normal column.

23
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.220
Okay, so don't use the ED column in recent years.

24
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.930
We need to use that Ad Jane column introduction and don't provide any data type like, you know, long

25
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.380
or integer for this column.

26
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.780
No, this particular column is the not normal one.

27
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.010
OK, like this one?

28
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.720
This is basically the foreign key.

29
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.130
So you need to use the entity glass of your parent.

30
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.220
You what example?

31
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.160
Which is the parent printable department table, right?

32
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.010
And what is the entity Glasby Health Department or Java?

33
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.790
So that we have used it already and relationship OK from student to department, it is many to one so

34
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.440
that we have defined using this entity.

35
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.470
So now let's go to subject table.

36
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.350
So here also, we held many to one relationship from subject to student.

37
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.040
But here, which is our parent table student table.

38
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.580
Right?

39
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.030
So let's go to over and did the class one subject landing.

40
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.520
And here we need to define one field type of our parent table.

41
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.890
So we need to use the appropriate entity class that is student, right?

42
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.170
So this is what we need to define in the same way.

43
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.670
Join Column.

44
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.560
What is the name?

45
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.190
This one right student underscored I.D..

46
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.350
Student and escort I.D. And this is also many to one relationship, right?

47
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.710
So defined like this, how getters and setters.

48
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.700
Select all standard format and serve it.

49
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.460
So this is the relationship from subject to student table, and that is many to one.

50
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.810
So this is how you can define the secure relationships while working with GP, use the Join column.

51
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.970
In addition, provide the column name, use the appropriate entity class and define the relationship.

52
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.580
Many do one one too many, many too many, whatever you have.

53
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.520
OK, so here we are done in the student and class and subject one.

54
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.960
Now let's run our spring wood application to verify that everything is good, OK?

55
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.360
Yes, I was putting what application got started on Port Adelaide, so we are good with this three entity

56
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.680
glasses and three repositories now in the next lecture.

57
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.860
We will see how to play around this recipe as, OK, whatever is being automatically provided for these

58
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.130
three tables using these three repositories and how to handle these relationships while we want to create

59
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.540
or delete the record.

60
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.690
So all the things we see in the upcoming lectures.

61
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.640
So that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

62
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.110
Thank you very much.
