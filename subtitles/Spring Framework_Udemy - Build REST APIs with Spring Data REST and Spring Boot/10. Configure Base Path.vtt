00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.040
While working with spring guitarist by default, there is no bass, but whatever it is.

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.570
Look at this, you are looking up there, look almost ADHD directly.

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.670
We are using our IPAs, les SDD or les students, whatever we can figure out.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.030
But now let's say, if we want to have some bass part.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.100
OK, so for example, up to localist ADHD, we want to help his buddies less EPA So let's see how to

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.520
do this.

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.990
Jump to his ideas.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.780
Now, to set the best path for our spring guitarist says we need to set one property in our application,

9
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.840
what properties by look?

10
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.820
So here at the property is spring day to rest.

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.630
Not.

12
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.730
Biz, high hyphen, but equal to say, for example, slash API.

13
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.930
OK, this is the property we need to set.

14
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.240
For some reason, it is giving some error.

15
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.020
OK, let me rephrase.

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.980
Or close it and open again.

17
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.680
Yes, now we are good, OK, go to this property.

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.900
This is the best part and read this comment.

19
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.050
Miss Part two, we use it to by spring guitarist to expose repository resources.

20
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.970
OK, so it is using this best part while exposing the recipes.

21
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.080
Which one?

22
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.790
Using our repository in A.D. Glass, we are using that spring guitarist.

23
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.210
OK, let's close this one and I don't know what spring would application, so this will get started

24
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.600
on board.

25
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.230
880.

26
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.410
Dylan, that's some two browser now.

27
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.800
Hit this.

28
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.990
You are looking for what our application look almost ADHD in one of the previous lectures.

29
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.890
We have seen this right?

30
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.280
You did.

31
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.610
See, now we are getting four of why?

32
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.740
Because we have a change it up bass part.

33
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.680
OK, so that we need to add less IPA.

34
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.810
See, we got a response.

35
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.530
Let me zoom in.

36
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.320
OK, now this is our API is less API, less steady or less run.

37
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.550
So get whatever you configured.

38
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.860
Jump to Bossman now.

39
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.210
Try to hit this gear debut.

40
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.690
We should get port for sea.

41
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.940
We need to add Dobbies ports less API that we have configured.

42
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.660
OK, now we got proper response, OK?

43
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.740
All the rooms and this will be applicable for all the APIs, OK?

44
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.090
And so, for example, you have another security department.

45
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.460
There will be another entity, Glass Department or Java.

46
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.020
So you will be having IPRs likes less departments.

47
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.720
OK, so there also this will be applicable basically whatever it is, dpa is are being exposed to by

48
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.100
spring.

49
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.090
The Tories took a look at this comment.

50
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.020
You can read it again.

51
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.390
Spring guitarist is using this bass, but for all the apples it is exposing using all the entity, classes

52
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.890
and all the repositories.

53
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.080
OK, here just now we have one entity class student or Java, and that was ignored here.

54
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.240
So this is how you can configure a base pod while working with spinning that arrest.

55
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.100
That's all for now.

56
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.920
And we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

57
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.420
Thank you very much.
