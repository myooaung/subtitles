1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.390
Now we have three sequel tables in the musical database.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.960
We have three entity classes and three repositories.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.320
So now we are all good with our spring wood application.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.150
But before we run it, let's comment.

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.920
This annotations OK, decent property in JSON ignored.

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.700
These annotations no more required, I'm just commenting for your reference.

7
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.390
And we have already seen in the previous lectures right now.

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.720
Let's read our spring wood application and jump to browser.

9
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.800
This is the usual for replication sleazy MBAs over this part, right?

10
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.700
He did.

11
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.970
Let me zoom in.

12
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.590
OK, so that you can have a better idea, see, now we have three resources.

13
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.100
OK.

14
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.850
Why?

15
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.700
Because we have three tables in the musical database.

16
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.180
We have three and diddy glasses and three repositories.

17
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.990
OK, so Spring Guitarist is using these three A.D glasses and the repositories and using that it is

18
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.120
exposing them as wristbands.

19
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.630
OK, see, this is our base, but OK, but look at this one less departments, less subject lending

20
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.090
and less study.

21
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.930
This is via wallet is indicted for this.

22
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.300
These two knew it was now.

23
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.520
Yeah.

24
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.350
And for those, we have ended the classes and repositories as well.

25
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.780
Now we know right for our student table, the parent, the police department one.

26
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.430
So as of now, our all three tables are completely empty in the database.

27
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.820
So let's start by creating that, according to the department.

28
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.920
But then only we can create this one.

29
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.460
And then after we can create the records and do the subject above, right?

30
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.560
So let's copy this.

31
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.840
You are all for our department apps.

32
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.430
Go to postmen.

33
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.570
Jane, this to add to the proposed body rule, we know, right, Jason.

34
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.210
And we just need to provide the department.

35
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.660
This is identity glass.

36
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.490
This is all we need to pass.

37
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.840
The department name is.

38
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.880
Computer science.

39
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.930
Call this eBay.

40
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.970
He got the successful response.

41
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.250
OK, let's verify in the database.

42
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.510
Yes.

43
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.630
Now we have one record into the department.

44
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.420
Now let's zoom to restaurant table, OK?

45
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.770
This is also empty as of now.

46
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.310
So in one of the previous lectures we have already created does and right with this details first name,

47
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.040
last name and image.

48
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.510
But now we have one more column right in this table.

49
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.580
And that is Department I.D. OK.

50
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.410
So this is the foreign key and basically primary job department label.

51
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.740
So for that, what we have in our identity class, $200, this will right type department and ridiculous,

52
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.010
right?

53
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.000
So this we need to pass as rigorous payload, but not as JSON object, OK?

54
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.600
We don't need to do like this one.

55
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.840
No, we need to pass the reference.

56
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.980
OK.

57
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.420
Interesting format.

58
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.850
So this is our department's IPA.

59
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.380
We created this department, right?

60
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.240
Let's get department by ID.

61
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.190
OK.

62
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.300
Last one.

63
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.310
So this is our department under this department, we want to create one student, right, so copy this,

64
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.350
but this one, OK, including the idea has been don't include the bass part.

65
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.950
OK.

66
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.360
And these we need to possess string inside this distant object.

67
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.910
OK, whatever you have with your annotation, whatever relationship or joint column, you know what

68
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.720
example we have with this one department, OK?

69
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.570
So it's less departments.

70
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.830
This is EPA, and this is one particular department where it's equal to one.

71
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.850
And under this department, we want to create one student.

72
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.180
Right?

73
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.590
All these EPA.

74
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.120
See, we got success response point.

75
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.680
OK, let's verify in the database.

76
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.350
See, now we have one record inside the roundtable, but look at this one department IDs equal to one.

77
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.970
So this is basically pointing to this particular record using the concept of foreign key.

78
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.700
OK, now in the same way, we can have records inside Objective Lisbon.

79
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.170
So let's do it.

80
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.590
So first, this is the EPA.

81
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.760
You?

82
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.670
OK?

83
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.560
This one, my bed subjects learning.

84
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.450
New.

85
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.880
Host body.

86
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.450
And JSON format.

87
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.320
OK, we need to pass the subject name.

88
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.020
Say, for example, Java.

89
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.640
Max Opt-In type of integer.

90
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.250
So, for example, 70.

91
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.410
Then student, right?

92
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.170
So this we need to provide the reference.

93
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.920
So here also, we need to provide the reference in the same manner.

94
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.220
OK.

95
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.150
Just like we did for department, right in the student creation.

96
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.690
So this is how we are getting one particular student right?

97
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.280
Goodbye.

98
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.240
Call this one.

99
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.800
So for this student, we want to help one subject learning entry.

100
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:10.930
OK, so copy this slurs, as did his last one and provide in the string permit like this one.

101
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.380
So for this student, we want to help this sub dignities, OK, inside of us subjects learning table.

102
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.000
Call this eBay.

103
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:27.030
Because the success response rate, let's verify see, now we have one record inside the subject's landing

104
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.330
table.

105
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.720
OK.

106
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.440
And this is the foreign guy is equal to one in the same way we can have another one.

107
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.340
Jane, this data.

108
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.530
So, for example, my sequel, this is 60 called Abia.

109
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.520
Now we have a second record as well, OK, for this particular student.

110
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.250
So when you have equal relationships using the foreign key and you are using this putting the arrest,

111
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.040
then you need to pass this kind of reference.

112
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.400
OK.

113
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.680
You don't need to provide all the things or you just if you just provide like this one, OK, ID equal

114
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.070
to one.

115
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.790
This will not what you need to provide the proper EPA.

116
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.020
And this is the best place.

117
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.310
OK.

118
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.890
You can look and don't include the best part when you are providing the reference while you are handling

119
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.970
the sequel relationships.

120
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:15.330
OK?

121
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.750
Using the spring guitarist, you just need to pass this kind of thing.

122
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.840
So les depts, les ideaof of the department department and whatever is your unique identifier?

123
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.750
Bassett Okay, same for this one, is it?

124
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.040
Look at this one.

125
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.110
So this is how you can handle sequel relationships while working with spinning guitarist.

126
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.880
That's all for now.

127
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.490
And we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

128
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.930
Thank you very much.
