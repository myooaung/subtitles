1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,510
In this lecture, we will go for business, and so using this API, we are getting the student information

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:06,750
right.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,660
And by default, our bid says, is trade.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,160
So we are getting that 20 day goals.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,200
So this is our page number one.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,900
Now look at this page information, OK?

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,030
The current bid number equal to zero.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,810
Why?

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,940
Because this is zero bidder index.

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,250
OK, so first bid means zero.

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,010
2ND Bid means one.

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,170
Likewise, OK, because it is zero business index.

13
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,020
Now let's get the second bids.

14
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,840
And on that page, we should get four records.

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:34,440
OK.

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,420
Because total, we have 24 records.

17
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,880
And on the first page, we got 20 records.

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,380
So let's see how to do it.

19
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,240
So we need to pass one query parameter bids equal to one.

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,050
OK.

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,550
This is zero based index, so we will get second page called IPA.

22
00:00:51,850 --> 00:01:01,820
So this is the first round, OK, second, third and fourth come down, see number equal to one.

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,780
So this is our second pitch, but it is zero based index.

24
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:13,330
So current bid number equal to one total elements, 24 total bids to and default bids is equal to 20.

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,550
Now, let's get the other page, OK?

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,040
So, for example, Tara Page, so page equal to two.

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,530
This is what we need to parse in the gritty parameter.

28
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,960
All they say see this area or collection or list, least whatever you say.

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,930
OK, this is completely empty and come down.

30
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,790
The information is seem OK.

31
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,650
The current page number equal to two.

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,540
That means equal to three.

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,190
It is zero business index.

34
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,520
So your consumer will get this all information OK?

35
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,190
And when he will get this empty, he will get the idea that on this page, there are no more records.

36
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,770
And this is applicable for all.

37
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,540
Get abs.

38
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,540
Let's do same with the subject API here.

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:55,920
OK.

40
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,600
Let's first call first page, okay.

41
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,060
That is no equal to zero.

42
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,950
See, we got 20 seconds.

43
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,790
OK, now on the second page, we should get eight records, right?

44
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,040
So page equal to one.

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,760
So here we are, eight subject details, OK?

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,150
Come down bid number equal to one that means to get zero misery index total wages, we have to.

47
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,220
Now let's get to the.

48
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,920
We should not get any record.

49
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,420
See, this is completely empty.

50
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,550
Come down current paid no.

51
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,600
Equal to three.

52
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,000
My bed.

53
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,120
I think we got affordable.

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,300
Bid.

55
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,600
OK?

56
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,740
Let's look toward here.

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,960
So this is our total bid, OK?

58
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,730
We don't have any record on the total pitch.

59
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,350
So obviously we will not get any on the fourth page or 20 bids, for example.

60
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,180
OK, let's call it see.

61
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,110
We will not get it, OK.

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,300
So this is our verbiage.

63
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,510
See the current bid number equal to two.

64
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,720
We don't have any records on this one, but yes, we do have one, does they can bid that is equal to

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,020
one?

66
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,980
But we are getting eight records on that number two.

67
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,570
So this is all you need to do it with you, the business, and while working with spring guitarist,

68
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,480
you just need to use this gritty parameter, Pejic world.

69
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,290
That's it.

70
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,310
And when you are calling this OK, remember that this is zero major index.

71
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,250
So if you want the very first page, the first 20 records, then you need to pass zero like this one.

72
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,140
By default, it is zero and you.

73
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,350
See, if you don't pass any value, then it will give you the first page.

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,310
That means first 20 records.

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,030
But then afterwards, if you want to sell, then you need to keep in mind that it is zero major index.

76
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,880
So this is second page, not the first one.

77
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,300
OK.

78
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,310
Another 20 records we are getting.

79
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,550
So using bids, gritty parameter, you can do the business, and while working with spinning, they're

80
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,530
dressed, that's all for now, and we'll proceed further and the next lecture.

81
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,030
Thank you very much.
