00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.860
In this lecture, we will see how to get all the records from the sequel table.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.780
So here we host one table.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.950
So that is basically writing the sequel query select start from student.

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.890
But remember one thing while working with spinning that ADP, we are not going to write any net new

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.580
sequel, really.

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.770
We will use this printed ADP and DPA will create a native sequel already for us.

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.980
So inside the table, we have two records.

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.740
OK, so this particular record, the first draw we will get as one object support entity glass.

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.170
OK, so here we have a table.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.540
So this will get us one object of $1.0.

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.720
This the will get as another object observer entity, glass that is rendered.

12
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.240
Likewise, what other records as well?

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.330
So how to get all the records from the particular cycle table that we will understand by creating the

14
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.960
recipe?

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.690
So let's jump to his ideas.

16
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.370
This is our spin controller.

17
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.020
Let's say one GDP.

18
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.340
Good mapping.

19
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.700
Public.

20
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.050
So now we are getting all the records right from the student table, and we know one role we will get

21
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.270
as one object what entity class, OK, so written by will be list top student.

22
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.340
Say, get all students, OK, this is our EPA.

23
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.780
Let's import the list, and this is our mapping.

24
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.290
OK, you ought to let us get all students.

25
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.120
Now from here, we will call our service layer that is still in service, so let's go to it, OK?

26
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.890
And here also we need to write one matter that will be done.

27
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.550
Lee's top student?

28
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.700
Get all students.

29
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.290
Imported, you did list.

30
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.860
Now we know, right, we have this student repository using which we can have the grotto presents over

31
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.080
the student table using this particular entity, glass that is rendered.

32
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.540
OK, so let's ultraviolet here.

33
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.130
Student repository like this.

34
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.530
And imported now using this repository.

35
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.030
OK.

36
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.490
We just need to call one matter that is find oil.

37
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.240
That's it.

38
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.250
OK, so this matter is provided by dpa and this will create the natives equality for us.

39
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.360
OK, so here our table is different.

40
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.450
We have entity classes $200.

41
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.560
So this will create OK.

42
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.700
Select Start from student whenever we will call this matter OK using this one repository.

43
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.170
Find all it will create done.

44
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.240
That is equal activity that is select start from student.

45
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.380
If you have another table, you are using another entity class.

46
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.750
You are having another repository for it, OK?

47
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.170
So for that, it will create select start from your table.

48
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.160
OK, so here we are not writing any natives equal query.

49
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.630
We are using spring data.

50
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.200
Let me close it and collapse.

51
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.960
So this method we will call from our controller.

52
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.640
OK, so let's auto wireless service in our controller.

53
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.490
Like this?

54
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.120
Let's say this as private and important now we just need to return whatever our student service is returning.

55
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.550
OK, so get all students.

56
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.330
That's it.

57
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.700
So we are all good with this debate.

58
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.110
So let's test it out.

59
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.510
So let's run over spending what obligation?

60
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.340
So this will get started on both ADHD, they'll then let some two policemen.

61
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.530
So forget the be or select the gate.

62
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.520
At DDP.

63
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.820
Local host.

64
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.750
ADHD slurs.

65
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.260
Student.

66
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.590
And then get all Syrians right.

67
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.140
Call this get.

68
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.290
We got the response right.

69
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.910
Let me do makes me my seat.

70
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.980
This is the first round, OK?

71
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.530
This is another sprint as of now.

72
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.970
We just outgrew records, OK?

73
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.220
That's why we are getting two records.

74
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.760
OK.

75
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.590
This is one is an object and this is another.

76
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.240
It is an object.

77
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.770
So basically, we are getting pushed rents details in the response in the former top.

78
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.040
Jason, if you are 10 records in just one table, you will get 10 students these days or here in the

79
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.940
form of decent.

80
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.100
But the main thing is, OK, let's go to over the service layer this part.

81
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.270
OK, see, we are not writing any ne'er do sequel creating.

82
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.100
OK.

83
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.370
We are using the GPA and Gibbs creating the sequel grade for us.

84
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.840
We don't need to worry about it.

85
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.110
OK?

86
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.210
That what GPA does in the background?

87
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.690
No.

88
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.470
Just use the GPA and forget the sequel part.

89
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.420
OK, GPA will handle it.

90
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.940
So this is how you can get all the records from the particular security table.

91
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.410
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

92
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:07.850
Thank you very much.
