00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.980
Using this API, we are getting story, and it is.

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.470
And here we are replaying projects and so to apply to projects and every time we need to use the gritty

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.570
barometer now, let's say we want to have default projects.

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.890
And for our EPA, which EPA, the EPA in which we are getting the collection of data collected on student

5
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.040
colleagues are not subject our colleagues in our department.

6
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.880
So we want to set default projects and for our EPA so that we can do using the exiled.

7
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.770
So let's see how to do this.

8
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.180
With ideas.

9
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.060
And here we have these projects and first projects.

10
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.440
And what which entity?

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.590
Class student?

12
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.340
And for this vio student repository, right?

13
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.920
So let's open the repository.

14
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.700
And here we have this annotation repository, this resource.

15
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.120
Now, in this annotation, we need to set one attribute.

16
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.540
OK.

17
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.620
So here.

18
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.720
Exert projection on this one, it goes to a projection that we want to set as default.

19
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.100
Let's go for it.

20
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.450
First, a projection.

21
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.930
There's one not glass.

22
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.310
That's it.

23
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.080
I don't know what Springwood application.

24
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.240
Until then, jump to Bozeman.

25
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.650
No, let's call this EPA, but without any query parameter.

26
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.510
OK, so called EPA.

27
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.500
We got a response.

28
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.500
Let's stick it out.

29
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.890
See, we are getting full name put on subjects, OK, for all these reasons.

30
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.750
So here first projects that is applied, how using that exalt.

31
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.260
OK.

32
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.280
So with this, we are seeing that our default projects on is this one?

33
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.720
See here.

34
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.790
While calling the API, we are not sending any query parameter OK like projects and equal to past projects.

35
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.240
And no.

36
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.360
Still, we are getting the response as but our first projects and how because we have this configuration

37
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.720
now, OK, so we can say that the port project then is now first production.

38
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.570
Now let's get the single student, OK, bye ID.

39
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.770
So for example to.

40
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.490
See, here we are getting normal response.

41
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.420
All the pills basically so exert is not applicable over here.

42
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.230
Why?

43
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.330
Because Exert is only applicable when your are is giving collection of data.

44
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.200
Right.

45
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.410
Here we are getting single record, so it is not applicable here.

46
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.970
Now let's go back.

47
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.200
Call the EPA and we are getting the proper response.

48
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.080
So our default projects on is for projects.

49
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.160
And OK, now we're calling the EPA OK, let's say it projects and equal to second projection.

50
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.500
OK, so the default projection is plus projection.

51
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.000
And while calling the EPA, we are setting with the query parameter second projection.

52
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.400
So let's see, we will take priority in this.

53
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.700
OK?

54
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.990
Call the EPA.

55
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.170
See, we are getting it in first name.

56
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.940
So this is as what second projects and OK, let's go to our second projection.

57
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.030
And here we are, populating only it in first name.

58
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.660
OK.

59
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.040
So this is what taking priority, whatever you are passing is very parameter.

60
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.520
If you have exerted and you're passing the gradi parameter projects, and then this will take the priority.

61
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.090
So using the example you can how different projects than for your EPA, that's all for now, and we'll

62
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.160
proceed further in the next lecture.

63
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.600
Thank you very much.
