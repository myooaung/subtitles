00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,450
While developing recipes, it's not always that we want to expose all the fields in the decent response.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,620
So for example, you are storing some sensitive information in the student table, for example, password

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,960
or maybe Secret Service in it answer.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,130
Now this values you don't want to expose in the JSON response.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,640
So let's see how to do this for this as well.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,070
We are going to use the Jackson Library, OK?

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,600
Now, say, for example, we don't want to expose students email address.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,330
OK, so on top of this, we'll use the in JSON ignore.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,150
This one.

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,410
That's it.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,090
I don't know what's between what obligation.

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,340
Dump the Bushmen.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,550
And call this API.

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,100
See, now we are not getting email attribute in the decent response, OK?

15
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,480
Get all the students.

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,450
See, this is the first.

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,320
We are not getting the email address for this one, and this has been.

18
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,680
So, in short, email filled is being ignored while giving that decent response.

19
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,120
And keep in mind, OK, this is not just applicable for your decent response.

20
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,040
This is applicable for your request payload as well.

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,470
OK.

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,370
So for your request, be alone and just a response email attribute is being ignored.

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,090
Why?

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,720
Because we have user read these entries and at just an ignored OK.

25
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:31,500
And this is also coming from the Jackson Library, just like we have seen Jason property in the previous

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:31,980
lecture.

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,720
So this is how you can ignore that just an attribute while working with spitting that arrest.

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,550
That's all for now.

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,160
And we'll proceed further the next lecture.

30
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,630
Thank you very much.
