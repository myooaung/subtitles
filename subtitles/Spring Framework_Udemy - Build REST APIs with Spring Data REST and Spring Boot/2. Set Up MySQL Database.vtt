Before we jump was being at ajp, legs was set up bicycle database in our local machine.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.570
So here what I've done is using the bicycle workbench, I have created one schema that is university

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.480
and inside that I have created one table that is table.

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.980
So this is very simple.

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.520
Table, OK?

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.140
Let me show you the structure of it.

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.510
So this wooden table has total four columns.

8
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.500
Its first name, last name, email, this idea column is having the database begin and other three columns

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.420
are having the data diapers worker.

10
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.410
Heidi Gholam is primarily of this table.

11
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.190
So obviously, it's not normal, and this is that does Auto-enrolment.

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.310
That means basically database will order implemented by one whenever we will insert a new record in

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.480
this particular table.

14
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.770
So this is very simple table.

15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.100
Let's go to this table.

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.640
So as of now, this table has two records.

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.900
So this is very simple table having the four columns, OK?

18
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.780
You can create it yourself or along with this lecture, I will provide the sequel file for this university

19
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.180
schema.

20
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.560
You can download it and import in your local machine using the bicycle workbench.

21
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.460
It's up to you.

22
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.680
So make sure before we jump to the next lecture, you have the student table in your local bicycle database,

23
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.600
so that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

24
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.010
Thank you very much.
