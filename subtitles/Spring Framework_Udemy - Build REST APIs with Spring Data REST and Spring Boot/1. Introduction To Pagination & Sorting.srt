1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,600
In the upcoming lectures, we will see how to do business in and sorting while working with spring guitarist.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,400
So for this, we need to open up records in our student and subject table.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,290
So that's what I did in the background.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,440
OK, let me show you quickly what we have in our musical tables.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,290
So this is the department table.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,680
We have total two records in this table.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,500
Total, we have 24 records.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:24,780
OK?

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:25,610
I do.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,790
Starting from the two.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,620
So total 24 records.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,750
Now let's go to subject level.

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,790
And here we have total.

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,870
Twenty eight records.

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,170
OK.

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,850
It starting from three.

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,620
So total twenty eight records.

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,650
So this is what we have in our MRGO database.

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,310
Don't worry, along with this lecture, you will get disqualified.

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:44,640
OK.

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,790
So with that, you can import all these things in your local machine.

22
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,540
Using the bicycle workbench now of a spring wood application is already running.

23
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,600
So let's jump to browser and hit this.

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,040
You are to at what our application.

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,590
And this is the response we are getting right.

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,520
So we have a passport department student n subject.

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,830
Now let's focus on this one.

28
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,190
OK, for example, with this, we are getting all the students right.

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,080
And look at this query parameters, page number, size and sort.

30
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,470
So using this query parameters, they can do unison and sorting while working with spring guitarist.

31
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,620
And this is what we are going to do in the upcoming lectures.

32
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,070
OK.

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,290
So let's copy this API.

34
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,400
You all jump to Postman and call this IPA.

35
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,800
We got the response come down at the bottom.

36
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,620
See this one object obituary page object so size equal to 20.

37
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,810
So by default, bid size is 20.

38
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,410
OK, 20 is the default size provided by spring guitarist.

39
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,860
Total records we have is 24.

40
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:47,440
OK.

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,130
And Total Page is equal to do so in the first bit.

42
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,940
How many records will get 20 on the second page for right?

43
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,410
Because total, we help.

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,430
24 records.

45
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,210
Indestructible.

46
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,860
See, here we are getting till 21.

47
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,050
OK?

48
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,340
It's equal to 21.

49
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,160
That means total twenty records.

50
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,940
We are getting OK.

51
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,830
From this green table.

52
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,700
Let's come down see this one.

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,620
So total 20 records we are getting.

54
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,270
So this is our being number one.

55
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,020
OK.

56
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,600
Same thing for subject as well.

57
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,430
Let's copy this one.

58
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,770
Call this EPA.

59
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,900
OK, we got 20 seconds total elements.

60
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,620
28.

61
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,570
So on the second page will get eight records because totally out two pages.

62
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,280
So along with the data, your consumer is also getting this information OK?

63
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,780
Bid size bid.

64
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,940
No total bid isn't total elements.

65
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,360
So looking at this, OK, your consumer will get idea that what he or she needs to get on the next page

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,580
will depend on the total number of elements, the total number of pages, the current number of the

67
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,350
page OK and bid size.

68
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,770
So with this information, your consumer will get idea that what he or she needs to do for the isn't

69
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,380
to get all the records or support, for example, all the records in the next page or upcoming pages.

70
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,950
See all these things are provided by spring guitarist.

71
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,480
OK, we are not doing anything.

72
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,420
This page object OK in the decent format is being provided by spring guitarist.

73
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,500
Now how do we do the pagination that we do in the next lecture?

74
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,270
So that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

75
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,830
Thank you very much.
