00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.320
By default, Bid says this 20 when we are working with spring guitarist.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.830
Now let's say we want to change this default bid size.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.360
So that also we can do.

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.220
OK, so let's go for it.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.220
Jump with ideas and put in the default bid.

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.510
Says, OK, we just need to set one property in our application, not properties, right?

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.760
So here the property we need to set is spring distressed.

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.360
This one, okay?

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.930
Bid sites said, for example, we want to help bid size equal to 10 instead of 20 000, which is default

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.150
one.

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.770
That's it, said this property and I don't know what Springwood application.

12
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.770
Jump to Portman, all these EPA.

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.210
Come down.

14
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.650
See now bid size equal to 10 total elements, 24.

15
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.020
But now total page is equal to three.

16
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.740
OK, because we hope it's as equal to 10.

17
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.140
So on the first page, we will get 10 records on the second page as well.

18
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.580
We will get 10 records.

19
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.190
And on the third page will get four records.

20
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.290
So let's get the party page.

21
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.460
So using the very parameter page equal to two, right?

22
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.560
Because we want to have that thought a page.

23
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.270
So zero based index.

24
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.230
Remember this one?

25
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.750
See one, two, three and four four records we are getting.

26
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.650
OK.

27
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.960
And this is applicable for all get resources.

28
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.850
So, for example, we are getting older subjects, OK using this API.

29
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.540
So now here also bids as equal to 10 is applicable.

30
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.080
See, this is what we have said in our application, not properties, OK?

31
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.600
So every place for your all resolutions is now the default bid size is 10.

32
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.500
Here we are total 28 records, so total is equal to three on the total bid will get eight records,

33
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.800
right?

34
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.070
So Page three surpassed the two.

35
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.300
And here we will get eight records.

36
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.240
This is page number two.

37
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.590
That means per page.

38
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.110
So this is how you can change the default bitesize while working with spring guitarist.

39
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.640
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

40
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.050
Thank you very much.
