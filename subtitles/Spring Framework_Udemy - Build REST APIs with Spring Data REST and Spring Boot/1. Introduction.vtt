Hello and welcome to the course that dippers with spring guitarist and spring board.

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.330
Before we move ahead, let me give you an introduction about how these courses is designed to.

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.590
So the very first thing is course structure, this course is all about spring guitarist.

4
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.780
And in this course, you will learn how to develop recipes using spinning guitarist.

5
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.630
For this, you need to have the basic knowledge on spending that Adebiyi, so the very first thing we

6
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.170
will get started in this course is that basic SOP GPA, it may be possible that you are already everybody.

7
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.190
That's fine.

8
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.150
But I can't assume that all people who are taking this course are aware of GPA that we will jump to

9
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.400
spring guitarist to develop the rest.

10
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.720
In this course, you will learn how to do business and sorting by working with spring guitarist.

11
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.270
You will also learn how to perform validations while working with Spring Guitarist.

12
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.000
In this course, you will learn projection and exiled provided by spring guitarist.

13
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.800
This course covers Hail Explorer provided by spring guitarist.

14
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.520
Someone has rightly said that don't judge a book by its cover, and the same thing is applicable for

15
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.060
this course.

16
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.890
This court is having more than three hours of content, so I would like to request you that what at

17
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.240
least 30 to 50 percent of the goods and then come up with your constructive feedback.

18
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.010
I am always looking for the constructive feedback to improve the course quality.

19
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.710
The next is buyers of the goods.

20
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.410
Some students prefer to learning for speed.

21
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.200
And some students prefer to learn in slow speed.

22
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.940
In this course, I tried my best to keep medium pace targeting all kind of students whenever required.

23
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.930
I slow down my peers to make you understand the topic in a better way.

24
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.660
Still, if you think that the pace of the course is either slow or fast, then you can use the video

25
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.360
player setting to increase or decrease the speed.

26
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.700
Source code and other resources that we are going to use in this cause that you will get inside the

27
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.250
lectures and you can download them as well.

28
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.070
English is not my mother tongue, so I hope before taking this course, you have watched the preview

29
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.790
videos to take my teaching style and English pronunciation.

30
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.760
Yeah, that sort introduction about this course and will get started from the next lecture.
