1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,040
Till now, we have seen recipes using spring guitarist and spring guitar.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,960
But that was using only one table and that was turntable, right?

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,380
But now let's say we have a couple of pebbles in our square database and that is with second licensee

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,030
using the port and key concept.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,190
Now, in this case, let's see how to how the rest is.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,380
When you have a couple of tables with relationship.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,040
OK, so how to work with that using the spring guitarist?

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,070
So that's what we will see in the upcoming lectures.

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,540
But before we jump to that, we need a couple of tables with sexual relationship, right?

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,430
So that's what I have done over here.

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,830
Inside the university schema, I have created two more tables department and subject.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,080
Let me give you an overview of this table.

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,380
OK.

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,580
This is the department table.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,540
Very simple.

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,240
One with two columns I.D. This is the primary in the park many see as OK.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,820
Now this all three tables are completely empty.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,090
OK?

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,030
There are no records inside these three tables.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,920
Now this is the table.

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,550
We know what it is, but one more column has been added now.

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,570
Department I.D..

23
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,740
So this is the parent basically primary job department table.

24
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,020
This is the subject learning table.

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,340
OK, Heidi, this is primarily subject name Mike, Slopping and Randy.

26
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,600
This is Warren G and Primary Job Student Table.

27
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:29,620
So this is the hierarchy department tables, parent table, rent table and student table is parent table

28
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,210
for subjects learning table.

29
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,050
Let me show you with your diagram that will give you a better idea.

30
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:42,560
The department is better enforcement level, and here is the Foreign Department, 80 known police,

31
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,740
but Interpol for subjects landing table.

32
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,060
And this is the foreign student I.D..

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,620
Now let's talk about the relationship so we can say that many students belong to one department.

34
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,770
OK, so this relationship is basically many to one.

35
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,860
From student to department, it is many to one.

36
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,370
OK.

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:07,090
In the same way, we can say that many subjects or you can see more than one subject right one or more

38
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,060
than one subjects can be learned by a single student.

39
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,160
So this is also many to one mapping from subject to strain.

40
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,550
It is also many to one relationship.

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:16,900
OK.

42
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,380
From student to department also, it is many to one relationship.

43
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,270
So these are the three tables.

44
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,170
Don't worry.

45
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,470
Along with this lecture, you will get disqualified.

46
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:25,750
OK?

47
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:31,120
You can download it and import in your local bicycle database using the bicycle workbench.

48
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,980
OK, so no need to worry about it.

49
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,020
Along with this lecture, you will get disqualified.

50
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,080
So these are the three tables, and with this in the upcoming lectures, we will have the rest space,

51
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,220
but not the manual.

52
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,550
OK.

53
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:48,070
We are going to use the spring guitarist, but the main important part is how we are going to handle

54
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,950
this relationship while working with the spring guitarist.

55
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,920
So that's our focus in the upcoming lectures.

56
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,540
So make sure before the next lecture you are ready with this three day was OK.

57
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,320
So that's all for now, and we'll proceed further.

58
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,370
The next lecture?

59
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,810
Thank you very much.
