00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,210
In this lecture, we will see what is spring data.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,940
So basically, spring data is umbrella project under which there are many such projects.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,320
For example, spring data, GPA, spring data, MongoDB, spring data, Cassandra and many more.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,580
It's not possible to list down all the SAP projects or hear if we are using any relational icicle database.

5
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,510
Then we can use spring data ADP so that we don't need to write the natives equal queries in our spring

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,590
board application in the same way.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,380
Say, for example, if we are using the MongoDB database, then we can use spring data, MongoDB, so

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,730
that we don't need to the native MongoDB queries in our Springwood application.

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,210
And same goes for Cassandra and other databases.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:52,770
So, for example, Neo4j graph database, so that is bring data Neo4j provided under spring data.

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,590
If you want to know more about spring data, you can check out the official page provided by spring.

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,720
So for that, let's jump to browser and search for spring data.

13
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,000
This is the official one by spring for hamburgers being not, I'll.

14
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,520
As I said, this is the umbrella project, OK, spring data.

15
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,700
And these are dozens of projects, OK, under the spring data spring that ADP is putting data, MongoDB

16
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,800
spring data, it is spring data, Kassandra Spring Data, Neo4j and many more.

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,320
You can read out this one, OK, if you want to know more about spring data in this course.

18
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,630
Our focus will be on two projects.

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,400
One is spring data and another one is spring data rest.

20
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,340
So this is an introduction to spring data, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,750
Thank you very much.
