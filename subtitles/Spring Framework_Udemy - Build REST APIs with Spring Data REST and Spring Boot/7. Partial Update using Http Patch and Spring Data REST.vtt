00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.870
In the previous lecture, we have seen how to update the record using the DPA provided by spring guitarist.

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.960
But the problem here is that we need to pass all the attributes.

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.300
OK?

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.510
Doesn't matter if we want to update the values for those attributes or not.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.270
But still, we need to pass all the attributes and their values in the reverse payload in the format

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.170
of JSON.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.620
Now, let's say we want to do partial update that means we just want to pass on those attributes for

8
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.440
which we actually want to update the values.

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.110
And at the same time, other attributes, right that we are not passing in very crisp.

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.010
Chris Ballard should not get nullified in the database, just like we have seen in the previous lecture,

11
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.310
right?

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.500
These two columns were getting nullified when we were not passing these two attributes.

13
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.680
OK, so we want to avoid that.

14
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.340
So this is the current status of our roundtable.

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.200
Now let's see.

16
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.600
We just want to chain this first name, OK?

17
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.430
From Peter to Peter one.

18
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.820
And we don't want to touch for these two columns.

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.860
So let's see how to do this.

20
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.280
Some two policemen.

21
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.040
So this will remain same.

22
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.400
OK.

23
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.290
The rest wri is let's rents and ID equal to four, because this is what we want to update.

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.550
OK?

25
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.680
ID equal to four.

26
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.810
So posit as part variable.

27
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.840
Now, Jane, these two added debate BitPay OK at the debate method and just pass only those attributes

28
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.280
that you want to update.

29
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.150
So, for example, beta one and call the API.

30
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.230
See, we got the success response.

31
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.660
Check the database, see first name got changed.

32
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.740
But look at these two columns, OK?

33
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.320
These values are now not nullified.

34
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.710
OK, so this is the partial update now.

35
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.880
Let's try again.

36
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.070
Say, for example, we want to change value for the first name.

37
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.640
OK, Peter, go and mark one.

38
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.030
These two attributes, and we don't want to touch a value of email.

39
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.630
OK, call this IPA because the success response taking the database see first name got changed.

40
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.240
The last name Gajendra.

41
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.160
But this is on general email because we are not parsing its value.

42
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.900
Know what payload?

43
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.500
OK.

44
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.170
And at the same time, it is not getting nullified.

45
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.710
This is a deadbeat PDP.

46
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.990
And this is automatically provided by a spring guitarist.

47
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.080
So using this boot and Petitpas, you can update the record while working with spring guitarist.

48
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.720
Now you narrate how this works.

49
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.370
So as what are your requirements, you can go with either equity report or pitch?

50
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.210
OK, are what is your requirement and whatever is preferable for you?

51
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.140
You can go with it.

52
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.970
So this is how you can update the record using BitPay.

53
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.740
So that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

54
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.970
Thank you very much.
