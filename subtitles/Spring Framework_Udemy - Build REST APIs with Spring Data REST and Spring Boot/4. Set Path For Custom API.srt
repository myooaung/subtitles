00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:08,070
Bill, now we have developed this custom apps using the Pine Bay method provided by GP here, but let's

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,930
say you are right to put our apples.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,760
Same is our methodology.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,800
So here we are, joined by email here we help find by first name or last name.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,510
Same for other methods.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:25,270
Now, let's say you are not compatible with this part, or let's say it is not as per the standard OK

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,750
for the project you are working for or for the company you are working for.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,990
Well, let's say your consumer is not compatible with this EPA, but let's say you are two and you want

9
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,660
to change it so that also we can configure.

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,420
And this is what we are going to do in the lecture.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,940
So here we have this part, right?

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,290
What about EPA fined by email, which is same is our method name, OK?

13
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,410
This is the default one being used at a base putting that arrest.

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,970
Now for this one, OK, so use the energy sun as rest a resource.

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,140
OK, and we need to set, but attribute value this one.

16
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,200
So, for example, we want to have it as less decimal, so provide e-mail.

17
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,100
Don't include us less, OK?

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:06,980
Just provide.

19
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,070
But now run Springwood application and jump to postman.

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,930
So up to 30, right we have already seen find by email.

21
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,820
Let me see if I am getting.

22
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,150
That's fine.

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,030
Let me add, I did OK, this one find by e-mail.

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,570
And good parameter email equal to.

25
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,190
John at Gmail dot com.

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,840
Call this EPA, we should get photo.

27
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:42,000
OK, see, we are getting photo four, because now we have a change in the partagÃ© for our EPA.

28
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,650
We need to provide less EPA then our query parameter in its value.

29
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,180
Now call this EPA.

30
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,640
See, big order details, OK?

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,990
And this video is in.

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,020
But the main part is now we have genes in the part borrowed EPA instead of having this default one,

33
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,320
OK?

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,790
Now we have configured it how using this annotation rest resource.

35
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,510
So the same thing you can apply for these methods as well, OK?

36
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,590
You just need to have this kind of annotation and provide the part for your API.

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,280
That's it.

38
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,200
Let me go back here.

39
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,160
So here what happens, I'll give whatever methods you have inside your repository.

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,460
Those are being exposed by spring guitarist, OK?

41
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,640
As this debate is now, let's say you don't want to expose some particular methods, OK as recipes.

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,400
So that also we can do obviously the easiest ways to comment this out, OK?

43
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,290
So splintered that it will not expose this matters, but is Typekit.

44
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,400
This is the best way you can do, but all you can say is that, for example, you can remove this completely.

45
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,280
But let's say you want to have this matter, OK, inside your repository for some reason, for reference

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,330
or for any reason.

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,630
OK.

48
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,940
But you don't want to expose this as it is debate saw here.

49
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:04,110
OK, using this generation, that is the resource you need to cite one attribute exported equal to false.

50
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:05,440
OK.

51
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,130
That's it.

52
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,310
But I'm speaking what application and jump to Boseman?

53
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,310
This is our last e-mail.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,090
Now call it.

55
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,900
See, now we are getting photo port, why?

56
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,290
Because we are now not exposing this, OK?

57
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,430
This as GDP, we have said export equal to false.

58
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,690
By default, it is true.

59
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,420
So this is how you can configure the part for your custom apps while working with spring guitarist.

60
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,280
That's all for now.

61
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,920
And we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

62
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,330
Thank you very much.
