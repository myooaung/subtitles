00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,890
In this lecture, we will see what is hideous and what is hell.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,780
In other words, you can pronounce it as hit or is whatever you want to pronounce.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:20,050
So here Haiti transport hyper media is the engine of applications dead and health stands for hypertext

4
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,250
application language.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,760
Now let's understand this to wit example.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,210
See, we have Springwood application by which we are providing the wristbands.

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,180
So here is the consumer with hitting over these tips and in return it is getting the response in the

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:37,540
apartment.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,500
Jason.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,640
Now, Heidi, Do is is the principal, or you can say concerning by which you are allowing your consumers

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,650
to navigate to other resources.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
All you can say to navigate to other apps provided by you.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,790
OK, so that will happen with a decent response.

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,530
Let me show you an example.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,100
OK.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,380
This is not just a response or power.

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:07,300
One of the apps, so this is headier is inside which your JSON response will contain hyper media links.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,170
Say this one?

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,490
So what will happen?

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,710
Your consumer will get this decent response, OK, by calling your API, and it will contain this kind

21
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,840
of hyper media links so your consumer can consume this IPAs, OK?

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,330
So that is kind of a self mitigation.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,970
Your consumer is calling one of your weapons in the response it is getting the data along with it.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,670
It will get this kind of hyper media links.

25
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,970
So using this, it can call other APIs provided by you and this call it is hitting us.

26
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,380
Now, let's say you want to provide U.S. support for your wrist base and you want to have this kind

27
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,020
of hyper media links in that JSON response.

28
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,430
So you need an implementation because he does.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,120
It's just the principle.

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,180
Or you can say constant, you need an implementation.

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,920
So there comes hell.

32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,520
So basically, is the implementation up here, do yours?

33
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,340
There are a couple of other hurdles implementation as well, like local exemplars, Jason, just an

34
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,540
EPA, et cetera.

35
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,730
But the most popular and widely used are the implementation of video is is hell.

36
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,280
And that's what we will use in this course as well.

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,420
See, if we are using the spring guitarist, then we don't need to worry about it, okay, because spring

38
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,090
guitarist will create this kind of hype with media links for our wristbands in the former top Jason

39
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:29,870
in our response.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,700
OK, we don't need to worry about it.

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,460
Spring guitarist will work with the hell and it will put this kind of hype and media links in that Jason

42
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:37,970
response.

43
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,260
What our research is.

44
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:47,720
So that's all about headless and hell, that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

45
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,100
Thank you very much.
