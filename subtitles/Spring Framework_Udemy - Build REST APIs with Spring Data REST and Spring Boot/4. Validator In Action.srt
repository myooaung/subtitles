1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,000
So now we are all set with our validator.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,410
So let's test it out.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,170
But before we don't know what spending would apply, Gibson, let's go to department repository and

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,130
comment this one OK?

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,350
Now we want to have our department able to be exposed to this arrest resource.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:16,620
OK?

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,070
So for your reference, I'm having this poor as commented.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,810
OK, now we are all good.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,320
I don't know what Springwood Application will then dump to postman.

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, by creating the student, let's provide first name value equal to empty like this one.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,190
The CPA?

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,710
See, now we are getting 400 bed requests, OK?

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:45,540
Let's check our response, see under the arrows and the glass, which one surrendered our property that

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,560
is basically filled, OK?

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,820
You know what example that is?

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,160
First name and look at this message.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,920
It is saying that first name is required.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,760
So this is the proper error message that now consumer is getting and using this error message, OK,

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,860
in the format of this and the consumer will get idea that what things he is doing wrong, what here?

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,950
Now let's try to create the department.

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,280
So in the same way, I want it to be post API.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:11,670
OK.

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,800
Let's clear, does civil department.

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,000
And call this EPA see, he got 500 internet data, OK?

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,190
And take this message, cannot cast Department Glass to student glass.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,130
Why we are getting this jump to his ideas.

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,050
And this is our validator, OK?

28
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,710
And here we are doing casting right object of this one right target to student class.

29
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,600
So from here it is throwing error.

30
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,030
Now let's go to our configuration.

31
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,160
So here we have registered this validator right and event type is before create.

32
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,760
So this particular validator is applicable for all your ADP post-debate.

33
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,260
So when you create this one, this will be applicable when you create the department.

34
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,990
This will be applicable when you create the subject.

35
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,270
This validation will take place.

36
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,230
So basically, for all your tables, OK, with which you have entity class in repository and those are

37
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,100
exposed, it is.

38
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,410
It is the resource for all those, right?

39
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,250
When you create the record, this particular validator will take place.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,970
So this is applicable for all the post debates, so to avoid this, OK?

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,960
What we can do?

42
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,390
We can have one it conditional here.

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,280
So, for example, this particular decent and we just want to know when we are creating this one.

44
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,290
Obviously, when we create the department, we will not get the value of poisoning.

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,030
And in the same way, if we are creating the subject right, we will not get the value of poisoning.

46
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:49,050
So if this is instance of student class, OK, then only cost it.

47
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,850
Now, if you want to help another one, it is an OK for your department.

48
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,110
So, for example, department name cannot be null or empty, then.

49
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,110
Copied again with the elusive if like this one instance of department.

50
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,740
This one and put your it isn't what here.

51
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,870
Whatever it is, OK, using this one, you can throw out the error message saying that department in

52
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,140
cannot be null or empty.

53
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,570
So let me comment out this one for your reference.

54
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,920
Now we are all good.

55
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,480
I don't know what Springwood Application.

56
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,880
Dump two policemen.

57
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,070
And call this EPA.

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,010
Now we got the success response, OK, 201 created.

59
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,990
So what do you need to remember?

60
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:46,370
Is that OK, whatever you have inside this matter with this particular event, OK, before create it

61
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,970
will be applicable for all the added to be four steps, basically before you create any record using

62
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,260
this register resources.

63
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:02,000
So this is how you can impose the will descend before you create the record, that's all for now, and

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,210
we'll proceed further.

65
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,220
The next lecture?

66
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,660
Thank you very much.
