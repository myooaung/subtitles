1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,590
Look at this response.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,550
We are not getting it its value in the decent response.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,240
So this is the default behavior provided by spring guitarist.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,270
It will not expose the value of your field on which you have added an audition.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,250
Basically, your unique identifier.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,670
OK, so this is the default behavior provided by spring guitarist.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,890
But end it.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,330
And that's what we are going to do in this lecture.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:24,810
OK.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,270
We just need to do a little bit configuration.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,020
So let's create another class for this.

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,690
Say arrest config.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,350
Mark, this with ad configuration.

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,200
And we need to implement.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,250
Interfaced.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,640
Repository, it is this one configured at a.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,870
Let me do maximize.

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,550
And we need to operate one metallo case or go to interface, come down.

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,630
And this metallic country gold repository, wrist configuration, this metal, we need to order it,

20
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:10,090
OK, so let's copy signature of this metal and in our class.

21
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,550
What here?

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,170
Mark Devitt at or override?

23
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,570
Now using this configuration object.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,140
OK.

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,790
All the metal to expose IEDs for, and we need to provide the entity glass, so you know what, example,

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,080
student or class?

27
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,360
That's it.

28
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:37,810
OK.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,100
Go to this matter.

30
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,830
It is accepting multiple classes, OK?

31
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,290
Say, for example, we have a department table.

32
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:44,800
OK.

33
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,960
And there also we help Adekola column.

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,660
So obviously we'll be having the department and the Glass department or Java support that we will be

35
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:52,870
having.

36
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,730
That is Depay's on which end point?

37
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,990
Less departments, right, automatically generated by spring that arrest.

38
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,150
So if you want to expose its ideal value, OK, so you need to provide it or here like this one, OK,

39
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,070
Department Board plus, for example, I'm saying we don't have this entity class.

40
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:15,850
Say, for example, you have 10 tables in your school database, so you will be having the then entity

41
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:22,960
classes and for them all, if you want to expose it as well, you provide all 10 entity classes or here,

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,180
OK, with comma separated like this one.

43
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,770
But for now, we just know one entity class that is student dot java.

44
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,680
So provide like this one, OK, astronaut class.

45
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,640
That's it.

46
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,220
Let's run our Springwood application.

47
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
Jump to postmen and we will call the same EPA, OK?

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,430
Getting this plant that is equal to one.

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,650
See, now we are getting it for its value in that JSON response, OK?

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,150
Let's check for all students now here.

51
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,570
Also, we will get it equal to one in equal to two earlier.

52
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,610
We were not getting this bill's value, OK?

53
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,060
And that was the default behavior provided by spring, that arrest.

54
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,440
But with this configuration, we have changed our default behavior.

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,560
OK, now another workaround is also there, OK?

56
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,780
So for that, what you can do?

57
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,100
Go to your entity class.

58
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,560
OK, define one meter.

59
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,660
Say, for example, get student I.D..

60
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,100
OK.

61
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,390
And here done this, not it.

62
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,040
It will tell you basically you're now running again.

63
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,460
So this will get exposed in the DSM response, OK?

64
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,710
As Student ID attribute.

65
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,650
Let me show you OK, all this EPA.

66
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,110
S. Student Aid equal to one.

67
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,470
Equal to two gay.

68
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,770
Get it equal to one where see this one indeed equal to one.

69
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,900
OK, so this also you're going to have the metal and expose it.

70
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,960
So whatever you prefer, you can go with this one, OK?

71
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,240
Let me comment this one for your reference.

72
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,300
In this course, we will go with this configuration when OK?

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,250
Provide your entity class.

74
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:19,660
So this is how you can expose it if its value while working with spring day to rest, so that's all

75
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,290
for now.

76
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,050
And we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,550
Thank you very much.
