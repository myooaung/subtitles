00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.480
In the previous lecture, we created this record right now.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.250
Let's try to delete this record and this we have already seen in one of the previous lectures, right?

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.720
Let's go to postmen.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.240
And this is the student we want to delete.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.440
That is equal to one.

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.370
So, Jane, these two adedipe, delete and call disappear.

7
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.230
See, we got some error.

8
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.550
OK, cannot delete or update a parent through a forensic sunstein fees.

9
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.580
Which one subject's learning?

10
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.570
Why?

11
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.330
Because now we have this table, right?

12
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.700
Which is basically digestible for a first roundtable so we can directly delete or get this particular

13
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.940
record from the student table before we delete these two records.

14
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.640
Because for these two records, which one is the parent record that we have in the student table, this

15
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.340
one will give extended equal to one, you see.

16
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.530
Now we have this point in the subject learning table stranded equal to one.

17
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.130
So if we want to delete the student first is we need to delete these two subjects or whatever OK for

18
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.000
that particular student.

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.490
First, we need to delete the records from the tile table and then we can delete from the parent table.

20
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.890
So let's see, how do I do this?

21
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.130
While working with spelling that AGP jump to as do is stop the Springwood application.

22
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.980
Let's go to our subjects lending entity, Glassie.

23
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.860
This is how we have done the mapping right from subject to student.

24
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.270
It is.

25
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.730
Many do one mapping so in reverse.

26
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.230
We can say that from student to subject, it is one to many relationship.

27
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.610
So let's define OK in our student entity glass or here.

28
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.130
Private list of.

29
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.680
Subjects learning.

30
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.220
Learning good.

31
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.270
Copy this one.

32
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.180
And imported Darla, you will list so it.

33
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.790
Vilest because a particular student can be learning one or more than one subject.

34
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.930
OK, so we need to provide a list of over daily tables and glass.

35
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.790
You know what example subjects learning?

36
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.380
So on top of it, we need to mark this one, OK?

37
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.720
Listen, keep as one too many like this one.

38
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.590
Not very over actually mapping.

39
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.520
OK, using the foreign key column, this one, right, using the joint column.

40
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.640
And this is the field we have right in the subject's landing.

41
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.410
Whatever variable, whatever you define, look just copied and go to this annotation.

42
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.760
OK, one too many here mapping by attribute equal to this field.

43
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.720
Whatever you have defined in your title tables and glass, OK, and then gas get equal to gasket type.

44
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.350
Not all.

45
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.280
That's it.

46
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.530
Let's get a sense that there's.

47
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.550
For this one.

48
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.860
Select on and generate format Soviet.

49
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.570
Now let's renovate Springwood Obligation.

50
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.960
Jump to Portman now, let's try to delay this student again, OK?

51
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.850
Let's see if we are getting this error again or not.

52
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.170
Call this a b.

53
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.600
See, we got a sexist response, OK for our two zero four.

54
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.380
Let's verify in the database first in the subject's landing.

55
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.750
See, two records got deleted from the tile table and from the table.

56
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.520
This one also got deleted.

57
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.980
So when you have a sexual relationship using the foreign key concept and you want to delete the records

58
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.450
right from the parent table, then this is how you need to handle using this kind of mapping.

59
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.870
Okay, one too many or whatever and use this attribute on a map.

60
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.710
Because here we can do a joint column or edit column, in addition.

61
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.040
OK.

62
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.300
This is the parent table.

63
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.270
So you need to go to your daily table and ridiculous and whatever field you define right for your parent

64
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.500
table, the class.

65
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.620
This will you need to put in your parent one word here and cascade equal to casket type on.

66
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.200
Don't forget to get dozens that does OK.

67
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.050
Not the same thing is applicable for department as well, because we know what eight in one department

68
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.210
we can help one or more than one students.

69
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.420
So a separate example inside the computer science department.

70
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.660
OK?

71
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.690
There are five student entries OK you have in this table.

72
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.550
For example, let's zoom, OK?

73
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.350
And if you directly want to delete the computer science department, then you will get the same error

74
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.750
that we have seen in the lecture, right?

75
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.890
Just be for a few minutes.

76
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.960
So the same thing you need to do, OK?

77
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.280
Let me copy this.

78
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.850
And so you.

79
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.080
Stop this one.

80
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.910
So this is our parent one, right?

81
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.840
Go here.

82
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.530
He had our child table and tinted glasses student went right.

83
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.150
So this is students and how we are doing the mapping inside this one, this one department.

84
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.950
Copy this one.

85
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.040
This is our department one would on here.

86
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.790
That's it.

87
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.890
This is also one to many relationship, right from department to student.

88
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.500
It is one too many, isn't it?

89
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.010
And don't forget, get us sense that as OK.

90
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.770
Standard format it and save it.

91
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.820
That's it.

92
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.290
This is all you need to do.

93
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.120
We have tested by deleting the student table's entry right now here.

94
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.250
You can test out yourself, book by reading from the department tables, entry, how some departments

95
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.010
and inside the department create some students and then try to delete them completely department.

96
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.970
It should work.

97
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.920
So this is an assignment for you.

98
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.320
You will get the source code along with this lecture.

99
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.970
So try it out yourself.

100
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.540
So this is how you can delete the record when you have security lessons while working with spring that

101
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.020
arrest.

102
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.470
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further.

103
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.580
The next lecture?

104
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.780
Thank you very much.
