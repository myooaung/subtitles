00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.240
Let's get started by creating the springboard application.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.400
So open spring Brazil, click on the file new spring starter project.

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.850
You, the project mean, say, for example, spring water here I am going to use Apache Marvin with

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.180
delivers in eight.

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.550
This is the group an artifact?

6
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.030
OK.

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.920
And this is the package inside which we are going to have the main glass for us being good application.

8
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.120
Click on the next.

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.110
As of now, when I'm recording this lecture, the latest was an upstanding Buddhist 2.6, not three.

10
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.200
OK, so this was an ideal use for this being would now to understand us being that AGP, we are going

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.970
to develop these debates, so we need to add a couple of dependencies, OK?

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690
So the very first is spring that because we are going to have that is be OK.

13
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.850
Spinning web and obviously splendid idea because that's what we are going to see.

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.410
And now we have Michael database, right?

15
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.540
So, Adam, bicycle driver.

16
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.760
So as of now, we require three dependencies spring that spring did AGP and my sequel that I would click

17
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.260
on the next and finish.

18
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.350
Here is our springboard obligation.

19
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.410
And this is the main glass over Springwood application.

20
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.350
As we are going to develop, that is.

21
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.370
So let's say, a controller in service packages, OK, so let's say two separate brigades for controller

22
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.700
live.

23
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.560
Had the new package.

24
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.840
Controller and another package for service layer.

25
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.060
That is service.

26
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.850
Let's create does one controller.

27
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.550
New class student controller.

28
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.600
Marty's with Ed Forrest controller.

29
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.050
This one and Howdo request mapping.

30
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.740
Slurs student.

31
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.920
OK, as of now, just one controller is empty, livid blank like this one in the upcoming lectures,

32
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.060
we will adopt the iPads now let the dust dancers.

33
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.880
So this is the new class student service.

34
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.260
Mark, this with a service annotation.

35
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.180
Well, now this will also be blank in the upcoming lectures, we will let the court order here, OK,

36
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.060
so from controller to we will call to service.

37
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.940
So now we need to add this to pick this OK as components again, then only it will work great with our

38
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.870
spring wood application.

39
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.970
So you know what it means glass components again, and we need to add these two packages like this.

40
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.530
This is the first one.

41
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.040
And another one is service copy this.

42
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.830
Don't make any mistake, OK?

43
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.470
So I do understand the being at a GPA in the upcoming lectures will develop couple of de beers using

44
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.220
this one controller, so know basic structure of always being good.

45
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.730
Application is ready and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

46
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.140
Thank you very much.
