00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.430
This is our entity, class student, student or.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.770
And using this name only splinted arrest is creating the USA forever.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.750
This debate is this one, right?

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.460
Misled students.

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.240
So this is the default one being generated by spring that arrest.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.320
But let's say we want to change it, OK, we want to change this.

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.780
But all you can say you are right for our rest APIs so that also we can do so.

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.320
For example, we want to have you what is less study?

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.820
So let's go for it.

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.150
So this is our entity, Glass.

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.570
What is the repository for it still in repository, right?

12
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.920
So go to this one.

13
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.990
And instead of this annotation at repository use at.

14
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.800
Repository rest resource.

15
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.250
OK.

16
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.890
And we need to set the value pod attribute.

17
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.680
But this one particle to say, for example, a study, that's it.

18
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.240
Remove this one unwanted import.

19
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.350
Yeah, now we are good.

20
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.360
I don't know what's happening with application.

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.970
And, Jane, these to get all students OK, like this one called disappear.

22
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.090
See, now it will not work.

23
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.110
OK, this is giving fodder for now, let's try this.

24
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.750
You are OK.

25
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.130
This is what we have said or here particle to.

26
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.250
Call this one.

27
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.350
See, we got a student.

28
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.200
And second, when basically all the students, OK, whatever we have in our mythical table student.

29
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.830
So this will be applicable for all the AP is there, for example, getting the run by I.D. it equal

30
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.220
to one.

31
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.830
OK.

32
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.350
To all the is, OK.

33
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.210
This is the part of your country.

34
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.980
So this will be applicable at every place, OK, for every.

35
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.180
And did be geared to post delayed beds every bit.

36
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.610
OK, now let's go back to get all the students call this one.

37
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.990
Look at this one.

38
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.260
OK?

39
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.570
This is the collection.

40
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.950
Or you can see a list or you can see it.

41
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.670
OK.

42
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.670
Where we are getting all the records for the particular table.

43
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.430
And this is the gist, Angie.

44
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.100
Now, let's say, if you want to configure this decent.

45
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.000
This is also being provided by spring guitarist, but let's say we want to change it.

46
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.660
So for that, stop this particular application.

47
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.680
And in this thing, A.D. said, OK, we need to set the value for another attribute that is collection

48
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.220
resource.

49
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.210
This one.

50
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.380
Year, for example, STDs, students are going short.

51
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.900
This is what we want to have as Jason.

52
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.740
Ronald.

53
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.050
Some men all this EPA again.

54
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.420
See, now this decent guy has been changed to whatever we configured.

55
00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.590
OK, we have genuine about what our EPA and decent Kefauver colleagues and all you can say at least

56
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.910
are against it, Eddie.

57
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.850
So this is how you can change that you are right for your race, Debbie, and also decent guy for Hellickson,

58
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.470
that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

59
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.940
Thank you very much.
