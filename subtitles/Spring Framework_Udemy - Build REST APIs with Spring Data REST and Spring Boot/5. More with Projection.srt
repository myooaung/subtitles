1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,770
Inside the glass, we have subjects learning that is they bob list.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,570
Now let's say we want to populate a number of subjects.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,400
The particular student is learning, so that is basically count that we want to populate in the Jeison.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,290
So let's see how to achieve this using projection.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,420
So this is our first projection.

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:26,450
Let's do another method signature with return type as integer because we want to retain the count,

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:26,690
right?

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,220
So that is numeric value.

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,880
So, for example, get total subjects.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,190
And on top of this, we need to have the added value in and using those putting explicit language right.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,300
We need to do this.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,730
So has called.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,700
And here we will get the object of still going into declassified and inside that we have this list.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,620
OK, so this is the fear.

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,020
So this bill, right, is type of list.

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,900
So how to get the size of the list in Java by calling the seismometer right, so called the meter size.

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,650
That's it.

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,550
Springwood application and will then jump to postman.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,250
All these EPA and applied projects and equal to five projects and called EPA.

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:20,070
See, we got the response, but look at this one now, all subjects equal to two come down for this

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,570
one total subject, equal to one and so on.

22
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,240
So this is applicable for all the records, OK?

23
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,150
Or let's get this done by it.

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,270
So here also we are replaying the first projects and see we are getting total subjects equal due to

25
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,900
how we are getting this using this projection and we know this method signature, OK, inside our first

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,530
projection.

27
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,870
So this kind of things you can try out yourself.

28
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,230
This depends on your requirements, what you want to have inside your projects and use the add value

29
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,650
in addition and spitting explicit language.

30
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,500
That's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,970
Thank you very much.
