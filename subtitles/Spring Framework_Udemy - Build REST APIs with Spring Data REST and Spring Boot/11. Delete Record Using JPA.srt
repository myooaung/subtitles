1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,530
In this lecture, we will see how the record using GDP, so for example, we want to delete the record

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,880
that is equal to three.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,500
So let's see, how do I do this using GDP?

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,170
And for this purpose, we will develop the daily debate.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,860
So let's jump to our student controller and here we will develop another API that is daily debate.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,440
So use the and delete mapping.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,450
OK, eps last delete, and we will pass the I.D. as part variable.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,740
Public now on the successful deletion of the record reveals just written the simple message saying that

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,790
student has been deleted, so the return type will be string.

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,970
Delete student.

11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,370
Let's get the part variables value using that part variable, in addition.

12
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,320
Long, I.D..

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,980
And from here, we will call our service here.

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,240
So let me copy this part.

15
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,750
Industrial service.

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,720
We will get it.

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:18,190
And now using the repository of stolen repository called the metadata delete my I.D. this one and passed

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,180
it its value.

19
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,480
Now let's return the message saying that student has been.

20
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,020
Deleted.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,320
That's it.

22
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,180
So using the GP, if you want to delete the record by it, basically by your primary key, then you

23
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,540
just need to call the matter delete by it.

24
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,460
That's it.

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:39,810
OK.

26
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,580
This one is provided by GP.

27
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,770
Now let's call this matter from over control earlier and the scene will return.

28
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,990
OK, so room service.

29
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,600
Called the matter Bastide, if its value.

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,290
That's it.

31
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,080
Let's run spending what application?

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,730
So this will get started on Port 880.

33
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:08,610
Dylan, let's Demko postman, and here this is now delayed and it's equal to three as part variable.

34
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,720
Send this to a TTP delete method and called API.

35
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,060
We got the sexist response saying that student has been deleted.

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,320
Let's verify, you know what my school database see now we just have to record the record of it it equal

37
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,670
to three got deleted.

38
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,980
How using that GPA?

39
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,630
So what do you need to do is.

40
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,310
OK, let's go to a western service.

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,080
You just need to call the metal delete by ID using your repository.

42
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,070
That's it.

43
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,270
Then that internet security will be carried out by GP.

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,740
You don't need to worry about it.

45
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,010
OK?

46
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,560
So called this matter deliberately when you want to delete the record by your primary key, which is

47
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,510
basically your unique identifier.

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,990
In other words, your field OK on which you have ad ID and decent in your entity class.

49
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,600
So this is how you can delete the record using spinning data.

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,090
So that's all for now, and we'll proceed further in the next lecture.

51
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,500
Thank you very much.
