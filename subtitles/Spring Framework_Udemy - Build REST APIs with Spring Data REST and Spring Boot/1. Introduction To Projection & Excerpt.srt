00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,060
In the upcoming lectures, we will see projection and excerpt provided by spring guitarist.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,650
But before we jump to it, let me give you an introduction about this too.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,830
And let's understand why we need to go for projects and excerpt.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,360
So this is a right we have already seen by which we are getting desperate and it is basically collecting

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,080
hope student.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,090
Now look at the decent response.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,480
Here we are getting forfeits right in the just response.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,340
And this is pixel response.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,560
That means every consumer will get this for filling in the form of design.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:41,040
Now let's say you have a couple of consumers and one consumer is coming to you and ask you, Hey, I

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,560
just want I.D. and email I.D. of this student.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,990
I don't need first name and last name in the JSON response, so don't provide me this to fill.

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,930
Now, let's say you have another consumer which is asking you that, Hey, I just need ID and first

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,710
name of the student.

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,020
I don't need last name in email of this.

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,860
OK, so don't provide me these two pills in the JSON response.

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,480
So how you will handle this kind of situation while working with spelling data is.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,280
So there comes projects and so it projects, then we can provide that.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,860
We just want to expose this particular to release, OK, under that particular projects, and now we

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,970
can help on other projects.

21
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,940
And under that, we can provide another fields.

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:28,160
So, for example, ID and email I.D. So this project son of a consumer needs to pass while calling this

23
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,970
API how using the query parameter so that we see in the upcoming lectures.

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,030
OK, don't worry, we will see that with the practical example.

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,420
So with projects, then we can have a view that which fields we want to expose under that particular

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:42,730
project.

27
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,490
And that project then our consumer can use while calling the EPA.

28
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:54,700
Now, let's come to exert when we want to have the default protection for our recipes, then we can

29
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,780
go for except now for which it is the IPAs in which we are having the collection of data collection

30
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:08,020
up student or collection of department or collection up subject so that we can have the default projects

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,780
done using the exiled Soviet expert.

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,500
What will happen?

33
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,970
Each and every consumer doesn't need to pass the projection while calling the EPA OK.

34
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,340
They don't need to pass the very parameter for the projects, and they will get the default view using

35
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,120
the exact.

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,430
So this is an introduction to projects on an excerpt, and we'll get started from the next lecture.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,810
Thank you very much.
