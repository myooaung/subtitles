1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,080
Okay.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,620
So in the previous lesson, we explored the benefits of tailwinds.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,100
Yes.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,780
And in this lesson, we're going to use The View Seelye to add it to our project.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,020
As you'll see, it's going to be a super simple setup process.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,360
So the first thing I want you to do is to open up your command line or your terminal and navigate to

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,820
your job search directory where we have our project.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,420
And I recommend shutting down the running server if there is one.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,060
And when I say running server, I mean if you still have the output from NPM run Serv where we are actually

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,530
transpiring the View app and showing it in our browser, I want you to shut that process down.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,810
Typically on a mac that's going to be something like command or command C and on a Windows Machine,

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,760
I imagine it would be something like control the or Control C and in case that doesn't work, you can

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,560
always just close your terminal application and relaunch it and that should do the trick regardless.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,760
Here is where we want to be.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,650
I am in the job search directory and nothing is running and we're once again going to use our View Sealy

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,770
program and the command we want here is going to be ADD.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,210
And as you might guess, this is going to add a dependency to our project.

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,980
And the beautiful part about the view.

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:11,250
Seelye In comparison to just a plain NPM install is this will not only download and fetch the dependency

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,080
but also create some basic set of files, some basic boilerplate code to get started.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,050
So that is the advantage of usually it is specifically designed to add a technology to a view project

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,550
and so it's not going to have support for every package, but in this case it does have support for

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,000
tailwind.

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,940
So what we want to add here is view add tailwind.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,430
So go ahead and press enter here.

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,210
And that's going to start the process of installing the plugin fetching dependencies.

27
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,430
It's also going to give us this option right here.

28
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,070
Tailwind is going to have a configuration file in our code base called Tailwind.

29
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,080
That configs will take a look at that at the end of this lesson.

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,230
And this is offering us an option as far as the starter configuration that we want so we can keep this

31
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,220
option of minimal.

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,360
So just press enter again.

33
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,000
And that of course is actually going to start the process of downloading the actual tailwind NPM package

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,590
as well as creating all of the files.

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,340
So as always, this might take a couple of seconds to run, but it's going to complete right here.

36
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,420
And with that, we can jump into the S code and see all the files that it has generated for us.

37
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:10,900
All right.

38
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,540
The first thing we're going to see is in our source directory in assets, we have a new Tailwind Access

39
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:16,870
file.

40
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,860
And as I open this file, you're going to see a slightly unconventional syntax.

41
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,010
It's just going to be at tailwind base components and utilities.

42
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,350
We'll never have to worry about this file again.

43
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,540
But basically what this is doing is using a special syntax to import all of tailwinds available to us

44
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,140
as classes.

45
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,210
So basically what we're doing here is all of those hundreds, if not thousands of utility classes that

46
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:42,280
we saw in the previous lesson, the classes that deal with margin and padding and font size and all

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,750
that stuff, this is basically loading them all in and they're going to be available to use automatically

48
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,670
simply with with this code right here.

49
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,050
All right, then the other file that's been affected here is Main Dogs.

50
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,450
And if I open that file here, you can see here in this file where we are bootstrapping the view application

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,860
as a reminder, here's where we are loading our starter app component and connecting it to that dev

52
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,700
with an idea of app.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
Here you can see on line three we are importing our new tail.

54
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,860
It's just as class and simply by doing that we are registering all of those CC utility classes to be

55
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,510
available to be used in our code base.

56
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,090
Notice here that we are using a relative import.

57
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,610
We can once again be consistent and use the app symbol.

58
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,500
So remember the assets directory is directly in the source directory which we can represent with the

59
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,100
app sign.

60
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,320
So right here I can do the app sign followed by the remaining code and that is going to be the exact

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,190
same file reference.

62
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,800
All right.

63
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,900
So that takes care of importing the styles.

64
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,490
And then, of course, this post post the SS config that she has filed, we will never have to worry

65
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,210
about it again.

66
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,890
But it's another kind of configuration file related to post the SS, which as I understand it, is its

67
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,650
own other separate SS translation pipeline.

68
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,280
Basically, we're not going to need to touch this file ever again, so don't worry about it.

69
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,050
The file that we will be concerned with throughout the course is going to be this one right here tailwind

70
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,860
dot config data.

71
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,130
Yes.

72
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,230
And here is where we are going to be able to extend and manipulate how Tailwind works.

73
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,940
So Tailwind gives us a lot of success classes out of the box, but it doesn't give us everything we

74
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,270
need.

75
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,980
And here's where we can, for example, add custom colors, custom fonts, things like that.

76
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,660
And you're going to see it's actually going to be incredible because Telemann is going to take the configuration

77
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,810
settings that we give it and it's going to generate automatic new CAC classes for us out of the box.

78
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:27,120
And that's one of the most incredible features that I was totally impressed by when I was building this

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,560
course out, was seeing how tell when, just took the configuration I gave it and then created these

80
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,170
helper classes on top of all the ones that it ships with.

81
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,700
So it makes it super simple to just add a whole bunch of class classes in line to an element and then

82
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,070
see the impact immediately with minimal effort.

83
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,670
All right.

84
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,120
So we're going to explore this file in greater depth throughout the course, but that's all there is

85
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,140
to cover in this lesson.

86
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,580
And I will see you in the next.
