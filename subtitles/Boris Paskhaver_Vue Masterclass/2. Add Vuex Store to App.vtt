00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.380
All right.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.200
So in this lesson, we're going to install the View X Library to our project, and we're going to do

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.220
so with The View.

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.650
Seelye One advantage of using these.

5
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.220
Seelye over just a plain NPM install is this.

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.040
Seelye is going to create some starter files for us with some small configuration, so it takes care

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.260
of a little bit more of the boilerplate code and spares us the need to write some of that extra stuff.

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.180
So in our primary project folder, make sure you shut down your view app.

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.590
You can do that by pressing control.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.160
C So shut everything down and then we're going to execute view add view X as a reminder.

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.430
View is our global installation of the view client and PM, and that program has an ad command that

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.450
allows us to add a package to our project and configure it and view is one of those options.

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.960
So view add, view X execute that.

14
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.270
That's going to go ahead and fetch the dependency and store it as well as generate some of those starter

15
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.690
files.

16
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.470
All right.

17
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.820
You can see it downloaded the package.

18
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.560
Now it's running the generators, which is going to go ahead and run those files for us.

19
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.590
And now we can transition to V code.

20
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.290
And take a look at what it has created for us.

21
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.850
I'm going to open my file, Explorer.

22
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.480
And there's two things that I want you to note in this lesson, actually.

23
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.880
Three.

24
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.670
Let's begin with packages that Jason.

25
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.890
I just want to show you in this lesson that we have added view as a dependency right here.

26
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.340
Right.

27
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.540
So that's one thing it did for us.

28
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.490
And then it created a new folder for us called Store.

29
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.190
And the way Store Works is very similar to how the router folder works.

30
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.160
In both of those folders, you're going to see an index file in the router index that yes file which

31
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.970
we explored earlier.

32
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.820
That's where we create the view router for our app and in our store index that just file here is where.

33
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.160
It has created the initial store for us.

34
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.380
We're going to talk more about this in an upcoming lesson.

35
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.990
And in fact, let me save this file so we have the prettier formatting.

36
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.740
So what this file is fundamentally doing is creating a store.

37
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.820
You can see here the the import of the create store function from view acts.

38
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.390
We don't have to worry about all of these configuration details just yet.

39
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.610
Just know that this is the file right now where we are creating and exporting a view to store and then

40
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.830
where we're actually sinking it, we're connecting it to our view app is in main.

41
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.400
Yes, this is also where we configured the router earlier in the course.

42
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.690
So in this file of main that yes, you can see we are importing that exported store from the store directory.

43
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.630
We can in fact make this an absolute import by changing this to an outside and as a reminder of how

44
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.860
things work in JavaScript.

45
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.660
If you have a directory like store with an index file, you don't need to write out slash index JavaScript

46
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.240
by default will look for an index such as file.

47
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.770
So that's what we're importing here.

48
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.770
We're importing the default export from this index jobs file from our store directory in our source

49
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.160
folder.

50
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.140
And then what we're doing right here is we're using the same use method we used earlier in the course

51
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.980
to add a router to develop the view collide collided the exact same approach here it gets back the app

52
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:15.530
object from the create app function and then it uses the use method to add that view store to the app

53
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.920
itself.

54
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.940
And the way this method works is it returns the app object itself.

55
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.280
That's what allows the sequence here to change on a bunch of method calls because the use method returns

56
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.440
the app object, which allows us to once again use use on it to configure the router as well.

57
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.000
So the order of these doesn't matter.

58
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.010
They're all just going to be additional configuration objects that we are adding to our Central View

59
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.400
app.

60
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.970
All right.

61
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.850
So this is just what the view.

62
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.040
So I added for us when we set up View X and then in the very next lesson, we can go ahead and start

63
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.170
playing around with this library.

64
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.460
Of course, what we'd like to do in the terminal, one final thing before we leave, of course, is

65
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.050
to get our app back up and running by running NPM, run, serve, and that's going to start the development

66
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.350
server.

67
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.560
You also, by the way, you should have your back and running another tab.

68
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.420
Here is where I'm running JSON server.

69
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.110
All right.

70
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.230
So we've installed the UX and I will see you in the next lesson.
