1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,520
Okay.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,580
So the first dependency that we will need to install will be a web browser.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,810
And in this course I will be using the Google Chrome browser by Google.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,620
This is still the most popular browser used in the world.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,560
I believe it has something like 65% market share.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,150
So it is a popular, modern, up to date choice with frequent updates.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,160
So I encourage you to use the Google Chrome browser for this course.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,000
However, you are more than welcome to go with another browser if you prefer, such as Firefox, Safari,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,080
Opera, etc..

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,240
All right, so if you want to install Chrome, you can head to Google.com, slash chrome in your browser

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,860
and then click download Chrome and that will give you an installer that is specific to your operating

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,680
system, whether it be Mac, Windows, Linux.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,320
Once you get that installer, of course you can follow the instructions in that installer file to walk

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,220
through the installation.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:50,550
All right.

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,680
You're obviously watching this course on a browser now, so I hope this is not your first time experiencing

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,340
a web browser.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,480
But of course, if you're unfamiliar with Chrome, this is a pretty good, solid, modern option.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,850
And this is what I'm going to be utilizing throughout the course.

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:03,540
All right.

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,280
So go ahead and install that if you want.

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,810
And I will see you in the next lesson.
