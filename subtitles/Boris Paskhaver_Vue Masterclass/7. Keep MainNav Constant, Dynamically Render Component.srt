1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,170
Okay.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:07,410
So as I mentioned in a previous lesson, we can combine the dynamic router view component along with

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,760
some static constant content that will appear from page to page.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,960
So a perfect, constant piece of content is our main NAV.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,050
The user is going to see that on any route, on any view.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,930
So what we want to do is always render the main NAV and then below it use our router view component

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:32,220
so it will dynamically render the custom view that that page requires, but below the consistent main

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:32,970
nav component.

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,330
So let's make that happen.

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,510
The first thing I need to do is I need to import my main nav component because it is not global.

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,950
So I'm going to import May NAV and we can find it in our components directory.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,430
In the navigation folder there is my main nav component.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,150
I need to register it with my components object.

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,870
So right here.

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,540
Main now.

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,340
And then what we can do is since our main nav will have the eventual links to navigate from page to

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,250
page, we can remove this code from the previous lesson.

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,660
We don't need these root or links.

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,580
Eventually we will add them to our May nav where we have that menu with all of the different pages.

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,410
But we don't need this code right here.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,870
And so what I can do is render main nav right here, like so self-closing.

22
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,600
And generally some people consider it a best practice to have a single route element within any given

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,320
view component.

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,310
So just to enclose these two in a single parent element, I'm going to have them wrapped within a div.

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,240
So like so.

26
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,700
All right.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,590
So with that, we are looking good.

28
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,650
We have our main NAV always being rendered no matter what, and then our router view immediately below.

29
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,990
The main nav will render the dynamic content.

30
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,400
So let's see it in the browser.

31
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,130
So navigating back here we go.

32
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:52,040
We start out with our job results page and here we have our main nav and there we have our subnet below

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,480
it and it is always being rendered.

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,730
And then here is where the router view component takes over and renders the dynamic result.

35
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:03,680
Let's see if I can show you that in our view Dev Tools app, it looks like I am getting pretty buggy

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,980
results throughout the entire page, or at least not refreshing.

37
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,610
But here we go.

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,140
So we have a router view component here and there is the job results view component that it renders.

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,160
And then I have no way anymore of navigating to my home roots.

40
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,910
I'm just going to go there manually in my browser tab and you'll notice right now.

41
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,630
That we are still rendering the May NAV, which we are always rendering in our main nav component.

42
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,940
And then immediately below that we are rendering our home view and that is exactly what we want.

43
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,130
Obviously in our home view we want to bring back the old code we had, which is the actual form and

44
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,750
the headline, and we will do that shortly.

45
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,640
But the key takeaway here is now we're able to navigate to different URLs and keep something that is

46
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,650
constant and also dynamically change, something that is different from view to view.

47
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,660
And that is all there is to cover in this lesson.

48
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,220
So I will see you in the next one.
