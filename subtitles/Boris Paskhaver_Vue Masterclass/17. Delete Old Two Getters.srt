1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,320
All right.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,770
So this is going to be a fun lesson.

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,600
We're going to delete a whole bunch of code.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,190
So here I am in my Getters Digest file and the old two getters that we were previously using to individually

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,220
filter either for selected organizations or for selected job types, are now no longer relevant.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,520
So this getter right here filter jobs by organizations.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,310
We're no longer using it anywhere in our code base and any of our components because we have replaced

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,280
this logic with this filter jobs getter down below, which itself is reliant on these two getters up

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,610
above.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,300
The same thing applies to this filter jobs by job types getter.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,510
We are no longer using it, so we are good to completely delete and remove these two getters from our

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,150
code base.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,620
All right.

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,490
So let's begin this process in order that the very top of the file.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,580
I'm going to delete the two constant imports.

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,040
So our names from the constants file.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,240
So let's delete filter jobs by organizations and filter jobs by job types.

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,530
Delete those two lines.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,400
That's going to highlight the exact to get our method methods that we want to delete.

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,230
So right here, I'm going to delete filter jobs by organizations like that.

21
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,920
And right here, I'm going to delete filter jobs by job types.

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,210
Let's go ahead and delete that.

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,170
Save that.

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,670
Maybe remove some of these line breaks and in case prettier does not save that.

25
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,390
All right.

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,360
Let's move on now to our constants.

27
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:29,190
Just file right here in constants just so we can remove the previous constants which are no longer being

28
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,150
used in the code base.

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,390
So right here, filter jobs by organizations, remove that constant right here, filter jobs by job

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,650
types, remove that.

31
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,190
All right.

32
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,820
And if I look in my code base for filter jobs by.

33
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,720
We can see the only place where we still have a reference to those former getters is in the test suite.

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,150
So you guessed it, we can go ahead and remove the tests for those former getters as well because they're

35
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,800
no longer part of our code base.

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,090
So right here, let's go to our getters that test, that just file right here this entire described

37
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,540
block for filtered jobs by organizations.

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,710
Scroll all the way down to here and press the delete key.

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,700
And there we go.

40
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:16,300
And as I scroll down here, here's one more test file or test specifically for filter jobs by job types.

41
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,820
This big described block that has a whole bunch of tests in it.

42
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:26,350
Delete that entire describe block here we go delete that save the file so prettier does its formatting

43
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,170
and now we have the tests for only the relevant getters.

44
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,680
We can see the results here on the left hand side have reduced to zero.

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,100
So there's no more reference to this former getter in our code base.

46
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,650
And if I go back to getters, just to show you, take a look at how elegant this Getters file is.

47
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,290
We have a bunch of really small getter methods.

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,670
They're each basically a couple of lines long and they work pretty well, pretty elegantly, pretty

49
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,610
simple to read, especially if a method is only three lines.

50
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,700
Another engineer can pretty easily read it and understand it.

51
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,570
And we have most or all of these getters fully tested.

52
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,310
So if an engineer wants to understand how they're meant to be used and how they work with The View XT

53
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,650
or state, we have a perfect test suite to show those developers, so perfect example of these getters.

54
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:14,110
Nice lightweight methods that talk to the View Store State and derive some kind of data from it.

55
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,530
So just to play it safe, let me once again run my entire test suite right here, NPM run test, colon

56
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,470
unit and hopefully everything should still pass.

57
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,780
But as always, it never hurts to find out.

58
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,980
So let me run everything.

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,370
Give it a second.

60
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,840
There goes running pretty quickly.

61
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:37,410
So the good news is all 20 of our test suites, that means our test files are passing and all 61 tests

62
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,120
within them are passing as well.

63
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,860
So everything is looking great.

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,100
But you might have noticed we have a little bit of code coverage missing.

65
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,380
So right here, it's telling us for the getters just file, we're missing a test that is covering lines

66
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,000
29 through 31.

67
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,120
So if I scroll down here, you'll notice that lines 29 through 31 are the filter jobs getter.

68
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,200
This one right here.

69
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,070
So we have written two tests for the two inclusion getters right here.

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,910
But we have not actually written any test for our filter jobs getter.

71
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,400
That is the last thing we need to add a test for in order to make our code coverage perfect at 100%.

72
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,570
So we're going to take care of the test for this getter in the very next lesson.
