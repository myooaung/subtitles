1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,200
All right.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,660
So now that we've configured some extra colors in our tail and config file, we can go ahead and apply

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,000
some quick CC styles to our main NAV.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,480
These next two lessons are going to be access focused, so I'm going to proceed rather quickly, but

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,280
I am going to talk a little bit about what each Tailwind class is doing.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,790
So I've opened up my main NAV component.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,710
We can go ahead and start building out some additional content in here.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,200
So I'm going to remove my main nav text and within my header I'm going to place a div.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,670
And we should automatically create the closing date.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,100
And by now we should hopefully know how to apply or tailwind styles.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,480
We can just provide a class to the DIV and use whatever talent styles we would like.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,970
So the first one I'm going to add is fixed.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,310
What this is going to do is apply a position fixed, which means this element, our Navarre, is going

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,980
to be positioned relative to our viewport, to our screen.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,160
Basically what this means is our neighbor is going to stay fixed.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,490
It's going to stay in the same position at all times, even as the rest of the page is scrolled.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,760
We want this kind of a fixed or kind of glued to the very top of our page in order to specify where

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,370
we want this actual element to be fixed on the page.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,200
We have to provide some additional classes.

20
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,130
We're going to provide a top dash zero and left dash zero.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,920
And this specifies that the fixed element R div will be placed zero pixels from the top of the screen

22
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,370
and zero pixels from the left of the screen, which basically means the top left corner.

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,150
We've kind of positioned this divide to be fixed, starting from the top left corner, and then it's

24
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,010
going to expand out and down as as much as the content inside it demands.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,340
All right.

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,250
So then I'm going to add a W full class, just like we saw in the previous header.

27
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,860
This just makes the with 100% of the parent.

28
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,050
I'm going to add a height of 64 pixels, which I can do with age 16.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,350
You can see here in my tailwind, IntelliSense, it is forearm or equivalently 64 pixels and then one

30
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,310
more class here, BG Dash.

31
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:57,720
Right.

32
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,720
This is automatically available in Tailwind.

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,760
Tailwind knows that white is a common color, so it has a helper class like Big White, which, as you

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,920
might guess, makes the background of this box white.

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,050
All right, so I'm going to save this.

36
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,820
There's not actually going to be any changes onto the page just yet that are going to be visible.

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,830
But when we go ahead and add some more content, which we'll do in the next lesson, we'll be able to

38
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,730
see it appear.

39
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,140
In fact, let me go ahead and look at my inspector right now, just so we can take a look at what it

40
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,620
looks like.

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,040
And we can see the div is actually on the page right here with the corresponding styles.

42
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,260
There it is highlighted in blue.

43
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,830
And we're going to continue building out more content within this.

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,400
Now, this is going to be the box.

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,350
It's going to house our navigation.

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,680
All right.

47
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,390
So I will see you in the next lesson.
