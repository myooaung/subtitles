00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,170
Okay.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:07,020
So before we continue chipping away at our new components, I would like to add a new box shadow to

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,700
our tailwind config file.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,410
So let me open up that file.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,350
And again, the reason we need to do this is so that tailwind will generate the right sized classes

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,660
for us to be able to use in our templates.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,750
So here we already have this box shadow section.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,360
We have a blue box shadow and now I'd like to add a new one and it will be a grey box shadow.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,760
So Tailwind is going to generate a bunch of classes that start with the word shadow, followed by whatever

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,800
prefix we give here.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,670
In this case, it's going to be shadow gray and we're going to provide a string argument here, and

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,350
it's going to be zero one pixel, three pixel zero.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,360
And then for the color, we're going to use the RG be a function in CSC.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,270
So that's red, green, blue, alpha, how much red, how much green, how much blue and then how much

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,020
opacity.

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,390
And again, I just got these values directly from the Google Careers website, so I'm just going to

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,220
invoke this function using parentheses.

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:11,100
And we want values of 60, comma, 64, comma, 67, and then for the it pass that we want point three.

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,960
All right, so save that and that will create the styles automatically.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,790
If you run into any problems, check your syntax and if everything looks correct and it's still not

21
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,420
working, I recommend shutting down the view server in your terminal.

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,580
You can press control C to do that and then starting everything up again with NPM run serv and that

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,160
will recalibrate by re importing the Italian config file into your project in case you have any issues.

24
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,810
So with that we have the box shadow we need and in the very next lesson we're going to start building

25
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,310
out the job listing.

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,130
That's going to represent one job on our site.
