1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,840
Okay.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,490
So just a quick note on the components that we're going to create over the course of the next couple

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,000
of lessons.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,760
If you look at the job results page on the official Google Careers website, you'll notice there's two

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,140
distinct sections.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,950
There is this sidebar here where we have the filters for the jobs such as the job, location, the degree,

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,030
the type, etc..

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,250
I'm going to call this section or this component.

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,910
The Job Filters Sidebar component.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,300
It is a sidebar.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,980
It is not part of the main content and its job is to provide filters.

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,440
So I will call it the job filters, sidebar.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,720
And then this main area right here with the gray background that has all of the results.

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,240
I'm going to call that the job listings component because it stores all of the job listings.

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:45,690
All right.

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,090
So we're going to start with those two top level components.

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,150
We're going to render both of them on our job results view.

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,500
And then later on, we're going to start building out smaller components for things like an individual

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,460
job listing itself.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,070
So let me navigate back to the code.

21
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,840
And here we have my file explorer.

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,430
We have our source directory components.

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,850
I'm going to create a new feature folder for our job results page or our job results feature to be more

24
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,360
specific.

25
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,910
So right here in components, let's create a new directory and I'll call it job results, and then I'm

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,330
going to start doing something new.

27
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,670
I'm going to start nesting additional folders within a feature folder.

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,870
There's nothing necessarily limiting us to just one top level folder inside components.

29
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,470
We can nest as much as we want for the purposes of organization.

30
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:36,710
So in job results, I'm going to create a new folder itself called Job Filters Sidebar.

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,660
And this will deal with any components that have to deal with that sidebar on the left for filtering

32
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,690
jobs immediately within that folder.

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,860
Job Filter Sidebar.

34
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,120
I will create my top level job filters, sidebar components.

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,390
So this is going to be the one that kicks everything off on the left hand side.

36
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:59,180
But any related components that deal with the sidebar, I will also place within this same directory.

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,410
So let's call this component job filter a sidebar dot view and let's write some code.

38
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,530
So right here, let me blow this up.

39
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,210
We'll start with our template.

40
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,510
We'll keep things super simple for now.

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,760
So I'll just add a div that says job filter sidebar.

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:21,230
And of course, let us define our script section and export default to a JavaScript object with a name

43
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,770
property.

44
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,010
And I will give that name property job, filter, sidebar.

45
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,560
Let's add a line break right here.

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,100
And this is a good place to leave this component in its starting state.

47
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,450
Okay.

48
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:38,420
So the next thing I'd like to do is to render this job filter sidebar component in our job results view.

49
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,210
So I'm going to head to our views folder right here.

50
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,510
As a reminder, these are our top level pages, if you will.

51
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,940
These are the top level parent components that are going to kick everything off on a given root or a

52
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,510
given path.

53
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,180
So we want to access our job results view.

54
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,510
This is our page that will render below the NAV whenever we navigate to slash job slash results.

55
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,110
And we obviously have some additional leftover code here that we can basically delete.

56
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,270
This was just experimenting with Vue router.

57
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,470
So I'm going to get rid of this right here.

58
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,590
I'm going to get rid of this method and then let's import our new component and render it within our

59
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,010
template.

60
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,590
So in my script section, I'm going to import my new job filters sidebar component that is going to

61
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:25,040
come from my source directory components, job results, job filter, sidebar.

62
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,160
And then the component self is called job filter sidebar as well.

63
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,850
We also need to register it in our components object right here.

64
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,120
So we'll create that and registered job filter sidebar.

65
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,340
At this point, we should use it somewhere in our template.

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,120
So right inside this div I'm going to render with a self-closing tag the job filters sidebar component.

67
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,150
Closed it off like so and that should be enough.

68
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,360
So if I navigate to my browser and head back to my actual app and we go to the jobs page right here

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,360
at slash job slash results here we have that view being rendered and that is rendering our job filters

70
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,510
sidebar component.

71
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,850
So everything is looking as we expect.

72
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,700
If I navigate to my view dev tools, we'll see.

73
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,850
Here's our job results view and here is that job filter sidebar.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,770
We do of course need to apply some styling later to make it occupy just a portion of the screen, but

75
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,030
that is a good place to start.

76
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,310
And in the very next lasting lesson, we can create the complimentary job listings component which will

77
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,420
render on the right side.

78
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,650
So I will see you there.
