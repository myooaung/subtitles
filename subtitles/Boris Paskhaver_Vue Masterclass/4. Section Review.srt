00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,150
All right, so let's do a quick section review will typically do this at the conclusion of every section.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,060
Just to summarize our learnings from the previous lessons.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,680
And this one was a pretty short section.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,640
So of course we know that we can write our styles inside a few components style tags and inside those

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,030
style tags we can write any kind of valid access that we want.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,310
We can target IDs, classes, age, HTML elements, etc., whatever you'd like.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,570
It's just plain access.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,240
But of course, the most important takeaway from these lessons is that we want to add the scoped keyword

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,500
right after style.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,020
And what scope does is it limits the styles to just the current component.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,890
So if we target, for example, access class, it's only going to apply the styles to that class in

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,670
that component.

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,740
If that CSC class is written in another component, the styles will not be applied.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,470
So the scoped keyword prevents access leakage, it prevents pollution across different files.

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:06,720
It makes it easier to define components as they should be defined as small, isolated, reusable, independent

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,640
pieces of our UI.

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,150
All right.

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,650
That's all there is to cover here.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll see you in the next lesson.
