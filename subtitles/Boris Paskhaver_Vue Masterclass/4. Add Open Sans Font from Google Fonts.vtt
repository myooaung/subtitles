1
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.200
All right.

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.040
The next step on our journey is to add a font to our project.

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.090
The goal here is to have a very similar look and feel to the actual Google Careers website.

4
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:20.890
Now, as it turns out, the Google Careers website uses a font called Google Sans, which is proprietary.

5
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.530
That means that it's owned and copyrighted, and we can't actually use it outright unless we ask for

6
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.150
permission or pay some kind of fee.

7
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.270
So instead of using Google Sans, we're going to use a popular alternative which is very similar and

8
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.040
look and feel called open sans.

9
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.450
All right.

10
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.220
And again, since we're not super concerned with having our CSB 100% pixel perfect and 100% identical

11
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.830
to the Google career site, this, I think, is a reasonable compromise.

12
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.810
That's the focus of this course, of course, will always be the view aspects of it.

13
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.300
But that said, I do want the site to actually look as close to the real thing as we can get reasonably.

14
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.250
So we're going to be incorporating this open sans font into our project so you can open up your web

15
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.970
browser and go to font start Google.com.

16
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.100
And here is sort of a search engine for fonts.

17
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.700
And Google makes it very easy to add any of the fonts here to our project.

18
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.140
And of course, I want to search for a font right here called Open Sans.

19
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.360
You're going to see the results here.

20
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.960
And we want this one by Steve Madison, Open Sans.

21
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.000
So go ahead and click on that file.

22
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.420
And it's going to bring you to this page where we see a bunch of styles or variants of this font in

23
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.150
various kind of font weights and like bold italic sizes, etc..

24
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.280
So as we navigate through this page, we're going to click this select the style button to select a

25
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.080
bunch of various variations of this open sans font that we're going to need.

26
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.320
So we can start with like 300 will select the style.

27
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.110
And as soon as I do that, we're going to get this pop up, appear on the right.

28
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.880
We'll come back to that in just a second.

29
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.610
We also want to include regular 400.

30
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.200
So once again, select the style.

31
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.770
We also want to include semi bold 600, select the style and then bold 700 as well.

32
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.850
Select the style.

33
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.700
And what Google is going to give to us on the very right hand side is this link text right here.

34
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.430
We can copy everything we see in this box right here.

35
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.440
Just copy it with command C or control C if you're on a Windows computer.

36
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.240
And then once you have copy of this blob over here, we can head back to our text editor.

37
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:32.140
So I'm going to bring up vs code and in here we can go to our index that h html file as a reminder.

38
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.160
It is going to be in the public folder in your project.

39
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.680
And if you want to open a file without going through the file explorer, you can press command P on

40
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.940
a mac or I believe, control panel windows to bring up the file search.

41
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.610
And from this input you can type whatever file name you want, find it in your project and open it very

42
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.000
easily.

43
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.270
All right.

44
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.180
That's a quick trip hat trick in the S code.

45
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.580
So right here, let's say right below this link right here on line seven.

46
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.830
I'm just going to paste that content that I copied over from the Google Fonts website.

47
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.950
You can see all it's really doing is providing just a reference to that fonts website and the Google

48
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.010
API that provides it and then specifying right here that we want the open sans font at these weights.

49
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.280
Right.

50
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.060
Google makes it super simple to configure again and we don't have to really worry about what this is

51
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.140
doing behind the scenes.

52
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.230
Technically, the important user facing feature here is that we're now enabling the use of open sans

53
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.540
in our view project that font.

54
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.990
All right.

55
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.100
And as soon as I save this file, I believe prettier wear will automatically format it for us.

56
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.820
Perfect.

57
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.230
That works great.

58
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.020
And there's one more thing we need to do to complete the configuration of the open sans font.

59
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.380
And we're going to need to configure it to work with Tailwind.

60
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.050
And in order to do that, I want to take you back to the Web browser, and I'm going to take you to

61
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.330
a GitHub page for a tailwind.

62
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.590
You don't have to follow me here.

63
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.020
Just keep your eyes peeled for what's on the screen.

64
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.000
So basically, this is the behind the scenes setup or configuration for Tailwind.

65
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.860
As I mentioned, Tailwind gives us access to a whole bunch of CSS classes and styles.

66
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.520
It also gives us access to some default fonts.

67
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.680
So reasonable assumptions for the font family that our HTML elements will have.

68
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.640
See, here in this configuration page, we have this big configuration object with the key of font family.

69
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.530
And then here we have a sans key.

70
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.960
Sans describes a type of font.

71
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:36.430
I think it means sans means without so sans means without curves, I believe is the distinguishing characteristic

72
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.930
of these fonts versus serif fonts, which do have kind of curvy edges.

73
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.090
It's I'm not really super well versed on typography, but there's basically different categories of

74
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.890
fonts and sans is one of them.

75
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.620
And Serif and mono are other types of fonts, and sans corresponds to an array of strings.

76
00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.460
And each one of these strings represents a available font to use in our project and the way it works.

77
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.530
Is whenever our browser renders fonts, it's going to look for the very first one, and if it has that

78
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.570
font available, it's going to use it.

79
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.990
And if it doesn't have it, it's going to fall back to the next font and the next font, etc..

80
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.200
So the reason we have a big list here is because we're accounting for all kinds of different operating

81
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.360
systems like Windows, Mac, Linux.

82
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.280
So at some point you're going to fall back to a reasonable font that should be available to render in

83
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.850
your browser.

84
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.690
So of course, what I want to do is to modify this array to include our open sans font, and I want

85
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.880
to include it at the very beginning here.

86
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.240
So our browser tries to render open sans font first, and now that we have it in our project, it's

87
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.070
going to render it successfully.

88
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.100
And then of course, if for some reason the Google font API is down and we don't have access to the

89
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.020
open sans font at that point, it's reasonable to fall back to our tailwind default fonts.

90
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.340
Right.

91
00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:02.080
So we need to configure this logic in our tailwind config file to kind of inject are open sans font

92
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.980
right here.

93
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.430
All right.

94
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:11.500
So I'm going to head back to my code editor and let's open up our tailwind DHCP config that JS file,

95
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.140
it's available at the very top level of our project.

96
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.220
All right.

97
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.840
And there's two things I need to do here.

98
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.490
The first is I need to import the default theme from Tailwind.

99
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.500
The default theme is basically a huge JavaScript configuration object.

100
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.500
It's what we just saw in that GitHub page in the browser.

101
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.200
It's a whole bunch of default starting values for various tailwind values such as the font.

102
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.640
So the very top of this file I can use the old school JavaScript import syntax.

103
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.150
I can say const equals default theme.

104
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.860
Equals.

105
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.090
And I'm going to use the built in node required keyword to import a file.

106
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:56.630
And we're actually going to import from the Tailwind CST Library, which has now been added as a NPM

107
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.190
dependency in our project.

108
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.740
So tailwinds test and then slash default theme.

109
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.600
So that's going to import that JavaScript object and assign it to a constant called default theme.

110
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.110
All right.

111
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:15.980
So here in this big object that we have in our tail and config file, this is where we can customize

112
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.240
that default theme.

113
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.940
And as a reminder, we don't just want to replace the existing fonts from default theme, we want to

114
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.160
add on.

115
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.100
On top of that, we want to add on Open Sans before all those fonts.

116
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.310
So right here in this extend object, right here under theme, we can do a line break and here we talk

117
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:40.370
about which tailwind properties we want to extend and what we want to extend here is font family.

118
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.800
So we're going to start with that key or that property.

119
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.130
We want to set that equal to a JavaScript configuration object, another JavaScript plain object.

120
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.960
All right, let's do another line break here.

121
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.060
And then, as you may recall from the GitHub page, there's actually different kinds of font families

122
00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.100
inside of Tailwind, and we want to target our sans family.

123
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.940
All right.

124
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.720
So in the GitHub page, we saw that this was equal to an array.

125
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.120
Right.

126
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.710
And whatever values we put in this array right here are going to be the font families that are available

127
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.230
for the SANS category in our project.

128
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:21.470
So for example, here I can put a string of open sans and make sure to spell it exactly like this.

129
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.250
Capital O, capital S with a space in between the two.

130
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:33.350
And so now we've enabled our project to use the open sans font that we have just gotten from the Google

131
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.040
Font API and made available in our index that edge HTML file.

132
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:43.610
But of course we're not done yet because if we do this, we're going to overwrite the tailwind default

133
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.030
sans fonts that we just saw that long array list of strings.

134
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:53.420
So what I want to do here is use the S6 array spread syntax that we introduced in the previous lesson

135
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:59.870
to take all of my other fonts which are represented as strings and I want to take them from default

136
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:06.230
theme and I want to spread them out here as well so they are available as backups if open sans fails

137
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.370
to load for whatever reason.

138
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:13.250
So right here I'll put a comma and then dot, dot, dot to spread an array out and my array of fonts

139
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:19.580
is going to be found at default theme which we've imported dot font, family, dot sans.

140
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.750
All right.

141
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.670
So this again is going to be a array of strings that we just saw in our browser.

142
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.970
We're going to spread out those values, but after our open sans font.

143
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.360
So we're going to use this by default.

144
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.920
And if it's not available, then we're going to loop through these fonts to find a backup.

145
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.500
And when I say we, what I really mean is our browser and tailwind and the CAS logic.

146
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:41.840
All right.

147
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.430
That's all there is to cover.

148
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.100
In this lesson, we installed our open sans font.

149
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.080
We configured it to work with Tailwind.

150
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.930
What I recommend you do now is in your terminal.

151
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:56.570
If you have your tailwind or your view app rather up and running, I recommend shutting it down.

152
00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:03.050
You can press command or control D to exit and then restart the app by running the command and PM run

153
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.710
serve again.

154
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:09.020
That just ensures that everything will build from scratch and that should incorporate our newly added

155
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:15.200
Tailwind library, our newly added font AH configurations and all of those things that we've been adding

156
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.760
over the course of the last couple of lessons.

157
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.590
So rerun, NPM, run, serve from the command line and in the very next lesson we're going to try out

158
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.990
our tailwind styles for the very first time.
