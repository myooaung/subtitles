1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,540
All right.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:07,000
In this lesson, we're going to add our menu items to our main nav components.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,960
So we're finally getting closer to fulfilling our original user story.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:18,070
So right below this hyperlink with our company name, I'm going to add an HTML nav element right here

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,110
and this code will automatically close it off and I want to immediately give it some tailwind.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,060
Utility classes right here.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:31,210
I'm going to give it the full class to apply a 100% height so it inherits the full height of its parent.

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,900
And then I'm going to create some space between this NAV and my company name by adding some margin to

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,160
the left of this NAV.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,560
As a reminder, we have our M classes for margin and if we only want margin on the left, well, we

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,480
have M L classes just for that.

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,790
So right now I'm looking for an L 12.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,980
And as we can see from the descriptive box on the right hand side, that's going to add three RAM or

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,360
equivalently 48 pixels of margin between my NAV and my company.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,280
So we're just going to buy ourselves a little bit of space here.

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:00,970
All right.

17
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,660
The next thing I want to add within my NAV is going to be an unordered list.

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,740
So a u l and then I'm going to apply some classes here too.

19
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,750
I'm going to make it a Flexbox just because I want to distribute the eventual menu items within this

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,350
Flexbox.

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,260
I want to give it the same H4 class for the height.

22
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,090
I want to explicitly state that I want zero padding and zero margin here.

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,990
The way I can do that is with the P zero class and the M zero class.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,600
P zero applies zero padding on all sides and zero applies zero margin on all sides.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,530
And then finally, to avoid the bullet points that come by default with the list items in a list to

26
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:44,800
avoid those to get rid of them, there is a class I can apply called List None, and as we can see,

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,880
what it adds is the access property list style type set to none.

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:56,710
That again gets rid of the bullet points that crop up by default next to the items within a unordered

29
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,010
list.

30
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,400
All right.

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,850
So all that's left to do now is to add our six menu items.

32
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,690
They're each going to be allies or list items within our list.

33
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:13,120
So right here, I'm going to add an ally and I'm going to give it a class of H full again.

34
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,770
And then inside there, I'm going to add the hyperlink that's going to take us to that eventual page.

35
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:24,460
Right now, we don't have any pages on our site, so I'm going to set the attribute equal to an empty

36
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,720
string to to go nowhere.

37
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,940
So right here I'm going to add a hyperlink, I'm going to set it's off attribute to an empty string.

38
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,500
And then I'm also going to make sure that I provide some classes here for styling.

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,940
So my hyperlink is going to have a class a flex to make it a flexbox.

40
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,130
I'm going to vertically align its elements or its content with item center.

41
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,780
I'm going to apply H H4 to make its height 100%.

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,370
And then what I'm going to do is apply a special padding class called p y.

43
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,200
The the Y in this class name refers to the y axis.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Earlier on we saw classes like p x over here which deal with padding on the left and right or the x

45
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:05,740
axis.

46
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,080
P y is the complementary set of classes in tailwind that deal with the y axis.

47
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:18,340
So for example, if I apply py2 point five here, we can see from the box we're going to add some padding

48
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,890
to the top and some padding to the bottom, but we're not going to add any padding on the left and right.

49
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,990
So in this case, it's going to be ten pixels.

50
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,380
All right.

51
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,250
And then, of course, we actually have to provide the text that the user is going to see.

52
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,990
And the very first menu item on the Google career site is teams.

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,340
So I'm going to put that right here.

54
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,450
All right, then I'm going to copy this list item below.

55
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,370
And it's basically going to be the same.

56
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,710
We're going to change this text to location or actually location that sounds a little bit more appropriate.

57
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,310
Appropriate.

58
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,710
But then we're going to add one more thing.

59
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:57,080
I want to create some additional margin between this list item and this list item.

60
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,540
This list item doesn't need any additional margin to the left of it because the NAV is going to create

61
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,660
the spacing between it and the name of the company.

62
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:11,360
But if we do not add additional margin to this list item, it's going to scrunch up and right next to

63
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,080
this ally.

64
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,420
So I want to create some spacing between my allies, but only starting from the second one.

65
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,610
So I'm going to add amount here for margin left and I'm going to choose the HTML nine class, which

66
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,760
is 36 pixels of spacing or margin.

67
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,860
And this is what we're going to copy for the remaining list items because for every subsequent list

68
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,010
item, we want to add the same amount of margin to its left.

69
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:40,100
So in summary, we're adding left margin to every list item besides the first one because it already

70
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,470
has some spacing from the now.

71
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:42,920
Right.

72
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,540
So I'm going to copy this one.

73
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,140
And pace it four more times.

74
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,890
One, two, three, four.

75
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,150
Right here.

76
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,610
I'm going to provide my next menu item text, which is going to be life at Baba Corp..

77
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,790
I'm going to pretend pretend that my company is called Bobo Corp..

78
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,390
You can name your company, your fictional jobs company, whatever you want.

79
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,980
And you'll notice when I say this, prettier is actually going to give us what I think is a slightly

80
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,150
ugly way of representing this text within an anchor tag.

81
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,560
But for now, I'll forgive it.

82
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,360
And then moving on, let's change this locations to how we hire.

83
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,210
And then the next one is going to be students and our final one is going to be jobs.

84
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,010
So we have six menu items.

85
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,800
Let me save the content in my component and head back to my browser so we can observe the changes and

86
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,720
ooh, we are getting somewhere.

87
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,800
This looks pretty good.

88
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,890
We have our company name of bubble careers and we have these six hyperlinks which represent our menu

89
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,690
items from teams to jobs.

90
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:48,540
And you'll notice how we have that margin to the left of each of the menu items starting from the second,

91
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,900
and we don't need it to the left of the first one.

92
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,850
The only reason I emphasize this right now is because we're actually going to come back to this margin

93
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,540
a little bit later.

94
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,870
We're going to see how Tailwind helps us solve a problem where our first element, our first child element,

95
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,560
has a distinctly different style from every other child element.

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,060
We'll talk more about that in a couple of lessons.

97
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,180
But for now, just notice the differences in margin between the elements versus the first list item

98
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,740
and the company name.

99
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,100
All right.

100
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,140
But so far, this is looking pretty good.

101
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,790
So we are going to stick with this.

102
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,230
And before we complete our user story, though, we're going to see how you can help us in situations

103
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,650
like this.

104
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:31,380
Whenever we have that kind of redundancy of having to copy and paste similar HTML elements, we're going

105
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,790
to take a look in the next lesson.

106
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,050
Add a view directive that could help simplify all the code that we just wrote.

107
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,220
So I will see you there.
