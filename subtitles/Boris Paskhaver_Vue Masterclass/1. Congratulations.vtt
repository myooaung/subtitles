Okay.

So congratulations on making it to the end of the course and to the end of our job search project.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.720
I'm really proud of what we built here together.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.380
This course was a lot of fun to make and our job search app feels like a great modern front end project.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.780
We used a lot of fun technologies.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.620
We used view view ax view router view, test, utils, typescript, just tailwinds, RSS and more.

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.600
And there's so many different places that you can go from here knowing all the knowledge that you now

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.080
possess.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.510
You can explore various view component libraries, you can explore various view testing, libraries,

10
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.060
etc. There's a whole bunch of different parts of the view ecosystem that are still yet to be explored

11
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.910
by you, and I'm really excited for you as you continue on your view journey, so I hope you've learned

12
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.650
a ton and enjoyed your time here.
