1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,370
Okay.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:06,830
So in this lesson, we're going to introduce a super cool view feature called Slots.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,470
It's the focus of the section and it's what's going to allow us to make our accordion component super

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,160
reusable.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:22,100
What slots allow us to do is to have a parent component specify a dynamic injectable slice of HTML that

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,010
can be rendered inside a given component.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,300
So slots are optimal when we need to inject different content in between consistent other content.

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:32,990
Okay.

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,770
That's kind of vague and vacuous.

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,100
Let me give you a better use case right in front of us.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,530
You'll notice here that we currently have the hardcoded text child right here.

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,180
And ultimately what we want to do in an accordion component is render some checkboxes, right?

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,280
CheckBoxes, for example, for organizations that the user can filter by.

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,860
But in another accordion component, later on down the road, we may want to have totally different

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,640
checkboxes.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,130
For example, we may want to have an accordion for job types, in which case we're still going to have

17
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,480
checkboxes, but they're going to have different text.

18
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,220
They're going to have job types like full time or part time.

19
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:16,370
So what we really want to do is to make this content in between the div customizable.

20
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:22,210
This is what we want to be able to have feature custom content.

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,470
We want to inject something dynamic here.

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,970
Why do we want to do that?

23
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,110
Well, the reason we want to do that is then we can reuse this component.

24
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,680
We can have the accordion take care of the open, closed logic, which remains the same no matter where

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,820
we want to use the accordion.

26
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,560
We want to keep this logic.

27
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,740
We always want to have the varying care symbol.

28
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,040
Right.

29
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,400
We always want to have the idea of expandability and collapse ability.

30
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,660
That's something that we want to keep constant and reusable and not have to duplicate.

31
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,470
However, we want to be able to have something custom right here.

32
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,250
We want to vary the child content that we are conditionally displaying.

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,410
We do not want to copy this logic to its own component because this is perfectly reusable.

34
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:10,040
We just need to customize one small sliver of this component and it is what we inject right here.

35
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,130
So this content in view is called slots.

36
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,440
A slot you can think of almost like the word slot in real life.

37
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,610
A slot is kind of something you fill up or fill in, right?

38
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,280
If you think about an open slot on a team, like a sports team, that refers to something that is waiting

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,970
to be filled.

40
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,300
Right.

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,620
It's the same idea.

42
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,100
We can view this as what we call a slot in view.

43
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,090
It is a place in our component where we can customize the content that we want to provide or inject

44
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,210
or slot into this point right here.

45
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,270
The rest of the component will stay the same, but we're going to customize what we put in here and

46
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,310
where we're actually going to customize it is in the parent component that renders the accordion.

47
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,230
When we render the accordion.

48
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:00,830
The parent component can say, Please provide something here that I want you to put into this slot.

49
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,810
It can be an H1, it can be an H2, it can be a header, it can be a table.

50
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,400
It can be a bunch of checkboxes.

51
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,050
It could be another set of checkboxes.

52
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,480
But anywhere where we render accordion, we're going to be able to customize this little section right

53
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:14,780
here.

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,710
Okay.

55
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,710
Let me show you how the syntax is going to work.

56
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,620
It's going to be pretty simple, and I promise it's going to make more sense when we see it in action.

57
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:28,700
What I'm going to do is I'm going to use a special available view global component called Slot, and

58
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,510
I'm going to render it with both an opening and closing component tag.

59
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,310
So right here slot like so.

60
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:35,480
All right.

61
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,750
So what this says is whenever a parent component renders an accordion, it can provide slot content.

62
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,820
An accordion will know to place that slot content right here in this component.

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,130
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to open up my job filter sidebar.

64
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,980
In fact, let me drag according to the right so I can show you how the logic will flow out.

65
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,620
Here we have an accordion.

66
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,730
It's currently a self-closing component.

67
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,810
I'm going to expand it to be an opening and a closing accordion component.

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,090
Same syntax by now, but here's how it's going to work.

69
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:15,470
I'm going to do a line break and anything that I put inside this accordion component right here as a

70
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,940
child, if you will know, belongs to this slot right here.

71
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:27,890
So, for example, if I put an H1 right here of Hello View will know to take this H1 right here and

72
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,620
inject it right here.

73
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,420
It's basically going to do this behind the seats, right?

74
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,470
The beautiful part about this design is if we want something totally different, if we want an H3 with

75
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:44,300
the text goodbye, then you will now take this thing and slotted into this spot.

76
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,810
Right here we are customizing this element right here while keeping the rest of the component the same.

77
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,760
We have gotten this perfect balance between reusability and customization, right?

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,340
We are we are reusing this collapse ability, but customizing what it actually hides and shows.

79
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,250
Okay.

80
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,000
So with that said, we have to make sure we have slot right here.

81
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,140
And for example, right here, I can simply write a message like, hello.

82
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,750
Custom content must save this and if we go back to our browser.

83
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,610
We're going to see now that when we expand this, we're going to see that element right here.

84
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,380
Hello, custom content.

85
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,630
So we have customized what is that hidden content that we are seeing when we expand the accordion,

86
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,550
when we just show you side by side, what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy and paste this accordion

87
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,840
component immediately below.

88
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,770
And here I'm going to do something different because we can talk.

89
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,170
We can totally have whatever we want and here we can have any text, any ailment, etc..

90
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,050
So I'm just going to put something here like an H2 and it's going to say totally different content for

91
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,100
my second accordion.

92
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,250
And when I go back to my browser, you'll notice we're going to have to accordion components.

93
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,670
And when we expand the first one, we're going to see our first bit of slotted content.

94
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,810
Hello, custom content.

95
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,160
And when I open up my second accordion, we're going to see that totally different content coming from

96
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,790
the H2.

97
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,190
We can customize just this part that is the beautiful part of slots.

98
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,790
All right.

99
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,860
So to summarize, what is a slot?

100
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,050
At the end of the day, it's just an available view global component that we put in the child and we

101
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:23,590
put it in the child in the template where we want to dynamically inject that custom content.

102
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,230
Now, that custom content will come from the parent that is going to be rendering that component with

103
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,680
a slot.

104
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,560
And the way that parent specifies what to plug into that slot, what to plug into that whole is by simply

105
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,920
writing that content in between the opening and closing component tag of that component that has an

106
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,640
available slot.

107
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,310
By the way, if we don't provide any content, if we do something like this, then all viewers going

108
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,590
to do is simply put, nothing right here.

109
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,130
Right?

110
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:51,870
So let me show you this.

111
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,640
I save that and go back to our browser and expand this.

112
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,510
We're going to see there's actually no content in there, which sort of makes sense because what Vue

113
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,320
says is it says, Hey, have given me nothing to put in the slot, so I'm literally going to put nothing

114
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,800
in that slot.

115
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,560
So basically evaluates to this behind the scenes, right?

116
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,300
We still have our is open div, but we don't actually have any dynamic slot content to put in there.

117
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:10,840
All right.

118
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,520
So there's no danger if we accidentally leave out chunk content, but if we do include child content,

119
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,780
we're going to inject it in that slot.

120
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,160
All right.

121
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,760
So pretty simple concept, but I think pretty difficult to describe in words.

122
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,190
Hopefully that makes sense.

123
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:23,530
All right.

124
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,810
So before we close this lesson off, let me just delete the second accordion and then we're going to

125
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,780
continue learning more about slots in the very upcoming lessons.
