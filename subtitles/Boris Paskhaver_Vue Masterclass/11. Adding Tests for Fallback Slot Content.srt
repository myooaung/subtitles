1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,110
Okay.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,470
So in the previous lesson, we added some default content to our slot in our accordion component.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,740
Let's now take a look at how we can test this functionality.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,740
So here in my accordion test file, I'm going to create another described block nested within my first

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,170
one to provide some additional context.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,110
And this scenario under which I'm testing is this one.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:30,210
When we do not provide custom child content, what do we want to verify?

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,290
We want to verify that it renders default content.

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,590
And I'm going to provide a just arrow function here, and I am going to make this an async function

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,030
because I think for the most part, we can copy most of the test above.

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,320
So I'm going to scroll up and I'm going to copy everything here.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,800
The entire test, in fact, and pace the blow.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,390
Of course, we are going to make some significant changes.

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,810
So the first thing is we obviously do not want to provide a default slot value right here because we

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,460
want to see how the component will render when we do not specify the slot content.

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,380
So in my configuration object right here, I'm just going to remove the slots property entirely.

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,330
And similarly, we do not care about testing for minus the child right here.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,940
What we can do is simply click on the clickable area and make sure that it has the text that we expect

19
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,320
and the text that we expect is not going to be anywhere in this test.

20
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,850
It's going to be our eventual implementation right here.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,960
So I'm simply going to look for the text of, Woops, somebody forgot to populate me.

22
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,500
All right.

23
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,920
So I'm going to click that.

24
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,680
Save that.

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,040
Let's see what happens when we run it.

26
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,270
And we have a passing test week.

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,520
So that is how we can test for a default slot.

28
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:50,590
We simply do not provide that slot in our configuration object and verify that the component renders

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,870
whatever we want it to eventually render.
