1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,050
All right.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,710
So we ended the previous lesson with a little warning from S lint.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,800
And if I hover my mouse over it, it's going to tell us unexpected v bind before the colon.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,580
So let me first tell you that what we have here on screen is totally valid.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,300
It is perfectly normal, healthy view syntax.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,850
And I think it's best to introduce this syntax first because there's a little bit more explicit and

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,480
verbose.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,140
We are binding some kind of data to our h of attribute.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,110
With that said, View offers us a shortcut that we can use instead of the full V bind syntax.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,790
And the shortcut is pretty simple.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,610
All we do is remove v bind.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,200
So I'm going to remove this and I'm still going to keep the colon.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,540
All right.

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,260
So I'm going to save it.

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,760
And this is our final product.

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:52,950
So whenever we see a colon before an attribute in view, what that means is we are binding that value

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,930
of that attribute dynamically to something on our data.

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,480
It's the exact same idea.

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,080
It has an alternative syntax to what we just had with V bind.

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,420
It's actually the same directive under the hood.

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,710
It's just a little bit of a syntactical shortcut.

22
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,920
The View Style Guide, which is the kind of declarative guide on the Internet from the View Development

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,320
Team on how you should style your components.

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,750
That style guide recommends this approach because it is a little bit cleaner, although I will say the

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,870
most important aspect of your code base is consistency.

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,450
So if you prefer the V bind syntax, that's totally fine.

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,870
Sometimes I like more explicit things too, because they better communicate what the value is and somebody

28
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,270
can have a much easier time googling the bind and finding what it is compared to googling view.

29
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,140
Colon Right.

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,070
So I'm not necessarily going to say that this is a better approach, but we're going to be sticking

31
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,520
with this approach because s lint recommends it and so does the View Style guide.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,710
But this is the exact same thing.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,040
All right.

34
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,190
So either you bind or a colon before the attribute that you want to bind or connect to some piece of

35
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,640
your data.

36
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,470
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

37
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,940
So I will see you in the next one.
