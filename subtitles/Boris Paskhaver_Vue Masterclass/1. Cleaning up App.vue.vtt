Welcome to the next section of the course.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.220
In this section we're going to start familiarizing ourselves with the View Test Utils library for testing

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.330
our view components.

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.580
We're going to get to that in the very next lesson.

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.370
But in this one, I want to do some quick cleanup.

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.270
So open up your main nav dot view component file.

7
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.140
As a reminder, you can find it in the CRC components directory.

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.680
And here I want to delete a few lines before we move forward.

9
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.460
Number one, we can go ahead and remove this H2 right here where we have developed by followed by our

10
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.830
interpolation of those author properties.

11
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.840
We can remove that H2 entirely.

12
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.020
And then since we no longer need those author properties, we can navigate down to our data method and

13
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.360
its return object and we can remove the author property, the author object from here as well.

14
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.630
So I'm going to delete that, save this file and this code will remove some line thrust or rather prettier

15
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.870
will.

16
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.120
And so if I go back to my browser to take a look, we should just have our main NAV with our company

17
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.540
title.

18
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.190
For me, that is about careers.

19
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.880
All right.

20
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.590
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

21
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.730
In the very next one, we're going to start writing our first test for our view components.
