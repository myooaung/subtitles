1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,800
In this lesson, I want us to configure our easy limit settings as a reminder.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,600
Easy lint is our litter.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,660
It's a piece of software that's going to look at our code, both the JavaScript code and the view code,

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,790
and it's going to look for violations.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:22,150
And violations could mean anything from errors or even things like not following best practices when

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,300
it comes to efficient code, optimal code, etc..

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,090
So to summarize, yes, lint is going to make our code better by identifying areas of improvement in

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:36,700
our existing code and the settings for Eastland are found in this file at the top level of our job search

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,120
project.

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,370
It's this one right here, Iceland RC Dot Jess So go ahead and open this file up.

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,350
And the first thing I want you to focus your eyes on is this extends key right here.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,810
It's set to an array of strings and each one of these strings specifies a plug in.

13
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,930
A plug in is just a collection of rules, and there are various rules depending on the technologies

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,740
that we work with.

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:06,040
So, for example, this first plug in Vue three essential is rules specifically related to view code.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,060
In comparison, this second one in line eight is land recommended is general s lint rules for JavaScript.

17
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,920
Remember, these are different pieces of technology, so there are different rule sets for each and

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,370
it is in this extends array that we specify which combinations of rules we want s lint to be following

19
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,170
when it analyzes our code.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,610
So here's what I want to show you, and you do not need to follow along with this, but I'm going to

21
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:36,670
open up a sample view file in our app and it's called Hello World and I'm going to drag it over here

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,270
to the right.

23
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,280
And you do not need to understand everything that's going on in this file because we have not talked

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,750
about any view concept yet.

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,800
That's totally fine.

26
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,330
But I just want to show you an example and it will demonstrate how s lint works for us.

27
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,580
So you'll notice this first rule right here, View three Essential is currently in place and there are

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,800
no violations right here in this file.

29
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:02,200
What I want to do here is I want to change this to be another collection of rules that's going to be

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,340
more stricter.

31
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,560
So this is something you should follow along with.

32
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,470
Go ahead and open up your Iceland file and here change this from Vue three essential to view, three

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,890
recommended and that's how you spell recommended.

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,800
And what this rule set is going to do is it's going to look not just for the essential view violations,

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,500
which means the things that are most likely to be errors.

36
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,200
It's also going to look for things that are optimizations or best practices in the view community.

37
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,990
So the reason I want to go with the more stricter set of rules here is because I want these rules to

38
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:40,360
pop up as we build our code throughout the course so we can talk about why we have these best practices,

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,270
what problems or optimizations they're designed to solve.

40
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:49,240
So while the default configuration that usually gave us is, okay, I want to go with the harder one.

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,170
I want to go with the stricter one because it's going to offer us more opportunities to learn.

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,910
So let me show you this as an example.

43
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,380
I'm going to save this file and immediately Iceland is going to rerun and analyze our code.

44
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,840
And I want you to focus your eyes on this section in this file right here I'm going to save right now.

45
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,520
And you'll notice in just a second we're going to see this orange squiggly up here in this component

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,500
or in this file on the right hand side.

47
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,060
And if I hover my mouse over this, you're going to see the Iceland violation pop up.

48
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,930
It says Prop MSD requires default value to be set.

49
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,390
Now, right now, it's not important to understand exactly what this violation is or how we fix it.

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,940
The point that I'm trying to make is that this collection of rules in the recommended plugin is a lot

51
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,630
more stricter.

52
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,750
And that's why this rule appeared right here while it formally did not when we had just the essential

53
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,170
plugin.

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,090
So that's the only change we made here.

55
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,470
We've enabled more stricter settings so that we can talk through these violations, how to fix them

56
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,150
and why they matter throughout the course.

57
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,370
So this is the first change that I'd like you to make.

58
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,520
The second change is going to be in this file section right here.

59
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,710
And in order to provide the content right here, what I'd like you to do is to open up your just config

60
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,750
file that we modified a lesson or two ago.

61
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:04,030
So I'm going to use command P on a mac and I believe on windows it's going to be control P and you can

62
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,040
look for that just configs file.

63
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,670
It's found at the top level of your project and I want you to copy this array of two strings that belongs

64
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,840
to the test match key.

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,330
So just going to copy this array right here and right here in the S linked file in the override section,

66
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,780
you'll notice this object has a files properties set to an array.

67
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,730
I want you to take that array and I want you to replace it with the one that you just copied from the

68
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,540
just config file.

69
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,090
So I'm going to do that right here and that's what we want to do.

70
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,600
All right.

71
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,940
So once again, what this is going to do, it's going to tell us lint what our test files look like.

72
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:43,990
It's going to tell this lint that our test files can have either a dot just extension or a dot test,

73
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,040
that test extension.

74
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,870
And that's an important point worth noting here, and that is that Iceland is going to look for violations,

75
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,910
not just in our source code, in our implementation code, but also in our test files.

76
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,120
Right.

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,980
Because a violation is a violation no matter where we write it, if it is our code and we could write

78
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,070
it.

79
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,020
Yes, land should be watching out for it and making its recommendations.

80
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,760
I also want to show you that at this point Premier should be fully enabled and I can show that to you

81
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,710
in our excellent our successful.

82
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,020
So what I can do here, by the way, as an example, is I'm just going to move line eight right here

83
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,400
to the previous line.

84
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,470
And you can see it kind of gives this awkward syntax where we have two strings on one line and then

85
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,610
one string on the next.

86
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,780
That kind of becomes harder to read.

87
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,300
And as soon as I save this file, prettier will click in and it's going to reform at the file.

88
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,000
And as soon as I save, you can see pretty first preference is to have each array element on a single

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
line, or at least when the array is super long.

90
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,410
That's its preference and you'll see they will automatically reformat even this s land configuration

91
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,270
file and it's going to do the exact same thing for our regular JavaScript on our view code, our test

92
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,550
code, etc. and that is the beautiful part of Prettier.

93
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,100
We only configure it once and then it starts using its best practices to format our code in a really

94
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,540
beautiful manner.

95
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,110
All right.

96
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,390
So that's the only two things we need to do in this file.

97
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,530
Make sure you change this from Vue three essential to view three recommended, and make sure that the

98
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,630
files array is set to the exact same array of strings as in our just config file.

99
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,260
All right.

100
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,760
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

101
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,410
So I will see you in the next one.
