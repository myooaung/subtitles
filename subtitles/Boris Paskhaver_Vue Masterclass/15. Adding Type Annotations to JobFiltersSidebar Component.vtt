00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.080
Okay.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.430
So the next component we're going to update will be our job filter, sidebar component.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.790
It actually looks like we forgot to come up with a corresponding test suite for this component, so

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.500
maybe we'll add that in the next lesson.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.570
But for now, let's open up job filter, sidebar, dot view and repeat the usual steps.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.060
So right here I'm going to add a lang set.

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.590
That's right here.

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.730
I'm going to import defined component and that is going to come from view.

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.660
And right here, I'm going to wrap my object and pass it inside as the first argument to the defined

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.230
component.

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.720
Function.

12
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.750
And it looks like if I use unique job types we can see it as indeed a computed graph or in other words,

13
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.090
a view reactive object around a set of strings.

14
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.670
And the same thing applies to unique organizations.

15
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.860
It doesn't look like there are any errors here.

16
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.790
There might be a couple errors if you are referencing view components without the DOT view extension.

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.570
So in case you see that, make sure to update that here.

18
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.760
In our case, it looks like everything is looking good.

19
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.650
So we're going to close the lesson off here.

20
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.680
And in the very next lesson, we will add a test suite for this component.
