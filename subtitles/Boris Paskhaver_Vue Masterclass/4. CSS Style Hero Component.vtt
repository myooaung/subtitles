00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.100
In this lesson will apply some initial styles to our hero component.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.390
So let's get right to it.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.580
I want to apply some classes to this section element in my hero dot view file.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.670
And these classes are all going to come from Tailwind.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.750
So I want to begin with Flex, which will make this a Flexbox.

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.130
I then want to set the orientation or the direction of the Flexbox.

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.630
In other words, how the elements will distribute themselves within the Flexbox.

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.490
So I want to do flex dash.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.110
Karl that will make the flex direction attribute set to column, which means the contents of my hero

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.790
will flow from top to bottom rather than from left to right, so vertically instead of horizontally.

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.800
I also want to apply a dash screen.

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.310
This may be a new tailwind since class.

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:54.030
As you can see on the right, it sets the high to 100, the H and that the H stands for viewport height.

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.420
The viewport is what the user sees in the browser, the screen.

15
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.170
So we're making this element 100% of the viewport height.

16
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.570
Then the only thing I want to do after that is to add some padding, and I want to add a different amount

17
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.760
of padding to both my top and the bottom.

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.000
On the top I want to apply 40 pixels of padding and I can do that with the PPT classes that is short

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.990
for padding top.

20
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.330
And if I do, for example, t ten, that is going to be 40 pixels of padding on the top.

21
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.020
On the bottom, I'm going to apply a class called PB 20.

22
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.120
That's a lot more padding on the bottom and that's going to be equal to 80 pixels of padding on the

23
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.510
bottom.

24
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.950
Okay, one more success class, and this one is purely optional.

25
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.480
We're actually going to remove it later.

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.250
But I like to have a sense of what my box looks like within the browser.

27
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.030
And one way that we can easily distinguish this hero box or this hero component is by giving it a background

28
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.330
color, a background color that, again, we will eventually remove.

29
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.480
So I'm just going to pick an arbitrary tailwind CSS background class.

30
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.580
I'm going to do BG and let's do yellow 200.

31
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.920
Again, this is not for stylistic reasons.

32
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.060
This is just so we can see this section element within our browser.

33
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.250
So if I navigate back to Chrome, there we go.

34
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.110
This is what our page is looking like currently, and it's a good place to start out.

35
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.580
Well, notice we have our padding on top ever padding on bottom.

36
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.120
In fact, it looks like we are covering up more than the entire screen because we are extending past

37
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.330
the range of the height of this May now.

38
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.760
But for now, this looks good enough to me.

39
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.280
So we'll continue with this in the very next lesson.
