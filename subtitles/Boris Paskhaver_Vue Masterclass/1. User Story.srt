1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,260
Okay.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,880
So welcome to the next section of the course and to a brand new user story.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,980
I have a good feeling that this is probably going to be the last user feature we build for the app.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,070
I think we've had a lot of practice with view and view and right now we sort of reached the point of

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,850
diminishing returns where there's not as many new concepts being introduced.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,890
And I think that you've had a good exposure to the core concepts around view, view, view router.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,640
So this will sort of be our last hurrah or last user story to implement.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,400
There are going to be of course, some new features here and there.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,870
But at this point I feel comfortable that if you've made it this far and you understand what's going

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,030
on, I think you would feel comfortable tackling a new view feature by yourself or supplementing your

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,470
knowledge with something else that is in either the View Library or the View Library, etc..

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,570
Of course, there's always something more to learn about testing, about components, about this library

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,080
or that.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,190
But I think the heart of view has been captured and we've had a lot of practice with it.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,390
So this will be kind of our last user feature and it should be a good one.

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,210
There's going to be some familiar stuff and some new stuff as well.

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,240
And as always, of course, a lot of testing to go along with that.

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,170
So here it is.

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,600
As a user, I'd like to search for a technical skill that I know so that I can find jobs that fit my

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,470
specialization.

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,720
So this feature is going to be similar to our past ones in the sense that we're going to use something

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,660
that the user does to filter the jobs on the right hand side.

23
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,400
What's going to make this feature a little bit distinct is we're now not going to be using checkboxes,

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,320
we're going to be using a text input.

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,390
So directly below that clear filters button that we fixed up in the previous section, we're going to

26
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,030
add a text input where the user can enter a skill.

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,030
And most of our fake jobs revolve around various front end technologies like Vue and Angular and React.

28
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,280
So the idea here is that the user will be able to type a technology like view or React or Angular,

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,480
and we want to show the jobs on the right hand side that fit that search criteria.

30
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,800
Now, we're going to keep things super simple, so we're only going to allow them to enter one term

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,460
at a time.

32
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:02,160
And we're going to search for that term in the name of the job, because remember, our job has a name

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,850
or a title.

34
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,600
It also has all the bullet points and we can get really granular and search in those.

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,730
For now, we're simply going to search for the user search term in the title to keep things as simple

36
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,390
as possible.

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,880
So we want this filtering feature, of course, to co-exist alongside all of our other filtering features

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,330
as well.

39
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,150
So the user should be able to select, for example, a job type, a degree type and organization and

40
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,330
then search for view as their search term and have jobs pop up on the right that fulfill all of those

41
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,900
criteria.

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,470
All right.

43
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,180
So this will be our final user story.

44
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,090
Congratulations on making it to the final kind of section or a final project section, at least of this

45
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,410
course, because I may add some later lessons on various view concepts not directly related to this

46
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,820
project, but congratulations on reaching this last section for a user feature.

47
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,750
And as always, let's, let's have a lot of fun together and let's learn more about Vue.

48
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,160
So we will start building out this feature in the very next lesson, and I will see you there.
