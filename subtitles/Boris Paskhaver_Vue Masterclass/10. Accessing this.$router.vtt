00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.320
All right.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:07.800
So as I mentioned in the previous lesson, the complimentary property that Vue router adds to every

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.330
component is a router.

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.050
So right here we don't have to change anything in the results view.

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.350
We can just change this property to a router with an R at the end.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.500
Save this and take a look at this in our browser.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.910
And what this actually is, is the router object that we are exporting from our router index file.

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.480
So the reason why Vue makes it available here in every component is to spare us the monotony of having

9
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.510
to import the router every time we need to use it.

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.310
So it's available in every component.

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.170
We just access it via the this keyword and then accessing that dollar sign router property.

12
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.730
So if I navigate back to my browser and take a look at my console.log on my job results page, here

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.450
is that object.

14
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.470
And if I expand it, we're going to see a whole bunch of methods.

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.770
So what is the difference between root and root term, the root property and that corresponding object

16
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.380
stores information about where you are?

17
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.180
What page are you on?

18
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.530
What are the query params?

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.030
What is the name of that root?

20
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.040
In comparison, the router is the actual tool that allows you to navigate a user elsewhere in the app.

21
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.820
So this is where we can actually take some kind of action with root.

22
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.730
It's really meant to be used almost like a read only object.

23
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.750
You're only supposed to get information from it in order to do something in your component.

24
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.930
Here, we can invoke methods on this router object in order to navigate the user, for example, to

25
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.890
a previous root.

26
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.990
Here's a back method to the next root, which is forward to a specific root, which we'll see how to

27
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.100
do in the next lesson.

28
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.710
The point is that there's a bunch of helper methods here to help you navigate the user in a given component.

29
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
And the way this works, of course, is by connecting this logic to a component's logic.

30
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.570
So for example, if a component renders a button, you can add a V on directive to that button to react

31
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.530
to a button click.

32
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.260
And when the user clicks, that button is when you can invoke a method on the this dot router object

33
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.950
to force a navigation to another route, which then will trigger the corresponding component to render

34
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.370
there.

35
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.920
All right, so these two properties of root and router are available on any component in our app, and

36
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.630
we can use them for various use cases which we will explore over the course of the upcoming lessons.

37
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.320
All right.

38
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.060
So the very next lesson, we're going to see how we can use one of these sample methods on the router

39
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.090
object to navigate the user to a different view.
