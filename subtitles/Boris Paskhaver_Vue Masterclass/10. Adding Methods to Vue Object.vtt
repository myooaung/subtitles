00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.230
All right.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.660
So what is the next thing that we want to build out?

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.870
Well, we want the user to be able to click the action button and have that render our profile image.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.660
And the way that we can make that happen, of course, is if the click of the action button changes,

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.880
the value of the is logged in property.

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.630
If we can get the user to click the action button and switch this value to true, that will force view

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.050
to re render our component which will in turn render the profile image because now the v f will be attached

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.150
to a boolean of true right.

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.720
But how can we get the user action to trigger some kind of code to run or some kind of procedure to

10
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.310
execute?

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.320
Well, when you hear the words procedure, hopefully the idea that comes to mind is a function or a

12
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.070
method, right?

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.490
A bundle of code, a bunch of steps to run through.

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.540
And a function or a method, of course, encapsulates that collection of steps.

15
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.790
Well, as it turns out, we can attach methods to our view instances.

16
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.810
So let's try that out.

17
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.950
In this lesson, I'm going to open up my action button component right here.

18
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.600
I'm going to use command P to bring up my command palette that should be control piano, windows, computer,

19
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.970
and I'm going to search for my action button file.

20
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.780
And right here at the very bottom we have our view configuration object and an additional property that

21
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.880
we can add here is methods.

22
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.540
So once again, this name of methods is not up to us.

23
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.890
It is a view requirement.

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.490
This is how we attach methods to a view component.

25
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.940
All right.

26
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.120
So I'm going to provide my value here.

27
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.690
And the value is going to be a plain JavaScript object right here, curly braces.

28
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.090
All right.

29
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.760
So we can define our methods in here.

30
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.840
And an important note here is that we have to define them as s six methods rather than arrow functions.

31
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.050
So what I mean by that is let me just write out a sample one here.

32
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.070
So we'll see the differences.

33
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.750
We're going to right handle click.

34
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.330
This is going to be an arbitrary method name.

35
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.160
We can call this whatever we want, but I'm going to call this handle click because it's what it's going

36
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.460
to do.

37
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.610
It's going to react to a user clicking this action button and I'm going to use this syntax.

38
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.860
All right.

39
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.620
This is the traditional E-6 method syntax.

40
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.790
So in other words, we cannot do an arrow function like this, all right.

41
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.070
Because that prevents Vue from correctly binding everything it needs for this component total to to

42
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.430
function.

43
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.440
So without getting too much as the technical details do not use arrow functions here in this object

44
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.970
only use ES6 method definitions, which is just the name of the method followed by a pair of parentheses

45
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.360
where you put your parameters and then the function body inside curly braces.

46
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.620
All right, so what I want to do here is do something very simple in this method body.

47
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.520
I'm just going to console.log some kind of text to my browser console.

48
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.390
So I'm going to console.log a string of I've been clicked because obviously what we want to happen is

49
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.180
for this text to appear whenever the user clicks the button.

50
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.780
All right.

51
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.720
So let's go to the browser and see what is going to go on.

52
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.200
Right now.

53
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.790
I'm going to transition back to Chrome.

54
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.540
Here is my app and to bring up my console and what's going to happen when we click the button is absolutely

55
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.080
nothing.

56
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.590
Watch.

57
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.940
So I'm going to click this button.

58
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.160
Nothing is happening as I click.

59
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.670
All right.

60
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.740
So why is this happening?

61
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.710
Well, just because we've defined a method on a component, just because we've defined a procedure or

62
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.620
a collection of steps for you to execute doesn't mean that we've told you when to execute this method.

63
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.040
Right?

64
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.580
How is Vue supposed to know when it's supposed to run handle quick.

65
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.880
How is you supposed to know how many times to handle click?

66
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.150
Right.

67
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.120
Well, we have to trigger this method to run.

68
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.910
Just like when we write a basic JavaScript method, we have to invoke it right with parentheses or call

69
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.620
it as another term you might hear.

70
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.580
Well, we similarly have to tell you when to actually run this method.

71
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.450
The method will define the logic of something or how to do something.

72
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.650
And later on we'll see how we can use this method to indeed change the object's data.

73
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.410
But before we get there, we have to figure out how to actually tell you to run a method that's available,

74
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.660
and we're going to see how to do that in the very next lesson.
