00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.570
All right, so let's go ahead and style our action by using some tailwind utility classes.

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.060
So right here in my action button component, I'm going to add a class to my button and I'm just going

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.360
to write a whole bunch of classes.

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.650
Let's begin with some padding on both the left, right, top and bottom of the button.

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.090
That's just going to allow us to provide some space between the edges of the the button and the text

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.570
inside it.

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.700
So I'll start with five.

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.920
That applies padding on the left and right of 20 pixels.

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.410
Remember packs meaning padding on the x axis, left and right only.

10
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.790
We're going to apply this padding.

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.360
I want to apply slightly less padding on the top and bottom.

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.250
So for padding on the y axis, I can use the p y utility classes, y being the y axis up and down.

13
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.150
And here I want to provide ap3 class, which, as we can see here, is 12 pixels of padding on top and

14
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.590
12 pixels of padding on the bottom.

15
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.100
Then I want to apply a class called Font Medium.

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.250
That's just going to set a little bit of a boldness to the button text by setting a font weight of 500.

17
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.090
The next thing I want to do is make my text inside the button white.

18
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.870
Luckily, white is a pretty common color, so we have a prebuilt tailwind class that's just text white.

19
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.390
Although if I erase a couple of characters here, you can see that there's a whole bunch of different

20
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.560
colored classes here.

21
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.310
Here's the yellows and there's all kinds of text red and text blue.

22
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.480
There's a whole bunch of options available for us, but for now, we just want Text White, which will

23
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.710
make our text white.

24
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.280
All right.

25
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.560
I want to make sure that I have no border around my buttons.

26
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.050
I'm going to add border zero.

27
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.480
That's going to make a border with of zero.

28
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.800
But I do want to make the button rounded so I can apply the rounded class.

29
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.810
If this is going to apply a border radius that's going to around the corners of the button, although

30
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.820
I believe right now they're not actually going to be visible.

31
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.110
But that's totally fine.

32
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.650
And then finally, I want to set the background color of the button, and we do that with the big classes

33
00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.430
in Tailwind.

34
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.380
B.G. stands for background, and of course we have a whole bunch of helper classes from Tailwind with

35
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.160
a whole bunch of default greys and blues and yellows and reds.

36
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.640
But what we actually want to rely upon is that brand blue, one color that we configured in our tailwind

37
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.450
config file.

38
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.990
Remember when we set up those settings, tailwind automatically generated automatic utility access classes

39
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.100
for us out of the box based on the settings that we put in that file.

40
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.180
So now we can use Big Brand Blue one.

41
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.130
You can also see some of the other classes we configured, but in this case, BGI Brand Blue one is

42
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.500
that blue color that we want to associate with the button.

43
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.250
Our line is getting too long, but when I save it, we'll see.

44
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.580
That tailwind will slightly reformat it and that is all we need to do.

45
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.200
So we are already rendering this action button in my main nav component.

46
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.420
So when I navigate to the browser, we should see its impact reflected immediately on the screen.

47
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.270
Or by that I mean the impact of racist changes.

48
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.640
So let's go back to our browser and we'll take a look.

49
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.400
And there we go.

50
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.050
Our button is starting to take shape.

51
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.190
We have a button with a around it corner.

52
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.470
We have no board around it.

53
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.140
We have that nice blue background inspired by the Google career site, and we have some white bolded

54
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.070
text in the middle.

55
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.870
That's how easy it is to work with Tailwind.

56
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.880
We just add on a bunch of classes.

57
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.770
All right, so things are looking good.

58
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.990
We will continue with this in the very next lesson.
