WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.110
All right.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.140
So over the course of the next two lessons, I'd like to introduce you to two properties that Vue router

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.790
will automatically add to every view component in our app, and those properties are root and router

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.990
with an R at the end.

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.240
So these properties again are going to be available on every component and they're going to allow each

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.080
component to figure out which route it is currently on and also navigate the user elsewhere to another

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.610
path or to another route.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.200
Now, you may recall from the previous section that we used a method called EMET.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.820
We used that whenever we wanted our child component to emit an event to its parent.

10
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.640
And you may recall that that method began with a dollar sign, while these properties are also going

11
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.440
to begin with a dollar sign.

12
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.780
So it's going to be dollar sign root and dollar sign router, and they're both going to be available

13
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.600
on each component via the this keyword.

14
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.200
Okay.

15
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:02.340
So as a reminder for why we have that dollar sign, that dollar sign doesn't have any technical significance

16
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.150
in JavaScript.

17
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.910
It's just a regular character, no different than the letter A or the letter B, but the View Development

18
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.970
Team wants to give you a visual indicator that this is something internal or related to view.

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.170
It's kind of just a visual way for you to identify that this is something coming from view.

20
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.290
It also prevents any accidental conflict with, for example, your data properties because it's highly

21
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.620
unlikely that you would create a data property with a dollar sign.

22
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.980
So this is some way that they invented to distinguish themselves.

23
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.660
So you can know which parts are coming from your component set up and which parts are coming from them.

24
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.640
So Emit is coming from view.

25
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.320
So it's going to start with a dollar sign and in this case root and router are coming from Vue router

26
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.360
and they are also going to start with a dollar sign.

27
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.790
So what I'd like to do is take a look first at the root object, which is going to be available via

28
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.560
the this dot root property.

29
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.070
So I'm going to open up my job results view component right here.

30
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.780
And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to set up a computed property.

31
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.150
The reason it's going to be computed is because we're typically going to use the root to derive some

32
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.270
kind of data based on the route that we are currently on.

33
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.390
We're going to use that to figure out some alternate piece of data.

34
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.450
So since this is derived, since this is dependent on something else, it makes sense to put it in computed

35
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.500
versus just data.

36
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.650
And the reason I'm doing this is I just need some kind of method here that will allow me to console.log

37
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.090
the value of this dot root.

38
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.530
I need some way to access it.

39
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.680
So I'm just going to invent this arbitrary computed property here that will allow us to see the actual

40
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.940
root property in action.

41
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.720
So my name for my method here is completely arbitrary.

42
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.220
I'm just going to call it experiment.

43
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.770
And by the way, as a quick reminder, of course, our computed property is a JavaScript object with

44
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.750
a bunch of methods, and we can use those, those methods in line no differently than we would use a

45
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.500
data property.

46
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.880
So of course here in experiment is where I want to take my value of dollar sign root.

47
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.860
My root property, which again is now available on every Vue component in the app Vue router has made

48
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.320
that happen and I just want to console.log this so I can see what it looks like in my browser console.

49
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.890
Now the experiment computed property demands some kind of return value, so I'm just going to return

50
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.780
an arbitrary string of irrelevant.

51
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.440
It does not matter what we return here, we just need to return something.

52
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.160
And furthermore, if we leave our code like so, we're not actually going to see anything because Vue

53
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.190
has no reason to run the experiment computed property because we're not using it anywhere in our template.

54
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.210
So to actually use it, let's create a div right here.

55
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.320
Let's nassr h one inside it and below it I will put in the H2 and here we're going to reference that

56
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.600
experiment computed property using our double brace syntax.

57
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.200
We previously used this for data properties as well as computed properties.

58
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.910
They're the exact same syntax.

59
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.280
Just put the double curly braces and then we write the name of the computed property, which is experiment.

60
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.280
We do not need to invoke it, even though it is a method here.

61
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.580
Vue will automatically invoke it automatically for us.

62
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.960
So our view, our HTML is going to display the string irrelevant.

63
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.570
But what we really care about is this console.log.

64
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.640
So we can see that object that is available.

65
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.480
So let's transition to the browser and open up my.

66
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.300
Console.

67
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.390
And let me refresh the page just in case it's a little outdated.

68
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.020
And of course, the reason I'm not seeing anything is because I'm being very silly.

69
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.530
We put this in the job results page, so we have to navigate to job slash results to render the job

70
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.800
results view, which in turn will force the template to render, which of course will render the actual

71
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.530
computed property and thus do the console.log.

72
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.220
So finally, here it is.

73
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.080
Here is the object.

74
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.770
This is the dollar sign root property that is available via the this keyword on every single view component

75
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.190
interact.

76
00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.390
And the whole purpose of this object, as you can probably guess, is to keep track of information metadata

77
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.230
about the root.

78
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.940
So for example, we have the name that we configured in our router index that Yes.

79
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.690
File, we have the path right here slash job slash results.

80
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.020
Right.

81
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.940
We have a whole bunch of information later on will be able to get things like params and query params.

82
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.180
Right.

83
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.640
So just a whole bunch of information in case we need to use it to dynamically determine some details.

84
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:29.210
We have this root property and we can use it in any component and take whatever these whatever properties

85
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.220
here we care about and do something with them in case it, for example, determines what we'd like to

86
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.700
render.

87
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.340
We can use them conditionally, like so, etc..

88
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.680
The point is, we now have access to this information in every component.

89
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.930
We don't need to do any additional configuration from any component.

90
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.250
We can always find out which route we are currently on and then do something with that information.

91
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.400
So that is the first property that I wanted to introduce you to.

92
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.800
And in the very next lesson, I will introduce you to a complementary property which is router with

93
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.640
an R at the end.

94
00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:59.750
So I will see you there.
