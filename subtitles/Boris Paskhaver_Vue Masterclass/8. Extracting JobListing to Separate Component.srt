1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,020
Okay.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,260
So we only have one job listing in our job listings component, but already it is becoming sort of bloated.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,390
There's a lot of lines of code in this file.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,030
So as always, whenever you get a really complex component, it might make sense to break it up into

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,380
lots of smaller components.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,370
So I propose that we move the idea of a single job listing.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:26,610
So this list item starting here and proceeding all the way to here, I propose that we move that into

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,560
its own separate view component.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:35,040
It sort of makes sense logically because each one of those boxes represents its own reusable chunk of

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,710
UI right on the real Google Careers website.

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,680
We're going to have a list item for every single job listing.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,310
If we have ten of them, we're going to have this chunk of code repeated ten times.

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,740
So whenever you have that repeatability and you want to enable it to be reused over and over, it makes

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,540
sense to extract it to a component.

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,850
That way we can render that component as many times as we need and have all of this code repeated without

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,430
having to copy and paste it literally in this file.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,830
So let's copy all of our code, starting from this ally element insider ordered list.

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:12,390
So from line four here to the end of my ally here in line 55 and I'm going to go to my explorer and

19
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,420
within my job results directory right here, but not inside job filter sidebar, just job results.

20
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,160
I'm going to create a file and I'm going to call it job listing dot view.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,040
So just be careful here because it is singular in comparison to our job listings component which is

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,960
storing all of the job listings.

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,780
This is just the view component to represent just one of them.

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,860
So in here I will use my template tag and I'm going to paste the code that we copied from the other

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,220
file.

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,780
Of course it is very ugly now, but the beautiful part of Prettier and I love doing this is saving this

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,510
and seeing an auto format for it for me immediately.

28
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,700
So with that we have copied over that code.

29
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,900
Let me go to my bottom section here and add my script tag.

30
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:01,830
And we're going to export default to a JavaScript object with a name property set to job listing, add

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,490
a line break at the bottom, save that and that is a good place to leave off.

32
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,380
In the very next lesson, we're going to use this job listing component repeatedly in job listings.

33
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,460
So I will see you there.
