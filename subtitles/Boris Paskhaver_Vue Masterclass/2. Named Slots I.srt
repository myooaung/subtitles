1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,040
Okay.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:07,440
So in this lesson, we'll create a new header containing a component whose responsibility it will be

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,510
to center a bunch of content.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,230
And of course, that content will be dynamically provided using the slot component and the parent component

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,180
giving whatever it wants.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,840
All right.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,260
So as a quick heads up, I am starting to record this lesson and probably all follow up lessons on a

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,040
new computer.

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,150
So it's possible that there may be some visual mismatches in voice code.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,770
I apologize for that.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,010
But the view content itself is going to stay the same.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,900
So for some reason the colors don't fit or the font looks a little bit off, or the theme has a bunch

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,040
of different colors here and there.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,630
Again, I apologize for that.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,410
It's a technical requirement because my old computer is not working very well.

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,100
All right.

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,610
So with that said, I am going to open up my source directory, my components folder, my shared folder,

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,250
and here I'm going to create my new view component.

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,280
I'm going to call it header container, dot view.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,300
It represents a header stored in a container that centers that content.

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,260
All right.

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,940
So as always, we're going to need a template and we're going to need a script section.

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:10,600
All right.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,240
And we can knock out script right now.

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,560
So I'm going to export default and object with a name property.

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,270
And that name property will be equal to header container perfect.

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,700
And then within my template, I'm going to create a top level div and I'm immediately going to add some

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,960
tailwind classes to it.

29
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,960
We're going to make this Occupy 100% of the parents with by giving the full class.

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,350
Then I want to add a border on the bottom.

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,420
So I'm going to use border B to do that.

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,370
I want my border to be solid.

33
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:47,460
So I will add the border solid class and I want to use the brand gray, one color that I specified in

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,780
my tailwind config file.

35
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,120
So I'm going to add border brand gray one that is an automatically available class.

36
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,970
Then within this div, I'm going to add another div and I'm going to provide some classes here as well.

37
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:06,510
I'm going to center this div by providing margin on the left and right hand side as much as the browser

38
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,180
wants to add to center this in the middle and I'm going to add the Amex auto class or margin auto class

39
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,410
on the X axis.

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,160
In order to do that, I also want to add some margin on the top and bottom.

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,760
So I'm going to add the AM Y margin on the Y axis classes.

42
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:27,210
I'm going to do m y 16, which should give me a 64 pixels of margin on the top and 64 pixels of margin

43
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:27,690
on the bottom.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,670
And then perhaps the most important class here, I'm going to add the text center class, which will

45
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,990
add a text line of center to whatever content I place inside this div.

46
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,900
And of course that is going to be the dynamic content.

47
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:46,980
And as we mentioned here, we don't just want one slot, we want to one is going to be for the top level,

48
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,110
the title, if you will, the primary text or whatever content my, my parent component wants to give

49
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,320
me.

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,600
And then I'm going to create another slot for the subtitle, the second bit of content underneath.

51
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,200
All right.

52
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,030
So I'm going to start with my top little slot, the exact same syntax we introduced in the previous

53
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,420
section.

54
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,800
However, the difference here is I'm going to give my slot a name and the way I do so is with a name

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,230
prop.

56
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,720
So right here in line is going to provide a name prop and I think an appropriate name here is something

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,530
like title.

58
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,910
This is the title content.

59
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,040
And then if I want to provide any default or fallback content, we know how to do that.

60
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,150
Now we're going to do that right here in between the opening and closing slot tag.

61
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,460
So maybe we can do something like sample title.

62
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,700
And again, Vue is only going to use this fallback content if the parent component does not provide

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,080
anything for this slot.

64
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:37,890
All right.

65
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,720
Now, what about for a second slot?

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,760
Well, it's going to be the exact same syntax.

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,430
We're going to open up a new slot component.

68
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,140
We're going to close it and then we're going to give it a name prop set to a totally different value.

69
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,560
So how about here we give it a name of subtitle.

70
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,510
And we'll give it some fallback content like sample subtitle.

71
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:04,010
So what we have enabled now is a parent component to be able to provide not one but two custom pieces

72
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,260
of HTML to inject right here.

73
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,830
And of course, we're not obligated to have our slots right next to each other.

74
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
We can have a slot here.

75
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,030
Then we can have some more HTML in between right here.

76
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,520
And then we can have an additional slot below.

77
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:22,460
And that is the real power of this design and view is you can keep that commonality in your component,

78
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,700
but also define multiple sections or slots where you can plug in custom content.

79
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,160
That's why it's called a slot, because it represents a portion of the UI or a portion of the component

80
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,040
that you can slot in that you can stick a piece of HTML into.

81
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,310
Right.

82
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,760
Just like the word slot means in your everyday use.

83
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,110
It's a place to put something.

84
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,850
So here we have two slots right next to each other and the parent component will be able to provide

85
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:52,670
both of them or either of them or none of them because we have some fallback content to rely on in case

86
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,030
they don't.

87
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,510
All right.

88
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,850
So we've set up the basics of this component.

89
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,660
And in the very next couple of lessons, we're going to start using this component throughout our app.
