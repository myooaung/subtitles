00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.390
All right.

2
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:07.060
So in this lesson, I want to customize a configuration setting for our just testing library.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.760
And the settings for this library are going to be found in a single file at the top level of our job

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.540
search project.

5
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.230
It is this file right here, just configs.

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.770
And if you open this file, you'll see that it consists of a basic JavaScript object with a preset property.

7
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.770
Now what I want to add to this object, which of course is the settings for just what I want to add

8
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.190
to this object, is going to be a new test match property.

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.260
And in the previous lesson in that article I provided the direct property and its value.

10
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.870
So you can go ahead and copy that directly over.

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.740
So I'm going to do that on my end right here, paste the below.

12
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.750
And then I just want to take a quick couple of seconds to describe exactly what is going on here.

13
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.330
So what this property sets is the file extensions that just is going to look for when it's trying to

14
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.820
determine the test files in our project.

15
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.770
So, for example, right here in our test directory, if you expand that, you'll see that we have a

16
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.550
sample test file and it is called example that spec docs.

17
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.350
Now by default the view configures just so that it only looks for test files with a dot specked extension.

18
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.060
And that is totally fine.

19
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.200
But another common convention that you'll see across JavaScript code bases is test files that end with

20
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.470
dot, test dot.

21
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.980
Yes.

22
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.830
So there is no option that is inherently better.

23
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.810
It really is a matter of personal choice and consistency ultimately in your team's code base.

24
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.840
However, with this setting that we added will do is it will recognize either option, either dot spectators

25
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.270
or dot test dot.

26
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.580
Yes.

27
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.190
What this actually is, is an array of rejects.

28
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.650
Rejects is short for regular expressions, and regular expression is just a search pattern for text.

29
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.050
So you don't need to understand all this complexity.

30
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.180
But right here you can see we are designating that the file can have either spec or a test in its name.

31
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.370
That's basically all that we are configuring here.

32
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.030
All right.

33
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.510
And that's all the just configurations that we need to do for this course.

34
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.310
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

35
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.870
And I will see you in the next one.
