1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,520
All right.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,520
So this is going to be a quick lesson.

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:10,010
What I'd like to do in this lesson is add another brand color to our tailwind dot config case file,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,210
so tailwind can generate some additional CC classes for us.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,200
So let me open up my tailwind dot config that JS file.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,010
As a reminder here we have our colors, which tailwind will use to generate things like font classes

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,950
and background color classes, etc..

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,990
And what we need to add here is another blue color because our secondary version of the button which

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,390
we saw is applied in the search form.

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,380
Whenever you hover your mouse over it, it's going to show a blue background.

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:45,380
And that blue background is a different blue color than the one we have here represented by brand a

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,010
blue one.

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,670
So I need to add that color and it's going to be the same process right below here.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,200
I'm going to add a new key.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,300
I'm going to call it brand blue, too.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,730
It's another blue color that our brand uses.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,190
And the hexadecimal code for it is going to be the hashtag and followed by 42, 80 5f4.

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,900
We can see that blew up here right there.

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,110
And I'm going to add a comma to the end here and save the file.

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,260
If you experience any kind of issues with something that working in the following lessons, just remember

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,870
you can restart your review app here usually, so you can cancel that process by pressing something

22
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,780
like Control D or Control C, I forget which one it is.

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,950
It's one of those combinations.

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,040
And then restarting the app using the command and pin reserve, and that will re-evaluate and re-import

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,250
these tailwind settings and tailwind will again regenerate those new CSS classes that you can then use

26
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,570
within your view components.

27
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:44,630
So now that we have this new brand blue to color, we can use it to model our secondary styles for the

28
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,870
button.

29
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,200
So I will see you and we will do that in the very next lesson.
