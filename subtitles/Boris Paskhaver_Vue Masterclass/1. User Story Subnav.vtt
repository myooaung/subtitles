00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.940
Welcome to the next section of the course and to a brand new user story.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.380
So let's read it together.

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.380
As a user, I'd like to know the number of jobs that matched my search results so that I can be sure

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.480
my filters are being applied.

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.670
So let me take you out of this presentation and straight to the Google Careers Web page where we can

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.660
see this in action.

7
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.760
So here I have it open in a separate tab.

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.750
And if you want to be at the same page that I am, you can click on this jobs link on the top menu right

9
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.080
here.

10
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.590
Another way to get to this page, by the way, from the main landing page, is to provide a role and

11
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.450
a location and click the search button.

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.700
And that will take us to the jobs page as well.

13
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.030
And yes, we will be building out all of these features throughout the course.

14
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.480
But I'd like you to turn your focus right now to the jobs page.

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.610
So the way this page works is the user applies a bunch of filters right here on the left hand side,

16
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.500
for example, they can filter for jobs with a certain degree or education requirement.

17
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.460
They can filter for the type of jobs such as full time or part time.

18
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.710
They can filter for organizations within Google, such as Google or YouTube, different companies.

19
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.600
And as they click these checkboxes, you'll notice the jobs on the right hand side will change.

20
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.170
But more importantly, for the purposes of this section, you'll notice that this number right here

21
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.270
is going to change to reflect the number of jobs that match that search criteria.

22
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.940
So, for example, if I apply another filter here part time, that's going to increase the number of

23
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.900
jobs that are available.

24
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.970
If I only look for part time jobs, you'll notice that there's only going to be eight jobs that have

25
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.010
both part time job type and a bachelor's degree requirement.

26
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.330
So we're not going to get to this page right now.

27
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.370
We will certainly get to this page later in the course.

28
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.350
But for now, we're just going to start building out this sub now right here where we have this magnifying

29
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.660
glass and the number of jobs that match the actual user queries.

30
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.080
Later on, we're going to indeed hardwire this number to the page right here and the users search filters.

31
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.550
But since we don't have those built out for now, we're just going to be working on building out this

32
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.820
sub nav, as I call it, this thing below the main navigation menu, the secondary navigation menu,

33
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.540
if you will.

34
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.460
And we're going to be worried about styling.

35
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.470
It's dealing with all kinds of different view ideas to get it into the right location and give it the

36
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.250
right functionality.

37
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.290
This is going to be a good opportunity to both review old view concepts and also introduce some new

38
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.530
ones.

39
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.090
I know it seems like a very small feature because we're just going to statically hardcoded a magnifying

40
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.780
glass and you know, a static number and the words jobs matched.

41
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.180
But there is a lot more to learn about view simply through this small user ID ticket.

42
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.010
And then we're going to come back to this later in the course.

43
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.320
And again, we're going to hardwire this to actually be accurate, to reflect the number of jobs that

44
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.880
match the user's search parameters.

45
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.360
All right.

46
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.100
So with that, we can transition back to Visual Studio code and start on our next slice of work.
