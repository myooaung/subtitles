00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.200
All right.

2
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.730
So I now have my terminal and my view up, side by side, up and running.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.890
So the next thing I want to do is open our text editor, which is going to be a Visual Studio code.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.840
So right here, I'm going to open up a new tab in Mac.

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.490
You can press command plus T to open up a new tab.

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.830
Basically, I just need a new terminal window.

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.030
And by default, my Mac will place me in the same folder that I was just in.

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.250
If you are on another operating system and it takes you to another folder, just go ahead and navigate

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.710
back to where you have job search on your computer.

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.880
And here we can execute code, followed by a space and a dot in order to open Visual Studio code in

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.840
the current directory.

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.380
So that's going to open up our job search project in this code.

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.370
I'm going to drag it over from my other screen and keep it on the left here.

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.290
And I'm going to remove this welcome pane.

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.690
So we're going to dive into all of these view files and everything that is usually I created for us

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.440
in just a moment.

17
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.430
But in this lesson, I want to show you the concept of hot reloading.

18
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.880
Hot reloading basically means we can make changes in our code editor and The View SEAL.

19
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.030
I will automatically recognize that we've made those changes.

20
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.940
It will interpret them and it will transpire them.

21
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
And then we'll refresh the Web page that you see on the right to reflect those changes.

22
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.510
So we don't have to restart our server.

23
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.870
We don't have to worry about telling view which files have changed.

24
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.990
It is smart enough to figure that out and make the development process easier for us by auto refreshing

25
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.510
for us, which is a feature called Hot Reloading.

26
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.380
So again, we're going to worry about the files that we have here on the left in just a second.

27
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.150
For now, I want to use a code feature to search for a file and to search for a file by name.

28
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.150
We can press command P on mac OS or control P on Windows and that's going to bring up this little box.

29
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.370
And here you can enter any file name.

30
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.870
And I'd like to search for a file here called App Dot View and here it is.

31
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.560
It's going to open this file up.

32
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.800
This is an example of a view file.

33
00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.310
All right.

34
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.210
Now, you don't have to worry about any of the logic or syntax in here.

35
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.020
We're going to talk about it over the course of the next many, many hours.

36
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.920
But I do want you to notice here that we have this text.

37
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.540
Welcome to your Vgs app right here.

38
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.100
And you'll notice that that is the exact same text that you have right here on the right in Chrome.

39
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.270
And as you might guess, this is the string that affects this output.

40
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.150
So what I want to do here is replace this text with something else, save this file, and then we'll

41
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.730
immediately see the changes reflected in our browser.

42
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.000
So it doesn't matter what we put here, as long as it's something different.

43
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.480
So I'm just going to put a fun string of I'm learning Vue and let's add an exclamation point because

44
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.190
we're super excited right now.

45
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.660
Our file isn't yet saved.

46
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.970
We can tell in V code because we have this little white dot on our tab with the file name.

47
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.990
But once we save the file, which we can do with command s on a mac or control s on windows, then the

48
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.730
file will save vcl seal.

49
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.310
I will register the change transpire and automatically you can see the changes on your right hand side

50
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.880
right here.

51
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.320
All right, here's another example.

52
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.980
Let me do.

53
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.060
Hello, world, right here.

54
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.110
Hello, world.

55
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.430
Save that.

56
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.730
And within a second it automatically reflects on the right hand side.

57
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:12.150
Right.

58
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.740
So Vue makes the appropriate changes.

59
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.360
No refresh is required.

60
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.440
And this is an example of what Vue Seelye gives us out of the box.

61
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.340
We don't have to hardwire this web pack logic under the hood.

62
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.860
It just takes care of this kind of convenience for us.

63
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.190
All right.

64
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.020
So that's all hot reloading is.

65
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.330
And in the next lesson, we'll start configuring V code to have some optimizations to work with our

66
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.990
view project.

67
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.800
So I'll see you there.
