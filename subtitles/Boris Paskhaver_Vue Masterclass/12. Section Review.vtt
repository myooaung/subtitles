00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.500
All right.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.310
So that wraps up this section.

3
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.450
So let's do a quick review of everything that we've learned.

4
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:13.110
First up, we now know that our view components live inside separate files with a dot view extension.

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:21.480
Each dot view file stores one view component, and ideally each component represents one small reusable

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.190
chunk of the user interface.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.400
Within a component file, we can write our template tags where we write our H HTML for that component

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.410
and we can also attach a view configuration object within the script tags.

9
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.870
That view configuration object is a plain JavaScript object with some predefined properties that we

10
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.810
can add to customize how that component works.

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.070
Once we've defined a component, we can use it in another component.

12
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.970
We can render it as many times as we want, and each component exists as its own independent piece of

13
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.550
the UI.

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.850
Right?

15
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.360
So what are some of the properties we can define on that view configuration object within a component

16
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.630
file?

17
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.550
Well, we have the name property which defines the components name and that's what we see in the view

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.840
devtools in the browser.

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.730
And of course we have a potential method we can define called data.

20
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.580
The data method returns a plain JavaScript object and the properties of that object are available to

21
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.030
be used within our HTML in those template tax.

22
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.750
One example that we saw in this section was interpolating or literally injecting or rendering the specific

23
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.280
values of the data object, which we can do using our curly brace syntax.

24
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.520
Right.

25
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.490
We also saw what happened when we did not have a property defined on the object, in which case we got

26
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.430
undefined and v rendered nothing.

27
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.260
And we also saw that we could access nested objects within our data return object as well.

28
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.580
In addition, we also saw some additional tailwinds.

29
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.920
Yes, that's classes for things like padding and margin and Flexbox, etc. and we also customized tailwind

30
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.420
using the tailwind config file to add custom colors to our app.

31
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.820
And we saw how Tailwind helped generate new utility classes for us automatically, which we could add

32
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.620
to our HTML elements.

33
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.130
All right.

34
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.200
That's all there is to cover in this section.

35
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.970
In the very next section, we're going to start talking a lot about testing using the just framework.

36
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.220
So we're still kind of getting up and running here.

37
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.570
We're still finding our footing.

38
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.640
I know we're not talking a lot about just Vue, but we're still putting all the pieces in place together

39
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.090
for App.

40
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.850
And next up is testing, which is critical to making sure that your apps are running correctly and that

41
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.000
the new changes that we make don't break our existing code.

42
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.330
All right.

43
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.270
So lots of fun stuff to cover up ahead.

44
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.870
I will see you in the next lesson.
