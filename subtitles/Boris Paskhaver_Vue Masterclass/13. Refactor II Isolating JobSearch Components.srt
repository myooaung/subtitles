1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,260
Okay.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,540
So the next directory that I'd like to create within my components folder is going to be a job search

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,080
directory.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,150
And in there I'm going to put my headline, my hero and my job search form components.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,840
So basically what we've been working on over the course of the last couple of sections.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,910
So right here in Components, I will create a new folder.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,430
I'm going to call it job search.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,590
That sort of describes the feature that we've been working on and the components that make up that feature.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,040
So I am, of course, going to drag my headline into there.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,710
And yes, Victor, you can change it wherever you can find it.

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,700
And I'm also going to drag it looks like it's also asking me for permission here.

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,260
We're going to save it and come back to it later.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,620
Let me also move my hero component into job search.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,490
Okay.

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,720
That looks good.

16
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:44,590
All right.

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,430
Let me save that.

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,650
And let me also move my job search form component into job search as well.

19
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,480
And then we'll go through the components manually to make sure that things remain normal.

20
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,580
So let me just go into here.

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:58,970
Okay.

22
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,290
View.

23
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,840
Let me see if there's anything going on here.

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,800
So here we are importing our headline component from components job search, headline view.

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,490
That is correct.

26
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,760
And as far as job search from that view, that is not updated.

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,400
I think the reason we have this kind of discrepancy is the order in which we move our components into

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:18,880
the folder.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,000
They may auto update, but maybe when we moved hero, the job search form was still in its outer level

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,000
and Vader doesn't know to account for that.

31
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,830
So now our job search form component is also in the job search folder.

32
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,810
So let's add it here.

33
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,980
Job search slash job search form.

34
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,800
That looks good.

35
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,980
I want to ask to move on to my app view component.

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,990
I know there is some use of this here.

37
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,090
So right here we are getting our hero from components job search hero dot view.

38
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,440
That looks good to me.

39
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,670
Okay.

40
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,440
And then let's assume we got everything here, but we will come back to it if we need to.

41
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:00,880
In tests unit components, I want to create a complementary job search folder and into here.

42
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,790
I want to move my headline that test, that just file.

43
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,440
There we go.

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,210
Let's open up headline that.

45
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,660
Test that.

46
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,880
Yes, immediately.

47
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,280
Here we can see we are importing headline from components headline.

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,110
That is no longer where it is at.

49
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,930
It is now inside the job search directory.

50
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,310
So like that and let's try running our tests again.

51
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,960
So I'm going to open up our terminal.

52
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,220
And I'm going to run and PM run test colon unit.

53
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,200
Let's run our tests once and see if there is anything missing or anything we forgot.

54
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,130
And looks like everything is working so far.

55
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,990
Again, the tests are not a perfect indicator because there may be some imports somewhere that we're

56
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,590
not testing.

57
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:48,380
But for now, I'll treat this as being a good sign and we'll continue to refactor in the very next lesson.
