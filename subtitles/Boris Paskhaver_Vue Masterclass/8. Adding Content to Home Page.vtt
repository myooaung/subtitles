00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.800
All right, so let's return our home page or alternatively, our home view back to its correct implementation.

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.790
So instead of this terrible H1 will have our old hero component.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.310
So I'll navigate back to the S code.

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.270
And of course, where I want to head is our views directory in source.

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.570
We currently have two views or two pages.

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.170
I want to go to home view and right now it's just rendering this one.

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.290
So in our script section, let's import the correct component and the top level component that renders

8
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.720
everything, including the headline.

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.150
And the form is actually called our hero component.

10
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.520
It has been a little while, but it's called hero.

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.330
And we can find that component within our components directory.

12
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.380
The job search folder and the hero component is there.

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.840
And then of course, we register it locally.

14
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.940
So components property with an object.

15
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.990
Now we can provide hero and we can use it in line.

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.580
And that's really all I want to render in my home view component.

17
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.520
So I'm just going to render a self-closing hero component.

18
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.400
And if I navigate back to my browser, perfect.

19
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.010
Now our home page at the slash root.

20
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.480
Root is back to normal.

21
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.210
And if I go to slash job results, here's where we can start building out our eventual job results page.

22
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.530
And of course, as I mentioned, we do have the back and forward buttons working in our browser.

23
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.210
We set up that functionality.

24
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.400
When the user does this, the user is still not refreshing, the user simply going back and forth and

25
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.820
Vue is still dynamically rebuilding the proper components onto the page.

26
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.130
That's why I can be a pretty quick transition because it's just JavaScript working in your browser,

27
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.440
right?

28
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.300
So pretty cool stuff.

29
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.250
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

30
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.990
So I will see you in the next one.
