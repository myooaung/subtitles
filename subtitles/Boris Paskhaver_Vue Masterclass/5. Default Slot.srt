1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,990
Okay.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:06,540
So in this lesson, I want to do a quick review of the default slot in view.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:13,680
So as a reminder, if we create a slot component and we do not give it a name, view will assign it

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,510
a name of default.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,740
So let me show you how this works in my head or container for my very first slot.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,900
I'm going to remove this name prop, so I'm just going to have the slot component by itself.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,360
View is going to assign this for a slot online for a name of default.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,330
That means that if we have the syntax right here, then in our team's view, we can no longer use the

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,200
title name.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,480
We have to use the new name of default.

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,240
So if I save this and go back to my browser, we're going to see that everything is still working.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,820
Okay, let me head back to this code.

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,880
And the reason I wanted to introduce you to this pattern is because you might see it in the real world.

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,010
Now, a couple of things to know about this.

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:02,330
Number one, you can only have one slot without a name because you can only have one default name to

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,410
give to a slot.

17
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,620
So if we were to remove the name right here, we would run into problems.

18
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,990
So even if we're using this approach where we want to rely on a default slot, we still have to provide

19
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,540
any second slot, any third slot, and so on.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,540
A name property right here or a name prop.

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,230
All right.

22
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:24,230
Furthermore, what I would argue is that if you're going to have more than one slot, I would still

23
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,450
prefer to give each one a name.

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,960
And the reason is because I think it's a little bit more explicit.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,180
So, for example, a developer that's looking at our code, if we have a name here, a title going back

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,800
to our original design, well, they can see title and subtitle right here and right here.

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,690
If we return it back to its V slot of title and they can sort of easily understand the connection,

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,020
they can see title and subtitle here as well as in the component that it is rendering.

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,740
And it may make it a little bit clearer to them what's going on in comparison.

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,170
If they see the default name right here, they may have no clue what is going on.

31
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,790
Right, because they would have to go into the view documentation or they would have to know that internal

32
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,720
detail of view.

33
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,420
The fact that view assigns a slot without a name, the name of default.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,740
Right.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,780
So in my personal preference, if you have a single slot, then you can feel free to use it without

36
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,020
the name prop if you have more than one slot.

37
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,780
I think the syntax of giving each one a name is cleaner and simpler and less likely to confuse somebody.

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,240
And that way, whenever you are providing information or content to that slot, you simply use this

39
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,210
consistent syntax of a template tag with a V slot directive with that slot name explicitly written out.

40
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:35,870
All right.

41
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,190
So I'm just going to return this back to the original implementation, but I did want to do a review

42
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,800
of the default slot and view and how it works.

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,420
And I will see you in the next lesson.
