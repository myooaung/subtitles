00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.930
Okay.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.690
So knowing what we know about dynamic object properties in JavaScript, here is a cool refactor that

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.310
we can do to our action button.

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.490
You'll notice in our computed properties that we are creating a manual object with primary and secondary

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.950
properties, with the goal of having a boolean there to represent whether that suggests class should

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.640
be applied.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.590
And so we're comparing with a literal string of primary and a literal string of secondary.

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.680
Well, if you think about it, the type value that we are providing from our parent component in this

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.790
case secondary is the exact same as the name of the access class that we'd like to apply within action

10
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.090
button.

11
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.230
So if we could just take this value secondary and set it to a boolean value of true, then our action

12
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.840
button would know to apply the secondary.

13
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.680
Yes, that's class.

14
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.720
And alternatively, if our type was primary and we used primary as a object property key and set that

15
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.910
to true, then the action button would know to apply the primary access class instead.

16
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.340
So here's one way that we can remove these two lines and express the same idea in a single line.

17
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.920
I'm going to reference with square brackets because it is a dynamic property reference.

18
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.590
I'm going to reference this type.

19
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.060
So this is going to be some string, either primary or secondary.

20
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.060
But whatever it is, I'm going to set it as the object property here in my button class returned object

21
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.590
and whatever it is, I'm always going to set it equal to a boolean of true.

22
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.440
So if the user, for example, passes in any type of secondary, this will be an object with a single

23
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.430
key value pair.

24
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.550
It's going to be a key of secondary with a value of true, which will apply the secondary access class.

25
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.800
There is no primary key at all, but that's not a problem because view is just not going to apply the

26
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.410
primary key or the primary is, yes, that's class.

27
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.570
So if I go back to my browser right now.

28
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.320
We're going to see our secondary button right here.

29
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.390
And if I go into my action mind component, we can see here that our type is secondary.

30
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.200
That is a string.

31
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.470
And we're using that string as the basis for a property here in this object called secondary, which

32
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.270
we're setting to true, which of course is going to apply this secondary access class and give us this

33
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.900
type of button.

34
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.830
Alternatively, if I go back here and I change this to primary and save and I go back to my browser,

35
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.100
we're now going to see a different result and it makes sense.

36
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.010
We're passing in a different string of primary with thus activating or creating a different property

37
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.650
on our button class computed property object.

38
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.590
It now has a key of primary such a true so now it knows to apply the primary class and we get our primary

39
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.260
button right and that spares us the need to keep adding all of these additional conditionals if we decide

40
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.880
to make different versions of the button.

41
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.090
So if tomorrow we decide to, for example, have a new type called tertiary or error or warning, as

42
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.820
long as we add a scissors class of the same name here in action band, we no longer need to modify anything

43
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.210
here.

44
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.540
Right?

45
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.330
Because our property or our prop will stay the same.

46
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.420
It'll state the same as type and whatever the name is.

47
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.580
We're always going to apply it with a value of true.

48
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.900
So all that this component then needs in order to expand, to grow is the name of that type as a new

49
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.260
access class such as, you know, tertiary or error or whatever we decide to give it, it will automatically

50
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.770
be applied if we pass that type in and we can apply those custom styles.

51
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.020
So there's a lot less customization and less code that we have to add to our action.

52
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.840
But every time that we decide to introduce a different variant or access styling to it.

53
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.600
All right, so I like where we are currently and we'll continue chipping away at props and similar ideas

54
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.620
in the next lesson.
