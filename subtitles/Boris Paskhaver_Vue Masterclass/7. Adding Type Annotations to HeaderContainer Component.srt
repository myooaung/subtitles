1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,280
Okay.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:08,000
So here is a cool piece of news in our source directory in the components folder and in shared, we

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,200
have moved nearly every Vue component to be in TypeScript.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,940
There's only one remaining.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,500
And just to satisfy that little completionist side of me, let's take care of it in this lesson.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,840
So let's target header container view.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,640
And this component should be super simple because there's not even that much going on in this section.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,730
Regardless, it's going to be the exact same process right here.

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,110
Lang equals to yes and I'm going to import define component.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,570
Directly from view.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,860
There we go.

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,730
Let's invoke it.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,570
It's kind of redundant.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,850
And I'm sort of starting to feel that pain of repetition now as a developer.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,440
But the good news is we only technically have to do it once.

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,770
And as the component expands in the future, we don't have to do anything more.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,840
This stays the same and this stays the same.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,250
That's just something positive to think about in these moments of repetition.

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,030
All right.

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,390
And as always, let's update the test suite as well.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,560
Had our container that test that genius which I'm going to change to have a test extension.

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,790
And as you can see, everything in that test folder now has a doctor's extension.

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,100
It looks like there are no issues to be found in this file.

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,410
Just make sure you have a dot view extension here in case everything in case anything doesn't work.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,450
And here, of course, we'll do NPM.

26
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,500
Run, test, watch.

27
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,030
Now run.

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,870
Any tests that include the header container component in some way.

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,880
It looks like it's only our primary test file, which now has its extension and everything passes.

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,510
Great.

31
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,240
So that completes moving all of the components in the shared directory to be in TypeScript.

32
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,290
So one small accomplishment to celebrate.

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,060
And I will see you in the next lesson.
