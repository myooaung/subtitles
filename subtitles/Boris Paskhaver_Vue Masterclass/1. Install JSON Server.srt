1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,190
All right.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:09,060
So in this lesson, we're going to add a new NPM package to our project, and it is called JSON server.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,050
So JSON server allows us to create a fake backend.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,890
We're not going to actually build any kind of real backend in this class.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,600
And there's a couple of reasons for this.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,160
Number one, building a backend is complex, usually involves setting up a database.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,070
It usually involves some kind of framework or a library.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,320
And there's a lot of variety as far as the programming languages and the libraries and the frameworks

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,010
that you could use.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,470
I don't know where every student is coming from.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,810
Some students, maybe JavaScript people, some may be Python people, Ruby people, Java people.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,760
So rather than deal with the complexities of a specific framework, we're going to set up a fake backend.

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,010
We're going to install a package that's going to make it very simple to simulate a backend without actually

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,480
having to build a real one.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,890
And that package that's going to enable us to do it to do that is called JSON server.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,760
After we installed JSON server, what we can do is create a JSON file in our project directory and JSON,

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,640
if you're unaware, is just a file storage format.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,450
It's basically a way to store data in a file and the format of JSON is very similar to how objects look

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,380
in JavaScript where it is a property and then a colon and then a value.

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,190
In fact, JSON is short for JavaScript object notation because it's notation or in other words, how

21
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,690
it looks comes directly from or is influenced by JavaScript.

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,010
So we're going to install this package right now and then I'll show you how to set up this file with

23
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,700
fake data in just a second, and I promise it'll all make sense then.

24
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,310
For now, let's begin by installing this dependency.

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,890
So I'm going to write NPM install and we need to add this not as a main dependency because it's not

26
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,520
going to be directly related to the bundle that the user will get in their browser.

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,440
It is a development dependency that we as developers need in order to fake a back end.

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,790
So it's only for development.

29
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,120
So in order to install a package as a dev dependency, we can add this include flag with two dashes.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,200
So dash dash include then an equal sign and the word dev.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,860
So we're telling NPM to install this package as a dev dependency rather than a regular user dependency.

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,160
And then the package is called JSON Dash server.

33
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,660
So I'm going to install this.

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,670
It should be pretty quick.

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,000
And in the very next lesson, we'll take a look at how we can set up this package to create a fake backend

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,240
for us at whatever URL we want and have it serve the data that we want, which for us is going to be

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,760
a listing of 100 fictional jobs.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,330
All right.

39
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,860
So I will see you in the next lesson.
