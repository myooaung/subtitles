1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,140
All right.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:07,830
So in this lesson will apply our initial tailwind CSR styles to our three components job results, view,

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,710
job filter, sidebar and job listings.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,140
So let's begin with our job results view.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,420
Currently, it is rendering our two child view components inside a div and I want to apply some tailwind

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,650
classes to that div.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,550
So right here I'll create a flex box for my children using flex.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,880
I want to make sure I arrange the children in a row direction so I will add the flex row class which

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,290
makes the flex direction row.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,840
Then I don't want these elements to wrap.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,590
In other words, I don't want my job listings to appear below my sidebar.

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,110
I always want them to stay within a single row.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,960
So for that I will add the flex no wrap class which adds a flex wrap of no wrap.

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,780
And finally, I want to make sure that this div occupies the full width of its parent container, 100%

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,510
of the parent, or in other words, the full browser window.

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,340
So I'll add the W full class, which applies a width of 100%.

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,270
All right.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,640
So that takes care of our top level view.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,950
Let's now move on to our sidebar.

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,720
Our sidebar is going to be the thing on the left where the user filters the jobs based on certain criteria.

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,100
So right here, I will add some CSS classes as well on this top level div.

22
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,860
Let's make this a Flexbox as well.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,420
This is going to arrange all of the possible job filters in a column order.

24
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,900
So eventually when we render the filters for things like job type and location and college education,

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,690
etc., we want them to appear in a column format.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,090
So in addition to making this a Flexbox, I want to lay out the items in a column, not a row.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,910
So I'm going to apply the flex core class which will set the direction of this Flexbox as a column.

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,520
This is not to be confused with the Flexbox that we applied on the job results view component a second

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,640
ago, that Flexbox is going to still arrange the job filter sidebar in a row compared to the job listings

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,690
component side by side.

31
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,430
This is a separate Flexbox to arrange the children of this dev right here.

32
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,410
All right, let's add some padding.

33
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm going to do the P for class to apply a padding of one ram, which is going to be about 16 pixels

34
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,360
on the top, left, right and bottom.

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,720
That's just going to give us some space between the edges of the container and our actual filters themselves.

36
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,300
I want to make sure I have a white background so I can apply the big white class to give it a white

37
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,780
background.

38
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:28,860
Then we have a border between the job filter, sidebar and the job listings component, but that borders

39
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,260
only on the right side of the sidebar.

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,490
This is the border that separates that sidebar from the start of the job listings.

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,440
So what I can do is add a class called Border AR, which is short for border, right?

42
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,870
That's going to apply a one pixel border, but only on the right side of this box of this diff.

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,530
I want to make sure I have a solid border so I can do border solid.

44
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,560
And that's just to make sure it's not something like a dashed border.

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,770
It's going to be a straight one pixel straight line.

46
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,500
And then I can specify the actual color of that border line, and I can do that with my border class.

47
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:07,500
And we're actually going to use the brand gray, one color that we set up in our tailwind config file.

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,210
This is one of our custom gray colors.

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,820
So as always, as a quick reminder, Tailwind generates this file for us based on our configuration

50
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,220
in the tailwind dot config that JS file.

51
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,460
Finally, I want to add a width to this job for the sidebar and that's going to be 96.

52
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,060
That's going to add a width of 24 M and with a base size of 16 pixels, that's going to be about 384

53
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,300
pixel width for the sidebar on the left hand side of the screen.

54
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,130
Let me save that in prettier will arrange a lot of these classes kind of flowing downward.

55
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,050
So it's a little bit easier to read and I think that is a good place to finish up our styling for the

56
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,340
job filters sidebar.

57
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,580
Finally, we can move on to our job listings component.

58
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,980
Same deal here will apply some tailwind classes, but this time it will be our main element right here.

59
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,620
First, I'm going to apply the flex auto class.

60
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,750
What that is going to ensure is that this box will grow as the page with increases or shrinks.

61
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,340
It's going to grow in proportion.

62
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,730
Again, this is kind of for responsiveness sake.

63
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,430
We're not really building a fully responsive APS.

64
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:14,130
I'm not exactly sure how our app will look in mobile format or a smaller screen size, but this will

65
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:20,820
just help add a little bit of expandability to this content that is holding all of the job listings.

66
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,580
I do want to add some padding here all around my job listings, so I will add the paid class that is

67
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,700
going to apply a padding of two RAM or equivalently 32 pixels on the top, left, right and bottom.

68
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,120
So some spacing between the edges of the container and our job listings.

69
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,880
And then for this background, as we saw on the official website, it is that custom gray background

70
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,790
and we had that available in our brand gray to color so we can access the big classes which assign a

71
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,300
background.

72
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:55,590
But rather than using a built in tailwind background, we want to apply our custom brand gray to gray

73
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,130
background.

74
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:56,850
All right.

75
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,050
And that's going to be the entire box.

76
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,940
So if I navigate back to my.

77
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,380
Browser.

78
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,110
We should now see everything looking a little bit better.

79
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,640
Perfect.

80
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,920
So now we have our job filter side by right here.

81
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,740
It takes up 384 pixels to the right of that.

82
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,780
Using the Flexbox, we've arranged the job listings component and we have it with a nice gray background

83
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,300
and they're kind of arranged side by side now.

84
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,250
And furthermore, when we start laying out our items within the sidebar, they themselves are going

85
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,960
to fall in in a column format within the Flexbox in this sidebar.

86
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,730
So this is a good place to start and we will continue chipping away at the CC and the structure of these

87
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,590
two components in the upcoming lessons.
