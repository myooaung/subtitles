1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,500
Okay.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,740
So in this lesson, I want to introduce you to yet another helper function available in view X and it

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,350
is the map getters helper function.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,800
So let's begin by importing it at the top of our script section.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:20,370
So right above our component import, I'm going to import a named function called map getters.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:26,800
And this is going to come from the U.S. So you probably can guess what this function does.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,220
But let's do a quick review of all of the other map functions that we've used previously in the course.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,460
And just to make this easy on the right hand side, I've opened up my store index tags file where we

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,340
have all of our configuration for the View X Store.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,790
So you may recall that we have the map state function.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,870
What does that do?

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,700
It allows us to map properties from our view X Store, state these things right here.

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,270
It allows us to map that to component computed properties.

14
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,540
Right?

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,290
Similarly, we have the map mutations helper function.

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:05,820
What that does is it allows us to map or connect these mutation methods as regular methods on my component.

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,750
Similarly, we have the map actions helper.

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,600
What does that do?

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,190
It connects these action methods to our component as plane component methods.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,730
The key idea behind all of these helper functions is the same.

21
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,400
We want to take some part of the wax and make it available as some part of the component, right?

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,760
Usually as a local property or as a local method.

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,970
And if you think about what we're doing here in the computed property, we're doing something very similar.

24
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,380
We're defining a method, a computed property technically, but a method on our job filter, sidebar,

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,490
organization's component.

26
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:44,040
That method is called unique organizations, and all it does is it runs another method, which is the

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,820
getter method, honor view store.

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,900
So what Map Getters does is exactly what you might expect.

29
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:55,170
It allows us to have a shorthand syntax for connecting our getter methods to being regular component

30
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,590
methods.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,210
So it's going to do exactly what we're doing here for us behind the scenes, but with a much shorter

32
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,750
syntax.

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,070
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to comment out this code just so we can compare the before

34
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,520
and after.

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,720
And right here, I'm going to invoke my map getters function.

36
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,470
All right.

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,630
Now, just like many other Mac functions, this is going to return a JavaScript object.

38
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,240
And what we want to do is this structure the properties off that object, so they become top level computed

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,050
properties, right?

40
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,190
So this is actually going to be a combination of various reactive methods.

41
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,010
So we're going to take those methods and we're going to bring them out.

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,690
So there are top level computed methods on our job filter, sidebar organization's component.

43
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,960
Then what we give to map getters is an array of the names of the getter methods that we want to make

44
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,640
available on this component.

45
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,740
So in this case, we have just one getter.

46
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,470
It's called unique organizations, and luckily we have its name available here as an export it constant

47
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,060
unique organizations right here.

48
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,500
So I'm going to import this string and I'm going to pass it to my map getters function.

49
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,830
So right here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to import unique organizations.

50
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,390
That is the name of the getter method that we want to make available, and it's going to come from our

51
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:13,000
top level source directory, then the store folder and remember Node.js is going to look for an index

52
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,140
file by default.

53
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,140
So this is good enough to get it to find this file on the right.

54
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,290
Then what we provide to map getters is an array of the getter methods that we want to make available

55
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,970
on this component as methods.

56
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:31,000
So if I simply provide that string in unique organizations, what we're telling view is, Hey, find

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,860
the getter called unique organizations.

58
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,940
Find this thing right here and make it available as a top level.

59
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,240
This unique organization's method on my component.

60
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,630
So literally what we're doing is mapping getters or in other words, connecting getter methods.

61
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,960
Honor of using store to component methods on our component.

62
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,960
So this right here is doing the exact same thing as what we're doing on lines 36 to 38 is going to use

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,870
the name of the getter as the name of the component method.

64
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,980
It's going to be one in the same.

65
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,620
There is a way to customize that, but typically I just provide an array here and provide the name of

66
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,160
the exact getter name as it is in the store definition file.

67
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,080
And the advantage of this approach, of course, is if we want, for example, five getters, we simply

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,700
provide an array of five strings.

69
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,830
We don't need to manually define five computed methods, each one of which simply talks to a different

70
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,160
getter.

71
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,520
It's a much more simpler, shorter syntax for accomplishing the same thing.

72
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,780
So now what I'm going to do is remove this former code because we're accomplishing the same result.

73
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,920
Save this.

74
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,210
The test is going to rerun it, and we're going to see everything still passes because under the hood

75
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,890
it's doing the exact same thing that we were just doing manually.

76
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,770
It's just a little bit more of a shortcut.

77
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,280
All right.

78
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,020
So to summarize, what Map Getters does is it allows us to connect our getter methods from the view

79
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,140
store to become regular component methods.

80
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,910
We invoke the function, we do structure the return value, which is an object of methods.

81
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,000
And what we provide to map getters is an array of strings.

82
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:01,500
Those strings represent the getters that we want to move or map over from the UX to our component.

83
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,120
So in any other component that we want to use this getter, we can simply use this syntax again in the

84
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,260
computed property section.

85
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:13,680
And then the other component will also have access to this unique organization's set of unique organization

86
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,040
strings.

87
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:14,730
All right.

88
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,520
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

89
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,090
So I will see you in the next one.
