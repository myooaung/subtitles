1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,450
All right.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,920
So super quick lesson here.

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:08,680
You'll notice that if you try to launch your app in the browser now, the app will load, but the jobs

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,090
page actually will not work.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,100
And the reason for this is because of this change we made in our store index test file.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,500
You may recall that we created this key that we need in order to get access to the View Store.

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,590
And we use this key in a component wherever we used the use store function to enable the proper type

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,520
checking for the actual shape of the store, more specifically its state.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,670
Unfortunately, we also have these composable is right here in the source store composable stats function

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,490
and these also require the key to now work.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,890
Otherwise these getters and this action right here will simply fail, which will cause the corresponding

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,550
component that relies on these composable to not work properly as well.

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,770
Luckily, the solution is going to be pretty simple.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,330
We just need to import the key.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,740
So right here I'm going to import the key based on the file on the right.

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,660
So that's going to be from my source directory and then the stored directory in there, which is going

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,160
to target the index file.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,770
And then obviously everywhere where we are using use store, we simply have to provide that key and

19
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,420
that's going to give it access to the store.

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,850
And with that, everything should work again in the browser.

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,950
So you store, you store it, you store finally right here, you store as well, make sure you provided

22
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,300
the key as the first argument.

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,150
Save if you have any issues, just try to restart the view app in the terminal as well.

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,640
But otherwise this should get everything fixed up again.

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,270
All right.

26
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,160
And with that, I will see you in the next lesson.
