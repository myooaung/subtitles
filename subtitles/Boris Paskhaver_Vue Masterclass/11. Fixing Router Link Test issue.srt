1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,410
All right.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,520
So we have added a lot of functionality to our job listings component.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,230
We have added the current page.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,070
We have added the conditional router links to the previous and next page.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,310
And I do want to add tests for all of this functionality.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,540
But before we get there, I want to make sure all of our tests are still passing.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,390
So I'm going to go ahead and run NPM, run, test, colon, watch, just to run our full test sweep.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,130
And if you get an issue like this where it says no tests found, that's simply related to your last

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,670
get commit.

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,520
If you ever see this, just press h run all your tests.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,080
So I'm going to run all of my tests and we're going to see they're all passing.

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,910
But we are getting some warnings.

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,680
And if I scroll up, we'll see that they're all coming from our job listings tests.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,580
And that's actually an issue that we've seen before several times throughout the course.

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,140
You can see the output tells me it failed to resolve component, root or link.

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,040
We added these router link components from the view router library.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,980
But of course whenever you test utils mounts our job listings component, it has no clue that Vue router

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,520
exists.

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,150
So it doesn't know what these router link components are when we're rendering them.

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,880
It gets confused and offers us this warning.

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,560
So I'm going to open up my job listings test suite.

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,710
I'm going to drag it over here on the right.

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,560
And we're going to use the exact same solution that we used previously in the course.

24
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,900
We're going to stub out this child component with the available router link stub component from the

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,310
view test utils library.

26
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,910
So right here, I'm going to import router link stub that is available directly from view test utils

27
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:38,460
because replacing router link is such a common operation whenever we're testing a component that utilizes

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,420
that child component.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,030
And then where we actually provide that stub is in this global object right here.

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,730
And we are getting that global object as part of the master configuration object that we get from calling

31
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,100
create config in every single one of our tests.

32
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,110
And the cool thing about this design is we can simply write our code once right here for the stabbing

33
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,970
and any test that we write moving forward that uses the create config function.

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,740
We'll never have to worry about it again.

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,390
So right here I'm going to add a new property in my global object called Stubs.

36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,430
This is a JavaScript object.

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,890
And as a reminder, the way this works is the properties here represent the child components and the

38
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,350
value represents what we want to stub it out with, or in other words, what we want to replace it with.

39
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,830
So I want to replace every occurrence of router link.

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,830
And the only reason I'm writing this in quotes is because we need to specify the dash here, and that

41
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,500
is not valid syntax for a JavaScript property.

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,410
It is valid if it's in quotes, but it's not valid without them.

43
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,380
So I'm going to add that as the name of the component.

44
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,210
I want to step out and of course I want to replace every occurrence of it with router linked stub,

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,070
which I just imported from above.

46
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,390
All right.

47
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,430
So now we're going to see that Vue test utils is going to replace every occurrence of router link that

48
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,720
it sees with router link stub.

49
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,760
It knows what router link stub is.

50
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,670
So doesn't care any more about the occurrence of this right here.

51
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,640
It doesn't care where it came from because it's going to replace it anyway.

52
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,570
And you see now that all of our tests are passing and we're getting no warnings.

53
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,170
All right.

54
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,260
So this is a good place to leave off.

55
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,410
And in the very next lesson, we're going to start tackling the tests for all of this functionality.
