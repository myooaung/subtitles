00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.150
Okay.

2
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.650
So super quick lesson here.

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:08.650
We are moving right along on our journey to convert our code base to TypeScript and we are focusing

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.880
first on all of the Vex related functionality in our store directory.

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.310
So one of the simplest files here is our constants that Yes.

6
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.250
File where we have all of our constants for things like getters, actions, mutations, etc..

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.190
So let's go ahead and move this file to TypeScript as well.

8
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.690
So right here, right click and we're going to rename it and change the extension to.

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.790
Yes, there we go.

10
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.220
And you can see there are no violations in this file.

11
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.900
And now if I hover my mouse over one of these constants, you can see that TypeScript recognizes that

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.730
it's not just a string, but a constant string set to a fixed value.

13
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.120
All right.

14
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.960
Pretty simple.

15
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.050
Files like these are always super fun to do, and that's all there is to cover here.

16
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.820
So I'll see you in the next lesson.
