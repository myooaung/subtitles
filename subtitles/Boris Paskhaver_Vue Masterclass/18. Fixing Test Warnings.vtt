00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.900
Okay.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.410
So in the previous lesson, we added some prop validation logic to our action button component and that's

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.530
actually going to affect the test output that we see.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.680
So let's go ahead and rerun our test suite.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.510
I'm going to run NPM, run test colon.

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.020
Watch.

7
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.990
It's going to run just in watch mode, which means it's going to rerun every time there's a change.

8
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.250
If you get something like this, not a problem, press a to rerun all of our tests.

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.770
So we're going to run our test and we're not going to get a failure, but we are going to get a warning

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.000
right here for action.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.800
But button that test that J component.

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.440
You can see here, Vue is warning us that some test is missing a required prop of text.

13
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.750
This is great because now we're not just getting the benefits in our browser for our new app.

14
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.840
We're actually consolidating with our tests and allowing us to write tests that are more reflective

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.610
of how the component is meant to be used.

16
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.310
So what it's telling us is one of the components that we're mounting is missing a text prop, which

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.520
the action button component expects it's required.

18
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.910
Right?

19
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.970
So if I open up my action button component again, just so we can quickly see if we said that the text

20
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.420
prop is going to be a string and that is required.

21
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.090
But right here in our second test, we are not providing that text prop.

22
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.840
All right.

23
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.920
And so we have to provide it.

24
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.860
So it doesn't really matter what it says because it can be anything.

25
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.460
So I'm going to copy it from right here and add it right here.

26
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.350
Make sure to include the com at the end and when the whole test suite runs, we're going to get a passing

27
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.450
test as well as no warnings.

28
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.530
Warnings are not the worst thing in the world, but they are an indication that something can be improved.

29
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.180
And this is a perfect example.

30
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:47.730
Now, somebody looking at our tests knows that text is a text as required and that we can provide something

31
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.940
here.

32
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.790
Alternatively, if you're thinking about the type prop which is no longer required, we can, for example,

33
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.670
remove the type prop right here and double check.

34
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.700
The test still passes because we're checking that fallback condition that it will default to the primary

35
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.000
string.

36
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.110
So I think that's okay.

37
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.090
I think it's okay to have a test for the fallback and a test for maybe a different value like secondary.

38
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.930
But for now, I'm okay with these results, so I'm going to leave it as is.

39
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.350
So that's just a quick reminder to rerun your test suite frequently.

40
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.550
In fact, after you make any change just to make sure nothing is broken because sometimes it's going

41
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.710
to give you these warnings that will help you improve not just your components, but also the tests

42
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.610
that test them.

43
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.410
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

44
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.850
So I will see you in the next one.
