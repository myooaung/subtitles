00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.200
All right.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.180
So we are going to close this section off with a little bit of a refactor.

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.590
This is something that we've been talking about doing for a while now, and it is organizing the components

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.150
within our components folder.

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.160
So if I open up my source directory and my components folder, we currently have seven components here

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.720
and there is no structure or organization to them.

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.150
Now I still think seven is a manageable number, but you can imagine if you hold all your components

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.310
in a single top level directory, pretty soon it's going to become difficult to understand which components

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.180
are related, right?

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.830
So it's not a good idea to have a components directory with 50 components, 100 components, etc..

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.340
And so what we can start with is to start organizing these components into subdirectories within the

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.120
components folder.

13
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.360
And there's many different discussions on the best way to do this.

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.210
What I'm typically going to do or what I typically favor is organizing the components by the feature

15
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.870
within the app.

16
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.260
So to start off, I'm going to create a subdirectory called Navigation and that folder is going to hold

17
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.480
any components that deal with navigation.

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.230
So we're going to move our main nav component, our sub nav component and our profile image component

19
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.910
into that navigation folder.

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.070
Now, you might argue that profile image is maybe a shared component that we're going to use elsewhere,

21
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.150
and maybe that is true.

22
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.910
But for now we're only using our profile image in our NAV, so I'm going to stick it within the navigation

23
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.240
folder.

24
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.170
So let's begin by creating a nested directory.

25
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.220
I can do that in this code by pressing this second button right here, and I'm going to call this folder

26
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.940
navigation.

27
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.810
And what I'm going to do is drag my main now that view component into here.

28
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.050
All right.

29
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.960
And you're going to notice that our Vitter extension is going to pop up.

30
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.670
So make sure you install this extension.

31
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.090
Extension.

32
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.530
We did this earlier in the course.

33
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.510
And what it's going to do for us is it's going to automatically update the imports.

34
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.990
So wherever we imported main NAV previously, it's now going to add the navigation directory before

35
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.680
that import.

36
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.930
So if I actually click this show preview button, we're going to see that we are importing main nav

37
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.410
in our app dot view file and in our main NAV that test, that gas file and previously we were importing

38
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.840
from component slash main nav view.

39
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.960
And now of course it's going to import from component slash navigation, slash main navigate view to

40
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.480
account for that new navigation folder, which is perfect.

41
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.940
That's a great thing that the extension is doing for us.

42
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.380
And of course, to confirm it from this refactor preview pane, we can click this check mark.

43
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.420
And that will simultaneously move the component and make those changes.

44
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.180
In fact, it looks like what it did for me is it opened up those two files so I can see the changes.

45
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.860
So here's an app dot view.

46
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.820
This looks good.

47
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.180
We are importing may now from components navigation main nav.

48
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.050
Sounds good.

49
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.490
So I'll save this file and close it.

50
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.590
And here is may now test that.

51
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.980
Yes.

52
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.170
And right here we are indeed importing it from components navigation may now.

53
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.510
Great.

54
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.580
So I'm going to save that and close this.

55
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.560
And I think moving forward for our other two component moves, I'm just going to click the okay button

56
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.150
and I think beta will automatically perform the changes instead of having us go through every file.

57
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.040
Okay, so I'm going to drag our sub navigate view component into our navigation folder as well.

58
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.150
There is our extension of beta making its noise again.

59
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.690
So I'm going to click.

60
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.140
Okay.

61
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.190
All right.

62
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.140
So it looks like it made those changes automatically.

63
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.200
And then I'm also going to drag the profile image view component into navigation as well.

64
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.850
And I'm going to press.

65
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.240
Okay.

66
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.150
Okay.

67
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.650
So that completes the first part of our refactor.

68
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.490
As far as these three components, we're going to make some additional directories in upcoming lessons.

69
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.060
But there's one additional change that I'd like to make, and that is updating our tests folder to reflect

70
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.980
the changes that we just made.

71
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.050
So as you may recall, within tests unit components, we have component test files for each component.

72
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.610
In fact, I think we're missing some file tests or some test files for the for the job search form component

73
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.660
we created in this section.

74
00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.150
Rest assured, we will add tests for it later.

75
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.880
But for now, what I'd like to do is create a directory structure within this components folder that's

76
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.040
going to be identical to what we have right here.

77
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.010
So in my tests unit components directory, I will create a new navigation folder.

78
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.690
And I'm going to drag the tests for the corresponding components into navigation.

79
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.230
So let's move our main navigate test that jazz file into navigation.

80
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.730
Let's move our sub nav test into navigation and let's move our profile image test into navigation.

81
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.210
Okay, so let me open up these files and just double check that everything looks good.

82
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.980
So I'm going to open up main nav and nothing should really change in here because we're still importing

83
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.140
Main now from its correct position because Veeder took care of those changes for us and same thing's

84
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.890
should apply to profile image that is doesn't look correct because profile image now lives in navigation

85
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.410
so let's make sure we import it from navigation right here.

86
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.030
That looks good.

87
00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.080
And by the way, if we forgot one of these changes, don't worry, because we can always run our test

88
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.970
suite and our test suite will tell us that we're forgetting an import.

89
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.550
So right here, profile image in components navigation looks good.

90
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.580
And sub nav.

91
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.790
We do indeed need to make sure we are importing some nav from our from our navigation subfolder within

92
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.110
components that looks good.

93
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.380
And in May NAV for some reason it all already had that.

94
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.870
So I'm not sure why one updated the others didn't.

95
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.950
But for now this is good.

96
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.670
And let's just confirm everything is working fine by opening up our terminal and running our test suite

97
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.910
here.

98
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.470
So I'm going to run it once with NPM run test colon unit.

99
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.270
Let's see what happens here.

100
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.690
We shouldn't have to adjust anything on the just side because it automatically looks for any test files

101
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.300
within the test directory.

102
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.170
Even if we have nested directories, it goes down to any level of recursion.

103
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.850
So that shouldn't be a problem.

104
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.870
It should be able to find them.

105
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.400
However, our test files can be referencing imports from the wrong folder and it looks like we do have

106
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.180
one failure here.

107
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.360
So if I scroll up here, let's see what I'm checking here.

108
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.870
Cannot locate module components profile image dot view.

109
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.120
So something is going on in May now that test that yes, I'm guessing it could be that either the test

110
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.830
file is importing something wrong or the test follows rendering a component that is importing something

111
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.010
wrong.

112
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.060
So we will figure it out.

113
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.280
So let's start with main nav test.

114
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.780
We are importing may nav from components navigation may nav.

115
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.440
That is correct.

116
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.040
So let us then proceed proceed to the main nav view component.

117
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.920
And here is, I think where the problem is going to be.

118
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.050
Here we are importing those components from the original location and not the correct one.

119
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:40.190
So our profile image is now going to come from navigation slash profile image and our sub nav is also

120
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.510
going to come from components navigation sub nav dot view.

121
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.470
So let's save that.

122
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.850
And that is the beauty of tests is they can catch those kinds of failures for us.

123
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.740
Let's once again run our complete test suite.

124
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.670
Never hurts to run it and perfect.

125
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.560
So we have everything passing, which means all of our tests which are importing their respective components

126
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.960
are importing them successfully in order to test them.

127
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.300
So this has been a step in the right direction.

128
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:04.930
All right.

129
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.860
So that completes one nested folder.

130
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.830
We're going to make a few more in the upcoming lessons.
