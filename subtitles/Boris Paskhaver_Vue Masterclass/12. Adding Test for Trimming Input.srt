1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,350
Okay.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,410
So in this lesson, I want to add a third test, and I might consider this test to be a little bit excessive.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,720
I'm not always going to be a fan of this test, but I do want to double check that we are correctly

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,890
trimming the input.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,890
In other words, I want to validate that if the user gives me an input with whitespace, I want to make

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,550
sure that the value I am sending to the View X Store does not have it.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:31,270
The reason this is technically not a great test is because we are testing core view functionality.

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:38,740
We are validating that the trim input modifier is working as expected and it is not our job or responsibility

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,240
to test the view library.

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,950
Those tests belong in view.

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,310
They're not specific to our app, however, because this functionality is so critical to how our logic

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,950
in the store is going to work to filter the jobs correctly.

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,350
Just for my own sanity, I feel comfortable kind of violating that best practice and just adding a single

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,480
test to make sure my term is being trimmed.

15
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,360
And the good news is, it's going to be pretty simple to write this test.

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,750
So what I'm going to do is copy my previous test from the last lesson, paste the below, and I'm going

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,430
to change my description here to be.

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:18,830
It removes whitespace from user input and most of my test setup is going to stay exactly the same.

19
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,530
So I'm going to keep track of my commit just function.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,830
I'm going to mount the component, look for the input and enter a value.

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,810
And the key difference here is in going to modify this value, of course, to have a whole bunch of

22
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,380
spaces.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,490
It doesn't matter how many you put, let's just put a couple at the very beginning and very end.

24
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,580
And we're going to verify that what we send off to our View X Store, which of course is testing what

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,840
commit has been invoked with, should be not this string but the trend string.

26
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,490
So these arguments are going to be the exact same as they were in the previous lesson.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,740
Just view developer with no space at the beginning or end.

28
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,350
So we are testing that view as correctly removing this.

29
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:54,980
All right.

30
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,770
So say that that should correctly work.

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,230
There we go.

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,510
And if we want to validate that that is not working, we can, of course, remove trim and that should

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,900
get it to fail because View X should receive the full string.

34
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,430
Right now you can see it's going to say, Hey, you told me to expect this string, but instead I'm

35
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,400
getting the original string, which proves that trim is working correctly.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,170
So right here I'm going to add Trim back in.

37
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,350
And now we are validating this logic that we have it right here.

38
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,070
All right.

39
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,630
So that's all there is to cover here.

40
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:31,060
And I think I'm pretty happy with the tests we have for our job, the sidebar skills component.

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,250
So the next lesson, we can move on to implementing our actual filter jobs getter.

42
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,270
So I'll see you there.
