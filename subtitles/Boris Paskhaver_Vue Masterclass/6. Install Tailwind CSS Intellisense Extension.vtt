00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.110
Okay.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.350
So in this lesson, we're going to install a super helpful voice code extension that's going to enable

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.820
IntelliSense for our tailwind success classes in voice code.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.640
What that basically means is we're going to be able to see all of the available tailwind styles in line

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.650
in our code editor, which of course makes it a lot easier because we don't always have to reference

6
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.820
the Tailwind website.

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.420
So let's go ahead and head to our extensions panel.

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.920
That's going to be this collection of cubes here on the left hand side.

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.070
And the extension that I want to search for is just tailwind.

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.400
And this is going to be the very top result of Tailwind sees us IntelliSense from Tailwind Labs.

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.200
You can see it has more than a million downloads.

12
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.780
So go ahead and install that extension.

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.840
And afterwards I'm going to close this and then I'm going to reopen the app dot view component from

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.770
the previous lesson.

15
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.720
So in source components, actually at the top level of source, we're going to have app view and let

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.890
me show you how this is going to work.

17
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.650
I'm going to remove my MTA class here and I'm just going to begin by typing something like MTA.

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.950
And if the extension doesn't automatically work, you can also try holding control and pressing space.

19
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.140
And that's going to bring up this intelligence.

20
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.070
And this is actually what tailwind suggests the extension gives to us.

21
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.600
Sometimes this box will pop up automatically.

22
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.890
Sometimes you have to trigger it using the control key and spacebar.

23
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.530
It's just a matter of yes code kind of registering it.

24
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.490
But as you can see here, the benefit here is we're going to see all of our empty classes.

25
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.310
And even better than that, on the right hand side in the box, we're going to see the exact CSS properties

26
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.030
that they attacked.

27
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.880
So, for example, if I move down through these empty classes, we're going to see that empty eight,

28
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.700
which is the one that we originally had, is setting a as property of margin top two to RAM, which

29
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.230
with a font size of 16 pixels of the default, as you can see on the right hand side is equal to 32

30
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.620
pixels.

31
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.730
So empty eight is going to add 32 pixels of margin on the top.

32
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.510
Similarly, I can simply start typing a word like text and then try and control space and we're going

33
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.450
to see all of these available tailwind utility classes.

34
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.720
Right.

35
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.380
And again, on the right hand side, we're going to see the properties, the attach.

36
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.930
So for example, text center, which we have on the right hand side, is going to add text.

37
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.990
A line is set to center.

38
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.760
Then as I move down to all of these, we're going to see some of the available size related ones.

39
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.020
So text access, extra small, small base, large Excel.

40
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.750
And then again, we're going to see all those styles in the right hand side.

41
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.520
We previously had six excel here.

42
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.060
We can see that that adds a font size that is equal to 60 pixels.

43
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.660
Perfect.

44
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.030
So I can simply press enter and locked into place.

45
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.620
It works the exact same way that the IntelliSense works for any other language here in this code.

46
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.000
All right, I'm going to save this.

47
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.100
And that's really all there is to cover in this lesson.

48
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.750
Make sure you install this extension because it's going to be super helpful with identifying styles

49
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.160
and helping you kind of have this documentation in line in your editor.

50
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.760
All right.

51
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.620
And with that, I will see you in the next lesson.
