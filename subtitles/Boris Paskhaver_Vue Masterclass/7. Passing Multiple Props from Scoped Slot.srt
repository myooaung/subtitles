1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,330
Okay.

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:08,080
So given that slot props are a pretty advanced and complex idea, I want to review and reinforce the

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,840
concepts of the previous lessons by creating an alternate implementation of our spotlight component.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:20,230
So we're still going to use a slot props, but instead of providing a single spotlight prop, what we're

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,090
going to do is provide multiple ones.

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,340
And the way we're going to do that is by breaking up the spotlight object that we are iterating over.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:27,820
All right.

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,470
And that's just going to give us more examples of the syntax and hopefully a better understanding of

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,800
what these props represent and what slot props here represents.

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,600
I know that you may have a good grasp of these concepts as it stands, but I do want to reinforce them

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,830
in case you want another review, another shot, to understand what these things mean.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,980
So what I'm going to do in spotlight is I'm going to remove my former spotlight component and I'm going

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,160
to decide that I'm actually going to provide three props to my parent and image prop, a title prop

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,780
and a description prop.

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,080
And each one is going to extract the relevant piece of information from my spotlight object that I'm

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,900
currently iterating over in my V for loop.

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,440
Right?

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,980
So if I want an image prop, I want to do IMG here.

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,530
That would be the name of my prop and I can provide a reference to Spotlight Dot IMG.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,340
As always, you should know this by now and I apologize for repeating it 100 times.

21
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,970
This will not work because we will think we're literally providing a string.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,610
So if we want to bind to this prop so that it refers to a dynamic value, we have to use the V bind

23
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,060
syntax.

24
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,120
So now we are connecting the IMG prop to the IMG property on the current spotlight object that we are

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,810
iterating over.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,660
I'm going to do the exact same syntax for two more props here, so I will define a title prop.

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,410
And I'm going to give it access to Spotlight that title.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,710
So simply referencing existing properties on the objects that we define in our debate adjacent file.

29
00:01:54,070 --> 00:02:00,250
Then one more prop, I'll call it description and I'll dynamically bind it to spotlight dot description.

30
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,910
Okay.

31
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,840
So previously we were passing one prop up of spotlight.

32
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,250
Now we're passing three up.

33
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,440
But the concept does not change, right?

34
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,160
So on the left hand side here, we still use this type of syntax.

35
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,860
We still create a name for the object.

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,330
It's going to store our props.

37
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,720
Right.

38
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,240
So for now, I'm still going to call it slot props.

39
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,030
But now slot props is an object with three top level properties.

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,500
IMG Title and description.

41
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,980
Right.

42
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,720
We no longer pass it the whole object.

43
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,520
So we no longer have that spotlight.

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,250
But we do have that image, that title, that description.

45
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,690
So that allows us to simplify some of the syntax we're doing here.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,750
So, for example, in this image element where we are dynamically binding to the source attribute.

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,170
Now we don't have a spotlight object, but we do have a top level IMG property on slot props.

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,640
So there we go.

49
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,210
Slot props.

50
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:58,270
That IMG references this thing right here, which is the string from the object right here on the slot

51
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:58,950
props object.

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,680
We no longer have spotlight, but we do have a new title property.

53
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,170
And right here, instead of Spotlight, we have description.

54
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,200
And if I save this and go back to my browser.

55
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,310
We're going to see when you refresh that the thing still works as expected.

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:14,790
All right.

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,780
There we have the data.

58
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,240
And just to show you that the name is totally up to us.

59
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,840
I can change slot props to be whatever I want.

60
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,270
In fact, just for the sake of example, you do not have to copy this.

61
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,290
I'm literally going to change slot props to be a name of whatever I want.

62
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,960
The key takeaway that I want you to notice here is that this object name is up to us.

63
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,650
It's just going to represent the object of props that we define right here.

64
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,150
And whatever we call it here in this double quotes is what we have to use throughout.

65
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,280
So it's simply a matter of knowing what properties you have available on that object as they are defined

66
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,210
by the child component.

67
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,950
So once again, I'm going to save this.

68
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,940
Go back to my browser.

69
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,680
There it is.

70
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,140
It's working.

71
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,280
Refresh, just to prove it.

72
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,480
Refresh one more time.

73
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,670
Everything is still working out as expected.

74
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,690
The reason there's a little bit of a delay is because we're waiting for the JSON server to return the

75
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,370
data so that it can be iterated over.

76
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,060
All right.

77
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,830
That's all there is to learn in this lesson.

78
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:12,300
The key idea is that we can provide whatever name we want here, whatever properties we want to access

79
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,720
as well.

80
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,430
As long as we define them on the child component, so we are not obligated to pass up an object or a

81
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,480
complex data structure.

82
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,750
We can totally break it up into as many props as we want.

83
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,470
Of course, the ultimate goal, as always, is readability and simplicity.

84
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,710
If you have a lot of data, it might be easier to store it in a single object.

85
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,120
If you have things like this where we have three pieces of information, I don't think this is offensive.

86
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,650
I think this is pretty simple and it gives a reader a better understanding of what we're passing up.

87
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,750
It really is up to your personal preference as far as what code better communicates your intent and

88
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,430
what you want to pass up to the parent.

89
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:44,910
All right.

90
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,680
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

91
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,330
So I will see you in the next one.
