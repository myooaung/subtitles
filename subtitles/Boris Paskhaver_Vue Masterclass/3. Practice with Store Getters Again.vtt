00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.360
Okay.

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.970
So super quick lesson here.

3
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.910
The next thing I want to replace is my former filter jobs getter.

4
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.830
But the good news is, is we already have a composable function that gives us our filter jobs.

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.450
So as a reminder, if I open up my composable gas file in my source store directory, we already wrote

6
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.330
a helper composable function called Use Filter Jobs, which talks to the View Store and gets the filter

7
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.990
jobs getter.

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.880
We previously use this on our sub nav where we are showing the count of filter jobs.

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.270
So we already extracted this logic to a reusable function.

10
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.240
And let's go ahead and use it in our job listings component.

11
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.170
So right here, what I'm going to do is import.

12
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.380
Use filter jobs and that is going to come from my source directory store composable.

13
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.320
All right.

14
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.540
And in my setup method where we're going to store all this logic, I'm simply going to say cons two

15
00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.860
filter jobs is going to be the return value of use filter jobs, which is going to be a reactive object

16
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.350
storing the those jobs from the getter as the getter updates, which is going to happen when the view

17
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.110
store updates so well this logic right here.

18
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.560
All right.

19
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.040
Now obviously we're using this filter jobs getter in several places.

20
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.770
We're using it, for example, right here to get its length.

21
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.360
We're using it right here to slice.

22
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.430
So we're not quite done with it just yet.

23
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.150
But this is a good place to start and it allows us to clear this line right here.

24
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.360
We no longer need it because we've replaced it with its own functionality.

25
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.090
The next thing we're going to need to do is to wire up our former computed properties that depend on

26
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.320
this array of jobs.

27
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.450
But we're going to do that in the very next lesson.

28
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.470
So I'll see you there.
