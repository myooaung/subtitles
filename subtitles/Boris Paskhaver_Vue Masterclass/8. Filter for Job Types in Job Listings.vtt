00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.450
Okay.

2
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.340
So let's validate that we are able to filter jobs using just job types.

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.490
I want to test this feature in isolation before we combine it with the organization filtering feature.

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.860
So I'm going to open up our old friend the job listings dot view component.

5
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.270
As a reminder, in this component, we are accessing the filter jobs by organization getter.

6
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.480
We're getting it right here because that is the getter that is filtering our array of jobs based on

7
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.520
the organizational checkboxes that the user has selected on the left hand side, which have traveled

8
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.580
all the way to view X.

9
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.330
So what I'm just going to do is replace this filter jobs by organization's getter with the one that

10
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.650
we defined in this section called filter jobs by job types.

11
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.030
So right here, let's import filter jobs by job types instead.

12
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.610
So I'm going to replace organizations with job types.

13
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.780
That's going to.

14
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.430
Click on this and copy it so I can paste the right here.

15
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.090
And we are using that former getter in a couple other places.

16
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.030
For example, right here in a next page computed property.

17
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.310
We are dividing our filter jobs by ten to figure out how many pages we have.

18
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.700
So right here I'm going to replace this with filter jobs by job types.

19
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.790
And right here this displayed jobs computed property is talking to that array and slicing it to get

20
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.230
just the correct amount of ten jobs depending on what page ran.

21
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.840
So here, obviously we want to replace filter jobs by organizations with filter jobs by job types.

22
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.480
Everything else basically is going to stay the same here.

23
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.150
We're fetching the jobs here we are fetching them, which basically means invoking the view ax action

24
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.720
to get them.

25
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.700
And then this displayed jobs computed property is what we're iterating over with av4 right here we are

26
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.030
rendering a job listing component for each one and passing the job.

27
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.820
So all of this template logic should remain the same.

28
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.730
We're basically just going to alter where our array of jobs, of filter jobs is coming from now it's

29
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.830
going to be coming from the getter that is using the job types instead of the getter that was using

30
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.550
organizations.

31
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.740
But the logic should be basically the same.

32
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.780
So if I navigate to my web browser and let me just refresh the page to make certain, obviously now

33
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.190
we've kind of inverted everything.

34
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.610
So if I click on an organization, nothing will happen, but that's to be expected.

35
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.680
But now the page loads is fine.

36
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.120
And when I click on a job type such as part time, you should see where filtering the jobs on the right.

37
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.280
Now, there's nothing actually in our display that shows that this is a part time job, but the mere

38
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.600
fact that they are changing whenever I filter is kind of proof to me that it is working.

39
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.170
All right.

40
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.430
And just if we wanted to validate, for example, what I can do is just click part time right here.

41
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.190
Bring up my view devtools.

42
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.180
And then go to something like my components to right here.

43
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.190
I'm going to go two components right here.

44
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.440
Let's see if it loads me.

45
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.130
Refresh it.

46
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.820
There we go.

47
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.730
I'm going to go to my job results view.

48
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.010
I'm going to go to my job listings and we can see display jobs is an array of ten jobs.

49
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.120
And in theory, if I go over any of these objects, the job type should be part time.

50
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.730
We can see part time right here on the first object.

51
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.880
If I go into random object here, we can see it's part time as well.

52
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.970
Part time as well, part time as well.

53
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.800
So even though this piece of information isn't visually displayed on each job, I have kind of the comfort

54
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.880
here from a technical perspective that we are indeed filtering.

55
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.160
The correct jobs to appear right here.

56
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.700
And obviously, if I can select this, if I select all four, it looks like everything is working as

57
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.240
we expect.

58
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.380
We can see those changes on the right.

59
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.910
So I'm feeling pretty good.

60
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.660
All right.

61
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.210
So we've got these two independent features built.

62
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.370
We're able to filter by job type right now, but unfortunately, we've broken our filtering by organizations.

63
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.500
And our ultimate intent in this section was to allow the user to filter by both at any given time.

64
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.440
So this is the part where things are going to start to come together.

65
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.820
We're going to start to talk about more new View X features, and we're going to start on that in the

66
00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.470
next lesson when we're going to start talking about how we can consolidate those getters that are filtering

67
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.760
together into one.

68
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.720
So I'll see you there.
