00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.410
Okay.

2
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.920
So in this lesson, it will create a basic accordion component and then render it within our job filters

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.000
sidebar component.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.130
So here in my file Explorer, I'm going to go into my source directory then components.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.710
And I think a good place to put this is actually going to be within our shared folder because I can

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.570
see us having to use a shared accordion component in several places throughout the app.

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.390
We're going to try to build it in such a way that we extract the reusable elements of it the collapse

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.290
ability and the expandability, while allowing components to customize what goes inside it.

9
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.750
We're going to talk a lot more about that later on, but that is our intent here.

10
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.690
So in the shared directory, I'm going to create a new accordion dot view view component.

11
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.100
All right.

12
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.800
Now let's go ahead and wire up the basics of this component.

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.040
So I'm going to create a template tag right here and in here.

14
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.400
I'm just going to put a basic div for now with the text of my accordion just to make sure we have something

15
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.260
rendered on the screen when we render this.

16
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.290
And then as always, we will define a script section where we will export default a JavaScript object.

17
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.060
For now, I'm just going to give it a simple name, a property with the name of the component.

18
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.980
And that of course is going to be accordion, and that is it, as simple as we can make it.

19
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.610
All right.

20
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.760
Now, I want to render this accordion component, so I'm going to open up my job filter's sidebar component.

21
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.880
We were just working on this a lesson or two ago, and right here I'm going to import my newly created

22
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.360
component.

23
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.830
So import accordion and that is going to come from the source directory components, also the shared

24
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.260
directory and finally accordion and we're going to register it with our components object right here.

25
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.220
So accordion and for now, let's, let's just go ahead and render it within our section right here.

26
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.170
And I'm just going to render it with a self-closing tag accordion like.

27
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.740
So save that and let's head back to our browser and see what we have.

28
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.330
All right, there we go.

29
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.970
We have our accordion component being rendered right here.

30
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.710
Pretty simple, basic div.

31
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.590
But we have confirmed that everything is set up correctly.

32
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.270
We have a new view component, we are rendering it and the very next lesson, we can start to style

33
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.500
the accordion component.
