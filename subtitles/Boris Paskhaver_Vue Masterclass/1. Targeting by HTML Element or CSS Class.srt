1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,260
All right.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:07,650
So welcome to the next section of the course in this section will introduce some caveats regarding how

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,290
Vue and CSA work together.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:17,160
So here I have my app dot view file and I want to begin by adding an H1 above our rendered hello world

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,700
component.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,130
So right here I'm going to an H1 and I'm going to give it some sample text like Hello, I am in app

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,090
dot view and I'm going to save this and of course we're going to see those changes on the right hand

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,980
side here is the H1.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,810
And so as I mentioned in the previous section, we have this style section in every component.

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,570
And of course the ideal is that we're going to use this section to provide CSR styles for the content

11
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,920
in our template section.

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,370
So you might think to yourself, I want to style my H1 tag, let's say we want to make this text right

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,120
here purple.

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,010
So what I'm going to do is go to my style section and I'm going to add my element or tag selector.

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,160
So we're going to target an H1 and this is all Valencia Sass.

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,940
And right here, I'm going to say that I want its color to be purple.

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:04,480
All right.

18
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,330
And when I save this file we're going to see indeed that the color of hello.

19
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,490
I am an apt w is indeed going to be purple.

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,310
We're also going to see some unintended consequences.

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,260
So let's save this file and see what happens.

22
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,610
All right.

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,600
So on the right hand side, we see indeed that our H1 is now in purple.

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,580
We have a little bit of a problem.

25
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,670
This helloworld text has also become purple.

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,170
So what is going on here?

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,250
Well, remember, in our app component, we are rendering our hello world component.

28
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,800
And if I open up that file so I'm going to open up the file using my file explorer, which you can access

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,860
with command P on a mac or control P on windows.

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,140
And so here I'm going to look for my Helloworld file.

31
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,940
In our Helloworld file, I'm going to scroll to the template section and right here at the very top.

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,430
Lo and behold, we are indeed rendering an H1.

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,890
So what is happening here?

34
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:58,850
Well, the styles from our app to view component right here are escaping from the confines of this component

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,020
and affecting the H1 in a totally separate component.

36
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,560
All right.

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,390
And that, of course, is a problem because it becomes pretty hard to determine where a given style

38
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,650
is coming from.

39
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,010
Right.

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,720
And this is not really ideal.

41
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:11,990
Right.

42
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,690
Though the whole purpose of you is that each component is its own isolated, independent chunk of logic

43
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,620
with its own styling.

44
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,560
If we write in H1 here and all of a sudden we accidentally affect three other H1 across three other

45
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,470
components and we don't know whether style changes came from.

46
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,140
That's obviously very problematic and very confusing.

47
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,960
So by default, whenever we declare styles in our components, even in the style section, by default

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,430
they are going to be global.

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,790
What it means to be global is they're going to apply to everything.

50
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,670
If we have an H1 here, even though the style is in this style section of this component app view,

51
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,250
this style and this CSR selector logic will apply to every H1 in the app.

52
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,760
All right.

53
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,970
And that is, of course, a problem.

54
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,540
We're going to talk about how to solve the problem in the very next lesson.

55
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,700
But for now, I also want to show you an alternative solution that some people might be tempted to pursue,

56
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,430
but that will also create its own share of potential problems.

57
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:09,170
So, of course, one very common way to solve a problem like this is by using more specific selectors.

58
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,550
So somebody might say something like this in the app component, they're going to say, okay, I can

59
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,940
give my H1 a class and I'll give it a sample class like header and then down below here.

60
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,180
Since this is valid CSR, I can target that element not by its tag, not by an H1 but by the header

61
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,630
class.

62
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,110
Right.

63
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,360
And so if I save that now you're going to see that indeed we get the desired result we have.

64
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,200
Hello, i'm an app dot view which is the H1 from our app file.

65
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,000
That one is colored in purple while the H1 in the helloworld component is not affected.

66
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,540
However, the problem here is that these styles are still global.

67
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,300
These styles are still applied to every single component in the app.

68
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:53,030
So it's not an unreasonable situation to imagine where somebody might be editing the Helloworld file

69
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,040
someday and they might be saying, okay, I want to solve this H1 and maybe an appropriate class to

70
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,210
give it to something like Header.

71
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,010
And then we're going to be completely shocked when they add a class like header here and don't provide

72
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,450
any additional styles at all.

73
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,590
And then when they saved the file, lo and behold, Helloworld is now in purple.

74
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,390
And of course, the reason is because this header class and its styles are coming from this declaration

75
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,640
right here in a totally separate file.

76
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:16,940
Right.

77
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,330
And this can be very confusing if you have 100 different components in your codebase.

78
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,690
So yes, CSR class selectors or even ID selectors are a little bit more specific and offer some degree

79
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,680
of protection, but they're not perfect because they still don't solve the fundamental problem that

80
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,380
all of these styles are going to be available in every component.

81
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,840
And thus, if we use the same named class anywhere else, we have a chance that it will inherit the

82
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,350
styles from the access declaration in a totally different file.

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:42,950
All right.

84
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,510
So that is the problem we are seeing now.

85
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,180
We're going to see how to solve this problem in the very next lesson.
