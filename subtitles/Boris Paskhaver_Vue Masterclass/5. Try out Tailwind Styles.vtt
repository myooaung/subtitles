00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.430
Okay.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:07.530
So we have successfully configured the Tailwind Access Utility Library in our view application.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.470
And in this lesson we're going to see how it helps us really easily and quickly style our elements.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.840
So on the left hand side, I've opened up our app component and right now it only consists of a single

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.410
one.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.540
And on the right hand side I have my browser and we can see that H1 being rendered at the very top there

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.590
with no styles.

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.510
So the way Tailwind works is we're simply going to add a bunch of classes to each element.

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.210
Remember, you can almost think of Tailwind as being this collection of hundreds, if not thousands

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.780
of six classes that are available to use out of the box.

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.330
So now they're immediately available in this file and in any other component file that we want, we

12
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.360
don't have to define anything down below in a style section.

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.990
They're now available globally and we can simply add them on right here.

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.370
So for example, let's say I want to add some margin to the top of my H1.

15
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.370
Well, tailwind has a whole bunch of margin classes.

16
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.160
They're all going to start with the letter M and they start from margin.

17
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.080
And then for that, the classes that are only going to add margin at the very top, those classes are

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.150
all going to begin with empty.

19
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.820
It's going to be empty, followed by a dash.

20
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.190
And this is still part of the sizes class name.

21
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.280
And then what tailwind likes to do is have numbers.

22
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.530
So for example, empty one is going to be the smallest amount of top margin than empty two, empty,

23
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.450
three, empty, four, so on and so forth.

24
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.280
So for example, I can add a class here like Empty eight, this is an available tailwind class.

25
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.330
I'm going to save this.

26
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.720
And on the right hand side, you can see that's going to add margin.

27
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.110
Right.

28
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.520
And as you might guess, if I instead went with a class like Empty four, that's going to be about half

29
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.270
as much margin.

30
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.990
There we go.

31
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.310
And if I went with a larger class like empty 12, that's going to be a little bit more margin.

32
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.760
All right.

33
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.310
I'm going to reduce this back down to empty eight.

34
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.780
And you might be curious.

35
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.050
Okay.

36
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.950
Let's makes sense.

37
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.340
Perfect.

38
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340
We have all these available classes, but how do you know it's called empty?

39
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.190
And how do you find all these available classes that you can add?

40
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.340
Well, for that, you can head to the official tailwind documentation.

41
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.050
So I have that open here in a second tab.

42
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.010
And so on this site, there is usually going to be a helpful search button or a search input.

43
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.200
So for example, here's one on the front page and I can simply search for something like margin and

44
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.910
then find the page for that.

45
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.960
For example, here's margin.

46
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.820
And on a page like this, you're going to see all of the available access classes that Tailwind gives

47
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.710
you as well as the actual properties.

48
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.350
This, this is the actual CSS code that's going to add.

49
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.370
So if I show all classes, you can scroll down and you can see there's going to be a whole bunch of

50
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.550
them.

51
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.400
So as you might guess, empty is margin top.

52
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.300
But there's also going to be Amby for margin bottom and AL for margin left.

53
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.830
And as I scroll down, there's going to be a whole bunch of them and eventually you're going to find

54
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.120
the ones that you're looking for.

55
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.950
So this is how I was able to find Empty eight.

56
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.380
If I just scroll down here, I was able to find Empty eight somewhere here.

57
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.340
Let me see here.

58
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.980
I mean, if I do a find there we go.

59
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.140
There is margin top eight and you can see it adds a margin type of two RAM which assuming a default

60
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.310
font size of 16 pixels is about 32 pixels of top margin.

61
00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.580
Right.

62
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.430
And of course, there's classes for margin on only the left, margin on left and right margin of only

63
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.340
the right, etc..

64
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.420
And yes, there is somewhat of a learning curve because you have to learn all these classes.

65
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.580
But once you master one Tailwind project, the classes are going to be the same when you transition

66
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.660
to another talent project.

67
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.120
And in addition, they're not usually that difficult to remember the kind of intuitive, like empty

68
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.380
kind of make sense margin top.

69
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.880
And once you memorize that and you remember that there's a numeric component, then it's simply a matter

70
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.000
of adjusting up or down until you get to the desired look, right?

71
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.230
So yes, there is a learning curve, but I found that it wasn't too crazy.

72
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.650
Right?

73
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.590
Let me give you another example of some helper classes that Tailwind gives us.

74
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.660
So for example, let's say I wanted to make this text a little bit larger, so font size, so there's

75
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.220
a whole bunch of tailwind classes that begin with the prefix text and that's part of the CSS as class

76
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.490
name.

77
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.920
And so usually it's going to be text dash followed by again some kind of a qualifier or identifier.

78
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.270
So for example, we have a text six XL class and that deals with font size.

79
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.010
So when I save that, you can see we're going to get this much larger H1 if you want to reduce it.

80
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.290
As you might guess, there's a text for Excel class and that's going to make it a little bit smaller.

81
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.540
Let's return this back to six Excel.

82
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.660
And once again, how do you find these classes?

83
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.490
You can start with the tail end documentation and here, for example, is the search icon and click

84
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.360
on that and search for the seasons property that you're trying to find the classes for.

85
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.550
So for example, font size, go to that page and you're going to see a whole bunch of classes dealing

86
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.880
with that.

87
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.370
So text access, text, some text algae, of course, that's short for large in the same way that Esim

88
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.410
is for small going all the way up to text six Excel.

89
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.660
Right.

90
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.100
And again, all of these classes are available out of the box, so you can simply add them to whatever

91
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.000
HTML element you want as a class and tailwind will take care of the site.

92
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.540
All right.

93
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.320
Same principle here.

94
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.190
All right.

95
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.850
And similarly, let's say we wanted to center this bunch of text.

96
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.110
So alignment, right?

97
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.350
There is another series of classes also beginning with the word text and that's going to deal with alignment.

98
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.000
And there is one that we're looking for here.

99
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.260
Called Text Center.

100
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.550
So we can save that.

101
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.380
And that is going to center our text.

102
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.980
All right.

103
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.620
And that's as simple as Tailwind gets.

104
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.230
And that's the beautiful part about it, is as we navigate throughout the course, what I'm going to

105
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.790
do when we're working with CSC is I'm just going to write class next to the element I'm trying to style.

106
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.070
And we're just going to add on a bunch of Tailwind classes.

107
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.960
It might be one class or it might be ten.

108
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.970
But the idea here is that we don't have to worry about other CSC problems, like naming things, nesting

109
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.500
things with things like sass or less.

110
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.120
All we have is a whole bunch of utility classes that can accomplish basically everything we're going

111
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.450
to need.

112
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.750
And someone's going to be able to type out a whole bunch of these classes in a row, and then we're

113
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.040
going to get the styling we want.

114
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.590
And that's the beautiful and super fluid and fast part of how Tailwind helps us write our styles very

115
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.950
quickly.

116
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.880
All right.

117
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.740
So earlier in the course, again, we talk about having style sections in our components and then scoping

118
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.210
them so that the styles don't escape.

119
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.140
We really don't even have to worry about that problem at all or even having a style section because

120
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.300
Tailwind is basically going to give us all the CC utility classes we need to style our components and

121
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.240
our styles to resemble the actual Google Careers website.

122
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.930
All right.

123
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.180
So that's a good way to start learning about tailwind.

124
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.230
In the very next lesson, I'm going to show you an extension that we can install in this code so we

125
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.970
can get a lot of help with finding out these styles without having to consult the official Tailwind

126
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:12.690
documentation.

127
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.460
So I will see you in the next lesson.
