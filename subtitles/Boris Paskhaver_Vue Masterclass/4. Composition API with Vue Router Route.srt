1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,220
Okay.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,340
So let's move on to another component in this lesson.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,010
I want to refactor the sub nav component.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,950
So let's go ahead and open that file up right here.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,780
I'm going to open up my sub nav component.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,390
And as always, I'm going to look for components that offer us more opportunities to get familiarized

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,930
with the composition API, but dealing with other problems.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,120
So for example, we just saw how to use the use router function with our previous component and the

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,110
sub nav component offers its own share of new problems for us to figure out.

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,220
So take a look.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,410
This component is not that complicated.

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,600
We only have the computer section right here.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,570
But there's two things this component is reliant upon.

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,250
Number one, here is the dollar sign root property that's provided by view router.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,270
And just as a heads up, don't confuse this with dollar sign router.

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,370
Dollar sign router is the view router dollar sign root is an object that tells you about the current

17
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,310
root or in other words, the current URL that you are on.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,880
So that's the first thing we're going to need to replace using Composition API.

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,030
And then the second thing is reusing map getters here.

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,210
And remember behind the scenes, what this is doing is talking to the View store and running a specific

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,490
getter called filter jobs in order to enable a method on this component called filter jobs.

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,180
So let's worry about replacing this functionality in this lesson.

23
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,480
And then in the next lesson I'll show you how to replace the getter logic.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,170
So let's begin as always, by commenting out our old implementation.

25
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,210
So I'm going to comment out, computed, and as a result, I'm also going to comment out these two import

26
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,870
lines because they're directly related to our computed functionality.

27
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,130
All right.

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,820
So we're going to need to set up our setup method.

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,240
And as always in here, we're going to return an object.

30
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,260
All right.

31
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,250
So we know that eventually we're going to need something like filter jobs here because we're using that

32
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,270
as a name in our template.

33
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:53,060
And we're also going to need to have a name called on job results page while on job results page is

34
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,600
going to come from talking to dollar sign root, which no longer exists.

35
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,570
Well, can you guess how we're going to be able to get access to the root object within our set of method?

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,920
It's going to work the exact same way as we saw with the router in the previous lesson.

37
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:13,460
We're going to be able to import a helper function from view router that gives us access to the route

38
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,710
within a given setup method.

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,870
So what is that helper function called?

40
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,530
You guessed it, it's going to be called use root.

41
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,480
Once again, be very careful here.

42
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,500
This is not use router which we imported in the previous component.

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,970
This is just use root.

44
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,700
So right here I'm going to import that from a view router.

45
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,610
And since we have a computed property, we're going to want to watch the value of name like we're doing

46
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,500
right here and continue to compare it.

47
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,350
So whenever we have computed logic, we know that we're also going to need to get the computed function

48
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,490
from view.

49
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,470
So computed is going to come from view use root is going to come from you about.

50
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,590
All right so right here and setup, you guessed it, we can simply invoke just make sure I don't do

51
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,430
that in my return.

52
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,560
That was very sloppy of me right here.

53
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:06,170
If we invoke use root, we're going to get our root object, a reactive root object, and I'm going

54
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,180
to assign that to a contact called Root.

55
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:14,000
So just like that, we have the exact same functionality as we had via this that dollar sign root in

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,080
the options API.

57
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,630
So down below I'm going to define the name that I need to have in my template, which is on job results

58
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,990
page.

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,910
So right here on job results page and that is going to be a computed property.

60
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,040
So now it's going to be a computed function.

61
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,190
And so the or more specifically, it's going to be the reactive object that the computed function returns.

62
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,340
So right here I'm going to invoke my computed function.

63
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,400
We know that when we pass, this is a function that view is going to rerun whenever the reactive state

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,420
inside it changes.

65
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,480
So what is going to be our reactive state that we're watching?

66
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,130
It's going to be the value of the name property on our reactive root object.

67
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,130
And since it's reactive, Vue is going to know to rerun this function whenever that name property changes.

68
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,820
So right here, root that name and we're going to check if it's equal to the string job results.

69
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,290
All right.

70
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,290
So this is the exact same implementation we have right here.

71
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,720
We're going to implicitly return a boolean, and that's going to be the next state, the next reactive

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,050
state of this on job results page computed property.

73
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,360
The only thing that's left to do, of course, is to make sure we return it right here in this object.

74
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,770
And just like that, we've replaced the former computed property right here.

75
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,700
So right here we have on job results page, which expects a boolean.

76
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,370
Remember on job results page as a reactive object and the value property on it is what's going to actually

77
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,580
give us the boolean that reflects whether this condition is true or false.

78
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,590
But for the purposes of the template, we're welcome to use the reactive object right here in line because

79
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,300
Vue knows how to deal with that.

80
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,970
All right, so we've taken care of this bit right here.

81
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,600
And the very next lesson, we're going to show you how to take care of the getters.
