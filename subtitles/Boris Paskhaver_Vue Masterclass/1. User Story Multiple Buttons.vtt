00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.370
Okay.

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.400
Welcome to the next section of the course and to our new user story.

3
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.310
Let's go ahead and read it together.

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.360
As a user, I'd like to have my primary and secondary actions suggested to me so that I know what steps

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.250
I can take on the website.

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.960
So on this next slide, I'll show you the Google Careers website, or at least the landing page.

7
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.610
And you'll notice there's two primary ways that this website wants us to interact with it.

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.300
We have our sign in button on the top right corner, and that is a button.

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.360
And then we have this form where we can search for a role as well as a location, and then click the

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.930
search button.

11
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.470
So immediately you'll notice that there is a different type of button that we have for the search,

12
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.650
and you'll notice that it's different in many different ways.

13
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.100
First up, it has a totally different piece of text inside it.

14
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.070
And that's important because in our current code, our action button component, hard codes, the text

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.030
sign in.

16
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.170
So it's not dynamic enough to support any text that we want such as search.

17
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.840
But beyond just text, we obviously have the big visual differences between these two buttons.

18
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.200
The one in the top right has a blue background and a white font while the search button has a white

19
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.750
background and a blue font.

20
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.170
Right.

21
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.620
So there's differences and aesthetics and these buttons communicate kind of the actions that the user

22
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.210
can take on the website.

23
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.160
So in order to be able to support both of these actions, and I would argue that the sign in is the

24
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.120
primary action, it's kind of a lot bolder and more prominent on this page.

25
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.670
And the search button is the secondary action.

26
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.060
It's the second thing that Google wants us to do in order to support those visual distinctions.

27
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.080
What we basically need to do for this user story is to create a new type of button and do it in such

28
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.450
a way that we add dynamism or dynamic content to our existing button.

29
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.250
So as an example that we just talked about, we don't want to hard code the text sign in.

30
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.850
We want to be able to dynamically generate some kind of text.

31
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.690
Obviously, we could create another button where we hard code the text search.

32
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.700
But as, as hopefully you're starting to figure out right now that isn't really sustainable.

33
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.340
We don't want to build a new button each time we have a different text.

34
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.640
We want to find a way to use view features to make a button more flexible, to serve multiple use cases.

35
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.860
So coming back to our user story as a user, I'd like to have my primary and secondary actions suggested

36
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.260
to me so that I know what steps I can take on the website.

37
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.400
Most user actions are going to be in the form of the user navigating someone with a button.

38
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.180
So what we're going to be building out here is these two types of buttons.

39
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.130
One of them, of course, is already built out.

40
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.080
We have an example of that on the left.

41
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.820
But what we're going to be building out is the buttons on the right hand side, and that will allow

42
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.670
us to actually introduce a lot more new viewer view concepts.

43
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.360
It's not just going to be a refresher on what we already learned.

44
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.160
We are going to learn a lot of new view ideas simply by expanding upon our existing action button.

45
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.130
One additional detail you'll notice here is what happens on Hover for our existing button, our sign

46
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.520
in button.

47
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.310
When we hover, we just get that little box shadow around it.

48
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.490
In comparison, when we hover over this search button, we see that the styles invert, the background

49
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.980
becomes blue and the text becomes white.

50
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.530
And in addition to that, you'll notice that the blue hover background on the search button is a different

51
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.530
blue compared to the sign in button that we currently have.

52
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.450
So we're going to see how we can add that kind of dynamism to our view components and also talk about

53
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.390
all kinds of view concepts, tailwind concepts, etc..

54
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.100
So this is what we're trying to tackle and it's going to pave the way for us to keep building our form

55
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.950
where the user user is going to be able to search for their jobs.

56
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.340
All right.

57
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.200
Lots of fun stuff to cover in this section.

58
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.820
So I will see you in the next lesson.
