00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.440
All right.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:08.700
So in this lesson, we're going to install a special plugin or extension for chrome called Vue DevTools.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.510
And Vue DevTools are going to be super helpful for helping us debug or understand our view application.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.290
So open up Chrome and go to any site like Google and we're going to search for this view dev tools.

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.200
And the very first result here is the one we want.

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.970
It's going to be on the Chrome Web store.

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.920
So this is the official Vue.js dev tools for the Chrome Web browser.

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.990
You can see it has more than a million users.

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.100
And we're going to click, of course, the Add to Chrome button and that is going to install it.

10
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.710
It's going to give us this confirmation prompt and we can click add extension and that should automatically

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.430
add the extension.

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.050
You can see it added right here.

13
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.270
It's going to be this V right here.

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.440
In fact, let me go into here and pin it to my collection of extensions.

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.180
It's going to be this V right here.

16
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.820
And you can see right now it's pretty grayed out and you're going to see this V light up in green.

17
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.020
Whenever we are on a valid view app, it's going to recognize that we have a valid view app.

18
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.600
It's going to kind of hook into that and then offer us a way to analyze that app.

19
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.880
So what I'm going to do is close out of this window and go back to my actual Vue.js app.

20
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.810
And just to be safe, what I'm going to do is do a full page refresh.

21
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.760
And in case that doesn't work, what I recommend you do is relaunch your Chrome browser entirely.

22
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.820
But once you do this, what we want to do is go to the inspector panel, the same panel where we can,

23
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.530
for example, see our HTML elements.

24
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.690
So one really easy way to get there is by clicking this collection of three dots right here, then more

25
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.760
tools and then developer tools.

26
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.080
All right.

27
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.910
So hopefully we are familiar with this section.

28
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.740
And what you'll notice is on this panel of tabs, you should see a new tab called Vue.

29
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.350
And that is what the View Dev tools have added for us.

30
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.210
So notice as I click this that that's going to launch the view dev tools and right here the V is also

31
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.560
going to be lit up in green.

32
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.980
So we can say we can see here the documentation.

33
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.330
Welcome to the view dev tools.

34
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.130
We can have a little tour.

35
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.090
Let's go ahead and do that.

36
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.320
So I'm going to click next.

37
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.960
It's going to show you here the different various buttons.

38
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.480
We can not just see our components here, but we can also see things like the timeline, which is basically

39
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.160
the sequence of events.

40
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.100
As your app starts up, which component is rendered first, what it renders are user clicks, user events,

41
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.880
things like that.

42
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.030
Basically the kind of timeline of things that occur in your app as it launches and as it is being used

43
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.540
by the user continuing on, you can see the inspector.

44
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.930
This is going to be our favorite section throughout the course and we're going to explore the inspector

45
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.560
in just a second.

46
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.330
But this is basically going to be the tree like structure of components that are being rendered in your

47
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.630
app.

48
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.480
And if I click on, we can see some more additional settings.

49
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.380
I'm going to click next here.

50
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.150
You can explore this all in your free time, but just realize this is basically a good sign that everything

51
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.170
has been installed correctly.

52
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.970
So I'm going to click Skip right here.

53
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.460
And that brings us to The View Dev Tools.

54
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.110
And so what I want you to do here is make sure you have components selected right here and you'll notice

55
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.480
right here that we have a basic component hierarchy.

56
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.260
So remember, our app kicks everything off with the app component.

57
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.570
That is what we are rendering in mandatory not.

58
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.530
Yes, this is the component that is hooking into that div with an idea of app.

59
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.290
And so remember this is where the app launches and then our app component is itself rendering what we

60
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.140
call a child component, a component within itself.

61
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.140
And our app component is rendering the hello world component.

62
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.220
And that's what we see here.

63
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.040
And you can see it almost operates like a folder structure on your computer in that you can expand the

64
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.210
top level component to see everything that it renders as a child component.

65
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.720
And this relationship is going to proceed all the way down.

66
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.790
So if the Helloworld world component rendered its own to child components, we could then expand or

67
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.210
collapse.

68
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.420
Hello World to see its resulting components as well.

69
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.520
And in addition, a lot of helpful features related to each component are going to appear right here

70
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.390
on the right hand side.

71
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.490
Right now, we don't know what props is and later on, going to see a lot more different options appear

72
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.060
here on the right.

73
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.280
But the key takeaway is once we select any component, we're sort of going to see its configuration

74
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.500
on the right hand side and we're going to be able to alter that configuration in line here in this extension.

75
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.280
And then, of course, see the immediate changes in our view app on screen.

76
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.840
So the view dev tools are going to be a super helpful tool for debugging and understanding our View

77
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.550
app as we navigate through the course.

78
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.630
So make sure you install this helpful extension and I will see you in the next lesson.
