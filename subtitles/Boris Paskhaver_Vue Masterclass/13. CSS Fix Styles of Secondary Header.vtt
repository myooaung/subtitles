00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.170
Okay.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.030
So this should be a quick lesson.

3
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.930
What I'd like to do is style our H2 element currently on line number eight.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.340
So as always, let's add some classes here.

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.500
We're only going to add two.

6
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.660
First thing we're going to do is to increase the font size of this.

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.170
I'm going to apply the Tailwind text three Excel class, which is just going to set a font size of 30

8
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.430
pixels, so large, but not as large as the primary H1 text above.

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.440
And then I actually want to apply the font light class, which is the opposite of bold.

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.900
It makes the font a little bit lighter, not as heavy in terms of its depth on the page.

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.930
So let's go ahead and save this and see what it looks like.

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.210
Transition back to the browser.

13
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.180
All right.

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.290
Looking pretty good.

15
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.740
We have everything still working and looking just fine with our primary header and our secondary header

16
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.130
as well.

17
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.730
So that's all there is to cover here.

18
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.250
So I will see you in the next lesson.
