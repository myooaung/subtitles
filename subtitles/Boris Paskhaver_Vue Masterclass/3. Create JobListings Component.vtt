00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.280
Okay.

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.390
So now let's create our job listings component.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.700
I'm going to create that within my job results directory, but not within the job filter sidebar directory.

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.240
So right here I'll click on that top level one and I will create my job listings dot view component.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.130
That will be the box on the right hand side with the actual job listings themselves.

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.350
So our directory structure looks like this currently.

7
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.110
All right, so in this component, we'll create our template.

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.890
And this is going to be the main section or the primary focus that we want to show to the user.

9
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.320
So instead of using a div, I'm going to use the main tag which represents the main content or the body

10
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.880
of the document or the application.

11
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.190
The primary place where we want the user to focus on this page is the listings themselves, so it makes

12
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.320
sense to render this in a main tag.

13
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.420
But functionally it works just like a div.

14
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.490
It's a container for other elements.

15
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.700
So I will create a main element right here and I'll just write job listings component so we can easily

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.450
identify it.

17
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.450
And as always, we will add a script section and export default, an object with a name property.

18
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.450
I'm going to call it job listings and then let's provide a line break right here pretty easy.

19
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.600
And then we're going to render alongside our job filter sidebar component in our job results view.

20
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.510
So let's head to our job results view component.

21
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.220
We're rendering that as our top level parent on the slash jobs slash results route.

22
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.590
And here we can import that new component.

23
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.390
So we'll import our job listings component from source directory components, job results and it's going

24
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.250
to be right in here.

25
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.490
Job listings dot view.

26
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.520
We will register it in our components object below.

27
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.470
And then, of course, all that's left to do is render it immediately after the job.

28
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.140
Dr. Sidebar We will of course, organize these two components so they render side by side.

29
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.660
When we apply the CC in an upcoming lesson.

30
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.980
But for now we can make a single job listings self-closing component.

31
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.350
Save that head to our browser.

32
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.810
And there we go.

33
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.770
We have our job builder sidebar and our job listings component is rendering right after it.

34
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.560
And if I expand my job results view, you can see that that top level view component is rendering the

35
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.220
two child components right here, the sidebar and the job listings.

36
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.790
All right.

37
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.220
So those are going to be basically our starting point.

38
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.680
This is a good place to start styling our system and arranging these two components to live side by

39
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.700
side with one another.

40
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.010
We'll start working on that in the very next lesson.
