1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,790
All right.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,420
So let's wrap up this section with a quick section review.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,400
This section was focused entirely on integrating tailwind into our project.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,720
Tailwind, of course, is a success framework that adds lots of utility classes, readymade classes

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:25,130
for us to use in our project that deal with everything from margin to padding to font size to text alignment

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,970
to display, etc. instead of having to create our own access classes and remember all of those.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:37,160
Yes, as properties we can just memorize a bunch of Tailwind utility classes or reference the documentation

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,770
and have this very easy process of iteration where we just simply add those classes to our existing

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,590
H2 elements and observe the changes in our browser.

10
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,050
Until we find something that fits what we're looking for, we can use the view SEELYE To add tailwind

11
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,630
to a View project, we use the View Ad Command earlier in the course, and that created a whole bunch

12
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,340
of files for us to work with.

13
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,890
And the primary one that we really should be concerned about is the tailwind dot config that JS file

14
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,100
and that's where we can fine tune or set some more.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,860
My new Tailwind Options and settings.

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,920
For example, earlier in the section we added our open sans font to the project and we made sure to

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,510
tell Tailwind that it should prefer to use that font, but before it falls back to its array of regular

18
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,960
fonts.

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,260
All right.

20
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,630
That's really all there is to cover in this section.

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,650
Next up, we're going to talk about rendering data to our screen using view.
