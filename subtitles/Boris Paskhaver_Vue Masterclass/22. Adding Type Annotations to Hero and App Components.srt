1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,500
Okay.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:07,060
So with every lesson, we move closer and closer to having our entire app in TypeScript.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,120
So what I've done using the search feature in this code is look for all of the presences of the script

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,620
tag in my code base.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,210
And of course, these are all the script tags that do not yet have the Lang attribute.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,380
So these are all the components that remain that we still need to update to TypeScript.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,490
Luckily, they're going to be pretty simple because they don't have that much complexity in them.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,180
So let's begin in this lesson with the app and hero components.

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,880
I'm going to open up the app component and as always, provide the Lang attribute right here.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,530
I'm going to import to component and that is going to come from view.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,110
And right here, we're going to invoke that function.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,730
And do that.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,050
There we go.

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:50,740
Pretty simple.

15
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,170
And next up, we're going to do Hero as well.

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,490
So right here.

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,110
You know the drill by now.

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,030
It's almost like muscle memory at this point.

19
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,650
Import define the component that's going to come from view.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,690
And finally, we need to invoke that function, passing the object.

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:13,030
And luckily, these components have a pretty simple setup where it's just a name property and the components

22
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,630
registration.

23
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,990
So no typescript violations here or here.

24
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,020
So again, more progress.

25
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,840
And in the very next lesson, we're finally going to take care of all of our view components.

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,290
And when I say view, I mean view as in VW, the actual starter pages for our roots are going to take

27
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,750
care of these four remaining components.

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,470
And with that I think our entire codebase will then be in TypeScript, so I'll see you in the next lesson.
