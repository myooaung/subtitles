00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.570
Okay.

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.100
So here I am in Chrome and let's test the feature that we've been developing for all these lessons.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.630
So the first thing I'm going to do is to bring up my view dev tools.

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.170
So I'm going to open up my panel right here and click on View.

5
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.410
And right here on this dropdown, you can select View X to look at the current state of the View Store.

6
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.750
And as soon as this page loads, of course we should render our job listings component right here,

7
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.860
which should dispatch two actions, one of which is going to fetch the jobs.

8
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.800
The other one which is going to fetch two degrees.

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.250
And so here you can see we do have our array of 100 jobs.

10
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.180
And right here, it looks like we are getting and storing via mutation.

11
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.080
We are getting and storing our five degrees from our back in as well.

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.920
All right.

13
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.080
And here we have our selected organisations, selected job types and selected degrees arrays.

14
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.920
And they of course have nothing in them because no checkboxes are selected.

15
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.430
So here is the moment of truth.

16
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.520
Here are our organisation check boxes.

17
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.720
They're working as expected.

18
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.120
Here are our job types check boxes.

19
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.330
And finally, let's expand degrees and tada.

20
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.480
Here are our five unique degrees, which of course we get by iterating over the five degrees that we

21
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.770
get from our degrees.

22
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.190
End point.

23
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.820
All right.

24
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.530
So let's try selecting one of these checkboxes and a whole bunch of things, of course, should happen

25
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.250
when we check this.

26
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.230
First up, when we check this, we expect that this selected degrees array will update because we're

27
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.660
going to commit that mutation to the View X Store as soon as this part of the View X Store State updates,

28
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.700
we expect our filter jobs getter to rerun and thus update the jobs right here.

29
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.310
And of course, that filter jobs getter itself is going to be relying on the helper getters that we

30
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.580
wrote to filter an individual job based on whether its degree matches the array of degrees the user

31
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.030
has selected.

32
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.310
So let's try something like bachelors right here.

33
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.520
And we immediately saw that the job on the right hand change.

34
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.930
So everything looks like it's working.

35
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.740
Here's another example.

36
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.730
Let me select bachelors and it looks like it is indeed working.

37
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.270
All right.

38
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.710
Notice as I select these as well, that the number up here, which represents the number of filter jobs

39
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.700
is changing.

40
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.390
And that is another visual indicator we have that we are indeed filtering.

41
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.040
As we select more degrees, the number climbs up because there's more jobs that fulfill that category.

42
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.440
As we select something like bachelors, notice the number goes down because there's less jobs that match

43
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.580
that criteria.

44
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.500
So everything is looking at correct notice here as well that we have three checkboxes for three degrees,

45
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.210
which means our selected degrees array right here has three values and it's the exact three values that

46
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.780
we care about.

47
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.520
Furthermore, if I scroll down, we can take a look and make sure all of our getters are working as

48
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.000
expected.

49
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.680
So here's unique organizations.

50
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.430
That's correct.

51
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.330
Unique job types.

52
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.300
Here is our unique degrees getter.

53
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.140
This is the one that is simply iterating over the API response to get the array that we are iterating

54
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.820
over in our checkbox group component.

55
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.990
This looks correct to me.

56
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.570
And of course, here are the helper getters that we have include job by organization, so on and so

57
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.980
forth, include job by degree.

58
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.860
And of course, these filter jobs getter right here is using those three helper getters to arrive at

59
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.020
the array of 68 filter jobs.

60
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.420
And of course, the 68 right here should make sense.

61
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.060
It's the exact same number that we see right here.

62
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.600
Right.

63
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.360
So it looks like we should have 68 jobs rendered, and indeed we do.

64
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.440
So it looks like on the view side of things, everything is working.

65
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.660
And as soon as I deselect that panel, we can simply click around on some other job types to see the

66
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.340
values on the right hand side update and we can see that as I select them and deselect them.

67
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.690
The jobs on the right continue to update and that is a good sign that all of these things are indeed

68
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.260
wired up.

69
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.520
So congratulations.

70
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.040
We've now built three different filters by which the user can filter the jobs in the right by degrees,

71
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.480
job types and organizations, and notice that the entire app is reacting to all of those choices.

72
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.670
We're not limiting the user to just one.

73
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.650
They can apply as many filters as they want.

74
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.630
They can, of course, collapse it on, collapse it, show the values that they previously selected

75
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.860
were storing all of that state globally in the store state, every component, every UCS, store, mutation

76
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.130
getter, piece of state, composable, function, etc., etc. is perfectly tested and also written in

77
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.760
TypeScript.

78
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.210
All right.

79
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.470
So we've done quite a lot.

80
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.580
So big round of applause to us and congratulations to you as well for sticking through this.

81
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.000
We have built a complete new feature for our app in TypeScript.

82
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.630
All right.

83
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.520
So with that and the very next lesson, we can wrap up everything we learned in this section.

84
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.190
I'll see you there.
