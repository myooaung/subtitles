1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,130
Okay.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,760
So in the next lesson, we're going to start building out our accordion view component.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,370
And in order to do that, we're going to need to add some new font, awesome icons to our project.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,190
We're going to need icons to represent the carrot symbols on the right side of the accordion header.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,790
As a reminder, they are those symbols, those angles almost that allow us to click the accordion to

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,920
expand it and then again to collapse it.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,990
And we're going to get those icons from font.

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,500
Awesome.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,150
The place in our app where we configure that is in our main J.S. File.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,510
As a reminder, it is here in this file where we imported our face search font, awesome icon.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,050
That is our magnifying glass that we've used throughout the app.

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,640
And so what we need to do is import and register two more icons from font.

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,060
Awesome.

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,640
So that we can use them in our components.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,930
We need to make them available.

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,040
So right here from this library of four awesome free solid SVG icons in addition to importing f.A Search

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:05,880
font awesome search, I also want to import F a angle down and angle up.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,590
Make sure you spelled those names correctly and these are the respective carried symbols.

19
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,260
The angle down is the carrot that points down.

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,360
The angle up is the one that points up.

21
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,270
These almost look like the less than and greater than sines, except they are of course, pointed down

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,660
and up.

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,030
But that's basically what those icons look like.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:24,870
All right.

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,470
And in addition to importing them, we also have to register them with our font.

26
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,700
Awesome library here.

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,560
You can see we invoke the add method on our imported library object and pass in f.A Search.

28
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,290
We're going to need to do the exact same thing for our two new ones.

29
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:46,320
So right here, library add essay angle down and library add invoke that method pass in the font awesome

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,680
icon essay angle we have down.

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,520
So let's do up here.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,360
Okay.

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,790
And if you have any issues with your app not compiling correctly, feel free to shut down your running

34
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,610
view server and start it up again using NPM run serve in case you have any issues, but hopefully the

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,380
view compiler will register these changes easily and you should be able to use them automatically in

36
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,890
the browser.

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:08,460
Okay.

38
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,630
So now that our set up is complete in the very next lesson, we're going to start building our accordion

39
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,230
component.
