00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.280
Okay.

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.410
So the first thing we want to do is configure a new endpoint for JSON server.

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.140
And as a reminder, we do that in a special file in our code base called DB dot JSON.

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.120
So I'm going to open that file up.

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.350
And here it is.

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.460
As a reminder, it's basically just a JSON object.

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.560
You can think of that like a JavaScript object where the properties represent the URLs or the roots.

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.750
So because we've used jobs here, we're going to have a slash jobs, end point.

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.230
And when we access slash jobs, we're going to get back a response in JSON of this array right here.

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.840
So before this lesson or attached to this lesson, I've included the code that I'd like you to copy

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.410
and paste.

12
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.290
So I'm going to copy the code I have on my other screen right here, and then make sure that there is

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.830
a comma between the end of the response and the start of jobs right here.

14
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.710
And let me just do a quick explanation of what's going on here.

15
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.710
So you can see here we have a key of spotlights.

16
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.130
That means we have defined a new end point, a new route of slash spotlights at our API.

17
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.180
And what spotlights will return is going to be an array of two objects.

18
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.630
And each one of those objects represents the sample marketing text for one of these spotlight cards

19
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.070
that we're going to be building out.

20
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.990
You can think of those cards as the exact same ones that we saw in the previous lesson on the Google

21
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.350
site.

22
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.690
So you'll notice here that each spotlight has an ID and that's just some kind of unique identifier.

23
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.420
Then we have an image and the image here links to Unsplash, which is just a website that provides a

24
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.560
variety of different images.

25
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.490
And both of these images are basically just developers doing developer things, right.

26
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.470
You can again imagine this as being something that a marketing guru in your company has set up in a

27
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.840
CMS, and we're just getting the data from them.

28
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.720
Then we're going to have the title for the spotlight.

29
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.820
So Cloud Engineering or executive leadership.

30
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.920
And then finally description and description is going to be that paragraph text that we want to render

31
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.730
below the title.

32
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.790
So you can think of this as us getting the data or the metadata that we need in order to render the

33
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.160
eventual spotlight components the cards.

34
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.680
But as we saw in the previous lesson, those cards may have a different look and feel from card to card.

35
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.220
All right.

36
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.920
So with that, we have set up DB, that JSON, if you are running JSON server, it should automatically

37
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.710
restart because it detects changes in this file.

38
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.710
If for some reason any of the upcoming lessons don't work, try restarting JSON server, you can terminate

39
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.320
it and then run the command NPM run backend.

40
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.800
As a reminder, if you go to package that JSON, here is where we set up that NPM run back end command.

41
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.940
Whoops, I misspoke.

42
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.940
Backup right here on line ten is where we set up that command to run JSON server and look for that DB,

43
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.070
that JSON file as the source of its end points and the data that they return.

44
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.670
All right.

45
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.990
So we've set up our back end and now we can start building out the spotlight component in the very next

46
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.380
lesson.
