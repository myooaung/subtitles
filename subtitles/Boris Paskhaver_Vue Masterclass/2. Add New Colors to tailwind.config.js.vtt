00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.170
All right.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:08.130
So the first thing we're going to do is to add two more brand colors to our tailwind dot config gorgeous

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.580
file.

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.350
So let me go ahead and open that up.

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.220
And as always, we can imagine that a designer will give us a mock or a sketch of the feature that they'd

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.900
like to build.

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.920
So what we just saw in the browser and from that we can speculate which colors we're going to need.

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.140
So for this section, we're going to need to add two more gray colors, and I'm going to call them brand

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.120
gray two and brand gray three to distinguish them from this existing gray color.

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.520
So I'm going to add them right below here in this colors object as we know, the property or the key

11
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.070
is important because tailwind is going to generate a bunch of cases, classes for us based on this name

12
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.880
and then the value is going to be the value for those color related classes.

13
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.240
So as I mentioned, we're going to call this brand gray, too, and the value is going to be hashtag

14
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.120
f8f9fa.

15
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.210
So a little bit of a different gray color right here.

16
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.450
And as a reminder, as always, these colors are coming directly from or inspired by the Google Careers

17
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.410
website template.

18
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.750
So right here, we'll add another gray.

19
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.140
It's going to be brand gray three and this is going to be hashtag or hexadecimal 808.

20
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.870
And then 68 B and don't forget the comma right here.

21
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.460
That is a very dark gray.

22
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.970
All right.

23
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.140
And that's all we need to do.

24
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.790
Your view app should recompile.

25
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.440
If for some reason this doesn't work.

26
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.260
Remember, you can shut down the running view seal AI app in your terminal and restart it with NPM run

27
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.320
serv and that should incorporate all the latest changes.

28
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.730
The only reason it may break at that point is if you have a typo or something like that in this file,

29
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.000
but sometimes it just doesn't compile quite right on the moment.

30
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.790
That's fine.

31
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.280
Just shut it down and restart it.

32
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.390
And you should see the View app again in your browser if there are no typos and it will incorporate

33
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.110
these new colors.

34
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.740
And from that point forward, you can use those tailwind utility classes.

35
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.940
They will exist automatically.

36
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.570
All right.

37
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.070
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

38
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.630
So I will see you in the next one.
