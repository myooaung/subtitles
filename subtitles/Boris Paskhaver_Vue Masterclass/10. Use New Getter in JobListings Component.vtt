00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.410
Okay.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.170
So we now have our new filter jobs getter, so let's use it in our job listings component.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.440
I'm going to open up that component here, job listings.

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.400
And as a reminder, this is the component where we import our previous filter jobs by job types getter

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.170
we associated with the component.

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.470
And then we use it as the basis for iterating over in order to render the jobs on the right hand side

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.010
of the screen.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.950
So right here you can see the displayed jobs, computed property, talk to the getter slices, the first

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.510
ten elements from it or the right ten elements depending on what page the user's on.

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.670
Then it iterates over that array right here and creates a job listing for each job.

11
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.280
So all I want to do here is wherever I have filtered jobs by job types, I want to replace that with

12
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.050
my new getter of filter jobs.

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.560
So starting here in the import, I'm going to change this to filter jobs.

14
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.560
We now have that new getter name imported.

15
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.730
So in the map getters function call, I want to change this to filter jobs.

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.010
Now my component is going to have access to this start filter jobs, which is going to be the getter

17
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.810
that we defined in the previous lesson.

18
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.830
And now anywhere I was using this former implementation has to replace it.

19
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580
So right here I'm going to erase by job types.

20
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.960
So this is just going to be this start filter jobs.

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.160
And right here, this is also going to be this stop filter jobs.

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.320
So in theory, if our getter is going to return the correct array, then this component doesn't have

23
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.100
to change much.

24
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.740
It's just going to select a subset of ten elements or ten jobs from my filter jobs array.

25
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.120
Render them on to the screen.

26
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.300
But the rest of the logic of the component should work by itself.

27
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.980
And that in itself is a pretty good sign of our design.

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.280
It means that we've extracted a lot of the business logic higher up to view X, so this component just

29
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.080
gets whatever data it needs and just renders it in order, right?

30
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.800
And that's kind of a a good design because we're abstracting away a lot of this complexity of filtering

31
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.680
higher up outside of this component.

32
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.470
This component is just the view layer.

33
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.930
It's just rendering whatever jobs.

34
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.350
We get it.

35
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.900
So pretty simple to make this change.

36
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.640
Let's now look in our browser and we're going to discover that things unfortunately do not work as well

37
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.660
as we had hoped.

38
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.690
So when the page loads and let me refresh it just to show you when the page loads looks like everything

39
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.710
is going just fine.

40
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.350
Unfortunately, we run into issues whenever we try to select either a job type or an organization.

41
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.610
So let's say I select the job type like full time, and there we go.

42
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.740
On the right hand side, everything completely breaks.

43
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.720
I definitely know that there has to be at least one job that is full time, so something does not appear

44
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.160
to be working correctly here.

45
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.950
I'm going to select full time.

46
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.230
We're going to return back to the the jobs appearing on the right hand side.

47
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.280
Let's take a look at what happens when I select an organization like the Two and a Half Men.

48
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.280
Well, once again, the right hand side completely breaks.

49
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.030
All right.

50
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.280
Now, here's where things get a little bit interesting.

51
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.740
Take a look at what happens whenever I include both an organization and a job type.

52
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.300
So I'm going to select View and a Half Men and Part Time, and we're going to see all of a sudden,

53
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.000
everything appears to start working on the right hand side.

54
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.020
You can see we have Two and a Half Men view and a Half Men view and a Half Men and a Half Men.

55
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.660
So it appears like things are somewhat working whenever I have a selection from both filter categories

56
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.210
but not want to have just one selected.

57
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.900
All right.

58
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.520
So that tells me that my getter is moving in the right direction, but we've obviously made some kind

59
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.660
of error or mistake.

60
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.160
In our logic, it's not quite perfect.

61
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.230
So we're going to fix this issue in the very next lesson and hopefully get to a proper working solution.
