1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:01,850
Okay.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,450
So here I am in our job filter as sidebar component.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,290
And before we wrap this section up, there is one more thing I'd like to do.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,920
I want to move this logic over here or this slice of the template, starting with our top level accordion

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,240
for the organization section.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,080
I want to move all of this into its own separate view component.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,510
The reason I want to do this is because I anticipate otherwise the job filter sidebar component will

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:32,330
start to get really large, especially as we start to add checkboxes right here for our job types and

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,920
checkboxes right here for our degrees.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:40,580
Before we get to that complexity, I do see an opportunity to extract a chunk of UI to its own separate

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,620
file, and I think it'd be a good idea to do so.

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,410
All right, so I'm literally going to copy and paste this code into its own separate file.

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,020
Now, you may recall that earlier in the course we talked about the idea of the View Style Guide.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,330
The View Style guide, by the way, is just a set of recommendations or best practices from the View

15
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,080
Development Team.

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:02,420
And one of the recommendations that they have is that when you have child components that are closely

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,210
coupled to the parent, in this case, this new component that we create will be a child of job filter

18
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,490
sidebar, and it is directly related to it.

19
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,560
It is an actual filter in the sidebar.

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,000
What the View Style Guide recommends is including the parent's component name as a prefix in the child's

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,780
component name.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,790
So whatever name we give to this, we should also prefix it with job filters.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,540
Sidebar.

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,430
So I'm going to call this new component job filter, sidebar organizations.

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,090
All right.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,860
So right here, I'm going to open up my file explorer and my components.

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,860
Job results, job filters, sidebar feature folder.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,290
I'm going to create a new file called.

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,490
Job filters, sidebar, keeping the prefix of the original parent name, and then the actual component

30
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,280
will also have organizations as part of its component name.

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,040
This will be a dot view file and from my sidebar I can literally cut and paste this.

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,390
Just remember that you also have to wrap everything in a template tag before you paste.

33
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,440
So template paste that here let prettier format it.

34
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,820
And then before we call it a day, we do have to provide just the default configuration here.

35
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,890
So I will provide a script section.

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,320
And remember, we are using an accordion component right here at the very top level.

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,430
So we do need to import that and register it with this components, local components.

38
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,760
So I'm going to import accordion that is going to come from these source directory components, shared

39
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,360
accordion.

40
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,260
Then I'm going to export default my configuration object.

41
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:40,910
We're going to give this component a name of job filters, sidebar organizations, and then I'm going

42
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,050
to create a components property set to an object where I register accordion.

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,910
And that should do it for us.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,360
All right.

45
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,640
Now that I have this set up, I can go back to my job vector sidebar component, and we need to import

46
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,300
it and use it.

47
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,840
So down below, in my script section, right below these shared components, I'm going to import my

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,630
new job filters, sidebar, organization's component, and that is going to come from the source components,

49
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,630
job results, job filter, sidebar, job filter, sidebar, organizations that view file.

50
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,370
And then I'm going to just simply copy this right here, paste it inside our components object.

51
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,350
And then of course we have to use it.

52
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,590
We can use it right below our other two accordions right here.

53
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,560
I'm simply going to render job filters, sidebar, organization instead of camel case.

54
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,350
I'm simply going to provide a dash in between every subsequent word.

55
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,120
We can make this a self-closing component and save, and we should see the error go away below.

56
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,130
I think this is going to be organizaciones.

57
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:40,970
There we go.

58
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,610
Now we are using all of our locally registered components.

59
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,480
We have removed that huge slice of UI and placed it in a simple component.

60
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,230
And if I go back to my browser and refresh this page.

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,460
Just to make sure everything is still working as we expect.

62
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,660
Now we have isolated just this chunk of logic to its own separate component.

63
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,380
All right.

64
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,150
So this has been an introduction to slots, and I will see you in the next lesson where we're going

65
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,040
to do a quick review of this section.
