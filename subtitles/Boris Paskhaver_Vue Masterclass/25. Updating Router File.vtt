00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.380
Okay.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.910
So super quick lesson here.

3
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.710
I know it may be a little bit frustrating because with every lesson it feels like we're always moving

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.180
so close to the end.

5
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.550
But then there's always that one lingering JavaScript file somewhere in the project or that one lingering

6
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.550
component that we discover somewhere that's not yet converted to TypeScript.

7
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.440
But I promise you, I think this is the final lesson here in terms of the conversion.

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.020
So you may recall we have a router directory and it has an index just filed.

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.140
Here is where we configure all of our routes for the app and export the actual view router.

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.810
Let's go ahead and change this one to have eighths extension and if we're lucky, there's not going

11
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.040
to be any violations.

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.650
And it looks like everything is looking good here.

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.490
All right.

14
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.170
So no violations.

15
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.070
This file looks good.

16
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.000
And now we know that all of our components have the proper typescript setup with the Lang attribute

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.770
as well as the defined component function.

18
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.020
And here I have all the folders expanded and we can see that all the files are in TypeScript.

19
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.870
Here's composable, the router directory, the store directory utils, here's our views directory with

20
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.390
all of the additional view components and here is our test directory and we can see in here all of our

21
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.550
tests are now in TypeScript as well.

22
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.170
So a big round of applause.

23
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.400
And thank you so much for your patience for bearing with me as we went through a lot of these repetitive

24
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.790
steps to convert our complete project to TypeScript.

25
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.990
So lots of progress in this lesson and hopefully this section as well.

26
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.530
Hopefully in this section you've learned a lot about how to both migrate from JavaScript to TypeScript

27
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.800
and also how to generally write TypeScript code as well.

28
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.820
So I hope all this has been helpful and we can wrap everything up in the next lesson.
