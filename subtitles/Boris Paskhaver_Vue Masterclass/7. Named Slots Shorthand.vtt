00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.140
Okay.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:08.850
So in this lesson, I'll show you a syntactic shortcut for the V slot directive in my parent component.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.830
And this solution will also get rid of the S lint warning that we see right here.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.560
The reason that S lint prefers the solution that I'm about to show you is because it tends to be a little

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.220
bit shorter.

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.150
It's very simple.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.780
So whenever we have the V slot directive and we provide it with the name of a slot that we want to populate,

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.550
we can replace V slot and the colon with a single hash tag.

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.990
So the entire directive name and the colon we can just replace with a hashtag, which in technical terms

10
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.140
is actually called an octo thorp octo, which means eight because there's sort of eight sides to that

11
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.830
symbol.

12
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.100
Right.

13
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.150
So this is the exact same thing.

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.700
Under the hood, it's still the V slot directive, but it's a much easier way to write it out.

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.940
So right here below as well, instead of V slot colon, we simply write a hash tag immediately afterwards

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.750
without a space.

17
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.860
We put the name of the slot that we created in the.

18
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.730
All right.

19
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.340
So if we use the title and subtitle names in our child component, we have to use those here.

20
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.560
The only difference here is how we specify them.

21
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.640
We provide a template tag, then a hash tag, then the name of that slot.

22
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.920
I'm going to save this.

23
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.590
I'm going to go back to Chrome so we can see that nothing has changed.

24
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.180
Let me refresh just so I can prove it.

25
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.890
There we go.

26
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.010
The exact same logic.

27
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.560
We are still populating those two slots with their respective contents and we are specifying to view

28
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.050
which content corresponds to which slot.

29
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.090
This is the title content to inject.

30
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.340
This is the subtitle Content to inject.

31
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.210
All right.

32
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.220
And that's all there is to cover in this lesson.

33
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.190
And I will see you in the next one for a section wrap up.
