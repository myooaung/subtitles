00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,620
Okay.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:08,400
So in this lesson, I want to show you a super cool optimization we can make in our hero component as

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,640
it relates to our props object that we are getting from our child.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,240
We can actually de structure this object in line the same way that we do structure properties of an

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,410
object in E6 in regular JavaScript, we can actually do this in view.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,650
So right here between my double quotes, I'm going to do structure the properties off that object that

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,020
I care about, some almost going to ignore giving that object a name and I'm simply going to pull out

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,800
the properties on it that I want to use in my template below.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,440
So obviously I want the image property, I want the title property and I want the description property.

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,600
And the reason we're getting an error right now, the red squiggly is because Vue is telling us, hey,

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,540
your destruction of these properties, but you're not using them anywhere.

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,910
And the reason for that is because we still have our old references to the slot props object in these

13
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,660
three locations.

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,520
So let's update them here.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,820
Instead of referencing IMG on slot props, we can now use it immediately in line like so here.

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,920
Instead of interpolating the value of the title property on slot props, we've already pulled off that

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,130
title property above so we can simply interpolate title.

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,260
And right here, instead of writing the property description on the slide props object, we're going

19
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,700
to de structure the exact same description property right here and we can simply write it in line,

20
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,390
save that, and that helps make our syntax a little bit cleaner.

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:27,720
Right.

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,180
And it kind of reinforces the core idea of the section is that view is going to bundle up all the props

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,570
that we passed and the child and object made available in line here.

24
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:36,930
Right?

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,240
And now we're just using JavaScript concepts on that object and everything is still going to work as

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,440
expected in our browser.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:43,950
All right.

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,930
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

29
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,460
So I will see you in the next one.
