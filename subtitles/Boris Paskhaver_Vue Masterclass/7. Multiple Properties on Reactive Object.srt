00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,270
In this lesson, I'd like to give you one more example of the reactive function in use.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,400
I'd like to show you how it works with objects with multiple properties, but will discover, of course,

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,970
is that Vue makes every one of those object properties reactive.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,970
So if we reference them in the computed function and then we change the value of those original properties,

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,450
any change will force the computed function to rerun.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,210
So let's begin by removing RF function.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:32,090
We're actually not using it anywhere in this file anymore, and I'm going to expand my person objects

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,570
slightly.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,840
Instead of having a single name property, I'm going to have both a first name and a last name property.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,780
And you can, of course, feel free to replace my name with your name.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,210
So I'm going to change this to first name and then I'm going to add a new property called Last Name

12
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,590
and provide my last name.

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:50,420
There we go.

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,870
And so here in my title Constant, which is the return value of the computed function, I can no longer

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,030
reference person name, but I can reference person dot, first name and person that last name.

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,790
And what I'm going to do here to avoid concatenation with the plus sign is just use S six template strings.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,190
So what I'm going to do is use the little tilde or tick, whatever you call it right here.

18
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,290
And then I'm going to interpolate the value of person dot first name in here.

19
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:25,730
This is all traditional JavaScript s syntax and afterwards I'm going to write a space as well as person

20
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:32,990
dot last name and then the great and then make sure to close it off with the little tilde or whatever

21
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,630
you call it, the little tick as they taught me in bootcamp right here.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,760
So we have referencing the value of first name followed by a space and the last name and then the great.

23
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,190
And another thing worth noting here that I forgot to mention, the previous lesson is title is going

24
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,870
to be a reactive object, a regular reactive object, the exact kind that you might expect from the

25
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,770
ref function.

26
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,220
So we still need to reference value on the title constant.

27
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,030
Right here it is.

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,620
It is a requirement here.

29
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:57,860
Right?

30
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,060
We do not need to reference value whenever we are dealing with anything on person.

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,420
Right.

32
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,090
So right here, what I can do is change the value of person.

33
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,870
That first name.

34
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,480
I could change that to Peter for example.

35
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,550
And of course when we run this file, we'll see that we're going to start out with start out with Boris

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,880
pass over her the great and then transition to Peter passed through the great.

37
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,900
But every single property on a person object is reactive.

38
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,210
So here is an example of first thing and of course if I change last name, so I'll change last name

39
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:31,790
to something like Griffin and once again I will output the value of title value.

40
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,910
We'll see that because the computed function is tracking the object and any of the properties that are

41
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,510
referenced here.

42
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,130
If any of them change, then the computed function will rerun the arrow function.

43
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,320
Then we pass it and get the new value of title.

44
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,560
So now if I output title value afterwards, we'll see.

45
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,860
We've changed that once again to Peter Griffin the great right.

46
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,350
So every single property here now has the ability to be reactive and thus anywhere where we reference

47
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,650
those properties, the computed function will reevaluate, right?

48
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,220
If we only reference one such as person dot first name, then the computed function will rerun whenever

49
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,760
first name changes.

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,030
Right.

51
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,740
But in this case we reference both.

52
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,820
So view is keeping track of both of these properties and their state.

53
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,050
And as soon as either one of them changes, it's going to rerun this function.

54
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,120
It doesn't have to be both changing at the same time.

55
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,110
It can be just one.

56
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,940
And we demonstrated that with these examples where we changed the first name properties and the last

57
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,500
thing properties one at a time.

58
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,220
All right.

59
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,660
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

60
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,130
So I will see you in the next one.
