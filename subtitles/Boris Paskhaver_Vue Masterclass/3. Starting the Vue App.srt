1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,650
All right.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,640
So in the previous lesson, we created our job search view app.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,240
Our next step is to show this app in our web browser.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,590
And the output right here tells us exactly how to do that.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,000
We have to navigate into our job search folder, and this is a command that you should write down or

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,030
memorize, become very familiar with and PM Run.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,730
Serve is going to be the command that runs the View app in our browser.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,320
So let's go ahead and navigate into our directory with the KD command and run, NPM, run, serve.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,380
This process can take up to a couple of seconds.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,670
It has to build up all the files transpire them, which we talked about earlier.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,290
That's the process for Babble.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,890
It's going to take our view code and convert it to HTML, CSS and JavaScript that the browser can understand

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,090
it when it's done.

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,880
You're going to see this message compile successfully and it's going to give you a port on local host,

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,910
which is your computer, where you can access this app.

16
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,310
Now, normally what this should do is open up a web browser with the app, and if you see that, that's

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,640
great.

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,530
If it doesn't do that, then what you can do is open up your web browser of choice, in my case Chrome,

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,720
and simply navigate to this URL in the browser and you should see the app.

20
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,160
So let me do that right here.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,350
I'm going to drag over my Google Chrome Web browser from the other screen and right here, right in

22
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,100
the URL bar.

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,900
I'm going to follow this path right here.

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,820
Local host Colon 80.

25
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,860
So local host colon 80 and that's going to take you to your view app and welcome.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,130
This is a running view up in our browser.

27
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:38,380
Welcome to your Vue.js app and it's going to provide you of course with links to the UCI documentation.

28
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,450
It's going to tell you about some of the plugins that it automatically installed for you, some essential

29
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,930
links to check out the ecosystem review, which we talked about earlier.

30
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,730
Those are some of the related tools that are developed by the team that we're going to be working with

31
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,660
a little bit later on, of course.

32
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,520
But this is a running Vue app, right?

33
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:55,900
That's it.

34
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,120
That's all the earliest to cover in this lesson.

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,530
If you see this, then everything is set up successfully and we are all clear to start exploring the

36
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,500
code that powers the web page that you see right here.

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,030
I'll see you in the next lesson.
