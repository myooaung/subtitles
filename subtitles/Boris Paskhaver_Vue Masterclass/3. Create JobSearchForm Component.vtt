00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.260
Okay.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.000
So let's start building out our job search form.

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.770
I'm going to create a new component to capture the form itself.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.850
So right here in our source components directory, I'll create a job search form, dot view file.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.720
And of course, what do we need in a view file?

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.410
We need a template section.

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.770
And I'm actually going to put a form element in here because this will be a form to collect input from

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.230
the user, the role and the location.

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.540
For now, I'm going to put some text in the form just so we can verify that it is rendering correctly

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.760
when we eventually do render it in our browser.

11
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.310
So I will put the text of I will be in a better form eventually.

12
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.220
Just so we have some terrible humor in the app.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.730
Perfect.

14
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.090
And then, of course, the other thing we need is a script section.

15
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.900
And here I'm going to export default my JavaScript object, which, of course is our configuration object

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.710
for this component.

17
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.320
The only property I'm going to add is going to be job search or the name property, and I'll set it

18
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.730
to job search form.

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.640
Save that, add a line break to make prettier happy and that is a good place to start for this component.

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.330
So where do I want to render this job search form component?

21
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.150
I want to render it in my hero component.

22
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.910
As a reminder, our hero component is the one that's rendering the full grid, and it's also rendering

23
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.110
the headline component where we have our changing action test text.

24
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.720
And I want to render my job search form immediately below the headline component.

25
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.780
So right down below here in the script section, I'm going to import my new job search form component

26
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.480
and that's going to come from my source directory, which is represented by that symbol, then the components

27
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.630
folder and then my new job search form dot view file.

28
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.870
Of course I have to register as a local component and I can do that right here in my components object

29
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.450
that allows me to render this component in line.

30
00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.450
Again, I can use either this syntax or kabob case, which means all lowercase with dashes, and that's

31
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.740
exactly what we're going to do here.

32
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.430
So right below headline, I'm going to do a single self closing tag and I'll write out job dash, search,

33
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.030
dash form, provide that closing tag like so.

34
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.870
And since we're here right now, I think now is a good time as any to clean up our yellow background.

35
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.300
We previously did that and in order in order to distinguish the different sections of our grid.

36
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.820
But I think we're a little bit more comfortable seeing that change and those boxes on the screen already

37
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.920
so we can go ahead and remove some of those remnants of experimentation revolving around CSS.

38
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.360
That's great.

39
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.350
So right here on this section right here, we can remove that big yellow 200 class.

40
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.310
Perfect.

41
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.960
And then we can also remove the blue border around every div, which represents a section of columns

42
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.090
within the larger 12 column grid.

43
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.810
So on this one column grid, this one column div, what I can do is remove the border and blue 700 classes

44
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.120
on this second div, which is storing the headline, the job search form.

45
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.770
It is taking up five total columns.

46
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.510
I can similarly remove the border and same thing with our remaining two DIMMs of five columns and one

47
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.560
columns respectively.

48
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.540
We can go ahead and remove that.

49
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.630
And remove that.

50
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.030
And while we're at it as well, we probably don't need the text inside the device anymore to communicate.

51
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.240
We just can use the visual representation or the segmentations of these columns within the grid to identify

52
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.170
where they begin and end.

53
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.600
So I'm going to remove the one column text right here, and I'm going to remove the five columns text

54
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.330
right here and the one column text right here.

55
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.530
Perfect.

56
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.430
That's a good place to be.

57
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.100
So let's check in, in the browser to see how this looks.

58
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.170
And this is in pretty good shape.

59
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.900
So notice our headline component is still working.

60
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.530
And here is our introductory text to prompt the user to search.

61
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.400
And then this is our new search form component rendering right here.

62
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.860
Of course, there's no actual form elements yet, but don't worry, everything is correctly rendering

63
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.000
as it's shown on the page.

64
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.680
And in the very next lesson, we can start applying some CSR styles to all of these elements.
