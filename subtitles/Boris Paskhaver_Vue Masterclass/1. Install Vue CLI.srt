1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,140
Okay.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:08,010
So in this lesson, we're going to install the View SEAL Eye and the acronym SEAL Eye is short for command

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,000
line interface.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,400
So basically the view CLIA is going to run as your typical terminal or command line program.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,280
You can think of something like get as a closed comparison.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,120
And the purpose of this tool is to make it really easy to create, manage and update view projects.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,550
And when I say view project, I basically just mean a web application built with the View Library.

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,040
So The View Seelye, for example, is going to make it really easy for us in the next lesson to execute

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,430
just one command and have a complete view project ready to go so it can generate project folders for

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,650
your project files, web pack configurations, basically sparing you the need to understand all of those

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,580
deep technical details that are required to get a View app up and running in the browser.

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,650
So instead of manually hardwiring all this plumbing, the view is going to make it really easy for us

13
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,980
to just get up and running really quickly and then later on in the course.

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,410
That usually is also going to help us with doing things like adding plug ins to view adding additional

15
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,020
NPM packages like view AX in Vue router.

16
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:13,320
And one advantage of the view Celia over NPM is not only does it download and fetch those packages from

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,060
NPM, but it also creates, for example, starter files with the basic boilerplate code.

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,610
You need to get started with some of those technologies.

19
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,140
So this is a command line interface that is specifically built for working with Vue.

20
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,590
All right.

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,400
So in a moment, I'll take you directly to my terminal and we'll install it.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,820
But first, I want to give you a little bit of background on what we're going to do with NPM.

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,690
We're going to install Vue Sealey as a global NPM dependency.

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,880
So this is a regular NPM package.

25
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,310
It's a regular repository hosted on NPM, but we're not going to attach it to any specific project because

26
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,420
the view really is not really focused on being in a specific project.

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,220
Rather, it's a piece of software for helping us create and manage other projects, view projects.

28
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,040
So we're going to be installing it as a global dependency.

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,470
Now that basically means is when we run NPM install, we're going to attach a dash g flag that is short

30
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,420
for global and NPM is going to install it in some directory on your computer and then it's simply going

31
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,200
to be available in your terminal just like any other terminal based program.

32
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,720
So it's going to operate quote unquote, globally.

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,300
And all that globally means is it's not isolated to a specific project or a specific project folder.

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,550
It's just this global app that's installed on your computer, just like any other app on your computer.

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,010
The only difference is it's coming from NPM.

36
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,490
All right.

37
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,960
And I'll show you how to do that in just a second.

38
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,070
So with that, let's transition to the command line and we're going to go ahead and install The View

39
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,670
Seelye.

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,350
Okay.

41
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,900
So here I am in my terminal on a mac, but the command should be the exact same on your Windows computer.

42
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:47,220
And what I'm going to execute is NPM install, but I'm also going to add that dash g flag.

43
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,460
So Dash G and that of course is short for global.

44
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,740
So we're not attaching the package to a specific project, rather we're installing it globally.

45
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,090
So it is available to be used from any directory, from any folder on your computer.

46
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,280
So right now I'm executing this on my desktop folder, but you can basically be anywhere in your computer's

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,970
file structure.

48
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,150
As long as NPM is installed, this command should work.

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:09,810
All right.

50
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,130
So we're going to follow this up with the name of the actual package, and that's going to be act view.

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,000
That is the name of the actual organization that is hosting this repository.

52
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,160
Then slash C ally.

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,560
That is the actual name of the package itself.

54
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,370
All right.

55
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:29,370
Now, I am recording this video at the start of March 2022, and what I'd like to do now is pin down

56
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,830
a specific version number of the views really, because by default, if you run this command as is,

57
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,780
it's going to install the latest version, which may be different from the one that is the latest right

58
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,080
now.

59
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,840
And just to reduce the chances of possible errors or warnings, I want you to have a version that is

60
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,000
basically exactly like mine that just reduces the chances that there's updates or changes that are going

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,350
to lead to a different experience.

62
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,520
So I assure you that this is a pretty modern up to date version of the SEAL.

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,800
I and I will be monitoring this video as the course progresses in order to make sure that there isn't

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,270
a newer version released.

65
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,780
And if there is, I will do my best to update these videos as quickly as possible.

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,520
But for now, since we're just getting started with Vue, we don't really need to worry about this.

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,930
I just would like you to install a specific version to reduce all these chances of errors.

68
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,430
So in order to do that, we're going to add an app sign at the end, and that allows us to specify a

69
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,690
specific version number.

70
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,870
And we want to do 5.0.1.

71
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,190
And this is the latest version as of March 2022.

72
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:35,460
But if it's 5.0.2 tomorrow or 5.1 in a couple of months, don't worry, those changes are not going

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,540
to be that staggering.

74
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,400
And this CGI version will allow us to work with the latest and greatest version of Vue itself, which

75
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,210
is Vue three.

76
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:42,960
All right.

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,370
So we're going to install this global dependency and it might take a minute or two.

78
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,310
And when it's done, I want to try two different commands to verify that we have successfully installed

79
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,160
the view zeolite.

80
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,120
By the way, this program is going to be available on your command line with the command name view Yui.

81
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,830
So first step, what I want to show you here, I'm going to clear all this content is we can execute

82
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:11,340
the command and PM list followed by the Dash G flag that is once again short for global and that's going

83
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,400
to show you all installed global NPM dependencies.

84
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,560
So now you'll notice we have you still appear here with the exact same version number that we specified.

85
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,430
So that's great.

86
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,940
And then as I mentioned, we have this view command and if we want to add on a dash dash version flag

87
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,370
that will give you the version of the vehicle, I think we're going to get 5.0.1 here as well.

88
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,110
But the more important thing here is the mere fact that we are getting a number here means that this

89
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:42,390
command is working, which means Vue is now registered as a valid command, a valid program from the

90
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:42,990
terminal.

91
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,180
So that means everything has been installed correctly.

92
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,190
So what I'm going to do now is clear the content again, and now I'm just going to execute view by itself.

93
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,860
And that's going to bring up the documentation for this seal.

94
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,690
As I scroll up here, you can see it begins with a couple of options, including the version flag that

95
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,200
we just saw.

96
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,250
But here is really the heart of everything that Dave usually can do for you.

97
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,290
And the way it works is we begin with the view command, followed by a space and then one of these commands.

98
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,800
So for example, we can do view, create or view add or view invoke, etc. in each one of these commands

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,550
will do something different.

100
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,650
So for example, in the next lesson we're going to use, if you create in order to create a new project

101
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,780
powered by this usually service and you can also do something like if you add it to add a certain plug

102
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,280
in to the project, that's going to be something like View X and view router later on in the course.

103
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,470
So once again, this is just a basic command line software program to make it really easy to create

104
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,480
and spin up a view app from scratch.

105
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,610
If you're coming from the React ecosystem, this is very equivalent to something like Create React app,

106
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,010
but even more fleshed out and expanded.

107
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,120
All right, that's all there is to cover in this lesson now that the vehicle is installed, that we

108
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,510
can use it in the very next lesson to create our job search view app.

109
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,850
So pretty exciting stuff and I'll see you there.
