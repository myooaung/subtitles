1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,710
Okay.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:08,700
So I have opened up our Gators file and as a reminder, we still have our two old getters filter jobs

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,790
by organizations and filter jobs by job types.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,630
And we have captured all of this logic in our new getters down below, both our inclusion getters and

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,400
the final filter jobs getter.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,310
So we are almost at the point where we can remove these two getters from this getters file.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,260
However, we need to still look through the code base to see if there's anywhere else where we are using

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:31,470
them.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,920
So I'm going to bring up my VS Code search with command shift F and I'm going to look for filtered jobs

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,580
by just to get that kind of prefix at the very beginning.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,500
And we'll notice there's one location where we're still using it and it's in the sub nav component.

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,010
So if I open up my sub nav component as a reminder here, this is the sub nav that appears below the

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,030
main nav.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,820
The main menu we are still using are filter jobs by organizations getter and obviously we do not want

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,300
this one.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,760
We now want our filter jobs getter because that is going to reflect the most accurate number of filter

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,130
jobs after we apply both the organizations filter and the job types filter.

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,630
So let's open up the corresponding sub nav test file in sub nav.

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:24,060
That test that J.S. Let me bring up my terminal and let me quickly start running NPM run, test, colon

20
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,450
watch.

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,110
And there shouldn't be anything failing right now.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:35,040
But you'll notice in our test we are still using the old filter jobs by organizations getter right here.

23
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,770
So I'm going to follow a TDD approach.

24
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,240
I'm going to fix the tests first.

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,730
So right here I'm going to provide this getter right here a filter jobs replacing it in my first test

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,780
and down below.

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,840
It doesn't look like we're doing anything here, so that's just fine.

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,090
That's just going to lead to a test failure.

29
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,270
But that's exactly what we expect because our test is providing a gara filter jobs while our component

30
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,450
is still relying on the getter a filter jobs by organizations.

31
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,400
So obviously when we're mounting this component in our test suite, view says, hey, I don't know what

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,970
this is.

33
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,010
The scatter right here that you're registering doesn't exist from the monster you've given me, so it's

34
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:11,910
causing a failure.

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,920
So everything is predictable and we can edit our implementation to make the tests pass.

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,380
So obviously right here, instead of importing our former getter, we want to import the name for our

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,320
new getter and that is going to be filtered jobs.

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,750
So import filter jobs from our constants file right here to the map getters function.

39
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,550
I'm going to provide that constant name that is going to give us that getter as a computed property

40
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,360
on this component.

41
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,150
And finally, we're using it above right here.

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,400
We are taking the length of that array because that becomes the number that we're displaying in the

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,610
sub.

44
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,130
Now, I'm going to change this to filter jobs as well, which we now have available as a computed property

45
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,320
on our component thanks to map getters.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,310
Save this.

47
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,500
Let's let the tests rerun.

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,740
Gave it just a second here.

49
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,340
All right.

50
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,620
So everything is passing as far as our tests.

51
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,740
And if I head back to the browser, let's try it out.

52
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,860
So I'm going to expand job types, expand organizations.

53
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,370
I'm going to reveal my sub nav by signing in as a user.

54
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,350
Here we have 100 jobs matched.

55
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,980
And as I select a job type, the right hand side filters.

56
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,860
And this number up here, updates as well as I select only the view to jobs, the jobs to the right

57
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,470
filter and the number up here updates as well.

58
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,180
And keep an eye on that number as I select some sample organizations and job types.

59
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,830
And then as I remove them, once again, that number will continue to update with every single.

60
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,960
Selection that I make.

61
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,650
All right.

62
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,350
So our implementation is working, our tests are passing.

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,540
We are in a really good shape right now.

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,880
And then the very next last thing, we can go ahead and finally remove those original two getters.
