1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,050
Okay.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,590
So let's go ahead and create our new sub nav component.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,520
Sub nav, as a reminder is short for sub navigation.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,380
This is a secondary menu that will appear below our primary menu.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,070
Okay.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,150
So all of our components are within our components directory and SIRC.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,700
So let's place our new component in there as well.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,860
Later on, we may create some nested directories to organize our code, but right now we have a pretty

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,000
small number of components.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,850
So I'm going to call this sub navigate view.

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,710
And within this view, component file.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,670
What do we need?

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,430
We know that we need to start off with a template tag.

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,650
Here is where we're going to specify our HTML.

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,290
We cannot have an empty template tag, so let's put some placeholder content in here for now.

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:50,950
I'm just going to render a div and inside I'll put some arbitrary text like this is a seven out.

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,680
The other thing I want to add to this file is, of course, my script tags.

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,920
This is where I write my JavaScript related to my view component.

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,580
And as you should know by now, we export default a plain JavaScript object, and this is our configuration

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,380
object for this component.

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,480
For now, the only property I want to add here is name and I'm going to give it the exact same name

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,580
as the file, which is subnets.

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,930
I really see no reason to give it any other name, but in case you do want something different to render

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,860
in your view Dev.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,660
This is where you can customize that.

26
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,570
I'm going to save this file to apply my prettier changes.

27
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,340
It also looks like it wants me to add an additional line break after my closing script tag.

28
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,390
So I'm going to do that.

29
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:31,590
Perfect.

30
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,690
So we have a new sub nav component, but of course we're not rendering it anywhere, so it's not going

31
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,010
to appear in the browser.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,260
So where do we want to render this sub nav?

33
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,170
We want to render it directly below the main nav.

34
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,200
So I'm going to head into my main nav view file.

35
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:51,330
And as you may recall, there's a couple of things we need to do in order to allow the sub nav component

36
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,140
to be rendered here.

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,840
We have to import it here in the script section.

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,800
We have to register it with the components key of my main nav.

39
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,350
Basically, the components key sets the child components that the main nav component can render.

40
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,820
And once we've registered it here, then we can use it in the template above.

41
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,020
So these are all should be hopefully familiar steps, but let's walk through them right now.

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
I'll begin by importing my sub nav component right here.

43
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,210
And we know that the app sign here represents my astro seed directory.

44
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,650
In there I have a components folder and then there I have my new sub nav component.

45
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,180
So I'm going to import it like so.

46
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,760
And then of course we want to register it here.

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm going to add it as another key here, sub nav comma.

48
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,930
And as a reminder, this is using the S shorthand where we have a key or a property of sub nav whose

49
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,370
value is this component.

50
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,400
And this of course allows us to specify the name that we're going to use for this component in our template

51
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,500
in case we want to use a different name.

52
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,630
But this is totally fine for us because I'm okay with using just sub nav by itself.

53
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,230
Okay.

54
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,500
So we are seeing a little bit of a warning here, but that is to be expected.

55
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,670
This is because the sub nav component has been registered but not used.

56
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,140
So is led to saying, hey, you're telling me that this component is going to be rendered as a child,

57
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,980
but you're not using it anywhere in your actual template and that's a waste of memory.

58
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,990
So let's go ahead and add this sub now.

59
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,100
So I'm going to scroll up here.

60
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,640
So if I go back to my design, you'll notice we have this top level header and then we have a nested

61
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,330
divan here.

62
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,400
This is our top level div that makes the box fixed, which means it's going to stick to the top of the

63
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,850
screen.

64
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,080
As we scroll down.

65
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,470
I want to put my sub now within this fixed div, but not within the next one, because this div right

66
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,460
here is taking care of our primary main navigation.

67
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,670
So this is where we have our links and our action button and our profile image.

68
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,730
I'm going to collapse this there right here and I want to add my seven have immediately below it.

69
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,230
So let me actually go back here.

70
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,460
I think I accidentally deleted it.

71
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,720
Let me collapse.

72
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,360
And right below this div right here.

73
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,020
Perfect.

74
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,210
This is where I want to render my sub naff.

75
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,820
All right, so it is going to be a self-closing component because we don't have anything to render inside

76
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,060
of it.

77
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,560
We're going to talk more about when we would use opening and closing components a little bit later on.

78
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,980
But we're going to render this component the same way we've rendered any other component.

79
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,170
We're just going to do some NAV, followed by the closing tag right here and the closing curly brace.

80
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,990
Okay, so that will render a sub nav.

81
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,310
And if I go back to my browser now, we should see our seven now appear and there it is.

82
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,390
Let me just refresh the page.

83
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,680
It looks like I have some left over.

84
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,310
There it is.

85
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,670
This is our sub nav rendering below our main nav.

86
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,700
If I go into my view component our devtools I will see my view components.

87
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,700
Here is my main nav component and inside it it is rendering this sub nav child component right here.

88
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,100
You can now see it highlighted in green.

89
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,910
Perfect.

90
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,680
So we have created the sub nav and in the very next lesson we're going to go ahead and start styling

91
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:49,770
it.

92
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,880
So I'll see you there.
