00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.200
All right.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.800
So in this lesson, I'm going to introduce you to another view directive, and it is called the model.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.020
And the reason it exists is to solve this exact problem that we saw in the previous lesson.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.370
This is a valid way to establish two way data binding, but this is such a common operation in modern

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.090
web development.

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.450
The idea of connecting data to our template and keeping the two in sync with two way data binding.

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.390
This is so common that the View developers said, Let us give you an easy directive to accomplish the

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.950
exact same result.

9
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.640
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to remove the V bind to my value attribute and I'm going to

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.620
remove the V on event reacting to the input.

11
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.870
So we're going to remove those two and we're going to accomplish the exact same thing by adding this

12
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.160
directive right in line.

13
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.960
And we're going to write the directive the same way we did any of our other directives like V on or

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.470
before.

15
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.700
We're just going to write it in line.

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.030
But it is called V model and you can see the description V code creates a two way binding in a form

17
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.560
input element or a component.

18
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.890
Right?

19
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.860
And what we provided is a string and all we have to give here is the name of the data property that

20
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.800
we want to connect the two way data binding to.

21
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.880
So obviously this is our role input.

22
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.610
So it connects to this role piece of data.

23
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.310
So all I'm going to do is type in role right here.

24
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.700
And it's that simple and so much cleaner.

25
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.550
We just write the V model directive equals and then the data property we want to connect it to and immediately

26
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.960
we have to wait out a binding.

27
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.470
So let me scroll down here and we're going do the same thing.

28
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.590
We're going to remove the V binding to the value attribute.

29
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.560
We're going to remove the reaction to the input event.

30
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.410
And right here we're going to attach the V model.

31
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.150
But of course, we have to be careful here and attach it to the correct data property and that is going

32
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.230
to be location.

33
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.450
So right here, v model location.

34
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.140
So what else does that allow us to clean up?

35
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.080
Well, we no longer need these methods.

36
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.810
We no longer need this verbose approach of knowing about the event object and knowing which property

37
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.360
to access on it and getting target and getting value and then manually overwriting that a V model takes

38
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.070
care of all of that for us.

39
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.370
So you guessed that we can remove those two methods and that's the entire methods object right here.

40
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.570
So there there are seven lines removed there and two additional lines for each input remove below.

41
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.630
So we have removed something like ten lines and only added two more lines for V model and it accomplishes

42
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.010
the exact same thing.

43
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.500
Now, the reason I wanted to show you the long form way first is because you can't always rely on V

44
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.400
model number one.

45
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.200
And number two, I want to make sure you understand what is going on under the hood or behind the scenes,

46
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.870
what Vue does for us automatically before I show you the shortcut way to accomplish it.

47
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.150
So if I go back to my browser right now.

48
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.030
There it is.

49
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.350
And it looks like everything refreshed.

50
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.820
Here's my job search form.

51
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.160
You'll notice we have our data properties still present.

52
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.420
And as I type in here, for example, I will type, let's say, view a developer.

53
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.420
You'll notice my role data property will update here if I type a location like California.

54
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.120
You'll notice my location data property will update.

55
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.480
And if I change it, for example, if I click in here and change California to Seattle and save, you'll

56
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.210
notice the input element will update as well.

57
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.910
So we have the exact same two way data binding or bidirectional data binding, whatever you want to

58
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.240
call it.

59
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.930
We have that with a much simpler syntax of the model.

60
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.630
And in fact, one way I can prove this to you, it's kind of going to be a cool thing is and you do

61
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.800
not have to follow along with this.

62
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.440
By the way, I just want to show you that if I go here, I'm just going to type in Colon and I'm going

63
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.730
to use my curly brace syntax to interpolate or render the value of the overall data property right here

64
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.300
in line.

65
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.630
Right.

66
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.400
And you do not need to follow along.

67
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.840
This is just for the sake of example.

68
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.490
So I'm going to show you that as I go to my browser and type here, for example, I'm going to type

69
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.260
a role of, let's say, developer.

70
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.770
You'll notice as I type, we're going to see the exact same text appear at the very top above.

71
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.450
So again, why is this happening?

72
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.730
Well, it's happening because we have two way data binding.

73
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.440
So as we type every character, we are in turn updating the data.

74
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.780
Property of role and view knows that whenever the role data property updates, it needs to re render

75
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.290
the template.

76
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.730
So it's looking at the template.

77
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:32.000
And in the template we are referencing that role data property with our curly braces and the template

78
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.070
so it knows it needs to display it and its current value, which happens to be the exact same value

79
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.270
that we typed into our input.

80
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.270
So as we type a character instantaneously, this updates right here, which in turn updates this right

81
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.570
here.

82
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.250
And that is a proof that we have two way data binding as we're making a change in our template, we

83
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.570
are changing our data and as our data is changing, we are making a corresponding change in our template.

84
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.340
So that is a visual way of proving that we have to wait out a binding and a visual way of demonstrating

85
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.350
what DV model directive gives us.

86
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.840
Let me go back to my code and remove this, since this was just for the sake of example.

87
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.040
There we go.

88
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.510
And that's all there is to cover.

89
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.820
In this lesson, we introduced the model directive.

90
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.790
We write it in line just like any other directive.

91
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.410
There is no shortcut for this one.

92
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.740
Unlike Von or V bind, you always have the right leadership dash model followed by an equal sign and

93
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.200
then the name of the data property to connect or bind that inputs value to.

94
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.390
So as the data changes, the input will update.

95
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.550
As the input updates, the data will change.

96
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.090
All right.

97
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.460
That's all there is to cover here.

98
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.150
So I will see you in the next lesson.
