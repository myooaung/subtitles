1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,990
Okay.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,230
So in this lesson, we're going to start building out these styles for a single job listing in our job

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,160
listings component.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:15,480
So right here in our main tag, let's remove this former text and we'll begin with an ordered list.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,210
So I'm going to use the 0lh HTML element.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,030
So technically speaking, the jobs that the user sees are going to be prioritized in a certain order.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,220
You may not see a number to the left of each job listing, but there is still the concept of order.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,820
So an ordered list here is a more descriptive and semantic element compared to a U, l or an unordered

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,090
list.

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,950
So we're going to go with all L here.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,040
That's exactly how it appears on the Google website.

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,560
So let's create an ordered list and then for each one of our job listings, that is going to be its

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,850
own list item.

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,740
So I'm going to create an ally here and I'm going to immediately add a single tailwind class to that.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,390
And that's going to be me.

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,800
Seven is short for margin bottom and seven is a class that's going to apply 28 pixels of margin on the

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,660
bottom, which is just going to create some spacing in between our subsequent job listings or in other

18
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,490
words, our subsequent list items here.

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,630
Okay.

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,500
So as it turns out, the entire job listing itself is clickable on the Google Careers website, and

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,550
if you click it, it goes to the specific job page for that job.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,910
So in order to make our complete content of this box, of this job listing clickable, we need to make

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,690
it a link.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,330
But of course we no longer have the concept of hyperlinks or tags because we have a single page app.

25
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,100
So what I'm going to do here is use the view router component called router link.

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,400
Remember that is the view router equivalent of a hyperlink.

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,440
It allows us to navigate to another path without forcing a page, refresh or navigation.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,930
So I'm going to create a router link component here.

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,790
And because I want to have content inside it and all of that content is going to be clickable.

30
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:00,520
I'm going to make sure I have both an opening and a closing router link tag, and any content that I

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,090
put in here will be a child of the router link and thus clicking on any content here will navigate to

32
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,370
wherever the rattling says to navigate to.

33
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,700
So we don't have the concept of specific IDs for our jobs.

34
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,190
So for now, I'm going to use the two prop and I'm just going to give it an arbitrary URL of slash jobs,

35
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,110
slash results, slash one.

36
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,390
I know this isn't perfect because we don't have the idea of one to this job yet, but we need some kind

37
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,880
of place to direct the user when they click on the job listing.

38
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,030
So let's just make a go to jobs, slash results, slash one.

39
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,900
Furthermore, I'd like to add a couple of classes to this router link to style it.

40
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,290
So I'm going to make it a block element by adding the block class.

41
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:45,620
Then I'm going to center it in the middle of my job listings component by applying margin on the left

42
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,340
and right side.

43
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,640
I can do that with the Amex auto class that's going to center it in the center of my job listings component

44
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,960
or the outer element.

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,290
That is.

46
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,940
Then what I'd like to do is give it a white background, which I can do with big white.

47
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,060
Then I'd like to add a border around the entire box.

48
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,200
So I will apply the border class to give a border of one pixel.

49
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,990
I will make sure that border is solid with the border solid class, and the color is going to be border

50
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,340
brand gray too.

51
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,950
That is coming from our tailwind config file.

52
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,450
So border brand great deal.

53
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:25,790
The other thing that I'd like to do is make this a rounded box so I can add the rounded tailwind class

54
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,740
to apply a border radius of four pixels.

55
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,500
That is going to give it a little bit of a curve on all four of its edges.

56
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:36,230
And finally, in the previous lesson, we added that box shadow and the new scissors class for that

57
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,280
is Shadow Gray.

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,110
However, I only want to apply that when the user hovers over this box.

59
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:48,260
So in order to apply a style or a class only on hover, remember we need to prefix it with that hover

60
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,010
keyword followed by a colon and then the name of that CS6 class.

61
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,210
So on Hover I want to apply Shadow Gray and let me save this.

62
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,070
So we get a reformatting and we can see it.

63
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:58,830
Here we go.

64
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,950
Hover, colon, shadow, gray.

65
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,140
And remember, the reason that this word here is gray is because that's the name we used for the box

66
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,620
shadow as our property in the tailwind config file.

67
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,180
In the previous lesson.

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,400
Okay.

69
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,130
So this is going to be our router link.

70
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,150
When the user clicks on any content inside here, it's going to navigate them to this page right here.

71
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,970
So inside that router link, I want to add a new div.

72
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,510
And that div is going to be the kind of container that stores our primary heading, which includes the

73
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,560
job title name as well as the company and the location of the job.

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,750
So I'm going to add some quick classes here as well.

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,290
We're going to add five to you short for padding top.

76
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,990
So some spacing inside the box for the top to push the text content a little bit down.

77
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,810
I also want to add a little bit of padding on the bottom.

78
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,170
I can do that with the P B series of classes, padding bottom.

79
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,770
We're going to go with PB two here for about eight pixels of bottom padding.

80
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,980
I then want to add some margin on the left and right side.

81
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,900
So the X axis, so I'm going to apply the max eight class that's going to apply a 32 pixel.

82
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,810
So margin on the left and 32 pixels of margin on the right.

83
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,690
And here I'd like to add a border as well.

84
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,880
This is going to be for the kind of top section of this box where we have the, as I mentioned, the

85
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,020
title and the listings, and then there's a border and then you actually start the job description.

86
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,090
So we're going to add a border on the bottom of this def using the border B class border bottom.

87
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,820
We're going to make that a solid border with border solid.

88
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,880
And for this border color, we're also going to use border brand gray to.

89
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,540
All right.

90
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,140
So there we go.

91
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,160
Now, inside the div, we're going to need a header to store the job title.

92
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,120
It's going to be an H2 element since it's not the primary header of our webpage.

93
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,870
And let's type in a sample job name right now.

94
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,920
We're going to hard code this text and later on we'll make it dynamic when we fetch the jobs from a

95
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,720
sample back end.

96
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:54,740
For now, we're just kind of building out the look and feel of the job listing and hard coding some

97
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,340
text values.

98
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,380
But later on we will make these dynamic.

99
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,180
So for now, let's go with a real job title from the Google website, which is Technical Program Manager

100
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,690
Perception, Augmented Reality.

101
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,700
That sounds like exactly the kind of Google skill that I would never be able to do in real life.

102
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,240
Okay, so let's add a couple of classes to this H2 element.

103
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,540
We're going to add a little bit of margin on the bottom using maybe two.

104
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,790
That is eight pixels of bottom margin.

105
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,960
And we're going to make this text a little bit larger than our standard text.

106
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,850
So I'm going to apply the text to Excel class.

107
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,850
You can see that applies a font size of 1.5 RAM and then a standard pixel size of 16 pixels.

108
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,300
That's going to be a 24 pixel font size for this header.

109
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,580
So kind of prominently sitting there in the box.

110
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,450
All right.

111
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:47,000
So below our H2, I want to put another DIV and this is where we're going to store information about

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,780
the company that the job is at because remember, the Google conglomerate holds a bunch of smaller companies

113
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,660
underneath it like Google, YouTube, etc. and we're going to have the same idea here.

114
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:04,160
So for now, we're going to keep things simple, but we're going to apply a class here and we need a

115
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,780
little bit of margin on the right here.

116
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:11,330
So I'll add an M.R. margin right class and we'll do our five for 20 pixels of right margin.

117
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,550
And in here I'll put a span with the name of the intercompany within my larger company.

118
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,430
You can make up whatever word or company you want to do here.

119
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,870
I'm just going to use the word bobble since I can't be creative right now and come up with more fake

120
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,350
companies.

121
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,500
And finally below that, we want to add another div and here's where we're going to put a span with

122
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,150
the location of this job.

123
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:38,360
So let's say this job is located in San Francisco, California, United States.

124
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,290
It doesn't really matter what you write in either of these spans, as long as there's some text that

125
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:42,830
should be good.

126
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:43,490
All right.

127
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,830
So we've closed this div we've closed the outer div that is storing the header content.

128
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:54,170
And then we're going to put all of that within a router link to make this a clickable view router link,

129
00:07:54,290 --> 00:08:00,440
which is itself inside a list item because it is semantically one item in a list in an ordered list.

130
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,630
So quite a bit in this lesson.

131
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,180
Let's take a look at what it looks like right now in the browser.

132
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,590
So there we go.

133
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,280
Looking good.

134
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,440
So this is what things are looking like right now.

135
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,840
Let's see if I can actually push the San Francisco text onto the same line as Bobo.

136
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,360
And I think we can do that with a couple extra classes.

137
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,460
So if I go back to my editor, let's see here we have our H2.

138
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,540
We ever div.

139
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,470
All right.

140
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:32,540
So what I want to do here is for these two divs right here with our company name and our city, I'm

141
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,520
going to wrap those in their own div.

142
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,260
So let me do that right here.

143
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,020
And then I'm going to add a couple of classes to this one in order to get them aligned on the same row.

144
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:47,120
So I'm going to make it a Flexbox and I'm going to make sure that that Flexbox goes in a row base direction

145
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,200
by doing flex row.

146
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,970
And then I'm going to apply a line middle and that is just going to apply a vertical line of middle.

147
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,620
So it's kind of the text is centered in the center or the middle of that.

148
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,150
Flexbox I'm going to save that.

149
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,460
Let's go back to a browser and see how that looks.

150
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,120
All right.

151
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,580
So that is getting to where we want.

152
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,180
Looking good.

153
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,030
We have our H2 with the name, we have our company, we have our location.

154
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,860
You'll notice as I hover my mouse, we're getting that box shadow over the entire box.

155
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,830
And you'll also notice in the bottom left of my chrome window, you'll see that we have that URL listed

156
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,200
of slash jobs, slash results, slash one.

157
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,520
So if we click on this, it will indeed navigate us to that job page for that job.

158
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,170
So things are looking pretty good.

159
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,690
And the very next lesson, we're going to start wiring up the job description and the corresponding

160
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,290
bullet points.

161
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,310
So I will see you there.
