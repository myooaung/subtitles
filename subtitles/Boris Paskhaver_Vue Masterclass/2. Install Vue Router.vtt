00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.370
All right.

2
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.630
So in this lesson, we're going to add a new dependency to our project.

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.390
And that, of course, is going to be Vue router.

4
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.140
So Vue router is a totally separate NPM library.

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.860
It is still developed and maintained by the core Vue team.

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.390
So the same group of developers that develops Vue builds Vue router.

7
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.970
So of course the two are very compatible with each other.

8
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.490
However, they are two distinct libraries because you are not obligated to use routing in an app.

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.500
It is an add on, it is an extension pack and as we talked about earlier in the course, the goal in

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.540
view is to give you the core library and allow you to choose which parts of the ecosystem you want to

11
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.400
add when you want to add them.

12
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.950
And that's exactly what we've proven so far in this course.

13
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.990
So far, we only needed Vue to build the view, layer the components, and now we need to add a new

14
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.240
library in order to enable routing.

15
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.960
All right.

16
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.040
So we're going to use the view CLI in order to install this package.

17
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.820
Earlier on in the course, we used the same approach to add tailwind.

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.080
So you may recall the command, it's going to be Vue, which is our CLIA program.

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.520
Then the command is ADD and then the name of the package or dependency.

20
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.780
So in this case, we want to just type in router and it will know that we mean Vue router.

21
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.130
So let's execute that.

22
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.200
It may make an initial request to NPM as it's doing now just to fetch the dependency.

23
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.610
And then it's going to give you a configuration question or two about how you would like to configure

24
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.180
Vue router.

25
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.470
It's going to give you this question.

26
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.120
Use history mode for router.

27
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.460
For this one I want to press and for know this basically deals with how our view app is going to be

28
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.830
served or it's rather a configuration setting that we have to adjust depending on how our view app is

29
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.210
going to be served in production.

30
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.870
We don't really want to worry about this right now and this is the simplest option we can choose that

31
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.030
will allow us to get introduced to the features of router simply for the purposes of learning.

32
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.760
So let's select and for know here press enter and with that it's going to start installing that dependency.

33
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.730
Now keep in mind it's possible that when you install this dependency, your app compilation will break.

34
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.070
What I mean by that is NPM run serve may not work when you try to run it and that is totally fine.

35
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.530
We're going to fix that problem in the upcoming lessons.

36
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.840
For now, what I'd like to do to close this lesson off is to open up the code and I want to head to

37
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.670
a special file in my project.

38
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.670
And that file is our main asphalt.

39
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.410
It's found in the source, main source folder manger asphalt.

40
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.160
And as you may recall, this is the launch point for our project.

41
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.320
This is where everything kicks off in the browser.

42
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.680
You may recall here that we have this create app function.

43
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.340
It starts with a top level view component, which in this case is app.

44
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.810
And then we mount that view app, that view JavaScript object to a div in our HTML with the idea of

45
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.110
app.

46
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.830
So this is the top of the pyramid, this is the top of the hierarchy.

47
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.590
This is where the entire app starts up, right?

48
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.250
And so the only important thing that I'd like you to notice in this file is that view.

49
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.460
Seelye automatically set up some bits of the router for us.

50
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.300
So you can see here on line number eight that we are importing something called router.

51
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.290
And this is actually coming not from a router file but rather from an index JS file in the router folder

52
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.030
which has just been created for us.

53
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.690
So in case you're unfamiliar with how Node and JavaScript work, if we provide a folder to import from

54
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.880
what Node is going to do is look for a file called index JS in that folder.

55
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.210
That's what allows us to specify a folder here, a relative path to the router folder without a specific

56
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.710
index such as file name.

57
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.380
The implicit fallback behavior of node is to look for a file called Index State.

58
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.710
Yes.

59
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.040
So what we're really importing from is this file right here.

60
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.610
All right.

61
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.890
While we're at it here, since all of our other imports here are using this at sign syntax, let's get

62
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.620
rid of this relative syntax from the current directory and let's import from the top of the source directory.

63
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.340
So it's just going to be replacing this dot with that at sign.

64
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.920
And again, this just means source slash router which will look for an index that just file by default.

65
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.310
So whatever this file is exporting is what we're importing in this file.

66
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.380
It will come back to what that is in a later lesson.

67
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.610
The point is we are importing this router from this index just file.

68
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.190
And then in order to actually connect it to our view app, you'll notice here on line 13, we're invoking

69
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.200
a method called use on the View app that they create app function.

70
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.560
It turns back to us and then to that use method we're passing in our new router object.

71
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.240
And that's as simple as it gets.

72
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.880
That is all we need to do in order to configure a view router out with our View project.

73
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.240
Of course, we start to talk a lot about what this router is, which we will do.

74
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.010
But the key takeaways once you create a router, typically in a separate file, you'll simply import

75
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:45.740
it in your startup file like main JS you'll call the use method on the app object and you will provide

76
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.460
the router to it.

77
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.880
All right, so I'm going to save this file and we're going to stop things there.

78
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.630
In the very next lesson, we're going to try to fix our compilation issues, if there are any.

79
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.340
And we're going to take a brief look at how View Router actually helps us in the browser by allowing

80
00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.750
us to navigate from page to page.

81
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.290
And afterwards we're going to dive into this index such as file and see exactly how we construct a router

82
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.920
from scratch.

83
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.780
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

84
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.400
So I will see you in the next one.
