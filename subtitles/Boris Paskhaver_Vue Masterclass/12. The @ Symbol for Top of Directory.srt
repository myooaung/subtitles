1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,500
All right.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,990
So in this lesson, I want to show you a quick shortcut that we're going to be using throughout this

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,500
project.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,990
So you'll notice in our file Explorer, we have this file called JS config dot JSON.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,700
And we don't have to worry too much about this file, but you'll notice there is this section right

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,900
here called Paths and there is this key that has the act symbol in it.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,680
This is the add symbol that you might find typically in an email address.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:25,980
Right.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,390
And you'll notice that it corresponds to an array with the word SIRC in it.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,660
Now, SIRC, as you may notice, is a directory here, right here in our project and it stands for source.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,020
So basically what this means is whenever we want to reference the SIRC directory in our code in for

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,050
example, a JavaScript file, we can use a shortcut of an act, sign this at some right here.

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,940
So if I go back to my main digest file and I'm just going to write a comment here, you don't have to

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,110
follow along if, for example, I wanted to reference this file.

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,130
Hello World Dot View Inside Components Inside SIRC.

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,480
What I can simply write in my import statement is at sign followed by a slash and then components and

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,140
helloworld.

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,860
So basically that outside is simply a shortcut or an alias for source for sase right here.

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,850
Whenever I use this, I simply mean go find the SASE directory.

20
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,880
So that's a little bit of a shortcut to allow us to write less code.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,940
It's configured automatically for us.

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,260
Ingest config by the view Seelye when it created all of these files for us.

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,500
So as a quick example right here on line two and main that yes, you'll notice that we're making a relative

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,620
import of the app component from app dot view.

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,080
That's what this dot forward slash means.

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,430
It means from the current directory.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,400
If instead we wanted to use that syntax, we could import directly from the top of source because that's

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,020
where our apt at view file is.

29
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,570
Notice that it's right here inside the directory.

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,080
So what I can do as an alternative import is right and app sign right here because that means SIRC right

31
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,770
SIRC slash followed by the actual name of the file which is app view.

32
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,810
And what I'm typically going to be doing throughout this project is relying on imports like these absolute

33
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,760
imports, meaning from the top of my codebase rather than relative to the file that I'm in.

34
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,920
I generally prefer this approach because I don't like import imports that look like this, where, you

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,120
know, we're going up to directories, then going up into another directory, etc. I don't like those

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,260
because they tend to confuse me.

37
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,330
I like to think of everything from the top level down.

38
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,240
So we're going to be utilizing this at symbol a lot.

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,880
Again, it simply represents source and from that point you can reference any of the folders or files

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,720
that you have in here.

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,070
And since all of our view components and all of our view code is going to be somewhere in the source

42
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,440
directory that makes it super simple for our project.

43
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,270
So go ahead and update line two.

44
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,750
But that is all there is to cover in this lesson and I will see you in the next one.
