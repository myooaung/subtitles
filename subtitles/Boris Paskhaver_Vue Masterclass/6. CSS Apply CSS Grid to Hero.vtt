00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.190
Okay.

2
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.370
So in this lesson we will build out our grid based layout using CCS grid and that will allow us to have

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.740
the structure we need in order to place all of our subsequent elements like the headline text and later

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.890
on the picture, all within the confines of this grid.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.340
All right.

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.430
So let's begin within our section element.

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.170
I'm going to remove our old text of I can be a hero, baby, and I'll start with a top level div.

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.200
And on this step I'll apply two classes.

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.080
The first one is going to be grid.

10
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.450
Again.

11
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.670
This is a class that is coming from Tailwind.

12
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.810
It's going to apply Display Grid, which is going to allow us to define a grid in the browser.

13
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.380
And then I have to specify how many columns I want the grid to have.

14
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.680
So I'm going to specify grid calls, 12, that is going to create 12 columns within my grid.

15
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.460
Now what I'd like to do is to populate the grid with the corresponding sections of it.

16
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.030
All right.

17
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.620
We're going to see how this works out in just a second.

18
00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.070
And what I'm going to have is a layout where I'm going to have a box representing one column, so one

19
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.700
out of 12, then a box representing five columns.

20
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.320
And that's going to represent our main section where we have, for example, our headline text in our

21
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.740
form.

22
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.400
So one column, five columns, then another five column section of the grid, which is going to be where

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.510
we may place an image later on and then another column at the end.

24
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.100
And that's sort of going to be our padding.

25
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.540
So it's going to be basically one five, five one in terms of the distribution of how much of the grid

26
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.790
are individual elements here I'm going to take up and when we view this in the browser, it should make

27
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.920
more sense because we're going to see how they actually take up their respective space within this 12

28
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.310
column.

29
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.580
Great.

30
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.780
So in here, as I mentioned, since we're going to have these four different widths, I'm going to create

31
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.530
four diffs.

32
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.480
So let me create four gifts to begin with.

33
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.660
I'm just going to copy and paste right here, right here and right here.

34
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.380
All right.

35
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.810
And here I'm going to apply some tailwind classes.

36
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.170
So Div class, I'm going to do call start one.

37
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.510
This is just going to say start at column one.

38
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.690
So the very first column of 12 within my sixth grade.

39
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.990
And then I want this thing to span exactly one column.

40
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.060
So I'm going to say col span one that is the tail one class to say I want this to span the equivalent

41
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.340
of one column, start at the leftmost column, column one and make it span just one column out of 12.

42
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.600
In order to make this a little bit more obvious, I'm going to add some tailwind classes that we may

43
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.630
later remove that will add a border so we can see where each of these separate columns begins and ends.

44
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.270
So I'm just going to add a border class which will add a border and then I'll make it border blue 700,

45
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.680
just an arbitrary blue border.

46
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.140
So we see where this thing begins and ends.

47
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.130
And what I'm also going to do here is write some text in here so we can see it on the page.

48
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.090
And the text I'm going to write is going to reflect how many columns this thing takes up.

49
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.520
So I'll say that this will take up one column.

50
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.270
All right.

51
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.610
I'm going to do a very similar thing for our dev below.

52
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.600
I'm going to do class.

53
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.120
This one, I want to start at column two.

54
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.680
So I'm going to say call start two.

55
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.730
And this one, as I mentioned, I want to take up five columns within our 12.

56
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.770
So called span five will take a span or a distance of five columns.

57
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.710
And similarly, I'll add a border that's going to be blue.

58
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.730
So if you're keeping track right now, we have a 12 column table or a 12 column grid, rather, and

59
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.350
we've taken up six of its columns.

60
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.790
So right here, I'm going to add that this is taking up the equivalent of five columns within our 12.

61
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.270
All right.

62
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.370
Our next one is going to be very similar.

63
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.830
So I'm actually just going to copy this and place to right here.

64
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.710
The only difference here is we're not going to start a column two.

65
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.720
Obviously, we're now going to start at column seven.

66
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.920
So there we go.

67
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.180
That's going to spend five columns.

68
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.350
And the very last one is going to be very similar to our first one.

69
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.150
So I'm going to copy this first development, replace this.

70
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.340
And of course, instead of starting a call, start one, we're going to start at column number 12 and

71
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.780
span one column.

72
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.380
All right.

73
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.100
So just to reiterate, because I kind of rushed over here, we're starting at number seven.

74
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.860
So we're going to go seven, eight, nine, ten, 11.

75
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.050
So those are going to be the columns here.

76
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.350
Column seven through 11 is going to be one box within the browser.

77
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.890
And then the final 12 column is going to be its own little chunk.

78
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.180
And again, I've applied these classes so we can see how this plays out as well as the text.

79
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.280
So let's go see what this looks like in the browser.

80
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.670
And there we have our grid layout and that's exactly how grid works.

81
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.440
We basically said make a deal that's going to span the whole page, break it up into the equivalent

82
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.110
of 12 columns, and then distribute four boxes that are going to be respectively one column in width,

83
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.150
five columns, five columns in one column.

84
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.590
In fact, I believe if I bring up my elements, Inspector, I can even show you the grid and how it

85
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.700
looks right here in the browser.

86
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.870
We can see here that if I click on this grid, we can see those 12 columns arranged horizontally across

87
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.540
the web page, and you can see how I've arranged my columns to take up one, five, five and one respectively.

88
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.950
So this was my first time playing around with Access Grid, but this is basically how it works and it

89
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.140
also works the same way downwards if you want to do that.

90
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.970
But that's how you build out a grid based layout.

91
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.920
And so this one column at the very beginning and this one column at the end is sort of going to be the

92
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.030
equivalent of our padding.

93
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.400
It's just going to push the inner content in.

94
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.610
And here in these in these five columns is where we're going to play or render our headline or search

95
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.840
form or text, etc..

96
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.150
And here is where we're going to render our image, just like the official Google Careers website has.

97
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.390
All right.

98
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.480
So this is just building out the infrastructure to enable all of that later.

99
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.080
All right.

100
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.490
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

101
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.990
So I will see you in the next one.
