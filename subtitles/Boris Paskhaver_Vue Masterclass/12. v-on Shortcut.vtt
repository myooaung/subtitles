00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.990
All right.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.540
So at the end of the previous lesson, we saw this s lint warning interaction button component.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.600
And if I hover my mouse over, it will see the issue here.

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.750
Expected the act sign instead of the icon.

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.270
So again, this is an optimization.

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.340
It is related to style and aesthetics.

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.060
The code that we have on screen here is totally valid.

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.610
Technically, however, view prefers, or at least the View Style Guide, which is connected with s

9
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.560
lint, prefers a simpler approach that requires us to write a little bit less characters.

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.730
It's a shortcut, right?

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.280
We saw earlier another example of a shortcut.

12
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.280
For example, instead of writing V bind, right?

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.350
Instead of writing something like this V bind colon ref, we can just write colon.

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.390
It's the same idea here.

15
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.750
There's a shortcut available for a V on directive.

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.280
So instead of writing a V on colon click we can replace the van and the colon with an act sign.

17
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.610
So the sign, just like we see in an email address right here at click, the two options that we see,

18
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.420
let me in fact write them on, read them out side by side so you can compare them.

19
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.250
These two are technically identical.

20
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.160
There is no technical difference between them.

21
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.740
This at click is a shortcut or a a simpler way to write what is on line 13.

22
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.020
It does the exact same thing.

23
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.140
It says to register a method to execute whenever something happens, which in this case is a click.

24
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.300
So at click instead of V on colon that an equal sign followed by the name of the method that you want

25
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.920
a view to run.

26
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.560
Once again, do not invoke the method in here.

27
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.910
Just write the method name.

28
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.710
I'm going to save this and I'm going to head back to my browser so we can confirm everything is working.

29
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.910
I'm, in fact, going to refresh the page to make sure we have the latest changes and to clear the output.

30
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.190
And I'm just going to press sign in again and you can see I've been clicked is being console.log every

31
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.120
time we click the button.

32
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.000
So our new shortcut is indeed working.

33
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.630
All right.

34
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.250
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

35
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.720
So I will see you in the next one.
