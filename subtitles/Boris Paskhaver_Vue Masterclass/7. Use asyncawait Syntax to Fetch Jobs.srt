1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,930
All right, so let's replace our traditional promise syntax in the job listings component with the new

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,550
async await syntax.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,060
So the first thing we need to do is declare the mounted method or the mounted lifecycle hook as an async

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:15,540
function.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,910
So I'm going to add the async keyword immediately before the name of the method which is mounted.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,860
And of course, the reason we need to market as asynchronous is because there's going to be something

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,180
in the body of this method that's going to be asynchronous, that's going to take some amount of time

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,750
to complete.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,420
And that, of course, is going to be our Axios request.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:41,280
So right here, instead of this syntax, we can say is const response, and we're going to await until

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,190
Axios can get our data.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,030
So await Axios dot get and we're going to provide the exact same URL as we have here.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,420
And under the hood, these two lines are basically identical.

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,890
We're going to wait until Axios completes that request and gives us back the response object.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,100
And on that response object, we're going to have a data property.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,510
And that data property is what we want to write to our jobs data property.

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,080
So once we have these two lines, we can remove the former implementation.

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,220
And I think that makes our code a little bit cleaner and easier to understand.

19
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:11,670
All right.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,540
So let's save that.

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,250
Let's head back to our browser.

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,860
Let's refresh the page just to check.

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,320
Give it a second to make the request.

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,960
And then if I go into my job results view and my job listings, there is our jobs array with the 100

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,860
objects that we received from our jobs and.

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,810
Perfect.

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,640
So I will see you in the next lesson.
