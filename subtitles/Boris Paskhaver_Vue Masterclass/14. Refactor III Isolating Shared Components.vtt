00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.950
Okay.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.010
So we have one more component within our top level components folder.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.920
And what I'd like to do is to move it into a folder of its own.

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.370
And I propose that we create a folder called Shared.

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.800
And the whole point of this shared folder will be to store components that I can see myself using in

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.950
multiple locations or multiple features around the site.

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.670
And a button is a perfect example of one of those shared components.

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.160
We're already using it within our navigation.

9
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.410
We're already using it within our job search form.

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.940
So it has proven itself as a component that doesn't exclusively belong to one feature.

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.390
It's a shared component that's really meant to be used in many places.

12
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.880
So I think a shared folder is a good place to put it.

13
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.920
Other people like to name the folder common.

14
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.540
It really is up to you and your team.

15
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.450
But here in Components, I'm going to create another directory.

16
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.590
I'm going to call it shared.

17
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.640
And in there let's drag our action button that view component.

18
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.290
Let's tell a visitor, okay, to update, but I'm still going to go manually through a couple files

19
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.890
that I know.

20
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.090
Use my action button so I know I use it in my job search form component.

21
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.820
And if I scroll down here, here we are, we are importing action button from the top level components

22
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.770
directory that is no longer accurate.

23
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.720
We want to import it from component slash shared slash action button.

24
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.710
That's good.

25
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.250
And the other place where we have it is in our main NAV component and we are of course rendering that

26
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.050
action button to log the user in.

27
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.310
It's right here.

28
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.870
Action button from components will similarly add the shared directory right here, make that change

29
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.590
and that is good.

30
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.500
And then of course as always, let's update tests folder.

31
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.570
So in tests component components, I will create a new shared directory and I'm going to drag my action

32
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.990
button that test that you guys file into shared calling into here.

33
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.340
Once again, let's change this.

34
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.900
Import two components slash shared slash action button.

35
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.930
And with that, let's rerun our test suite.

36
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.590
And see where we are.

37
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.840
NPM Run Test colon unit.

38
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.950
Let's see.

39
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.330
Wait a little bit and.

40
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.070
Okay, looking good.

41
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.970
No errors or nothing glaring to you.

42
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.660
Look at right now.

43
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.760
And with that, we can tie this section up and review everything we learned in the next lesson.
