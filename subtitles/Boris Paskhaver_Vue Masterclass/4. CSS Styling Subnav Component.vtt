00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.650
In this lesson, we'll add some starter styles to our sub nav component.

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.420
So let's get to it here.

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.330
In Sub Navigate view, in my top level div, I'm going to add some CSS classes, so I'll add class here

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.490
and then we're going to add a whole bunch here.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.040
Let's begin with W dash full.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.880
And as a reminder, these are all tailwind classes that are provided to us.

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.570
This class will provide 100% of the parent with.

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.030
The next thing I want to focus on is the height.

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.480
I'm going to provide a class called H 16 and that is going to set a fixed height of 64 pixels.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.390
The next thing I want to focus on is the background.

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.300
I'm going to ensure that we have a white background.

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.580
I believe this is standard in CC, but we're going to be more explicit with it here and we can do that

13
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.950
with the BG Dash White class that is going to set a white background for this div.

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.550
The next thing I want to focus on is the border and when it comes to our sub nav, I actually only want

15
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.960
a bottom border.

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.290
This is going to be a grey border that separates the end of the sub nav and the primary content of the

17
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.700
page that we are on.

18
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.750
Okay, so to create just a bottom border, I can use a special class called Border Dash B, you can

19
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.130
see there it's going to add the border bottom width of one pixel only on the bottom.

20
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.570
So the remainder of the box, the left, the right in the top will not have a border.

21
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.530
I also want to specify that I want to have a solid border.

22
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.640
I can do that with border dash solid in comparison to something like a dashed border.

23
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.210
And then finally, I want to specify the color of the border.

24
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.020
And for that I'm going to use border dash brand gray one as a reminder, brand gray one is a custom

25
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.990
color that we configured in tailwind dot config.

26
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.320
Okay.

27
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.590
Yes.

28
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.950
And so tailwind automatically generated this.

29
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.430
Yes.

30
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.120
Classic for us as well as some other CSA classes that specifically deal with this color of brand gray

31
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.480
one.

32
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.110
Okay.

33
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.120
So that takes care of my outer div.

34
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.070
And I also want to add an inner div.

35
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.980
So right here I'm going to add a dear right here around.

36
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.850
This is a sub nav.

37
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.340
I'm going to drag this closing tag to the end right here and let's add a few more classes here.

38
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.950
I'm going to make this a Flexbox with Flex.

39
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.960
This is what I'm going to use to vertically center the contents of this sub nav, which is going to

40
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.530
be the things like the magnifying glass and the content that says the number of jobs that have matched,

41
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.980
etc..

42
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.170
So I'm going to start by making this a flexbox.

43
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.790
I'm going to vertically center the contents of the Flexbox using items center.

44
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.470
That's another tailwind success class.

45
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.420
Then I'm going to make sure that this has a 100% height, which is going to inherit the height of the

46
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.010
parent, which is 64 pixels.

47
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.960
And then I want to apply a little bit of padding, but only on the left and right side.

48
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.240
So the x axis and I can do that with the p x classes from Tailwind.

49
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.240
You can see here it's going to apply only padding on the left and right.

50
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.000
And I think eight is a good option here.

51
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.430
You can see here from my IntelliSense or my helper features, that's going to be 32 pixels of padding

52
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.630
on the left and right side.

53
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.980
That's just going to ensure that our content is pushed in a little bit from the edges of this diff.

54
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.640
All right.

55
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.110
And I'm going to keep my original text of this is a sub nav and this should be a good place to start.

56
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.630
So if I navigate back to my browser, we now have our subnet and it's looking pretty good.

57
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.810
We have our padding right here before the text.

58
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.010
We have our bottom gray border, that's our own custom brand color.

59
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.640
And it's going to separate this content from the rest of the page.

60
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.640
And this, of course, is also getting that height of 64 pixels.

61
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.320
So this is a good place to start.

62
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.020
And where we're going to proceed from here, of course, is adding the icon that we need and then follow

63
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.920
it by the text that says the number of jobs that the user has match.

64
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.980
So making good progress here and I will see you in the next lesson.
