00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.290
All right.

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.920
So in this lesson, we will continue styling our headline component.

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.640
And I'd like to start with our H1 tag right here on line three.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.060
As always, we're going to add a bunch of Tailwind CSR classes.

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.470
So let's add the classes right here and we'll begin with a bold font which we can do with Font Dashboard.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.710
As you can see, that makes the font weight 700 and earlier in the class, when we pulled in our fonts

7
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.920
from Google Fonts, we actually selected the bold options.

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.060
So we have this available.

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.890
The next thing I want to do is apply a special class called Tracking Dash TITRE.

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.110
What that actually does is it reduces the letter spacing, which is the distance between the letters

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.460
whenever we write our text.

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.620
This is again just to make it look very similar to the official website, but it's purely aesthetic.

13
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.920
The next thing I want to do, of course, is increase the font size.

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.600
We saw how small our text was in the previous lesson, so let's give this a really large font size.

15
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.730
And so we have text dash x eight Excel, which as you can see is six REM or equivalently 96 pixels,

16
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.940
so really large and prominent as the header should be.

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.030
And finally, what I'd like to do is to create a little bit of margin between this H1 and the H2 below

18
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.430
where we say find your next job at Bubba Corp.

19
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.080
That creates just some separation between the two, especially given our very large font.

20
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.750
So there is a class called MVP 14.

21
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.060
As a reminder, the M classes deal with margin and be in tailwind term stands for bottom.

22
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.560
So this is margin bottom.

23
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.950
So it's applying margin only to the bottom of this H1 element.

24
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.170
As and as you can see, margin bottom 14 is equivalent to about 56 pixels.

25
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.110
And when I say about I mean literally 56 pixels.

26
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.390
So that's a good place to leave off.

27
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.570
So let's go ahead and save this and take a look at how this looks in the browser.

28
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.040
All right.

29
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.410
There we go, starting to get there.

30
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.910
This is looking very, very familiar and very good and comparable to the Google site.

31
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.780
Of course, we still have to deal with this text right here, which we'll worry about in the next lesson.

32
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.400
But this is a good place to start.

33
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.380
And as always, let's just check in on our sign in button as well, just to make sure that everything

34
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.100
is looking fine when we log in and get our sub nav.

35
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.160
And indeed the page is looking exactly as we expect.

36
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.820
Perfect.

37
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.680
So the word is changing.

38
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.690
The font is nice and prominent and we're getting that cool effect of a different font color every 3

39
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.950
seconds.

40
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.560
We will continue styling in the very next lesson.
