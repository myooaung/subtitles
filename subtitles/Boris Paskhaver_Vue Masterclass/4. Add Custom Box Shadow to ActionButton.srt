1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,440
All right, there's one more CCS tweak that I would like to add to our button, and that is to have

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,300
it display a box shadow, but only when I hover my mouse over the button.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,770
Usually that's a good indicator to a user that a button is clickable.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,850
It kind of invites them to participate by changing the style of the button.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,560
When you hover your mouse over it right now, you'll notice we are getting a pointer, but there's no

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,140
other kind of call to action to click the button and a little bit of box shadow goes a long way to help

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,350
here.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:31,740
All right.

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:37,020
So in order to make that happen, we're going to first need to head to our tailwind config file.

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,510
So right here, tailwind dot config that.

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:40,980
Yes.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,560
So we need to provide some additional configuration settings for tailwind so that it knows the kind

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,120
of color that we would like to apply to our box shadow when we render it.

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,120
So right here in this theme object, under this extend object where we have a whole bunch of additional

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,780
settings that we've provided for the font family and the additional colors.

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,530
We want some additional settings for box shadow.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:05,920
All right.

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,210
So I'm going to make this an object.

19
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:15,070
And similar to how it worked for our colors up above, our key here is going to be the name of the seasons

20
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,570
class that we would like to have.

21
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,240
And what Telmont is going to do is generate some CSS classes based on what we provide here.

22
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,290
It may also prefix those classes with some of its terms.

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:33,160
For example, we saw in the previous lesson that it created a big brand blue one class, so it prefixed

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:40,210
our name with BG, but still the values that we provide here, it will serve as the names or partial

25
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,330
names of the seasons classes that tailwind generates.

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,310
All right, so I'm going to create a class called Blue because it's going to be a slightly blue block

27
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,570
box shadow.

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,530
And for my value here, I'm going to provide the actual styling syntax for providing box shadow.

29
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,560
Now, to be honest with you, I'm not particularly great with CC, so I don't know all of the settings

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,700
that we are configuring here.

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,920
But again, I simply opened up my element inspector in Chrome and looked at the real world button and

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,120
basically just copied it.

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,040
Styles So that's what you can do here.

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,630
You can copy along with me and then just trust that it's going to look as it does on the real site.

35
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,870
So right here we're going to write zero zero, then three pixels, three pixels.

36
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,270
I imagine this has something to do with the level of box shadow or the direction of the box set or something

37
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,720
like that.

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:36,670
And then afterwards I want to provide the color which is going to be this color hashtag 4285 F4.

39
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,030
All right.

40
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,180
It's this kind of darker blue color for our box shadow.

41
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:40,510
All right.

42
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,670
So save this file, as always.

43
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,900
If your app does not properly run afterwards or if you don't see these changes later, restart your

44
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,990
review server by canceling it and then running NPM run.

45
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,700
And that should reincorporate the changes from your tailwind file.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,360
All right.

47
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,420
So let's head back to action button dot view and we're going to add the style as our last class to our

48
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,810
button.

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,500
All right.

50
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:10,630
So by default, because we named our class or our provided a name of blue tailwind is going to generate

51
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,370
a class for us called Shadow Dash, whatever was the name that we provided.

52
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,550
So here we're going to have a class called Shadow Blue.

53
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,830
Now, if I save this file and I take a look in the browser, we'll see that we're not going to get quite

54
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,490
what we want.

55
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,800
We do correctly have our box shadow.

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,590
We can see it right here, but obviously it is present when the button loads on screen and we do not

57
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,160
want that.

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,310
We wanted to only appear on mouse hover.

59
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,200
Well typically in case you would start applying all of those additional, I forget what they're called,

60
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,350
but the additional syntax to indicate that you'd only like to apply styles on hover right or on click

61
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,990
or on mouse over things like that.

62
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,960
Luckily with Tailwind, the process for adding a class but only on hover is very, very simple.

63
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:03,190
Before the Tailwind class, all you do is prefix it with the word hover followed by a colon.

64
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,200
So right here I'm going to do hover.

65
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,870
Colon.

66
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:13,810
So what this means is only apply the shadow blue style, which we just saw in the browser when the user

67
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,290
hovers.

68
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,060
All right.

69
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,540
And it's that simple, and it will work the same way for any other tail in class.

70
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:26,260
For example, if I change the line above to hover colon big brand blue one, what that would mean is

71
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,810
only on user hover apply the background of of the blue brand color that we specified.

72
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,210
So that's what makes Tailwind so elegant is we don't have to remember all that CSS syntax or name all

73
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,940
of these classes or nets them or deal with that complexity.

74
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,950
Whatever style we want to apply on hover, we just prefix that class with the hover keyword.

75
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:51,220
In fact, I think under the hood what this is is its own separate CSS class that tail and makes available

76
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,640
for us.

77
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,770
Again, it ships with these hundreds, maybe thousands of available classes, and we can just use whichever

78
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,670
ones we'd like.

79
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,060
All right.

80
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,410
So I'm going to save this.

81
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,310
And now when I go back to my browser, we should get what we want.

82
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,140
We have our regular button when the page loads and then as I hover my mouse over it.

83
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,160
Perfect.

84
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,770
We have that nice little box shadow appear around the button to indicate that the button is clickable.

85
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,150
Pretty cool.

86
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,930
Looks good to me.

87
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,950
So in the very next lesson, we can go ahead and start creating our profile image.
