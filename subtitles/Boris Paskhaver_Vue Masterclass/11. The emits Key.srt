1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,320
Okay.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,140
So in this lesson, I finally want to come back to this s lint violation right here that we've had ever

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,680
since we used the omit method in our text input component.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,100
And if I hover my mouse over, it will see the update model value event has been triggered but not declared

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,570
on emits option.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,330
So what Vue is asking us to do is to do a validation similar to what we do with our props.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,980
View wants to know the possible emission events that we can produce from the text input component,

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,890
and it's going to validate that anything we emit falls within the constraints of what we promised would

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,250
be an eligible event for that component to emit.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,660
It's going to be super simple.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,750
So what I need to do here on my configuration object for text input is to create a new property and

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,710
I'll add it above methods and it's called emits and emits.

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:59,430
I will set to an array and in that array I'm going to provide strings representing the available events

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,230
that this component can emit.

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,010
Because remember, a component can emit as many different events as it wants.

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,140
If we want it to emit a different event, we would still call the Emit method on the this keyword and

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,700
then provide a different name here so our component could react to different things a user input, a

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,950
user click, etc. Whenever we need to relay any message to our parent, we simply call the Emit method,

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,160
but we can emit as many different messages to our parents as we want.

20
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,320
So for right now we only have one possible event name and it's this one right here.

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,230
So I'm going to provide a string with that exact name.

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,110
So update colon model value.

23
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,030
And as soon as I do, that view says, okay.

24
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,910
This is the array of permissible events.

25
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,430
You are using that exact event right here.

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,920
So if I go into my browser right now, you're going to notice in my console when I refresh we previously

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,370
had.

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,050
Some errors and when I refresh, they should go away.

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,840
You can see there's nothing here and view is not complaining.

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,390
Now notice if instead.

31
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,980
I go here and I change this to a different non permitted events such as nonsense.

32
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,890
You're going to notice first up in my in my text editor that is we're going to notice that view says

33
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,920
the nonsense event has been triggered but not declared on minutes.

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,010
So it's saying, I'm not finding this anywhere in this array.

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,470
So that's not a valid event for you to omit.

36
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,500
Please add this to the array before you use it.

37
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,710
And furthermore, if I go into my browsers and I refresh.

38
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,600
Let's say I try to omit by typing something like this, you'll notice the typing triggers the emotion

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,240
of that event and it's saying component emitted an event called nonsense, but it is neither declared

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,880
in the emits option nor as an on nonsense prop.

41
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,480
So the key focus here is it is not declared in the emits option.

42
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,550
So as we're playing around with this component in our browser, the view warning will tell us the same

43
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:47,820
thing.

44
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,530
You are emitting some kind of message for the parent, but you have not told me to expect that message.

45
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,580
And the reason that is beneficial is it can watch out for something like typos, right?

46
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
If we accidentally mistype, if we type something like.

47
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,930
Updates, you know, model value, but maybe we do it all lowercase.

48
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,070
Well, we're going to get the exact same warning and we can say, okay, this is our ultimate source

49
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,550
of truth.

50
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,350
This is the only thing I'm allowed to omit.

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,980
And so I'm going to change this back to a passing value, and that is fine.

52
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,230
And thus, if we have multiple events that we can omit, you know, event A, event B, it's going to

53
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,660
double check similarly that whatever we omit, wherever we omit, it has to be one of these three values

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,100
in order for everything to pass.

55
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:27,730
All right.

56
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,290
So to close this lesson off, I'm going to remove these two arbitrary values.

57
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,110
We're going to keep the omits property with that array of strings.

58
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,460
And that is the validation we need to add to make that s lint warning go away.

59
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,850
And that is all there is to cover in this lesson.

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,390
So I will see in the next one.
