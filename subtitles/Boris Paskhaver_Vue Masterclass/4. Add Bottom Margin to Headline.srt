1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,020
All right.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,600
So super quick lesson here.

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:09,090
The first stylistic change that I'd like to do is to add some spacing or margin between these two elements,

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,900
this introductory text and my job search form component.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,050
And where I'm actually going to do that is in my headline component.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,420
So if I go back to my editor and I open up my headline view file.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,840
This, of course, is where we have our action verb.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,230
And then here's the prompt to find your next job at Bubba Corp.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,500
And right here on this section, tag on line number two is where I'm going to add a new Tailwind class,

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,170
and that class will be maybe 16.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,400
As a reminder, the M classes are a margin and the B is short for bottom.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,110
So this will only apply margin on the bottom in this specific scenario.

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,740
And B 16 is equal to four REM, as we can see on the right, which is equivalent to 64 pixels.

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,440
So 64 pixels of space between the headline and our job search form, which we are of course rendering

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,710
in our hero right below the headline component.

16
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:02,460
All right.

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,300
So if we go back to our browser, that is a better starting point.

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,510
And this is where we're going to start building out the excess for our form.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,130
Perfect.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,060
So we'll continue with this in the very next lesson.
