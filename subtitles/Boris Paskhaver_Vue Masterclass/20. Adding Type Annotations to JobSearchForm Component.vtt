00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.230
Okay.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.830
So here is a really cool piece of news you can see here that I have expanded my entire directory structure

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.950
in my tests unit components folder and we can see that just about all of our tests are in TypeScript,

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.260
which also means that we have converted the corresponding components to TypeScript as well.

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.450
So we have obviously made a lot of progress in moving our entire codebase over to TypeScript.

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.000
So just to be a perfect completionist, let's target this final test file right here, job search form

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.620
that test that.

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.990
Yes.

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.100
And of course, in order to do that, we're going to need to adjust the component as well.

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.100
Let's open up job search form, view and right here we'll repeat our usual steps.

11
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.100
So right here I'm going to do lang equals S.

12
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:52.310
And right here I will import to find component and right here I will invoke defined component passing

13
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.520
in my object, closing it off right here.

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.860
And as I just hover my mouse over some of these constants that we're making available as properties

15
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.960
in the returned object, they look correct to me.

16
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.240
This is a graph or in other words, a view.

17
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.040
Reactive object wrapping a string.

18
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.180
Same thing with that.

19
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.690
Search for jobs is a function that returns void, which is correct.

20
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.080
Our router reference right here from use router is indeed returning a router object or a router interface,

21
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.300
which means that the push method is being validated.

22
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.010
So everything is looking good right here.

23
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.800
And with that we can of course move on to job search, form that, test that yes, drag it over here

24
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.360
to the right and rename this file to have a TSA extension.

25
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.130
There we go.

26
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.470
And we can see we're going to have a couple of issues here.

27
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.370
First, a, let's make this view to make sure it understands that we're importing.

28
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.340
We can see our usual mock return value problems, too, right here.

29
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.940
I'm going to say const user out or mark is going to be use router as just mock type.

30
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.730
And I'm going to make sure to update this to be use root or mock scrolling down, everything looks correct

31
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.890
and there's only one test in this file.

32
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.820
So with that we can run NPM run test.

33
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.130
In fact, let's run the entire test week because why not?

34
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.390
It's been a while since we did that.

35
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.610
Then it's going to run Test Colon Unit to run everything in our code base, which is going to include

36
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.610
a bunch of test files all written in TypeScript.

37
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.350
We can actually see them all appear right here and it gives me a really good feeling to see all of those

38
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.910
test extensions at the end.

39
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.340
Of course, my is deciding that right now is the absolute best time to be as slow as possible running

40
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.910
these tests.

41
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.240
But you can see they are now finally progressing.

42
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.330
And there we go, 24 passing test suites with 73 total passing tests and things are looking pretty good.

43
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.020
All right.

44
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.580
So I will see you in the next lesson.
