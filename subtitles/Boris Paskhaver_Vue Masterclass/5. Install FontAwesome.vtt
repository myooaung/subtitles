00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.080
Okay.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.360
So the next thing that we're going to be adding to our sub now is going to be this icon right here,

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.300
this search icon, this magnifying glass.

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.420
And we're not going to design this icon from scratch.

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.970
Rather, we're going to incorporate a library into our project that's going to give us access to a bunch

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.220
of icons just like this one.

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.230
And that library is called the font.

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.710
Awesome.

9
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.990
So let me take you to the second tab right here.

10
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.030
And it is the official font awesome website which you can access by going to the font awesome icon.

11
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.150
And the first thing to know here is that font awesome is a general collection of icons, thousands of

12
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.990
icons in fact.

13
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.670
And it's not just limited to view, you can use it in any frontend project with any framework or library.

14
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.400
You can use it in a plain HTML project, you can use it with React, with Angular, with view, etc..

15
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.170
So what we're going to be installing in just a moment in our terminal is going to be both the core font

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.270
awesome library as well as the view implementation of it, which is basically going to allow us to render

17
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.820
these icons as plain view components.

18
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.800
So this is going to be our first experience with using other people's components within our project,

19
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.220
right?

20
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.040
Let me just show you some of the icons that are available here.

21
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.880
So if I go to this site and I click on icons, it's going to bring us to the search page.

22
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.660
And as you can see, there are almost 15,000 icons in font.

23
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.990
Awesome.

24
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.340
So I can search for something simple like food and you can see there's going to be a whole bunch of

25
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.070
icons here.

26
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.490
Let me search again because it looks like my turn went away.

27
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.330
Here's food.

28
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.050
You can see there's all kinds of funny icons for avocado and bacon and burger.

29
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.190
Here's another example.

30
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.170
If I search for something like computer, you can see that font also has a bunch of other icons for

31
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.780
a basic computer, a mouse, a speaker, etc..

32
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.250
So there's a lot of these helpful small SVG icons that we can add to our project.

33
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.680
And similarly and finally, if I search for search, you're going to see the exact thing we need right

34
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.050
here, a magnifying glass, which is the kind of icon that we want to add in our stuff now.

35
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.380
All right.

36
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.040
All right.

37
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.170
So with that said, let's go ahead and open up our terminal and we're going to install the requisite

38
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.090
dependencies in our project.

39
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.130
So I'm going to open up my terminal and make sure you navigate to your job search project and that you

40
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.470
shut down the actual view application.

41
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.100
And this is going to be a plane NPM install command because this is not yet integrated into view SQLite.

42
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.750
So we're going to say NPM install and we're going to add the save flag right here to make sure we add

43
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.810
it to our project's dependencies as going to be three packages.

44
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.790
All three packages are going to be under the same organization and that organization is going to be

45
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.980
at Fort Awesome.

46
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.830
I just want to reiterate here, this is not font awesome.

47
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.200
The name of the organization is Fort Awesome.

48
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.470
LRT Fort like a castle for our and again, that symbol simply means that that is the name of the organization

49
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.720
under which the project is hosted.

50
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.410
So the first library we want is going to be font awesome.

51
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.460
Dash.

52
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.630
SVG.

53
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.740
Dash core.

54
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.580
All right.

55
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.450
And that is one library.

56
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.020
All right.

57
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.490
Moving on.

58
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.750
The second library is also going to be under the four awesome organizations right here for Awesome.

59
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.480
Then Slash and this library is called free dash.

60
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.080
Solid dash SVG dash icons.

61
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.540
And finally, the third library is also under the Fort Awesome organization.

62
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.260
So at four awesome.

63
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.390
Then view dash font.

64
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.650
Awesome one word.

65
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.940
And then we need to get a specific version to make sure these dependencies all work together.

66
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.770
So in order to do that, you need to add an app sign right here and we want the pre-release version.

67
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.420
So we're just going to write at pre-release and that is a tagged version of this view font awesome library

68
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.550
that specifically works with Vue three, which is the library version of view that we have in our project.

69
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.400
So once you have those three libraries, go ahead and press enter.

70
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.890
That might take a second to install all of them.

71
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.050
And of course, when all that is done, you can feel free to restart your server with NPM, run, serve

72
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.400
and then we'll pick right back up in our current editor in the very next lesson and I'll show you how

73
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.260
to integrate this into our project.

74
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.830
All right.

75
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.490
So I'll see you there.
