00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.350
All right.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.960
So as I mentioned in the previous lesson, it's possible that your View app will no longer be compiling

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.570
after adding the View router dependency.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.670
So just to show you what it looks like on my end, I'm going to run, NPM, run, serve and things are

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.460
going to appear to look to work just fine.

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.490
But as it reaches the end of its build process, it's going to give us a couple of warnings on our terminal.

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.130
And if you go to your browser, it's going to tell you it failed to compile.

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.740
So you're going to see these warnings are coming from a new set of files within the views directory

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.990
which previously did not exist.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.790
So let's head to our editor and talk about what this directory represents and why we're having failures

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.300
right here.

12
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.100
So you'll notice again, we have a brand new views directory.

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.470
Previously we only had a component's directory.

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.590
So in views you'll notice two new view component files and they're each going to have this view name

15
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.540
or suffix in their name.

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.730
And these are regular view components.

17
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.280
But the key difference is what a view is supposed to represent is a page, right?

18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.530
Like a specific page at a given root.

19
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.310
So for example, in our app, you might consider a view to be the job results view, right?

20
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.360
It's like the big page.

21
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.910
You can almost think of it like the top of the hierarchy.

22
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.610
It's the very first component that we want view to render when we reach a certain route.

23
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.860
And then that top level view is going to render all of the resulting child components that that page

24
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.340
needs.

25
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.240
And on a different page, as our home page, we're going to have a different view component.

26
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.070
So at any given root, we're going to specify a view that we want to render.

27
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.680
And that view is just the top level view component that in turn renders a whole bunch of other child

28
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.520
components within it.

29
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.800
Previously we only had one kind of top level component in our app and that was app.

30
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.810
But now we no longer have the idea of just one component technically because we have different pages,

31
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.990
and in the context of page to page, one page may have one top level view component and another page

32
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.510
may have a totally different view component and they're totally different visual uses within the app.

33
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.960
Right.

34
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.880
So just to show you how this works, what I'm going to do is I'm going to open up the home view component.

35
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.190
You can almost think of this like a page in our app.

36
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.240
And the reason why we're actually getting a compilation issue is The View.

37
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.430
Seelye tries to add this Hello world component here on line number four, and I also import it here

38
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.300
in line number ten.

39
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.000
This was a component that was available to us when we first created our View app and we then deleted

40
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.150
it.

41
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.520
So it's trying to import a component that no longer exists in the components directory so we can go

42
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.520
ahead and clean this up and remove it and we should be able to compile.

43
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.740
So right here, I'm just going to remove this reference to the import of hello world we no longer need

44
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.800
to instantiated online, for we also don't need this image tag right here because we do not have the

45
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.020
logo PNG file that it is referencing.

46
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.480
And in fact to keep this super simple, let's remove the div here as well and just put an H1.

47
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.580
I'm going to give it a couple sample tailwind classes just so it's prominent and easy to see on the

48
00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.940
screen.

49
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.580
I'm going to make the text pretty big with the Text six Excel class and I'm going to make the font bold

50
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.870
with the font bold class.

51
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.520
And I'm just going to put the name here.

52
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.320
I'm going to say home view.

53
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.280
All right.

54
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.110
And then right here as well, we are referencing the former Helloworld component, which no longer exists.

55
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.570
So we can just remove this and notice, as always, that we have our home view component right here,

56
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.290
the name that is, which is the exact same as the component file name.

57
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.510
And again, just notice that this view, as we call it, is a plain regular component, right?

58
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.150
There's no actual technical difference.

59
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.280
The reason we simply call it a view and the reason we put it in a separate view's directory is because

60
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.430
it's supposed to represent the beginning of a page, the top level pyramid component, the top of the

61
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.530
hierarchy of components at a given root.

62
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.630
That's going to begin that cascading effect of rendering all of the children and grandchildren and so

63
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.260
below it.

64
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.190
So if I go to my about view, we have a very similar set up here.

65
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.690
This is just another top level page.

66
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.320
And we're going to see later how view and the class set this up for us.

67
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.480
But in here we can do something very similar.

68
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.190
We can just get place in each H1 here, add a couple classes, let's do the same one.

69
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.580
So text six Excel and Font Bold and I'm just going to put about view right here.

70
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.740
And so that's best practice.

71
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.260
Let's also add our script tag and let's export default a JavaScript object and we'll put a name here

72
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.330
and we'll of course call it about view.

73
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.090
Okay.

74
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.860
So at this point, if I go back to my terminal, we should see that it is successfully compiling so

75
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.090
it's able to find all imports.

76
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.710
And if I had to my browser.

77
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.880
We're going to see this.

78
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.690
Now, don't worry about everything that we've built so far.

79
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.680
It's not lost.

80
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.150
We're simply not rendering it on any of our views.

81
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.990
And that's why we don't see everything we built.

82
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.430
We're going to bring it back into the app and just a lesson or two.

83
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.350
But the good news about not seeing all of our previous work is we get a much cleaner example of how

84
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.370
view router works.

85
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.640
So as I mentioned, we have two views in our app.

86
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.940
We have two top level pages and they are home and about.

87
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.300
Right.

88
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.880
And the way that this example is set up for us is you can imagine that this thing right here is a top

89
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.140
level navigation menu, very similar to the main nav we have on our site.

90
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.300
And as I hover my mouse over it, you'll notice in the bottom left corner the URL will change.

91
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.050
So as I hover over home, you'll see it is just the slash route.

92
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.320
And as I go to about you'll see that it's now slash about.

93
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.750
So this is a different URL, it has a different route, it is a different path.

94
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.190
It is a different destination for the user to visit.

95
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.160
And what's going to happen when we click on about will notice right here the URL changes.

96
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.640
So it's almost like the user has navigated to a different page on our website.

97
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.260
And what do we see here?

98
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.480
We see a totally different view.

99
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.560
We're now predictably rendering that about view.

100
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.740
That we just saw in our editor.

101
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:57.660
So we have gone from rendering this view, which is the first one to telling view to tear this one down

102
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.180
and then render this one right here.

103
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.040
And of course, what view router has done for us, what it's doing behind the scenes is it's watching

104
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:12.960
this URL and it knows which top level view component which view in our views folder to render at a given

105
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.260
route.

106
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.080
It knows at the home route or the slash route route right here that it should render the home view.

107
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.560
And at this slash about URL, it should render a totally different view, which is the about field.

108
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.230
Okay, so I hope that introduction is not too complex.

109
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:34.230
The reason we usually does this thing is just to show us how easy it is to navigate from URL to URL

110
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.270
and show a totally different top level view component, which again is called a view and is stored in

111
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.100
the views directory within the project.

112
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.470
But we're going to use this exact same principle to build the navigation in our jobs website to allow

113
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.730
the user to go from the home page to the job results page, for example.

114
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.490
All right, so that's all there is to cover it in this lesson.

115
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.140
And I will see you in the next one.
