00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.080
All right.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:08.340
So in the previous lesson, we saw a new warning message in this code whenever we used the apply directive

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.290
from the Tailwind Library.

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.430
That's because the CSC checker doesn't understand what this keyword means.

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.420
And so it's saying this is an unknown rule and obviously not valid access.

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.300
It totally is because our view compiler understands the syntax and knows how to integrate all of these

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.050
tailwind styles.

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.850
But the code editor doesn't.

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.650
And the simplest solution for now is going to be to just turn off these access checks so they don't

10
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.310
bother us.

11
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.580
So the easiest way to do this is to open up our file explorer.

12
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.850
And then at the very top of our project, you should see the dot vs code directory in there you'll see

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.510
a settings that JSON file, I'm going to open mine up right here and you might see two panels open or

14
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.260
perhaps one.

15
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.190
But the file that we're looking for here is this one that I have on my right hand side.

16
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.530
These are all the settings that we configured earlier in the course for our project, such as, for

17
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.620
example, the fact that the editor will save will format the file and we save it, that the editor will

18
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.380
use a default formatter of prettier to tabs or two spaces to represent a tab, etc..

19
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.070
So here's where we want to configure any project specific settings.

20
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.010
So at the very top here, I'm going to add a new setting, and this is just JavaScript object notation,

21
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.230
which is basically like a JavaScript object.

22
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.780
It's a combination of key value pairs where the key is the setting and the value is the actual option

23
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.220
that we've chosen for that setting.

24
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.460
So I'm going to add another key value pair here.

25
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.880
My key will be in double quotes and it's called CSC Dot Validate.

26
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.300
And then I'm going to provide a colon to provide the value.

27
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.390
And my value here is going to be a boolean of false.

28
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.170
And then make sure to put a comma here to make sure it moves on to the next line.

29
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.660
So we're just going to say turn off access validation.

30
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.560
Don't worry about that.

31
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.170
If Russia says breaks anyway, then the view compiler should catch it and we should see nothing successful

32
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.770
in the browser.

33
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.420
So we'll know if we did something incorrect.

34
00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.080
All right.

35
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.610
So I'm going to close the settings that JSON file and we should see that those warnings have been removed

36
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.550
from our style section of our action button component.

37
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.110
This warning that we're seeing from Iceland is valid, but we're going to come back to it a little bit

38
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.220
later in this section.

39
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.850
All right.

40
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.590
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

41
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.060
So I will see you in the next one.
