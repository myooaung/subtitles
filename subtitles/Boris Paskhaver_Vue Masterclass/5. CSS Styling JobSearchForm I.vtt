00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.700
All right.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.760
So the next thing I'd like to do is to start styling our form element in our job search form component.

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.480
So right here we can add a bunch of tailwind classes and this form element will serve as a container

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.370
for a bunch of input elements that ask the user for their role and their location.

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.480
So let's begin by making this form a flex box with the flex clasp.

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.490
I'm also going to vertically align my flex children using the items center class.

7
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.870
I want to make this form occupy 100% of the width of its parent, so I'll apply the W full or width

8
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.240
for class to assign a width of 100%.

9
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.930
I also do want to assign this form a manual height.

10
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.050
I can do that with my H classes or my high classes.

11
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.920
So here I'll do h 12 for a height of 48 pixels.

12
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.220
Then I'd like to create some space between the form and the component or the element above, which is

13
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.390
my headline component.

14
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.330
So right here I'll add my empty or a margin top class to add margin, but only on the top.

15
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.820
And I'll go with empty 14, which has 56 pixels of margin on the top of this form.

16
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.970
The next thing I'd like to add is a border.

17
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.240
So we're going to add the border class to give the form element, a one pixel border around all sides.

18
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.460
And I do want to ensure it is a solid border, and I can do that with my border, solid class.

19
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.220
So we have a one pixel solid border.

20
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.760
The last thing I'd like to specify is the color of that border.

21
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.830
And we're actually going to use one of our new tailwind colors, which is brand GRE three.

22
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.380
So we have a whole bunch of tailwind classes that start with border, including the newly generated

23
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.240
border brand Gray three.

24
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.210
That's going to apply that gray color to our border.

25
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.770
And finally, the last thing I'd like to do is to apply a rounded edge or a rounded container to the

26
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.820
entire form.

27
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.860
I don't want it to be a rectangular box.

28
00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.190
I want it to be a rounded box so I can add the rounded three Excel class here to apply a border radius

29
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.270
of 24 pixels.

30
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.570
And that's just going to curve the edges of my form.

31
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.530
And we no longer need this text right here, so we can get rid of that and let's save that and see what

32
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.150
that looks like in the browser.

33
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.770
All right.

34
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.390
So there we go.

35
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.840
We have this form element right here, nice and rounded, and this is where we're going to allocate

36
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.480
our input fields in the very next lesson.

37
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.950
The one last thing I'd like to do now is to add a search icon right here.

38
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.120
This is actually going to be another font awesome icon use.

39
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.030
It's the exact same icon we have in our sub nav.

40
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.580
It's actually going to be the search icon that we have right here.

41
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.470
I just want to populate it in here.

42
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.060
So let's head back to our Visual Studio code text editor.

43
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.910
And as a reminder, our font awesome icon components are registered as global components.

44
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.360
So we do not need to import them and register them locally.

45
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.920
We can just use them directly line in any template, in any view component.

46
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.150
So right here I'm going to use my font, awesome icon of global component.

47
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.700
I'm going to give it a self-closing tag or slash.

48
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.140
And then as a reminder, the way that we customize the actual icon that font awesome renders is by using

49
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.490
the icon prop.

50
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.200
So here I'm going to use icon.

51
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.020
And since my argument to the icon prop is going to be an array which is a complex value, I need to

52
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.560
use the v bind syntax, the colon right here in order to bind it so that Vue understands that I'm not

53
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.980
providing a string, but rather a string that represents an array.

54
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.070
So right here I am going to pass double quotes, but in that string I'm going to provide square brackets

55
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.170
to indicate that I'm working with a array.

56
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.810
This array is going to take two string arguments, and because we are in another string with double

57
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.200
quotes, we need to provide our internal strings in single quotes.

58
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.420
So the first argument here is going to be face that is just the parent level category of font.

59
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.870
Awesome.

60
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.210
And then the second string argument is going to be the actual icon we want to use and we're going to

61
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.650
use this search icon here.

62
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.920
This is the exact same syntax we utilized in our subnet.

63
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.940
And if you ever forget the icon that you'd like to use, you can look for it on the font.

64
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.810
Awesome website.

65
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.590
Okay.

66
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.140
So that is for rendering our font awesome icon.

67
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.990
But I do want to add two additional tailwind classes.

68
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.790
So I'm going to add a class right here.

69
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.180
As a reminder, this syntax can be a little bit confusing because we are adding classes to a component,

70
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.310
not to a native HTML element.

71
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.890
But this is totally permitted because what Vue is going to do under the under the hood is it's going

72
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.950
to take these classes, it's going to go into the font, awesome icon implementation, find the top

73
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.210
level root element.

74
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.610
So in other words, find the element that is at the very top of the template for that component and

75
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.510
then add those classes to that HTML native element.

76
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.840
So for example, I'm going to add two classes here for margin view is going to go inside this implementation

77
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.210
and add those two classes for margin to the top level element in this component, whatever that element

78
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.310
happens to be, we don't know and frankly, we don't care for the purposes of what we want to do here.

79
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.450
So the first class is margin on the left hand side, which is accomplished via the small classes margin

80
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.750
left.

81
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.890
I'm going to add ammo for here for a left margin of 16 pixels.

82
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.500
And then on the right hand side, I want to create some space between this icon as well as the first

83
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.160
input field.

84
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.120
So I'm going to add margin right with M are a little bit less though.

85
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.010
It's going to be hour three, which is 12 pixels of margin on the right hand side.

86
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.100
Let's go ahead and save that and see how it looks in the browser.

87
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.420
And there we go.

88
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.230
We have our icon right here and a little bit of space in here, which we don't see yet.

89
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.170
And in the very next lesson, we can go ahead and start adding our input fields for role and location.
