1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,350
All right.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:07,500
So now that we have completed our discussion on CCS scoping in view, we need to do a little bit of

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,560
housekeeping to prepare us for the next section of the course.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,950
Mostly this is going to consist of deleting a lot of the files that the view Seelye generated for us

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,020
that we do not need for our project.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,370
So I'm just going to open up my file explorer right here in this code, and we're just going to start

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,210
deleting files.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,570
So first up in the assets folder, you'll find a logo, that PNG file, that's just the view logo right

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:30,900
here.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,710
We're not going to need it for our project right now so we can go ahead and remove it.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,790
We can also go ahead and remove our Hello World View file inside the components folder.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,490
And by the way, it's failing to compile on the right hand side because one of our components is referencing

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,140
that former logo that's totally file, that's totally fine.

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,050
It's not building because it can't find the file it needs, not a problem.

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,110
So let's go ahead and delete our helloworld that view component.

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,290
We're going to we're going to come back to APT View in just a second, but I'd also like to head into

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,200
the tests folder, into the unit folder, and you're going to find this example, that case file.

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,240
This is an example of a test file.

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,920
We do not need it right now.

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,440
And later on will create a new test file and I'll talk you through the syntax of tests at a separate

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,810
moment in time later so we can go ahead and remove that.

22
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,200
And then let's come back to our app file and we're going to clean it up a little bit.

23
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,030
So first up, we no longer have a helloworld component, so I'm going to get rid of it right here.

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,820
We no longer have our image that references that view logo whose file we just deleted.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,960
So we can remove this.

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,980
So we can just go ahead and leave a basic H1 because we do need some kind of content within our template

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,330
tags or view will complain.

28
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,540
So I'm just going to do a basic H1, but you can leave whatever you want.

29
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,940
And I'm just going to leave a text here of Hello View.

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,740
Right here in our script section.

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,110
This is where we were formally importing the Hello World component from a separate file.

32
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,770
We'll talk more about components and imports at a separate point later.

33
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,900
But the short story here is we no longer have this component, so we no longer need to import it.

34
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,460
And right here in our components key, we can delete that key entirely.

35
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,400
So our left here in the script section of the course is just going to be a object with a name property

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,180
set to app.

37
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:22,720
All right.

38
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:29,800
And then finally, we actually do not need a style tag unless we are adding styles and we no longer

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,230
have any CSA styles to add to this component.

40
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,360
It's just a plain H1 so we can remove all of this content down below the style tag.

41
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,730
And once we save this, the View app should be able to render properly because now all the files are

42
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:48,640
present and we should be left with this super simple hello view H1 tag in our app.

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:48,910
Right?

44
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,080
And that's all we need.

45
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,190
We're starting from scratch.

46
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,110
We're going to truly build this job search app from the very beginning, from the very first component,

47
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,960
and we're going to start tackling that in the very next section.

48
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,460
We're also going to talk a little bit about a cool CSS framework called Tailwind.

49
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,620
That's what's next on our docket.

50
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,570
So lots of fun stuff lies ahead.

51
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,130
I will see you in the next lesson.
