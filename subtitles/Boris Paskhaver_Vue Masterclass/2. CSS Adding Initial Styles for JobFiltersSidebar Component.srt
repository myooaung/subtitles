1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,020
Okay.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,820
So I promise that we'll return to this code momentarily to start writing our first code.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,380
But I did want to show you this feature in The Real World on the Google Careers website.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,080
You'll notice here on the left hand sidebar, we have all of these categories, and I can expand any

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,700
one of them independently to have a list of checkboxes that I can select.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,950
And as soon as I select one, for example, bachelors right here and part time right here, we're going

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,840
to see the jobs on the right hand side.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,260
Filter themselves to only include these categories.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,180
So in other words, these are the jobs that have a bachelor's requirement that are part time.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:36,780
All right.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,360
The first thing we're going to start building out in this section is this kind of top level header right

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:42,660
here.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,720
What do you want to do as well as the clear filters button?

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,610
It may be a little while before we get back to all of this, but I do want to start building this basically

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,510
from top to bottom.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,670
So if I click the clear filters button, by the way, that is going to remove all of those filters.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,760
And then once that is complete, I can also collapse each respectable accordion like so by clicking

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,250
that carrot.

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,630
So as many times as I want, I can expand it and then collapse it.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:07,770
All right.

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,980
And where we are currently in our app is we have this sidebar section kind of delineated and marked

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,760
out, but we have to start building it out to have all those accordions right here.

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,740
So that's where we're going to be moving towards.

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:27,060
So with that said, let me go back to the code and let me open up a file we have not touched in a while

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,490
and it's going to be the job filters sidebar.

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,160
This is the code that creates that left hand sidebar with a certain with right here and right now it

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,850
has nothing in it.

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,600
So let's start adding some content.

29
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,620
I'm going to remove this text of job from the sidebar and I'm going to add a section and I'm immediately

30
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,760
going to provide a Tailwind class right here.

31
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,830
I'm going to add some padding on the bottom with the PB five class padding bottom of 1.25 ram or equivalently

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,640
20 pixels.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,300
And in here I'm going to create a div and I'm going to make this a Flexbox.

34
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,310
So I'll attach the flex class and I want my flex children to be arranged in a row.

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,080
So I'm going to add the flex row class.

36
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,570
And finally, I want to space out the children with equal spacing in between.

37
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,730
So I'm going to use the justify it between talent class and that is going to create spacing, equal

38
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,380
spacing between all of my flex children.

39
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,710
I'm only going to have to flex children within my flex box and they are going to be an three as well

40
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,850
as another div.

41
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,310
Okay.

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,560
On the H3, we're going to add a couple more classes right here.

43
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,860
I'm going to add some margin on the Y axis.

44
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,930
So only going up and down using the M Y series of classes margin wide.

45
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,080
And so I'm going to do my four to add 16 pixels of margin on the top and 16 pixels of margin on the

46
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,530
bottom.

47
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,390
The next thing I want to do is a class called tax base that's just going to use the default font size

48
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,320
of 16 pixels.

49
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,870
And then I want to have a little bit of bolding.

50
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,880
So I'm going to add the font semi bold class that is going to give it a font weight of 600.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,080
So a little bit of bolding.

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,030
And here's where I'm going to write my text, the exact same text we have on the Google Careers website,

53
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,610
which is What do you want to do?

54
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,700
All right.

55
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,980
Afterwards, we have our dev on this.

56
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,460
Dev.

57
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,140
I'm going to create another Flexbox.

58
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,030
I want to vertically align the flex children of this Flexbox.

59
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,220
So I'm going to apply the items center class.

60
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,560
And finally, I want a little bit of a smaller text for the children inside.

61
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,370
So I'm going to use the text as some class and that gives it a little bit of a smaller font size 14

62
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,340
pixels inside this div.

63
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:39,260
I actually want to use a button and I want to reuse the action button component that we've used previously

64
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,160
in the course.

65
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,140
So how do we wire up another component?

66
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,150
This may be a little bit of a review, but in our script section we have to import the component we'd

67
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,780
like to use.

68
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:54,020
So in this case, I'm going to import action button and that comes from our source directory components

69
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,460
shared.

70
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,590
And that's where we have our action button component.

71
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,020
And then in order to register it with my job filter sidebar, I have to add that component's property

72
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,580
set to an object.

73
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,470
And here I'm just going to provide action button which allows me to use action button anywhere in the

74
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,270
template of my job filter sidebar.

75
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:17,480
So within this div, right here is where I'm going to render my action button component with a self-closing

76
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,610
tag and an action button component.

77
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,550
As a reminder, I'm going to open it right here on the right hand side.

78
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,770
It requires two props.

79
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,290
It needs a text prop, which is the actual text that the button displays, and then a type prop which

80
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,850
specifies the type of button we have a primary button and a secondary button.

81
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,150
And in this scenario, we actually want a secondary button.

82
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,410
That's the style we want, and that will avoid the default prop value of primary.

83
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,840
So right here, I'm going to provide my text prop and I'm going to provide it with a string of clear

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,410
filters.

85
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,940
And then for my type prop, I'm going to provide a string of secondary.

86
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,440
And because these are basic string arguments, we do not need to use the V bind syntax.

87
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,700
In other words, the colon.

88
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,730
We can just provide regular string arguments, save that.

89
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:06,770
And if I go back to my browser, we can see we're starting to build out that top level functionality.

90
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,640
What do you want to do?

91
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,960
As well as the Clear Filters button, it does have a little bit of a different style compared to the

92
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,920
Google career site when I hover over it, but I'm okay with that for now.

93
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,130
We've sort of built out this top level navigation of our sidebar, and we can move on to building our

94
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,620
accordion components in the follow up lesson.
