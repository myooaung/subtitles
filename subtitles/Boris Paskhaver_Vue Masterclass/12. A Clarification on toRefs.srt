1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,860
All right.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,170
So there's just one more detail that I'd like to mention about the two refs function, and that is that

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,100
it only accepts a reactive object as its argument.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,000
It cannot accept a plain JavaScript object.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,740
So we saw this example in the previous lesson we were able to pass in person to the two refs.

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,830
The function because person is a reactive object from the reactive function in view.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,030
So let's see what happens if I remove this reactive function call and I reduce person back to a plane

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,170
JavaScript object.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,410
If I now try to pass this in to two refs, we're actually going to get a warning.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,520
It's going to say to refs expects a reactive object but received a plain one.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,910
So the object that we passed the two refs must already be reactive so that the function can iterate

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,420
over its properties, take each individual one and its respective value and make all of them reactive.

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,510
To give you back a brand new object where each individual property is reactive compared to the whole

14
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,740
original reactive object, which is just one reactive reference to a whole object.

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,770
Of course, if you wanted something like this to work, it's not a problem.

16
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:18,360
We can just wrap our person object in the reactive function that will return a reactive object whose

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,350
properties we will then make all reactive using the two refs function.

18
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,850
So this syntax will work just fine.

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,500
It's the exact same ideas what we did in the previous lesson, except we're all doing it in a single

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:28,890
line.

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:29,940
All right.

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,710
That's all there is to cover in this lesson.

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,270
So I will see you in the next one.
