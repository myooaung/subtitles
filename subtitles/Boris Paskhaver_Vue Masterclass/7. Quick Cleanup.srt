00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,200
All right.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,390
In this lesson, I just want to quickly clean up some files in preparation for the next section of the

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:06,810
course.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,670
The first thing we can do is clear out the contents of our playground dot file.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,460
As a reminder, this file is just a scratch pad.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,480
This code is not directly related to our view code, so we can go ahead and remove it.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,770
And I'm going to remove or delete the playground dot test that JS file completely just so that it doesn't

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,140
negatively affect our coverage when we actually start running tests for our components.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,360
I want to get an accurate sense of how much of our components remain untested, and I don't want this

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,640
additional tests right here, which don't actually do our project to influence that number in any way.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,990
So I'm just going to remove this test.

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,480
It was purely for the sake of example and learning so we can delete playground that test that.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:48,870
Yes.

14
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,030
And leave playground bags empty.

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,550
And that's all there is to do in this lesson.

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,350
I will see you in the next one.
