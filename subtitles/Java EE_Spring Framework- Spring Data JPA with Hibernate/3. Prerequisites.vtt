00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.170
The prerequisites are similar to other courses I've produced here

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.760
regarding Spring and some of the other libraries surrounding it. We're

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.260
going to still be using the Java 11 LTS version.

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.540
Java 11 is the current version for long‑term support,

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.840
and after that we don't have guaranteed long‑term support.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.570
So yes, Java 12,

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.420
13, and 14 have already been released, they're just not as stable as 11 is.

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.070
They work,

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.460
and in most cases all the examples we'll be doing should work there as well.

10
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.240
This is just the one that's guaranteed by them to continue working.

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.330
I'm assuming you already know how to install Java, so we

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.140
won't be covering that in this course.

13
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm also going to use Maven in this course.

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.160
Spring no longer offers up a way to download just

15
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.810
the JARs that you use for Spring.

16
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.740
You have to use Maven or Gradle to download these dependencies.

17
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.330
There is a Pluralsight course on Maven that I've actually authored here

18
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.140
on Pluralsight. If you have more questions about that,

19
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.230
you can go follow that course and learn how to use all the ins and outs

20
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.510
of Maven, but it's pretty simple. If you aren't super familiar with it,

21
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.250
we'll show you everything you need to know inside of the course here.

22
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.500
The next thing you'll need is an IDE. This course has now been updated

23
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.970
to use IntelliJ.

24
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.860
We got feedback that the majority of our users wanted to

25
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.040
see and use the examples with IntelliJ, so we have changed the course to use it.

26
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.940
I will be using an Enterprise version of IntelliJ.

27
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.340
They do have a 30‑day trial, as well as Student licenses available.

28
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.510
If you do want to use Spring STS, which I do like as well,

29
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.610
I will try and answer any questions you might have on the

30
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.680
forum for this course. And then Tomcat, the app will run

31
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.010
under Spring Boot or Tomcat.

32
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.820
We're also going to use Docker to run the database,

33
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.940
but we have a whole section dedicated to just that.

34
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.400
So let's recap here.

35
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.710
We're going to use Java 11 because of its LTS support, we have moved

36
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.620
to IntelliJ, but all of the examples will work with Spring STS, and

37
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.810
just the most recent version of Maven,

38
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.060
as that's how Spring requires you to download those JARs anyway. Not

39
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.580
required, but I do recommend having complete the Maven Fundamentals, Spring

40
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.040
Fundamentals, and Spring MVC Fundamentals courses.

41
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.840
This course does build upon those, so it will answer a

42
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.000
lot of questions you might have. Let's look at how we download that source code now.
