My name is Brian Hansen, and welcome to my course,

Spring Data JPA using Hibernate.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.670
I am the CEO of Complete Programmer and a director at Software Technology Group.

5
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.190
Hibernate and JPA are one of the most advanced timeâ€‘saving

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.040
frameworks to be introduced into Java development.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.400
In this updated course, we're going to cover configuring Hibernate,

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.990
utilizing Spring Data JPA, using Docker to run our database,

9
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.240
various JPA tips and tricks,

10
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.460
and all of our configuration has been migrated from XML to

11
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.840
use Java configuration with annotations.

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.500
By the end of this course, you'll know all of the fundamentals of

13
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.040

Before beginning the course, you should be familiar

15
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.840
with Spring and Spring MVC some.

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.820
