1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,970
The next piece that we want to update is to open up our

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:09,140
RegistrationServiceImpl, and we're going to do almost the same thing.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:16,170
And, I am making a really deep example or a harder example out of this to prove

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,720
a point, and that's why we're going to use Spring Data JPA.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,230
The actual Spring Data portion is what we've been dealing with,

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,040
but the JPA combined with Spring Data we haven't delved into yet.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,910
But this example is going to help illustrate that and show

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,040
you why we want to upgrade these things.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,290
We're going to do the same thing here.

10
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,470
We're going to wrap this course with an if statement.

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:52,240
Say if(registration.getId() ==null,

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,470
then let's go ahead and add that course to it and save that,

13
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,390
if not, we're going to just skip that.

14
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,420
We don't need to add that default attendee course to the

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,100
registration on an update, we're only going to do that as

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,830
part of the creation portion of this.

17
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,120
So, illustrating where we're putting our business logic at inside the

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,090
ServiceImpl, we have overridden our save method,

19
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,780
and there is a tiny bit of business logic in there that's

20
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:32,000
going to get replaced with Spring Data JPA. Let's save this now though and we'll move on to the UI portion.
