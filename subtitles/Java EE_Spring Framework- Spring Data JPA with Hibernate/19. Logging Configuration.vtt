00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.720
Since our properties file is actually a java.properties file

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.310
and not just a Spring properties file,

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.940
we can go ahead and change these parameters right

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.840
inside of our application.properties.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.570
So I'm going to go ahead and set logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG,

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.950
and you can turn that up and down to the various

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.540
logging levels for whatever you want.

8
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.400
Once you've maybe got the basis of your application set up,

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.640
you'll switch it to warn or even error.

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.120
Then I'm going to turn on spring.jpa.show‑sql=true and

11
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.640
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true.

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.560
These are really JPA properties,

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.240
not Spring properties, but Spring does have an interface to those to tune those.

14
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.880
So now that we have all these, we can save this.

15
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.590
And when we fire up our application for the first time in the next module,

16
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.080
it will produce those SQL log statements for us.

17
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.000
It'll show the actual SQL that's being executed, and it'll be formatted to a human‑readable format.
