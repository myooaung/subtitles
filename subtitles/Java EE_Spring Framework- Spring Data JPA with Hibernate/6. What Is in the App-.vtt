00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.540
Now that we have our scaffold application downloaded, what's in it?

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.040
What does it do?

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.100
Well, it's a conference application.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.610
It's the same one that we've used and standardized across a lot of

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.940
our Spring applications here on Pluralsight.

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.240
It has a Registration section and Users, and we gather all of that information.

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.690
It happens to be the same application we add security to in my

8
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.690
Spring Security course here on Pluralsight. It captures posts,

9
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.270
gets, does all of the things that we would expect inside of a

10
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.650
standard web application, but it does not store any data yet.

11
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.340
That's the whole goal of this course is to tie that into

12
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.430
the back end where we show you all the annotations and

13
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.140
configuration to store that data.

14
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.740
So to show how it works though,

15
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.000
let's walk through this architecture a little bit deeper so you kind of have a nice recap of what's inside of this app.
