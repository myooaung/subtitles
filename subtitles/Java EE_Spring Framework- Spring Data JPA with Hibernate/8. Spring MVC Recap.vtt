00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.210
The key points we mentioned from our Spring MVC app were

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.150
that it's all configured through Java.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.430
There's actually no XML in our app.

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.940
There's not even a web.xml in our application.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.730
It's launched through the AppConfig, or our conference

6
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.750
ApplicationConfig.java file, and everything is annotationâ€‘driven, our

7
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.440
requests from our web app to how we've configured our Spring tiers.

8
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.170
And lastly,

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.340
our application.properties contains all the pertinent information that we'll

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.790
add to connect to our database, any pooling information,

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.870
that type of stuff, will all be handled.

12
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.000
So those are the four main files that we're going to focus on for a lot of this class.
