00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,760
In this module, we talked about what is Spring and a

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,690
little bit of the history of Spring.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,380
It's a very stable framework, has a pretty consistent release cycle,

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,340
and it's always been very backwards and forwards compatible.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,870
We also talked about what is JPA and kind of the roots of JPA, how it was

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,580
influenced from tools like Hibernate, TopLink, JDO, and became a 1.0

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,030
specification that was later extracted out of EJBs because people wanted to

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,840
use it without using Enterprise JavaBeans.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,690
We also looked at the problem of what our business focus is and

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,590
all that JDBC code that really has nothing to do with us getting

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,730
this query back, and those are hoops we have to jump through to

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,440
find that information.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,670
But really that's one line of query and getting that car object back

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,810
is what our business cares about and what JPA and Hibernate will help

15
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,040
us do inside of our Spring application.

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,530
Let's get rolling on our application though and look at what we

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,000
need to do to download the sample app and do a quick walkthrough of our Spring MVC application now.
