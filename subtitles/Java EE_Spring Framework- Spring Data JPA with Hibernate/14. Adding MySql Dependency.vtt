00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.220
I opted to separate adding the Spring Data dependency and the

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.910
MySQL dependency into separate exercises,

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.890
and this was to clearly differentiate that the JDBC driver has

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.260
nothing to do with the Spring libraries.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.790
We are going to use the parent POM to pull in the correct

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.940
version of this transitive dependency.

7
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.040
But if you weren't using MySQL,

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.920
this is also where you would choose something else like Postgres

9
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.440
or Hypersonic, H2, Derby, some of the Oracle drivers or SQL

10
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.090
Server drivers. So completely separate.

11
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.520
We have our JPA libraries and then the JDBC driver that

12
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.000
talks to the database that we are utilizing. So let's add this library in now.
