00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,410
Picking up where we left off in our IDE,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:07,740
let's open up our pom.xml. And we can give ourselves a little

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,820
bit of space just somewhere between spring‑boot‑starter web

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,640
and spring‑boot‑starter‑tomcat.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,140
And let's add a dependency inside of here. And the groupId is

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:32,880
going to be org.springframework.boot, and the artifactId is going

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:43,440
to be spring‑boot‑starter‑data‑jpa.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,910
And when we save this,

9
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,620
it's going to go ahead and download those dependencies in the background.

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,770
I've already done it once before on my machine, so it did it quite fast.

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,910
It was already cached.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,100
It may take it a minute or so for yours to download them. And a couple of

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,340
things to note about this. Again, as I mentioned in the slides,

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,730
there is no version here,

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,280
and that's because it grabs this version from our

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,520
spring‑boot‑starter parent version up above. So doing

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,850
dependency management inside of our POM file,

18
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,840
it grabs all of those based off of the version of the parent that we're using.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,730
If you want to verify that the libraries were, in fact, downloaded, you

20
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:27,310
can expand the External Libraries section and see inside of here that

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:33,640
we've got org.hibernate‑core. And we've got 5.4.12.Final for the

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,840
version of the parent that I'm using.

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,790
You've also got the various JPA libraries,

24
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,130
the Spring Data libraries inside of here.

25
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,150
So everything looks like it got downloaded correctly for what

26
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:52,000
we're trying to include inside of our application. Now let's continue configuring the rest of the database connection.
