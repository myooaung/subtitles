00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,880
So far,

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,020
everything we have seen and have been dealing with

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,340
has been simple primitive types.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,890
How do we deal with objects or lists other than simple primitives?

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,210
Since JPA is all about dealing with objects,

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
we need to be able to bind collections of objects to the database.

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,710
There are essentially four types of annotations that we can use to

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,840
join objects and collections to one another.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,240
There is a OneToOne, a OneToMany, a ManyToOne, and a ManyToMany.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,950
These can be used in various configurations,

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,750
such as unidirectional or bidirectional.

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,940
And then we also have cascading features associated with them.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:46,000
The most common is typically the OneToMany and ManyToOne joins, and the most complex is definitely the ManyToMany.
