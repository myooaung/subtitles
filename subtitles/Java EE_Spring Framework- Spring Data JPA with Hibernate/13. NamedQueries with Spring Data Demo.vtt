Switching this over to use the named query and the projections that the named

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.040
query is utilizing is actually easier than you may think.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.790
There is one little caveat though. We have to go to our registration object

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.850
and change the name of our named query. You'll remember we used this public

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.480
static final String to name our named query in this definition of above. All

6
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.750
we have to do is come in here and specify the domain. So we'll say

7
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.640
Registration.registrationReport.

8
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.010
Now since we're in this RegistrationRepository interface, that

9
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.930
literally becomes the name of the method now,

10
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.160
RegistrationReport. We'll save this, and that's actually our named query.

11
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.510
So the rest of the functionality that we had inside of our

12
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.710
RegistrationRepository, the save, findAll, and findAllReports can

13
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.440
actually all go away. I'm going to delete the implementation,

14
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:11.500
click OK, and our RegistrationRepository has a call from

15
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.740
the RegistrationService that will now just be

16
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.940
registrationReport, and we can save that.

17
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:26.440
We have all of our code switched over to now using the JpaRepository interfaces,

18
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.660
and this is the extent of what our repository tier looks like

19
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.000
now. Let's fire up our server and see what this looks like from the user interface side of it.
