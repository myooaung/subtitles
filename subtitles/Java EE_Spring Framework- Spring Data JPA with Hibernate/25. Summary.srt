1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,920
So this was a big module.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,860
We covered a lot of things in here and had a lot of demos.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,740
We went over the most common and default annotations using JPA.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,640
We looked at how to override the defaults and what they implement for you.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,200
We went through the service and repository tier from Spring,

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,570
and we also looked at joins and using one‑to‑many and many‑to‑one. We

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,000
also demoed fetch types, eager versus lazy, and showed you some of the

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,640
limits or exceptions you might face with that.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,790
And then we went over projection, one of the most powerful, but

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,440
often overlooked usages of JPA in my opinion.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,460
And lastly, we cleaned up some of our code using named queries.

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,380
We have one more module left,

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,670
and we're going to dive into the actual Spring Data portion of

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,320
using JPA and some of their convenience interfaces that they have

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,770
and how that can reduce even more of the boilerplate code that we

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,130
have inside of our applications.

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:04,000
So some of that copy and pasting we've been doing, you're going to see a lot of that go away in this next module.
