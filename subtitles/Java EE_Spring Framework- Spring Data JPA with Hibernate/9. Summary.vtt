00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.040
Let's recap what we covered in this short module about software architecture.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.670
It's a much needed thing inside of our industry to convey

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.640
information and vocabulary about what we're trying to do.

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.560
We talked about MVC and how the traditional MVC design

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.690
pattern isn't necessarily reflective of what we're doing

6
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.240
inside of our web applications.

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.890
We also talked about n‑tier architectures and why it's beneficial

8
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.610
for us, and that leads us into a deeper discussion about the

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.590
various components inside of our application and how we interact

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.800
with those components specifically using our controller, service,

11
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.040
and repository objects.

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.110
Those three pieces are what really builds up our access to our back

13
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.080
end and where our business logic should reside.

14
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.160
And even though there are more of Spring proper than Spring MVC,

15
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.750
we should always use those within the Spring MVC app to help

16
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.440
with our model‑view‑controller design pattern.

17
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's dive into some deeper configuration and start using this inside of our sample out now.
