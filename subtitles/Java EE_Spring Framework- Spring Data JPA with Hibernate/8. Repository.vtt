00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.040
And lastly, the repository tier. It is annotated with @Repository.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.930
It also describes the nouns of our system.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.340
You can see where the focus is different from service versus repository.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.000
The service tier describes the verbs or actions that

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.390
we wanted to do in the system,

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.340
and the repository tier describes the nouns the data of the system.

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.770
It's focused on persisting and interacting with the

8
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.540
database or basic CRUD functions.

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.140
It's also typically a one‑to‑one mapping with an object to a database table.

10
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.340
You may have an address and have an address repository.

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.540
You would have a customer object and a customer repository.

12
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.510
It's also often a one‑to‑one mapping of those to the database table,

13
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.900
but that's not always the case based off your database design.

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.810
You may break things into multiple tables,

15
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.690
like a person in an employee table, but you may only have an

16
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.340
employee object inside of your application.

17
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.000
That is more up to the ORM tool that you're using and how you've structured that data.
