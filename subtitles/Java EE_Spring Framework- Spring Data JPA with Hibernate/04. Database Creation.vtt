00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.650
Database creation is actually an interesting yet easy

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.840
thing to do with JPA and Hibernate.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.940
By adding these two lines to the end of our application.properties,

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.440
we can tell Hibernate to create the database and its tables upon startup.

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.330
There are four different values that we can use here, create,

6
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.310
which is used to create the database if it doesn't already

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.890
exist and any respective tables; update,

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.870
which will just look for changes upon the existing structure that

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.670
exists there, but it will not remove columns if you have modified your

10
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.210
entity to no longer have that column; createâ€‘drop, which will create

11
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.470
and drop the schema each time the app is redeployed, and this is

12
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.030
probably the most useful early on in your development, bear in mind it

13
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.720
does delete any data that you have stored in your app right now; and

14
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.310
then lastly,

15
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.860
validate. Validate seems like it would be the least used when

16
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.790
in fact this is what you should likely use once your app is

17
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.240
stable to alert you to any changes.

18
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.870
Technically there's a fifth one too, which is simply just none, but it does

19
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.410
nothing, and you may choose that after your app has gone through QA and any

20
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.690
other testing that you have to switch it to none.

21
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.930
I do like validate.

22
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.040
One thing between validate and none is that validate can slow

23
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.240
your app deployment if you have a very,

24
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.000
very large database as it will go through and verify the structure of all of those entities.
