00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.860
OneToMany is the most common of the joined type annotations.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.960
It's used to define a one‑to‑many relationship between

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.640
an object and a list of objects.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.670
In our application,

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.220
we will have a registration and a collection or a list

6
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.540
of courses tied to that registration.

7
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.160
We just need a OneToMany annotation on our

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640
registration class tying to our course list.

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.850
We can then specify a ManyToOne on the course back to the

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.720
registration. And this is all tied together using the mappedBy from

11
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.440
the OneToMany onto the object on the opposing side.

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.000
Courses will belong to a registration, or this registration has a list or many of these courses.
