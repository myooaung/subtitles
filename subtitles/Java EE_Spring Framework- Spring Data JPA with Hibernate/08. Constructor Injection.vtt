00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.060
Having seen setter injection now, constructor injection almost seems simpler.

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.770
We have the same objects defined, but now we just move the call to get the

3
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.200
repository to the constructor where we are creating the service. You can see

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.260
inside of here we have our beans already defined, and then we just go ahead and

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.240
call that instance to get it injected in there.

6
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.650
So, you just simply put the constructor with arguments in the order that

7
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.190
you want them to be injected and it will automatically call and

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:43.000
instantiate those beans and fill that object for you. Let's look at that same configuration and how we used to do that with XML.
