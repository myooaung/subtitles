00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,170
A very pleasant upgrade to this course is that Spring has enabled it to

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,840
where we don't need a persistence.xml file any longer.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,440
Historically, this is where we would configure database connections,

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,040
some various transaction things,

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,750
the persistency unit that we were dealing with, things of that nature.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,000
But we can do all of this without this file anymore.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,990
This was actually the last piece of XML that our application had in it,

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,340
and we no longer need it.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,930
I leave this slide in here just to show you that if you are looking at

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,110
older examples or you're troubleshooting something,

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,000
this is kind of a legacy piece.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,780
If you're just doing JPA by itself, you still need one.

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,680
But if you're using Spring, we no longer need this file.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,140
And that's a much nicer upgrade to not have yet another place to go

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:02,000
hunting and pecking through, looking for some other configuration attributes. So no longer need this XML inside of our app.
