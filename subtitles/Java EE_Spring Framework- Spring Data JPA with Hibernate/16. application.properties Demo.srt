1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,030
With all of our libraries now in place and all the other configuration,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,440
we can begin to set up our data source, and it's actually quite simple.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,420
If we go to src, main, resources,

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,070
we have our application.properties file inside of here.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,930
And we can begin by configuring using the Spring properties inside of here.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:34,810
So we can just say spring.datasource.url and type in here

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:43,760
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/conference,

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:58,980
and this should be the database that we created in our docker‑compose file. And

9
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:08,210
then we want to create spring.datasource.username, and we're just going to use

10
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:21,440
root for this and spring.datasource.password=pass.

11
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,020
And if you didn't use the same values that I did in your docker‑compose,

12
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,940
you'll want to change those to whatever values you put inside of there. Then

13
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:40,640
finally, we'll say spring.datasource.driver‑class‑name,

14
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,840
and we will put inside of here com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver,

15
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,120
and we'll also specify the dialect for our database.

16
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:59,940
So we'll say spring.jpa.database‑platform.

17
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:09,260
We want to set that equal to org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect.

18
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:15,070
Make sure that you get MySQL5InnoDBDialect.

19
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,840
If you just do the MySQLDialect,

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,340
it actually won't generate tables correctly in the next module.

21
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,340
So make sure you've got that exact dialect and then save

22
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,140
this. And you'll notice that inside of here,

23
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,280
all of my name value pairs are blue‑green with the exception of the driver,

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,240
and that's because it looks the driver up off the class path.

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,960
If you have any red text here right now,

26
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:47,040
you need to fix what it is pointing to because it's got something incorrect.

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:56,000
Our URL, username, password, and dialect are all correct based off of the container that we set up.
