00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,080
In the previous module,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,320
we used the persist method of the EntityManager to

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,240
create records in the database, but we never did an update.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,100
The persist method is used only for inserts,

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,540
though, and we use a merge method instead for updating a record.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,360
When we created our method we purposely called it save because we were going to

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,340
override this method to handle creates, as well as updates.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:29,740
Now,

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,690
this is one of those things that we have to do in all of our repository

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,530
classes, our implementations, that just is copy and paste code.

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,210
Now, some people get a little creative and create an abstract parent

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,510
class and move this code up into that parent class,

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,440
well let's show you what that looks like.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,100
This is an example of what our goal method will look like after

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,140
updating it to support creates, as well as updates.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,170
A few things to notice about this.

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,200
First, we will look to see if it has an Id, so the getId equal to null,

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,900
and we can determine from that whether or not it is a create versus update.

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,600
Second,

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,400
one other thing that's a little confusing is we don't have to

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,940
flush because the merge is handled differently.

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,520
Third, and lastly,

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,510
the merge does return an updated object where the persist is void.

24
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,120
This is because the problem I mentioned earlier about the

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,260
various Id generated value methods when defining what Id

26
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,040
type we have on our entity.

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,120
Some of the types of Id,

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,140
specifically the Identity column, aren't chosen until

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,720
after the object has been saved.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,940
So this snippet of code,

31
00:01:50,940 --> 00:02:01,000
this image here, shows what we would update our goal repository Impl to for the save method.
