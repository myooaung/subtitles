00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.670
Annotations are a very powerful method of exposing

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.840
functionality while staying within the domain.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.680
What I mean by this is that I can mark up the object that I am in

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.740
with the functionality that I want it to have.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.800
Annotations aren't the only way to develop with JPA.

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.920
We can use orm.xml files or straight Hibernate hbm.xml files

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.260
and bind classes to tables that way as well.

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.000
But the industry trend has currently moved towards developing through annotations.
