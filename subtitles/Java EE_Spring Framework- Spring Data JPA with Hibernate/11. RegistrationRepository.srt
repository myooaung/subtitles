00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,600
The RegistrationRepository is very similar to the UserRepository in what we

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,940
need to do to make it available to use Spring Data JPA.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,360
One thing to note though is in the previous version of this course,

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,200
there was no support for projections or using named queries the way that

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,150
we have inside of our RegistrationRepository right now.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,740
Both projections and named queries have since been added to this functionality,

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,430
and that's why I did this object next is because we're going

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:38,000
to add all of that functionality in there. All the customize stuff we did, we're going to convert over to Spring Data JPA.
