00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.010
Let's show you both ways in which you can go ahead and

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.480
download the source code for our course here.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.210
The first is going to Pluralsight's website where

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.330
you're already viewing this video from,

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.920
and you'll notice on the main page for this course there is

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.330
an Exercise files tab as one of the menu items that you can

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.980
choose under the course header.

8
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.640
And if you click on Exercise files,

9
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.570
it will go ahead and give you the option to download the exercise files here.

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.750
And it's a ZIP file, it's got a before and after for each module,

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.140
it contains all the slides and everything else.

12
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.780
I won't go into any more detail here because it's really

13
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.180
straightforward and already has instructions on how to do that.

14
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.540
So that's the first way you can go ahead and grab the source code.

15
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.540
The second way is to go to GitHub,

16
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.870
and I've pulled up another browser window and typed in

17
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.340
the URL github.com/bh5k/spring‑jpa.

18
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.290
So you can see right there in my address bar.

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.790
And if you actually look at the header of my source code,

20
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.690
you can see it typed out there as well for bh5k/spring‑jpa,

21
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.450
and this is just a repository I have,

22
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.370
and that will take you to the main page for this course

23
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.430
and the branches and all of the source code that's

24
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.940
associated with it is available here.

25
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.280
Now if you're already familiar with Git and GitHub,

26
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.740
you already know that you can fork this and pull it into your own personal

27
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.910
repository and go ahead and start developing on it from there.

28
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.970
But if you're not, don't worry about it.

29
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.230
We're not going to go into that level of detail.

30
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.270
If you know that, go ahead and execute it that way.

31
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.840
If not,

32
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.620
you can just go ahead and click the download Code button

33
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.940
here and choose to download a ZIP file.

34
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.490
It will download really fast because it doesn't contain any binaries,

35
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.240
just the source code for this application.

36
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.640
Navigating to the directory where your browser downloaded that zip file,

37
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.710
you'll see that you have a spring‑jpa‑main.zip,

38
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.390
or whatever your download was, maybe you grabbed the exercise files,

39
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.840
but the setup is pretty much the same from here on out.

40
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.640
Double‑click that and expand this folder.

41
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.240
I'm going to start off by renaming this to conference.

42
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.040
That's the name that our application is going to have inside of here.

43
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.450
And I'm going to copy that into my dev/workspace directory.

44
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.980
So,

45
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.450
yours may be c:/dev or you may be working on a Mac or a

46
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.480
Linux‑based system where it's just /dev,

47
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.350
/workspace, wherever your workspaces at.

48
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.840
I'm going to copy that folder into my workspace.

49
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.360
And typically that's enough, but I do have other projects,

50
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.000
so I'm going to create a new folder, call this spring‑jpa,

51
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.440
and copy that conference folder into spring‑jpa.

52
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.180
And inside of here, I'll now see that I've got a couple of hidden files,

53
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.230
my .gitattributes, .gitignore, and then some setup information.

54
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.200
But really the two that I care about are our pom.xml and our source file,

55
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.040
which are both contained here now.

56
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.810
And we can go ahead and fire up our IDE to load this project in.

57
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.550
Launching my IDE for the first time to import this,

58
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.130
it'll bring up this dialog asking me what I want to do,

59
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.160
if I want to create a new project, import it,

60
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.640
open or get one from version control.

61
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.680
I'm going to go ahead and say Import Project,

62
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.000
and I'm going to point that to the directory that we just created.

63
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.020
So,

64
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.590
dev/workspace/spring‑jpa/conference and just choose that directory and

65
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.840
select Open, and it will bring up a dialog where I can select Maven and say

66
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.760
Import project from external model, and choose Finish, and your IDE will

67
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.110
pull up with the application all configured,

68
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.030
installed, and ready to go.

69
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.740
We've got all of the pieces inside of here set up.

70
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.550
I'm going to walk through what the actual application does,

71
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:24.000
but for now it's all installed with Maven configured, your library is downloaded, and everything ready to start development.
