1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,650
To use our setterâ€‘injected Java code, all of our code can be configured just

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,190
the same as a plain old Java object by having a typical run method like here,

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,670
a main method where we can create a repository,

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,840
then we can create a service, and lastly,

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,240
we set that repository into that service.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,900
Conceptually, this is the exact same thing Spring is doing behind the scenes,

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,840
but also adding a lot of inherited functionality.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,460
You can see,

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:42,000
though, the Java configuration is just the same as if we were doing it with Spring or without, and you can test code the same way.
