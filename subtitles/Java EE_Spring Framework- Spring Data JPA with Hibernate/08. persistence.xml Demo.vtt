00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.080
In my Docker Desktop,

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.350
you can see any of the containers you currently have in there

3
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.540
and that our conference container is running.

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.840
So if I expand that, inside of here, you can tell that there is our container.

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.050
And if I click into it, you can see the log files that tells you it was created,

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.370
it was running, which port it's running on.

7
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.810
All of that information is displayed,

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.040
and it literally did all of that from that dockerâ€‘compose file.

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.570
So just to clarify how much simpler that was, once

10
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.340
I got Docker Desktop installed,

11
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.070
I literally went out, put a dockerâ€‘compose file inside of our application

12
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.880
with seven or eight lines inside of it that went out,

13
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.300
downloaded the instance for us,

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.340
set up the username and password and the port mappings,

15
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.840
and we're up and running.

16
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.000
We have our database set up for our application, ready to start development against.
