1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,990
Configuration is often a painful task.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,020
It can honestly be some of the most complex and time‑consuming

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,000
parts of development. And Spring aims to make this easier, but

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,340
there are still a lot of moving pieces.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,830
It should also be noted that Spring isn't just about making things easier,

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,090
but oftentimes making things more flexible as well.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,240
So there can be a trade‑off for ease versus flexibility.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,000
We're going to walk through each piece of the configuration to get the

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
development environment up and running. It's often the hardest part for developers when learning new technologies such as JPA.
