00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,440
Let's start off by talking about the database for a minute.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,160
JPA is an abstraction layer for our database.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,700
We can use almost any relational database that we have a dialect for.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,140
And if you don't know what dialects are,

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,230
we're going to talk about these more in greater detail later in the JPA

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,030
configuration section and some of the more detailed things that we can do with

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,650
those dialects because it's a pretty advanced topic.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,090
For our course, we're going to use MySQL.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,830
We're actually going to walk through installing that in just a bit.

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,830
But since this is a reâ€‘release of an old course,

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,200
a new change is that we're going to use Docker to install the database and

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,220
keep it contained. Docker has become the industry standard.

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,350
And if you're not using it, you should be.

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,450
It actually made this course simpler,

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,140
and that was one of the deciding factors of why we used it.

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,600
If for some reason you don't want to use Docker,

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:02,000
you can install it natively, and all of the examples will work just the same. But I would encourage you to give Docker a shot if you haven't.
