There are two types of injection in Spring.

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.790
Setter injection is the most common,

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.370
and this is usually the case because classes have setters to manipulate

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.940
variables, but it might not have the constructor that we want.

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.540
As you may have guessed, the other type of injection is constructor injection.

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.670
Constructor injection will help enforce a contract within the code

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.040
that was intended by the creator of the class.

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.630
Either way,

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.000
the code will work the same regardless of which method we choose or which option is available.
