00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.890
Just to give you a cheat sheet of some of the Docker commands we're going to

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.480
run in this course, there is the docker‑compose up ‑d,

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.340
which is used to start up our Docker container and our image,

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.200
docker‑compose down shuts it down,

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.240
docker ps will show you the process that's currently running,

6
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:30.150
and the last two, docker inspect with pid and pid grep IPAddress,

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.460
will let us inspect pieces of an instance that are currently

8
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.310
running and if we need to do anything specific with those

9
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:45.000
processes. We've got our YAML file created. We're start adding in the JPA jars to our application.
