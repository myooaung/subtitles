00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.870
So we've seen that Spring can be configured in multiple ways.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.540
There's the XML configuration,

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.240
there's annotation, and then there's also pure Java config.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.550
Just to be clear,

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.560
you can have annotations with XML and you can have them with the Java config.

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.830
It doesn't mean that annotation‑based is Java

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.140
configuration‑based, that's actually just annotation‑based.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.140
We are going to be using the Java configuration with annotation approach.

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.260
What also used to be done with a lot of XML,

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.260
the web.xml, loader listener, all of that configuration

11
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.050
is now all contained in our AppConfig,

12
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.530
which is a very welcome change and makes the configuration

13
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:53.000
in our app a lot less, and that's actually where we'll start off in the next module, integrating this all in to our application.
