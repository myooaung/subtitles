00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.790
With Docker Desktop installed and running,

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.850
I went ahead and switched back to our IDE,

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.720
and I closed all of the open tabs we had earlier and shut

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.860
down the tomcat instance that was running.

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.440
And I'm going to right‑click on our project and say New, File.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.240
We want to name this file docker‑compose.yml.

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.780
This is a YAML file.

8
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.800
And yes, you do want to name your file the exact same thing as this.

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.910
It does follow convention over configuration.

10
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.450
So name your file this, and we'll hit Enter.

11
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.160
And it will ask if I want to add this to Git.

12
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.400
If you're using Git and have it set up that way,

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.790
it's going to continually ask if you want to import those files.

14
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.370
So I will just cancel this and do it in the desktop

15
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.220
IDE that I've got installed locally.

16
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.690
We can start editing this.

17
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.180
So I'm going to begin with typing in version, and this does have

18
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.090
some context‑sensitive help. A lot of your IDEs do.

19
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.640
If you don't, it doesn't matter because this is literally just a text file.

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.940
A YAML file is just a text file.

21
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.030
So we're going to add networks inside of here, and we're just going

22
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.740
to use the default network. From here, we want to start utilizing

23
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.380
these services and specifically the database service. And we're

24
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.940
going to begin with an image,

25
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.750
and the image we want is mysql. And this is name and case‑sensitive, so I

26
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.640
would follow the exact conventions I have typed in here.

27
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.840
The container name, we're just going to use conference.

28
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.540
And for the ports, we're actually going to use the default ports that they have.

29
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.280
You could change this to something else,

30
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.860
but you have to get it configured correctly with your OS and

31
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.160
with the port that's inside of the container.

32
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.440
We'll just use the defaults for now.

33
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.740
And this is for your local instance, so it shouldn't be affecting anything there.

34
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.540
We'll have volumes,

35
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.300
and this is probably the one that's the most

36
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.140
error‑prone for you typing incorrectly.

37
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.500
We're going to say,

38
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.760
store our data for this underneath our project in a .data directory and

39
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.180
under a folder named /db. And then for our environment, we'll say use

40
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:48.150
var/lib/mysql. And our last environment entry, and this is the environment

41
00:02:48.150 --> 00:03:01.400
of our container, I'm going to say MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, and we will use

42
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:10.890
pass there. And for the database, we'll say MYSQL_DATABASE, and this is

43
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.140
the database name.

44
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.940
We will say conference as well there and just save this.

45
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.000
I'm going to switch over to our terminal, and we can actually run this docker‑compose file.
