00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,710
Spring is all about making things work better together.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,890
It was designed from the ground up to help overcome difficult

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,980
configuration problems common in software development. For JPA,

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,680
we use Spring to configure the transactions, data

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,940
source, and overall JPA configuration.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,390
With everything configured through Spring, we can then use dependency

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,540
injection and inject resources into the rest of our application.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,150
Spring really helps tie everything together in a nice, nonâ€‘hard coded way.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,420
Our controllers from our Spring MVC app can now seamlessly tie into our

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,320
database and JPA objects without having to go in and hard code or look

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,140
up references from within our application.

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,260
Now I'm going to remind you,

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,200
though, we are not going to cover Spring in its entirety because that's

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:56,000
in other courses I have published here on Pluralsight. We're going to just recap the principles that we need to use for our application
