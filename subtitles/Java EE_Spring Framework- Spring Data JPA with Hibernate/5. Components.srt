00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,840
We talked about tiers and layers,

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,860
and we've even started to allude to components inside of our application now, so

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,140
how do we represent these tiers with Spring and Spring MVC?

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,590
We do that using these three components.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,340
We have our controller, service, and our repository.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,640
We've already discussed controllers already, they just

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,140
route where we're going and interpret the user's request,

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,160
and then there's the service, and that's where our business logic goes.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,840
It should also be noted that it's where our transactions will likely start

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,240
if we're accessing more than one database table as well.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,150
And then there's repositories.

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,010
The repository tier is also sometimes referred to

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:50,000
as a data access object, or DAO, and they usually have a one‑to‑one mapping with our database table.
