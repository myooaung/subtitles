00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.680
Switching back to our IDE. If we exit full screen out of User.java and go

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.840
back over to src/main/resources/application.properties,

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:24.380
go to the end of our file and add in spring.jpa.generate‑ddl=true and

4
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:37.340
spring.jpa.hibernate‑ddl‑auto=create, and let's save this, and now what

5
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.900
it will do is it'll go through when the application starts up, it will

6
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.600
read our entities and look for the values inside of here and map them

7
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.030
back to a database table.

8
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.650
And it's going to do its best to guess what these types are and

9
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.270
what they should be mapped to in the database.

10
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:08.000
So it's going to look at the Long id, the String firstname, the string lastname, and the int age and map that to a user table for us.
