00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
After installing MySQL Workbench, the first screen that pulls up is this

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.070
MySQL Connections page. I'm going to click the plus sign. And inside of

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.400
here, it's almost already set up for me.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.500
I'm going to give it a name and just call it

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.990
conference. And it has a username of root.

6
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.030
It's telling me it's going to store it in the keychain. And I can

7
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.210
choose the default schema of conference as well,

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.720
although it's not created yet, and I'll click OK. Then once I click on it,

9
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.660
it will ask me to enter the password, and if you feel remember, we

10
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.920
put the password as pass in our dockerâ€‘compose file and choose to

11
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.440
save that password since this is on my local machine and click OK.

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:56.250
We're actually in the schema, connected to our Docker image that's running.

13
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650
If I click on Tables,

14
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:05.000
there's nothing there, and so there's nothing to be expanded and viewed upon yet. But that's what we're about to change.
