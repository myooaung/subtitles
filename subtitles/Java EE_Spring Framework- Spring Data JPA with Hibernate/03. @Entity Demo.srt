00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,340
I've closed all the files we had open and shut down our server from the

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,140
previous demo so we're starting with a clean IDE.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:15,620
Let's open up src/main/java and go down into our model package and

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:21,990
open up User. User is a pretty basic class right now,

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,640
we're going to continue to add stuff to it throughout the rest of this course.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:34,240
We can begin by going above the class markings and say @Entity

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,140
and choose the javax.persistence entity. And you'll notice

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,430
that we already have a red error, and if you hover over it,

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,140
it will tell you that it doesn't have a primary key designated in it.

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:55,420
So, let's go down to above the rest of the member variables and say @Id, and

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:02,940
choose the javax.persistence annotation and @GeneratedValue.

12
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,250
And we need to give it a field that it can tie to, so we want

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:14,140
to create a member variable of private Long,

14
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,740
and we'll just name it id.

15
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:26,840
We can go down below the rest of the variables and rightâ€‘click and say Generate,

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,640
Getter and Setter,

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,800
select id, and save this. And we've got everything set up

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,760
for this class to now tie to a user table,

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,000
but we haven't created that table yet. Let's talk about how we do that.
