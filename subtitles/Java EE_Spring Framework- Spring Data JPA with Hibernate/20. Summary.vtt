00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.060
We covered a lot of random things in this module.

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.120
We started off by looking at our database and how that's

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.860
going to integrate into our application.

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.340
We actually installed that database using Docker.

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.560
Quickly pointed out some Docker tips if you're not familiar with it,

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.440
maybe haven't used it before.

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.380
Talked about all of the legacy stuff that we could omit because Spring is

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.240
following the convention‑over‑configuration approach.

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.990
Added jars for JPA and MySQL to our application. Discussed

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.340
that transactions were actually implicit,

11
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.840
which is a key point because you used to have to explicitly include them.

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.820
Then we wrapped that all up with some tips and tricks that

13
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.040
help you learn JPA and Hibernate quicker.

14
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.170
We are now ready to dive into the meat of our course now,

15
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.840
which is creating our first entity and going through the

16
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.000
repositories and all of the tiers of our application so we really can just focus on business logic now.
