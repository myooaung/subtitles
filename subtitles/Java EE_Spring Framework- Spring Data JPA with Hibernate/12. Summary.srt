00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,840
So in this module, we covered setter injection and constructor

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,430
injection, we looked at code to see that it was all in basic POJOs under

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,750
the hood, and we looked at doing both methods using XML configuration,

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,740
as well as auto wiring using annotations.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,200
And lastly, we covered briefly the topic of context files, and it still

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,250
has to be initiated or started through a context file, except now we're

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,460
doing everything using Java configuration,

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,740
that's kind of a historical approach.

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,790
In the next module, we're going to walk through getting all of this

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:40,000
configured and into our application so you can see these principles we've talked about and now put them to use.
