1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:10,330
All right let's finish with the final and most exciting application of deep learning.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,320
Yes this is an application of deploying but I prefer to call it separately artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,000
Here we go.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,700
That's artificial intelligence.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,830
Well it's more fun and more exciting to call it artificial intelligence.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:28,720
But what it really is and that's why I'm also categorizing it as a deepening application.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,360
The other word for it the more technical term for it is deep reinforcement learning.

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,940
Basically you combine deep learning and reinforcement learning reinforcement learning is a branch of

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:47,050
science or branch of machinery which is the foundation of artificial intelligence all the artificial

10
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,260
intelligence we managed to build today are based on reinforcement learning.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,240
And when you add deeper into it your artificial intelligence is even more powerful.

12
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,320
So we can call it however you want artificial intelligence or deeper enforcement learning.

13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,660
But anyway that's the final and definitely most exciting application of deep learning.

14
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,520
So how could I introduce you to artificial intelligence.

15
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:20,020
Well first there is this one book that I more than anything recommend to start your journey in reinforcement

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,780
learning and that is I'm going to write it up.

17
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,120
I'm going to type it here.

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:32,300
Reinforcement learning an introduction that you can see this is one of the first suggestions.

19
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,140
So where is that book.

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,620
Well let's have a look at it on Amazon.

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:44,750
Here it is reinforcement learning an introduction adaptive station and machine learning series by Richard

22
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,090
as sudden.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,730
So this is a great book.

24
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,870
This will give you the right foundations of your intuition and understanding of reinforcement learning.

25
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,500
And I highly recommend it.

26
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,670
If you want to go far into artificial intelligence because even if this is the beginning of the journey

27
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,380
you must start well in order to become successful in this field.

28
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,420
And so that's the first step I recommend.

29
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:16,000
Definitely then the next steps to follow because I don't think a book is enough is to practice and to

30
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,950
practice you need to have the right environment to practice and there is an amazing environment for

31
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,720
this which was made by entrepreneurs like you know Musk and Peter Thiel.

32
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,440
This is opening a jim.

33
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,280
So that's the next thing I want to show you here.

34
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:36,350
Open a gym because it's hard to practice on artificial intelligence.

35
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,300
You know it's not like machine learning or the UCI and Mail repository which I'll show you in the next

36
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:50,240
section or the section on Python to practice making machine models on data sets here to practice doing

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,790
AI you need an environment with several things not only simple data in tables or C as follows.

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,700
Here you need an environment that includes input data and that can be some data in tables but that could

39
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,550
also be images.

40
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,870
Know I'll show you an example in the end and then you need to define a whole environment where you define

41
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,090
the actions that the eye can play.

42
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,150
The rewards that we give to the AI when it's successful and the rewards when we have to punish it because

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,720
you will see that it works on the trial and error process in which you know you give.

44
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,590
As I said a good word to the ear.

45
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,490
When it does what you want it to do and you punish it with a bad word when it fails at doing what you

46
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,470
wanted to do.

47
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,160
So that's what you have to define this whole environment with the input data the actions that he has

48
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,720
to play the rewards you want to give to the AI and other sorts of environments.

49
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,740
For example if you want to make a self-driving car well you will have to make an artificial intelligence

50
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,720
inside the car to make it self-drive well to do this you have to create the whole environment.

51
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,530
You have to create a map you have to create obstacles on the map.

52
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,100
You have to create basically an application in which you will try all this.

53
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,230
But the good news is that you don't have to do all this because here we go gym open.

54
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,100
I build some environments for you so that you don't have to make the environment and you just have to

55
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,380
build the artificial intelligence.

56
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,920
Then you can connect your artificial intelligence to the environment.

57
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,420
That's one example here.

58
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,780
And then you can test it out.

59
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,910
So there we go that's the best way to practice.

60
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,050
And now in order to get the knowledge and practice of artificial intelligence.

61
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,620
Well this book is a first step but definitely not enough.

62
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,890
You need to proceed with online courses so you have a lot of grades on and course on the Internet on

63
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,560
your Desailly on me or on yak's or Coursera.

64
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,470
We also offer an artificial intelligence course in which we do by the way some amazing and exciting

65
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,410
applications of AI.

66
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:58,150
We build a self-driving car in module 1 we build an area that plays the game of in 2 and a third AI

67
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,460
that plays the game of break out in modules 3 and the self-driving car.

68
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,230
We actually made the environments from scratch but the second modules Doman break out we use of course

69
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:16,370
this gym opening a gym platform to implement the AI because otherwise this would be a ton of work you

70
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,790
know to make all these environments.

71
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,070
All right.

72
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,630
So these are the first three steps.

73
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:27,750
First get this fundamental reinforcement learning introduction book then get familiar with the open

74
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:33,360
gym environment for future practice and eventually choose your favorite online course.

75
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,890
And now that's when things start to get interesting because the next steps for you now is to start the

76
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:45,590
real journey of artificial intelligence and this real journey comes in several steps.

77
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:52,400
First of all you're going to start with the basics of artificial intelligence which is learning that

78
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,660
artificial intelligence without any deep learning without any brain.

79
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:03,410
So it's like a combination of mathematics equations still based on this trial and error process you

80
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,260
know with good and bad words.

81
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,360
But without any brain executing the actions.

82
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,160
And that's the first step you need to understand really well.

83
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:20,480
Q learning because then the next step after cure learning is to combine Q learning with a brain.

84
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,930
You know we are adding a brain and that's where the burning comes into play.

85
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:32,950
Because by combining learning in deepening your AI becomes what we call a deep learning model and that's

86
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:38,100
the next step to understand and to know how to implement the deep Guler IMHO.

87
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,650
But the deep Killary model is the simplest deep reinforcement learning model that is the simplest neural

88
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,390
network implemented for an AI because it only has neurons.

89
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:55,460
Basically you only use a classic artificial neural network to build this AI.

90
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:02,140
And so basically this AI can only take some input data in the form of encoded data.

91
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,770
You know with numbers of vector of numbers that encodes what's happening inside the environment and

92
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:16,510
more precisely we say that it encodes a state of the environment which means that your AI is actually

93
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:23,560
blind because it couldn't execute some actions based on some visible real observations.

94
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,330
And therefore you guess what the next step is the next step is to add some eyes to the eye and some

95
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,490
eyes to the eye.

96
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,850
Well we need to add the convolutional layers in the artificial neural network and therefore your AI

97
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:44,860
becomes a deep convolutional Q learning model and that's really exciting because basically now you not

98
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:51,980
only have a visual neural network you have a convolutional neural network inside the brain of your AI.

99
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:57,760
And that's why with the eyes while your AI is able to see what's really happening in the environment

100
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:04,420
to execute the future actions which are predicted by the neural network following the convolutional

101
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,250
layers.

102
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,390
And that's already a big next step.

103
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,010
But then there is an even more advanced step which is to add something else.

104
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,220
Can you guess what it is.

105
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:20,610
Well again this is all about trying to mimic the processes of the brain trying to mimic the human intelligence.

106
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,670
And therefore we can add to it is some memory and therefore to do this you need to integrate what we

107
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:34,390
call an Ellas T.M. a record rence neural network inside the brain so that not only the brain of your

108
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,120
AI has eyes but also some memory.

109
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,240
And that becomes even more powerful and even more intelligent.

110
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:47,410
So you can add this memory and therefore your AI becomes a deep convolutional Alice.

111
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,140
Q learning model the name starts to become complicated doesn't it.

112
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:58,390
But that's what it is a deep convolutional A.P.M. Q learning model but that's not all there is even

113
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,110
another step again can you guess what it is.

114
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:09,740
Well the other step is to add something else that we humans also have which is a critic sense a critic

115
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,810
sense can be added to the AI and that's actually the most powerful a model you can implement today at

116
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:22,930
a time and speaking again in 2018 which is called the A-3 see as synchronous advantage.

117
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:31,060
As a critic agent because it not only has a brain with some eyes and some memory and some neurons predicting

118
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,780
the right actions to play but also there is also this other brain which we call the critic.

119
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:43,180
And that will basically bring this critic's sense to the action splayed and that adds even more power

120
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,470
to your AI.

121
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:51,160
So there we go that all the steps of the AI AI journey you need to go through the steps progressively.

122
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,350
And I highly recommend to not only try to understand them but to implement them.

123
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,720
Every single one of them and I'm sure there are a lot of great artificial intelligence courses on the

124
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,440
Internet.

125
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:07,360
But if you're interested in this path if you're interested in this journey that's exactly the approach

126
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,130
we take.

127
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:15,420
We build these successive steps of building an AI first a simple AI that has no brain.

128
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,100
Then we add a brain to this AI but only containing neurons.

129
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,880
Then we add some ice to the AI.

130
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,220
Then we add some memory to the AI and then we add a critical sense to the AI and we do that for very

131
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:34,510
exciting applications such as a self-driving car smashing doom or smashing the game of breakout and

132
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,510
now we're going to finish this tutorial on an exciting note.

133
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,130
Let's watch these two AI's playing Doom and break.

134
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,100
Remember for Doom it's going to be a deep convolutional cool learning and for Breakout it's going to

135
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,190
be a Nathu DC as synchronous advantage.

136
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,930
Active critic and Joe the show.
