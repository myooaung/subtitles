00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.650
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial.

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.540
So you just saw what deep learning looks like with Curiel.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.440
And now I'm going to proceed with the applications of deep learning.

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.480
And there are two main applications.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.700
The first one is computer vision.

6
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.410
We apply deep breathing techniques to make a computer recognize objects faces or any kind of features

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.080
on videos or images or even webcams.

8
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.340
You know you can apply computer vision for streaming images and that's a big first application and there's

9
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.300
some amazing models implemented for computer vision and I'm going to talk about them in this tutorial.

10
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.740
And then the second big application of deep learning is now you know when you apply deep learning to

11
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.600
text.

12
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.880
So for example it can be applied to speech recognition can be applied to machine translation but of

13
00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:02.500
course the best and the most powerful application of DBAN LP is definitely chapbooks you can build a

14
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.730
chat but by combining deep learning and a.p.

15
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.560
So I will talk about DeBerry and hope in the next Doyle so I'll say much more on this.

16
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.420
But today in this is oil I'll talk about this first application of deepening computer vision.

17
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.690
So what should I start by saying well this is an introduction to the science course so of course the

18
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.640
first thing I'm going to tell you is the first step if by any chance you're interested in going into

19
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.570
that field and the first step is to start with a computer vision model that is either not based on deep

20
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:42.370
learning and that is open city that is the heart Cascades detectors so you probably have heard of this

21
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.930
amazing confusion library which is called Open City but I'm telling you the open city library is far

22
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.770
from being the best computer vision models used today.

23
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.700
And 2018 at the time I'm speaking.

24
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.940
But it's good to start with this because this is the simplest moral.

25
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.950
It's very easy to understand and this will warm you up for the real deal that is deep learning.

26
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.610
So start with open sea you have a lot of documentation online you have amazing courses on the Internet.

27
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.140
We have a deep learning and computer vision course that introduces you to open TV and actually we build

28
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.050
a model based on open city to recognize eyes noses and mouth and even a smile.

29
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.900
We make a smell detector with open the store with this.

30
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.900
And then once you're ready to take it to the next level well jump into deep and computer vision.

31
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.570
And so now let's talk about this.

32
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.450
What is deep learning combined in computer vision.

33
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.240
Well I have to mention three models three major and powerful deep computer vision models.

34
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.440
The first one is the SSD single shot multi box detector.

35
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.760
This is one of my favorites and this is one of the most powerful.

36
00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.120
It can detect basically any object on a video or on some images or even on your webcam.

37
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.070
You know I made an application last year I had my camera at the top of my car on my way down to Malibu

38
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.800
and just what fun I was trying to detect the cars around me the persons and other types of objects and

39
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.360
this works very well even if the car is not that close to you.

40
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.940
And so the as is deemed inundations are not that abundant on the Internet.

41
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.340
The good news is that we make one in deeper than computer vision course so feel free to check it out.

42
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.050
I'm sure there are some other great courses that implement this as well.

43
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.460
But if you trust us we show you how to use it and how to have fun with it.

44
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.040
And by the way at the end of this oil I will show you a very nice video we took as input as is the model

45
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.800
of our deep learning and computer vision course so that will be the end.

46
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:54.730
And now let's move on to the second amazing DPN computer vision model which is the yellow V-2 the yellow

47
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.600
v2 is for some people even better than the SSD.

48
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.240
It is not implemented in our and computer vision course so feel free to check out some other courses.

49
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.310
But since it is not implemented right now I'm going to walk you through some amazing Ullevi to documentation

50
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.130
so that you can check it out and maybe later if you're interested in that field.

51
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.400
Compare these two miles.

52
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.130
All right so here I'm on Google.

53
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.270
Let's type here.

54
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.820
Yolo V-2 exactly that you know V-2 that's Precentor.

55
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.880
And there we go.

56
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.930
So I recommend to check out the first link first because indeed this is an amazing condition with by

57
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.860
the way an amazing video here we can check it out if you want let's watch it for two seconds.

58
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.570
I think this is one of the James Bond movies.

59
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.790
I'm going to watch this

60
00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:00.050
you can see it detects all the persons even umbrellas even some chairs.

61
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.730
You know it detects everything and very fast with very fat even the size.

62
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.330
No this guy was identified as diet.

63
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.560
I don't know if you can hear me but basically we can see the power of this yellow V-2 the infantry division.

64
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.350
This is quite amazing even motorbikes cars everything so very powerful that I'm going to press pause

65
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.560
now.

66
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.400
But you definitely know how to check it out.

67
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.600
So YOLO v2.

68
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.850
And I think you even have the video on YouTube to check it out.

69
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.960
It's quite intense.

70
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.510
And also at the end I'll show you a demo of the model which was a video made in our deep computer vision

71
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.520
course.

72
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.860
All right.

73
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.110
So that's it.

74
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.440
That's it for the second show YOLO v2.

75
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.430
And now the third amazing computer vision model.

76
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.450
And actually we shouldn't call this computer vision mode but computer creation model because this is

77
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:59.610
a model with which you can take some images as input and then create the same images but completely

78
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.140
designed by the computer.

79
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.180
And that at the pixel level.

80
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.660
For example if I show you these two persons would you say there are real persons.

81
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.610
Well probably yes or probably not because you know I'm going right now but you are really looking at

82
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.800
human beings.

83
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.400
But that's actually not right.

84
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.030
We're not looking at human beings.

85
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.930
We're looking at some people created by a computer thanks to a computer vision model or more correctly

86
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.440
a computer creation model.

87
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.260
And these are the Gannes generative either social networks a super powerful DeBerry all applied for

88
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:40.800
computer vision computer creation and also you have the most advanced implementation of these gangs

89
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.080
because they have several versions which are the cycle.

90
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.370
So if you really want to go that far in that field you have to go up to the cycle Ganns.

91
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.920
And you know it's not like this deep computer vision model took a face and then replace some eyes.

92
00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:03.150
No it created these human faces at the pixel level by assembling the pixels in the right way to create

93
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.330
an image that looks like a human face.

94
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.590
So that's pretty amazing.

95
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.470
And that's my four recommendations.

96
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.110
If you're interested in that field.

97
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.320
So let's summarize it first.

98
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:21.860
Start with open city then check Yelton parallel as is the single shut multi-post detector and the yellow

99
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.610
V-2 and eventually check out the Gannes generative everso networks.

100
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.560
And if you really want to go far check out the cycle again.

101
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.510
All right so that's it.

102
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.090
I hope this is an introduction to deepen division that suits you.

103
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.880
And now as promised I'm going to finish with this very exciting video of one of my favorite places in

104
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.500
the world.

105
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.070
Monument Valley and this is a video on which we apply the computer vision model.

106
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.250
Single Shot multi box detector and Justitia.
