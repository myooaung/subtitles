1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,190
It all goes back to the interesting data science course we're in the visualization part.

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:15,790
And right now we're looking at the month variable and whether or not there is some correlation between

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:22,110
in which month we contacted people and their likelihood to take up our term deposit offer.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,820
We already create this recession in the previous tutorial but we haven't discussed it yet.

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,790
And plus you had some homework to grade the following three variables housing day a week and the outcome.

6
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,940
So we really got them created here and we'll look at them in a second but for now let's discuss month.

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,480
So what's the first thing that stands out.

8
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,520
First thing that should have stood out when you were looking at this election is that somehow we only

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,860
have 10 months January and February completely dropped out of this election.

10
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,390
They're not here.

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,790
So first thing we look at is filters.

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:01,930
There are no filters on so that means they're probably not even in the database or in the data set.

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,520
And so what's in a proper entend data science project we do at this stage is we would actually go back

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,420
to the original data source and make sure that we haven't lost any data along the way because it's quite

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,340
strange that January-February are here and so don't worry a very double check.

16
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,600
I checked the original data source and data set and we truly don't have January and February in there.

17
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,920
And so now we just have to try to understand why.

18
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:35,610
So the next thing is we discussed that we're not going to look at December because it looks like it's

19
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,890
not really statistically significant.

20
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,750
It's about 89 93 here compared to you know like we've got a lot more variables in other ones.

21
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:50,400
And so this could be a random effect that it's like almost you know half the people we contacted in

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,510
December decided to take up the trial because it could be a random effect because it's not a statistically

23
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,830
significant result most likely and therefore we're not going to look at it.

24
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:04,740
And again this illustrates the importance of statistics or just basic understanding of statistics in

25
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,530
data centers.

26
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:12,300
And this actually gives us a clue as to why January February might not be available either.

27
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:21,630
The thing is that people spend a lot of money on Christmas New Year's and other holiday presents during

28
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:28,680
the December festive season and that's why in December they're kind of like saving up money in order

29
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,040
to spend it on the presents and then in general if they simply don't have that money until they get

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,030
paid.

31
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,430
Several times from their job.

32
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,370
So they get paid for January and then they have to pay off their credit cards.

33
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,020
February is usually the worst month for retail and you you get to see that in practice as you do.

34
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,010
There are science projects in the retail industry you see that a huge dip in February in terms of sales

35
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,490
because people are still paying off their credit from December.

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,960
And maybe that's exactly the reason why this bank is not proposing these products to their customers

37
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,740
in January and February simply because a term deposit requires a customer to put it away put money into

38
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,930
the bank for six months or 12 months or 24 months for a fixed period of time.

39
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,780
And then which they cannot touch the money in that time.

40
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,130
In exchange they get good.

41
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,110
In exchange they get a good interest rate.

42
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,360
And so maybe the bank has already figured it out.

43
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,170
That said Janet Hembree I really not the best months to contact people.

44
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,650
And as you can see maybe they've also thought the same about December that there's quiet.

45
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,470
You know that's why they didn't do a lot of contacts.

46
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,390
And so that that could be one that could be the reason why Jennifer Bernardin here.

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,230
And now let's have a look at the other months.

48
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,130
What did you discover here about the other months.

49
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:52,500
Well we can see that the sell the term deposits in March are quite high although people who took up

50
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:00,750
the offer was probably the highest month maybe the reason here is that people actually got paid and

51
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,930
now they have some money they've saved up.

52
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,130
They have been buying presents and so on and they're willing to invest it in to make some interest and

53
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,620
then make some interest what else we can see that April kind of drops off.

54
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,050
Maybe it's because a lot of people invested in March and others is they don't have enough money to do

55
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,640
that again.

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,650
May I'm not really sure about May.

57
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,820
Why so low.

58
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,600
June July August outside is probably because of the summer holidays and people maybe in May.

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,990
People are saving up to go for a trip in the summer holidays and that's why it's low.

60
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,270
And then summer holidays.

61
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,490
June July August people are just not at home or that's not what they're really worrying about they're

62
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,320
spending time with the family if the kids are going somewhere and then it goes back up in September

63
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:51,660
because everybody's back and now they're you know kind of like starting a new educational year in terms

64
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,250
of school.

65
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,570
But like the adults the parents bring their kids back and you know maybe they're rethinking their finances

66
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,940
October.

67
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,540
Again similar on kind of like in that sense.

68
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,000
But then November drop's.

69
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,680
Why would a member drop Well similar to this situation that they're probably setting up for December

70
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,210
to spend money there.

71
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,220
Again we're not looking at this at all.

72
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,520
So they probably spring up for December and also in November we have Black Friday right.

73
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,730
So in Black Friday people spend a bit of money and that's another reason.

74
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,420
So there you go.

75
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:26,290
That's as an example of how interesting designs can be like we're looking at a picture but we're applying

76
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,050
so much other knowledge right away to assess why this is happening.

77
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:37,620
And the other thing I wanted to point out here as well is that these effects they are not like they

78
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,160
are not secluded right.

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,920
So there's also other variables and the combination what we're seeing here are people taking up this

80
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:51,730
term deposit is also affected by the variables and you know Carol that nobody is guaranteed that for

81
00:05:51,730 --> 00:06:01,090
instance I don't know the marital status of people we're contacting is consistently the percentage of

82
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,990
you know married versus divorced versus single.

83
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,680
It's consistent across the months maybe in March.

84
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,480
We just contacted more single people for some reason.

85
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,750
So there might be some correlation between the variables and that can be affecting these outcomes so

86
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,330
that's just something else to keep in mind we're not going to delve into that.

87
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,710
Just wanted to put that caveat out there that there are other things to consider.

88
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:31,510
And that comes with like additional statistical information knowledge or when you apply machine learning

89
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:38,890
but through basic visual analysis you can already get some valuable insights that's you know like you

90
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:44,950
can really say that some months like March September or October are most likely better than the other

91
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,880
ones.

92
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,620
All right.

93
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:52,810
So let's have a look at these other variables so housing you probably if you did this very well you

94
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,780
probably saw that there's not much effect here.

95
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,410
Nothing to talk about day of week.

96
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,280
Similar.

97
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,370
Not much effect.

98
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,930
The 2 percent difference even though you know eight hundred and nine hundred fifty three The difference

99
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,000
is so little it's only 2 percent.

100
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,500
And the number of people like in order to for that to be statistically significant.

101
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:18,820
I'll just give you like a quick quick insight into the world of stats for that to be statistically significant

102
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,500
between 2 and 10 percent.

103
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,660
The number would have to be in observations in each of these cases would have to be much greater than

104
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,480
it is now.

105
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:34,250
So even though they are high they are not high enough to prove that this 2 percent difference is that

106
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,110
this is significant.

107
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:42,010
So what we would conclude from here would say that there's not enough evidence to suggest anything about

108
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,120
about day of week.

109
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,980
So basically hour any day of the week you contact them.

110
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:52,930
They're same there's the same likelihood of getting that term deposit and the outcome.

111
00:07:53,470 --> 00:08:01,120
So here we've got an interesting example right so here we've got a huge difference.

112
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,410
Right.

113
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:14,260
So if if we if we contacted them before and it was a successful campaign IPO outcome is what is the

114
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,870
outcome outcome of the previous marketing campaign.

115
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:23,320
So if it was a successful marketing campaign previously then this time they are more likely to subscribe

116
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,760
to take that term deposit.

117
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,110
Sixty five percent chance that they will take.

118
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,990
So that's a huge gold nugget we found in there is kind of expected.

119
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,690
Right so if a person already said yes to our product or a product before then they kind of like maybe

120
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,800
they're loyal to us.

121
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,050
They they like our bank and so on.

122
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,610
So they are probably going to say yes again.

123
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,110
So it was expected but this percentage really high 65 percent so that's really good.

124
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:55,060
So something to point out if and then this one is interesting if we didn't contact them before if we

125
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,990
didn't even approach them at all then the percentage is 9 percent.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,220
But if we contacted them and we failed and they didn't take up the offer the percentage is 14 percent

127
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,560
and the numbers are quite high.

128
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,540
Six hundred and so there can be something going on here.

129
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,460
And so that's very interesting because I would expect the opposite.

130
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:21,130
I would expect if you failed to contact if you failed to sell them something before then you're not

131
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,770
likely to sell them something again this time and maybe people who you haven't approached at all then

132
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,110
you're more likely there but in reality as we can see is actually it's better to contact people who

133
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,330
we've failed to sell something to before then people we haven't contacted at all.

134
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,970
So basically you would contact them and this or you would contact people who you've successfully sold

135
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,130
to before then you'd contact people who you unsuccessfully sold to before and then only you would spend

136
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:53,530
your time and resources and energy contacting people who you haven't contacted yet before.

137
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,090
Interesting insights so this was expected this was probably unexpected.

138
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,270
You always obviously check test the statistical significance there.

139
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,620
But again we're not going to go into that looks looks kind of OK.

140
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:12,000
But obviously before presenting this to an executive you would make sure that it's statistically significant.

141
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,910
It's just a very simple calculation that has to be done.

142
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,540
So there we go.

143
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,370
That's that's some insights into some of the other variables.

144
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:29,590
All right so hopefully you had similar results and we're going to stop this tutorial here because there

145
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,080
was quite a lot of information.

146
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,470
And yeah and also on the next.

147
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,740
Until then enjoy that sense.
