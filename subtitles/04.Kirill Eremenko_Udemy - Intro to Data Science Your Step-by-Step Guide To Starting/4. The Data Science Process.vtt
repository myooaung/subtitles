00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.200
Hello and welcome back to intro Today it's nice.

2
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.970
And today we're talking about the data science process.

3
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.580
So let's have a look.

4
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.390
First of all why is it important for us to look into the data process.

5
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:29.530
Well at this stage it is important to take a step back and have a bigger picture view of what is going

6
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.710
on in the space of data science or how it all fits in to the end to end process when you do.

7
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.460
So basically what this whole concept is there is science process describes is that in any data science

8
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.750
project there will be phases there'll be steps that you perform or stages of that that process all of

9
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.850
that project's lifecycle.

10
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.750
And if you understand these phases Well if you understand what they're all about then all of the different

11
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.470
components of data science whether it's attestations or zation machine learning all of these will fit

12
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.940
in very well into this process and you understand why exactly you need to learn them.

13
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.530
And also at which point in time to apply.

14
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.290
So let's go through this process step by step.

15
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:27.050
The first step is very important and it's often missed by the scientists and even by resources you'll

16
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.710
find online.

17
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.830
They often don't mention and that person even made the same mistake for a long time until a certain

18
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.250
stage in my career.

19
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.840
So the first step is called identify the question.

20
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.620
This is the stage where you need to spend some time to consciously go and talk to stakeholders of your

21
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:52.710
project and ask them what exactly do they want from this project what exactly are they after what other

22
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.000
questions they're trying to answer and what are the questions they're not trying to answer.

23
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.900
And at the end of the day you need to get their agreement to the scope of the project in writing in

24
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.810
order to safeguard yourself from scope creep down the line if you commit to a certain project you don't

25
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.600
want that project to explode to 10 tons of size just because people want more and more and more answers

26
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.720
and more insights.

27
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.120
And that's why this step is very important first of all to identify the question so you know exactly

28
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.180
what you're looking for rather than just diving straight into it into the data without having an idea

29
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.270
of what you're after.

30
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.200
And at the same time you want others to agree to that to that scope.

31
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.680
And also I get to point out how long approximately I think these stages should take.

32
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.920
And that's mostly based on my experience and experience of other data scientists.

33
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.800
So if you're doing a science project and two and then this first stage I identify the question should

34
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.000
probably take about 10 percent of your time.

35
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.620
Next is another important stage which is called prepare the data.

36
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.770
You need to take the data get it from wherever it is stored.

37
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.620
Ask the client if you're working as a consultant or find it internally and talk to the right person

38
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.590
in the right department get it clean it prepared for analysis check that it's complete.

39
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:26.790
Look for anomalies fix them and then of course do some Q&amp;A for the data and this part of the design

40
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.960
process is actually one of the toughest parts and one of the most tedious and some days I really don't

41
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.950
enjoy going through these steps but at the same time they're very necessary and it takes up 70 percent

42
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.590
of the data science project.

43
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.560
That's why for instance knowing how to work with databases is an important very important skill and

44
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.700
also statistics is important because you can look at the distributions of your data and then you know

45
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.320
how to deal with anomalies and things like that so data preparation is very important.

46
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.910
Also visual data mining can help you out here as well.

47
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.920
So that's the first two stages.

48
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.630
Next stage is called analyze the data.

49
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.770
This is the fun stuff.

50
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.250
This is where you get to apply machine learning.

51
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.980
Again you can apply visual data mining you build models you run takes and lyrics and lots of other really

52
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.540
cool and fun things.

53
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.640
And the best part is if you've done the data preparation well and you don't have to go back and fix

54
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.350
the data all the time if everything is set in the first two stages and you know what you're looking

55
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.710
for you've identified the question then analyzing data shouldn't take that long either takes about another

56
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.230
10 percent of your time.

57
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.000
So funnily enough you know what the whole hype of data science is about the animal and the analytics

58
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.700
part is actually only 10 percent of the time you spend there.

59
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.720
That number might vary some might give it up to 20 or more.

60
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.390
But again if you've done everything before correctly this should be a piece of cake.

61
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.200
It should be very very quick compared to the data at the site.

62
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.970
But at the same time much more fun.

63
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.400
Next stage is visualizing the data.

64
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.510
And that is another very important part.

65
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.390
One thing is to find the inside.

66
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:21.840
Another thing is to present the insights in a more friendly way and a more approachable way for anybody

67
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.450
that's where viz. skills come into play.

68
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.520
This is a different type of isolation from the ones that we've mentioned before so you have visualisation

69
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.930
for data mining which is helpful with stages 2 and 3 where you're exploring the data you're trying to

70
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:46.410
get inside this type of zation Part 4 is the visualization where you actually did build the image or

71
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.890
the dashboard or the storyline and things like that.

72
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.280
So in order to communicate in size.

73
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.240
And this takes how much time.

74
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.000
Well it takes about another 10 percent of the time.

75
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.220
And so by now you're probably wondering if you've been following along.

76
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.410
We've already taken up this 10 plus 70 plus 10 plus then we've taken up all 100 percent of the time

77
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.350
where is where we're going to find more time for the last part and last part for Thurso's fight or what

78
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.160
it's called.

79
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.250
It's called present your findings.

80
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:27.840
This is the part where you need to communicate your results to your audience to communicate your results

81
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.260
to the stakeholders the CEO the manager the board of directors the customers their clients whoever you

82
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:40.200
are whoever was the person that asked you or the team that asked you to work on this you need to explain

83
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:47.610
the insides and what they mean what actions they might imply or where they might recommend for the business

84
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.920
what actions those insights might recommend for the business.

85
00:06:52.920 --> 00:07:00.270
You need to explain that and need to explain in a very approachable manner and in a way to quote Our

86
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.340
mission as a science.

87
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:07.050
You need to make the complex simple for them and you know it might look like this takes up 0 percent

88
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.680
of the time.

89
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.940
No it actually takes up 80 percent of the time.

90
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:19.780
Another 80 percent went like this is a very representative diagram in terms of percentage of time.

91
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.570
Very representative in the sense that how they decide to think about it they think OK I'll get the project

92
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.510
done everything's finished.

93
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.770
I visualize the data.

94
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.200
OK.

95
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.470
Hundred percent of the work.

96
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.950
And that's where the 80 percent unexpectedly creeps up and I actually had a podcast on the superintends

97
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.410
Science Show with ya'll ton think it was Episode 10.

98
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:47.400
He was a very dear colleague of mine back in the day and I considered him my mentor when we work together

99
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.130
and we actually discussed this.

100
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.790
And since then I call this phenomenon the 80 20 80 rule of Jau.

101
00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.810
The reason for that is that the first two parts these two parts they take up 80 percent then these two

102
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.600
parts.

103
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.660
The preparation basically takes up 80 percent the analysis and the position takes 20 percent.

104
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.280
And that's what usually data scientists refer to when they say 80:20 that this takes 80 percent this

105
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.090
takes 20.

106
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:16.350
But if you take into account how long it takes to present your findings that's an additional 80 percent

107
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:22.860
that you were not expecting to spend so budget that it's all over long this part will take you an extra

108
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.670
80 percent.

109
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:29.670
You need to spend on figuring out how to communicate your insides and then actually communicating them

110
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:37.150
and following through with helping people follow through with all your findings and implementing them.

111
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:43.540
So there you go that's the lifecycle of a science project or otherwise known as the data science process.

112
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.940
You might find different versions of this on line.

113
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.130
This version is our version.

114
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:55.050
What we've come to over the years of experience in dealing with data science again knowing this will

115
00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:00.450
help you keep the bigger picture in mind and understand where all the other components of the designs

116
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.710
will fit in.

117
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.760
I hope you enjoy Teresa Tauriel and I look forward to seeing them.

118
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.810
Until then enjoy their designs.
