00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:11,460
Welcome back into today to science today we're taking our first step in the Ultimate Guide to the data

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,730
science and the first step is statistics.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:22,580
So you've got a pleasant image of a normal distribution which in my imagination is a classic I can of

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,130
statistics.

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:31,320
And so the question is why are we starting our very first step into the world of data sets with statistics.

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,370
And moreover it will be even more confusing if you've already taken any of our other courses because

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,740
you've probably heard me say there that you don't need to know statistics to be a data scientist is

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,640
that counter intuitive.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,430
Isn't that contradictory even that on one hand I'm saying that we don't need to know statistics theory

10
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,910
is just on the other hand.

11
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,830
The first step in our journey is statistics.

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,740
Well the answer is quite simple.

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:08,140
I truly believe that you don't need to be an expert in statistics or know it in depth to be a data scientist.

14
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:14,360
In fact you don't even need to know most of the statistical concepts that people think you should know

15
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,160
or people spend a lot of time learning in preparation for becoming a data scientist.

16
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:26,180
The thing is that historically it so happened that people are quite a have this attachment to the thought

17
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:33,500
that data science and statistics are similar or similar or even the same thing and that some people

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,340
think of data scientists statisticians of their sides as actuaries.

19
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:47,140
And while historically indeed a big component of data science came from the world shows us that this

20
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:54,170
sticks with time it has the science has evolved so much and has taken on so many things from different

21
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,000
industries and from different professions that it is very very different now.

22
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,230
And you can still have that logic that logic no longer applies.

23
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:09,350
There are parts of the signs where indeed you will need statistics like if you're doing research in

24
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,030
machine learning or if you're doing quite advanced things in the space of health for instance.

25
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,660
But there are lots of other component or other types of datasets like visual or that sort of visual

26
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:30,260
data mining or maybe just a deep learning in application rather than going in-depth into declaring there's

27
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:37,720
lots of areas of science where you can do all that very in-depth statistical knowledge.

28
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:45,890
Now having said that I really also need to point out that statistics is of the core fundamentals of

29
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,100
statistics are going to be helpful for us starting data scientists because that will prevent a lot of

30
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,940
mistakes.

31
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:59,450
So that's why we're putting statistics as the first step in our guide because if you get to grips with

32
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:08,000
just the basic easy principles of statistics like just having that mindset of life for instance what

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,010
is a statistical significant result.

34
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:17,300
What is it will prevent you from for example reporting to your manager something that is completely

35
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,310
statistically insignificant.

36
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,530
Things like that are indeed important.

37
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,450
That's why we've put it here.

38
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,430
So let's have a look at the list and I'll be a bit clearer from there.

39
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:33,590
So statistics fundamentals the eight things we feel we think are important for a data scientist who

40
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,090
knows statistics.

41
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:41,570
Number one is distributions and it has some subcategories here normal distribution standard deviation

42
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,480
mean median mode types of distributions.

43
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,350
Number two is the central limit theorem.

44
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:52,940
Then my theory is hypothesis testing which has a score and T-test which we've identified as important.

45
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,140
Number four is statistical significance and Pyu values.

46
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,920
Number five is confidence intervals.

47
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,560
Six is AB testing and seven principle the 80 20 rule.

48
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,520
That's also known as that.

49
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,230
And number eight is Law of Large Numbers.

50
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,300
That's my favorite line.

51
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:17,640
So those are things that we think are important in data science inlike not advanced mystical.

52
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,750
But just general data science in terms of the stakes.

53
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:28,610
And now I want to apply what I said before that even out of these not everything is is absolutely necessary

54
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,330
to get started.

55
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,670
Like you can get really stuck trying to learn all of these and master them it'll take you a couple of

56
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:40,220
months or you know at least a couple of weeks to get your head around these properly and be using them

57
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,940
efficiently.

58
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,370
We followed having you know like reference materials and things like that.

59
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:52,580
So even out of these We're going to point out three the top three that you really should look into before

60
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,870
proceeding with the next step in your data science guide.

61
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:02,150
And the top three in our opinion are distributions and just the parts of what you need to know what

62
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,690
a normal distribution is.

63
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,610
A standard deviation is you need to be able tell the mean median mode from each other especially when

64
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,490
there's a skewness and distribution then you need to know about statistical significance and P-value

65
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,100
is very important because it again helps prevent reporting on things that are not statistically significant

66
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,890
and therefore driving bad business decisions or bad insights.

67
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:33,660
And finally AB testing it's it is important many industries whether it's marketing online marketing

68
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,410
or whether it's the health industry and so on.

69
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:42,320
And from there it builds the right mindset for comparing side by side different results so that's also

70
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,060
important.

71
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,170
And all of these are quite simple.

72
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,200
You can really get the grips of these things in a couple of days.

73
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,860
You can understand them.

74
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,190
And the main point is not to become an expert but to build the right mindset around them and they will

75
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:56,790
help you.

76
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:02,550
Going forward will just help you think differently about all of the data that you're looking at about

77
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,810
all of the lyrics about all of that insight.

78
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,790
And that's what we mean when we say that statistics is a good first step.

79
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,290
It's not a good first step if you're going to dive into it and spend five months learning it is a good

80
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,210
first step if you're going to spend a couple of days just to refresh your knowledge if you've known

81
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,610
if you knew these things back in junior high school or to learn them afresh if you didn't know.

82
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,730
And I didn't even point of law Ledger numbers even those my or my favorite of all of them because you

83
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,580
can still get by even knowing that.

84
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,210
So there we go.

85
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,740
That's the world of statistics.

86
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,170
And there is a list for you to look into and depending on how deep you want to go you can look into

87
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,790
more or less points out there and I'll see you back here next time.

88
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,860
Until then enjoy design's.
