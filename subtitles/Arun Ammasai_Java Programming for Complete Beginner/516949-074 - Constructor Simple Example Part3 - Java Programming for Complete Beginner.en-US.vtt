00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.005
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:01.845
Welcome back.

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:06.990
So we know how the contractor will walk so far, right?

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.225
So how the default constructor will be called while creating.

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:16.800
And we know that and we have seen some simple example also.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.420
So now what you're going to do,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:27.030
we're going to create an example to show you how we can use parameterized constructor.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.160
So I'm going to create

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.020
another class file which

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:40.450
contains constructor.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.370
Got it.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.915
So, so what are the first thing we would decide?

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:54.460
Let's declare some members are variables.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.805
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to provide in mobile number.

00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:04.460
And I'm going to have a string.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.970
Okay, So I heard two data members here, which is a variable.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.830
So now I need to create a constructor,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.265
but I'm not going to use a default

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:25.830
because I want my one constructor are customized constructor.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.275
So how we can do that?

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:29.405
So here I have two inputs, right?

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:35.570
I'm going to create a constructor which will lower right, this particular data.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.540
Okay, so what are the plasma and the first rule?

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.270
The contract that does not have any return type,

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.875
so it's a class name.

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:45.140
And we are going to write,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.700
this is a default constructor, right?

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.780
So now what we're gonna do,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.230
We're going to bed.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.925
I'm, it arrives to this particular condition.

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:59.240
So I'm going to use my mobile number also, person name.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.755
So int, mobile and command string name.

00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:09.020
So basically what we will do,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.480
this particular constructor is called from our main method.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.365
And then we will do some operations.

00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:19.325
Okay, let's go to the main.

00:02:19.325 --> 00:02:20.675
Let's create a main maternal.

00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:23.510
Still we have something else to do it. We'll do it.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.470
Okay, So how we will create an object for a new class, correct?

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.590
The class namespace and object name or really blame or reference name objects.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.155
Neil, when you provide the new keyword,

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:44.090
the center will be called.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.545
Okay?

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:48.620
But now you end up with an issue

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.340
because you have a constructor which contains parameterized.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.125
But there is no.

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:55.925
Normally when I do this,

00:02:55.925 --> 00:03:01.790
we will not get any error because by default every class has its one default constructor.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.675
But when you explicitly provide you won't constructor,

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:08.120
the default constructor will not be visible.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.550
So in order to use that,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.470
you need to create a default constructor here specifically or explicitly.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.005
Okay, so now I don't want to use the default constructor.

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:23.030
I want to use this particular chapter so I could learn

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.165
new keyword and we're using the new keyword I'm calling parametrized constructor here,

00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:30.650
which accepts two inputs.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.155
So basically what we call a matter,

00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:34.805
if it has some input parameter,

00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:36.155
you need to pass the data, right?

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:37.970
So here you need to pass two inputs.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.950
The first one is a mobile number, 987, okay,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:52.620
this is my mobile number and then name, surname is hops.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.570
So now the error is gone because I'm calling which contains two input parameters.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.680
So now what we're going to do, okay,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.210
So the last example,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.250
the default drew default constructor.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.780
We overwrite the data.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.760
So now we're going to use the same way,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.360
but we will receive the data to the constructor.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.450
So we can simply robbery whatever we did in the previous example,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.625
we're going to do the same thing, right?

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:25.595
So this dot, this dot number,

00:04:25.595 --> 00:04:27.200
I'm going to offer them mobile number.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.270
It is passed from here.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.950
Correct. It's come through this mobile and then this dot name.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.380
So person m is equal to I'm going to,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:49.115
to the person and with this particular name because this data has been passed from here.

00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:54.680
Okay, So even you can do the same way how we did in the previous example.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.625
Okay, but this is even better way to do that.

00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:02.525
Because whoever is, because when you're using this particular construct, our,

00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:06.545
whoever is trying to call the contract or everyone is getting the same outcome,

00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:08.150
which is a drawback, right?

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.520
So even if when you call my contract,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.680
when you integrate object for my class,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.330
you get the same job.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.650
You will come to Java basics.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.555
When someone else create the object,

00:05:17.555 --> 00:05:20.645
they also get welcomed to Java basics,

00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:22.685
but that is not the right way to do it.

00:05:22.685 --> 00:05:26.114
So this is an even better way, are more efficiently.

00:05:26.114 --> 00:05:28.600
I have my one parameter Spencer Hoover is called.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.640
They will pass their own data.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.625
All right, so now what I'm gonna do,

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.175
let's print the data flow.

00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:43.765
So object dot mobile number

00:05:43.765 --> 00:05:48.655
and object dot person name.

00:05:48.655 --> 00:05:52.270
So now we can render God run it.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.890
You should be able to see the person mobile number and the person in.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.360
So this is our Unity.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.104
Use the parameterized constructor.

00:06:01.104 --> 00:06:01.705
Okay?

00:06:01.705 --> 00:06:03.280
So even here, okay,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.710
I want to call my default constructor what you can do.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.070
Simple thing, just create a constructor here, which contents no.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.055
Input parameter is nothing but parameter constructor.

00:06:13.055 --> 00:06:21.110
Okay, so the object creations control dot OBJ r1 is equal to new parameter constructor.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.010
Now it'll work initially it was throwing an error when I'm doing it here.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.060
The reason that time I did not have my default constructor.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.350
Got it.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.265
Let's see each other next video and we're gonna talk about the another important concept.

00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:35.760
Thank you.
