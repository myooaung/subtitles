X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Okay, so let's go back and create these changes,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.695
like creating interface which contains static and default method.

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:10.785
So let's go back to our ID.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:15.270
So the first thing we're going to create a new example, right?

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.740
So n, I'm going to create a new class now.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.390
So in the class name is interface.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.090
Java 8.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.470
Interface changes.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.925
Tell me whether in it.

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:41.000
Okay, so now we have a Java interface changes glass here.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.205
So now we're going to create interfaces.

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:43.925
Okay?

00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:46.190
So we can create it here itself.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.160
So interface and open, close brackets.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.080
So when you're getting into,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.970
we're going to provide a proper interface name, right?

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.275
So here I'm what I'm gonna do.

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:55.835
So I'll use animal.

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:59.180
So so interphase animal,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.970
I think we already have a class chemical animal and animal one.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.490
So let's use animals for us animals.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:19.110
Okay, So it contains a method called wide make noise.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.680
Okay? So normally we don't have a method definitions here.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.775
Correct?

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:32.255
But here we can have metal definitions like but if you provide my implementations,

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:34.850
it has to be dv what Australia debited change,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.910
okay, lives have a default matter, default wide.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.910
So I'm going to borrow or something like this message

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:57.630
from default method. Okay?

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.260
So now we get one abstract method and one default method,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.620
which is just not possible before Java

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.370
it we can have unlimited declaration, not the implementation.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.945
From Java 8 onwards,

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:14.285
you can have a method with the implementation,

00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:17.540
but the method should be default or static.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.940
So let's display static for now.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.660
I mean the default. So now what I'm gonna do,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.150
I'm gonna create them one more class here.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.630
We have a forage animal, right?

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.950
So I'm going to create a wild dog.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.290
Dog.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.410
Since it's an interface,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.640
I'm going to implement, implement forest animals.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.100
I've got here the difference.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.145
So I have make noise method which

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:55.040
absolutely an integral over the implementation and the ad,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.390
whether it's an optional, either you can use it or if you want,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.670
you can overwrite them at their first.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.280
Let's create a implementation for that.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.640
Add unimplemented method which is nothing but make nice.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:17.520
So here's probably any sits well here. I'm oil log.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.360
Got it. So now what we can do either you can implement,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.255
I mean, extend this particular class here,

00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:33.445
and then you're going to access.

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:40.210
Or else you can create the interface to create a instance for this particular class.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.250
Okay? So what I'm gonna do,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.560
so my interface is fresh animal.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.520
Okay, Got it.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.320
For Irish animal, forest animal.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.305
So you cannot create objects for interfaith rate,

00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:52.450
but you're going to create opposite for whoever is

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.345
implemented that so I can create a object for a while.

00:03:55.345 --> 00:03:58.030
So while down.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.855
Got it.

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:02.615
So now we should be able to access fn,

00:04:02.615 --> 00:04:06.425
God Admin out make noise method.

00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:09.840
Okay, so let's run this.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.255
So now we have an outcome.

00:04:14.255 --> 00:04:16.250
So I'ma wild up, okay,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.770
so we return some other Madrid add method.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.975
So what do they use? You can access them here.

00:04:20.975 --> 00:04:24.630
For example, Fn, dot add matter.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.930
And so that's often,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.280
but the day that you can use it,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.785
now we have message from default metadata.

00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:36.110
And the important thing about the default.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.655
But then if you want,

00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:40.655
you can override this particular method

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:44.360
inside what is implementing that particular interface.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.495
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna copy this thing.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:52.740
So whatever editor here.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.520
Okay, so we need a broader public right here.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.755
So public, void add here.

00:05:03.755 --> 00:05:07.980
This method is from wild augmented.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.230
So initially when we call this add method,

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.850
we got this message from default meant that because we did not want to write it anywhere,

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.635
but now we need to override.

00:05:18.635 --> 00:05:20.105
So let's see the outcome now.

00:05:20.105 --> 00:05:22.415
So this is my previous outcome.

00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:24.065
Let me run it again.

00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:28.100
So now I'm wild out and this media from wild dogma,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.410
that NADH from the default method.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.595
So this is our unit to make yourself the default matter.

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:38.850
In the next video, we'll talk about how the static is going to walk.
