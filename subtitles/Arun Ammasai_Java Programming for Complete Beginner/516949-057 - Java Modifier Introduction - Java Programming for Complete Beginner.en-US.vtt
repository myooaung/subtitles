00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.890
Just take a look at the simple example,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.355
helloworld, which we already discussed.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:12.810
Moreover, we discussed lot of programs and a lot of topics, right?

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.900
But the one thing which we missed out, the access modifiers.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.644
So what do you mean by access modifiers?

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:23.865
All right, take a look at this.

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:26.415
I have a class and last name,

00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:28.230
but what is a public hearing?

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.180
And I have a method and there's something before my method,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.500
it is called as a public.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.970
So what are those?

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.440
So those are all called access modifiers.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.270
If it is before class,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.790
which means it's a class modifier, isn't case it,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.420
but it's a method is the method access modifier.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.325
Method access modifier.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:53.150
Okay.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.295
So the access modifier,

00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:57.665
I mean, we can call them as a multi-phase, right?

00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:01.400
So we can separate them in two different ways.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.835
The first one, access modifiers,

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:08.660
the second one, non-access modifier.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.470
Let's talk about access modifiers.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.535
Right?

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:16.580
So what is the access modifier it is going to do?

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:24.815
It is basically specifies the accessibility or scope of a field or method or constructor,

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:26.825
even a class, right?

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:31.805
So we can change the access level based on our needs.

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:34.640
So let's think about it.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.790
How many types of access modifiers are

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.965
available and what are all applied for glass and water applied for something else.

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:44.165
Got it.

00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:51.215
So I'm going to open a simple notepad for you to show you the first thing first.

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:53.315
So access.

00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:56.460
It may increase the formula is here.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.090
So you can take more, better catch up.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.810
Okay?

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.210
So the access modifiers, there are two ways.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.670
The first one is four and the second one is for the others,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:23.249
which means variables, methods, and constructor.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.320
So what are the access modifiers available on the class?

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.705
Okay, so the first one is public,

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:39.770
and the second one is default.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.065
So what do you mean by public?

00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:43.835
What do you mean by default?

00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:47.280
Means anyone can access,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.005
which means no restrictions at all.

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.509
But when you are using default,

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.190
that is a restriction.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.170
Because if somebody's asking you,

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.260
what is the default access modifier for a class,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.960
people immediately say it's a public,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.300
but actually it is not a public.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.585
It is public only for the entire package.

00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:14.345
So we can call them as a package, private. Good.

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:15.875
Because we're going to see,

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.040
we're going to prove what is the public and what is it?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.375
Default, right?

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:26.015
So default means access within package.

00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:27.210
Got it.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.270
Okay.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.775
Well, if these two are available, so what do, so?

00:03:30.775 --> 00:03:32.125
If you want to create a class,

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:34.375
we can create a public class and class name.

00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:36.190
But what do you mean by default?

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.120
If you are not providing any modifiers before your class,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.265
which is called as a default.

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:45.355
Even an old example, right?

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:54.205
If you remove this, it becomes the default default modifier. Got it.

00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:56.620
Okay, so what are the modifiers which you can use

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.140
against a variable method and the constructor.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.285
And there are quite a few here.

00:04:01.285 --> 00:04:04.150
The first one is always a public, okay?

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.660
And the second one, which is a private and a dead one,

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.315
it is called as a default.

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:11.900
Default.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.300
It's pretty much the same thing what we discuss in the class.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.300
A default means there is no access modifier

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.395
provided before the method or a variable or a constructor, right?

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:24.545
And that is a one more protector.

00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:26.750
So we'll talk about everything.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.855
So for always, public,

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:37.325
anyone can access direct, private only.

00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:38.945
That declared a glass.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:43.865
Which means if you are writing any method or a member or an entire class,

00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:46.085
we're only that particular class can use it,

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:47.885
nobody else can utilize that.

00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:55.070
And default means it's the same axis within packets.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.305
So what is protector?

00:04:57.305 --> 00:05:00.260
It is pretty much almost like a default.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:08.960
Okay? So access within Bacchus and subclass.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.030
So that is a conditional here.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.770
So if you want to use protector,

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.350
it can be accessed inside of the package.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.220
But if somebody's inherit my class, they can use,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.960
which means if somebody's extending my class,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.255
they can use my methods and members.

00:05:26.255 --> 00:05:31.830
Okay, So we're going to see an example for each and everything. Thank you.
