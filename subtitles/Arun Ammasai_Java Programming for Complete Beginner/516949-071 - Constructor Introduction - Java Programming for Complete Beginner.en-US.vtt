00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:07.905
The next important concept in ofs has a constructor.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:10.440
So if you're proceeding for

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.880
the next concepts like encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.705
Before that the unit have some basic understanding able to construct down.

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:19.680
Okay?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.080
So first of all, what is a constructor?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.440
Okay, so concept that is basically a block of

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.870
code that initialize the newly created object,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.345
will show you in a simple example how exactly it is working.

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:37.205
And when you're creating a constructor,

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:40.895
you need to have some certain rules in place.

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:44.870
So come center must be the same as the class name.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.865
Which means if you create a class called HelloWorld and

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:55.580
that particular class must contain a constructor called Hello World.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.265
So what kind of syntax I need to use it?

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.575
I'm going to show you that in an example.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:01.550
Okay?

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.085
So next thing, when you create a constructor,

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:06.080
make sure you will not provide any needed.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.475
Then type.

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:09.635
Looks pretty strange rate,

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:12.905
because concept that is pretty much like a third,

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:17.250
but it doesn't have any return type.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.465
And honor important thing.

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:26.090
You cannot defend a concept that as abstract or static and final and democratized.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.630
Okay?

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.609
You can employ any specific visibility to your constructor.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.280
So what basically is happening when we use the kind of shut down when we went to exactly

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.465
used the concept that will be called when you create the object using new keyword.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:50.570
To when do we use the new keyword?

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.695
When I'm trying to create the object for the specific glass IUD X2 Neo.

00:01:57.695 --> 00:02:00.860
Okay, So by default,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.630
each and every class contains their default constructor.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.510
We'll talk about word is default country

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.375
because we have a different types of construct are in place. Okay?

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:12.905
So just know one thing.

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:15.935
So when the controller will be called,

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:21.330
when you use the new keyword.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.330
And another important thing.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.780
And inside of the concept or that I'm not inside the country,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.935
they'll contract or we have a two different types of constructor.

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:35.855
One is a default constructor,

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:39.750
and second one is parameterized constructor.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.005
Let's see, default constructor and I'm interested Kunshan time.

00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:50.259
So what do you mean by default constructor

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:54.490
and what do you mean my parameter is Contractor contract.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.735
So basically constructor with no parameters.

00:02:58.735 --> 00:03:02.335
I mean no in good arguments or no arguments at all.

00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:04.930
That is called as a default constructor.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.815
Okay?

00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:07.090
And another important thing,

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.460
the default constructor you don't need to specifically

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.160
tell that is a default constructor in place,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.610
because by default, each and every class contains their own constructor,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.365
which means a default constructor.

00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:20.184
Or in case if you want to create your own constructor,

00:03:20.184 --> 00:03:23.955
you need to go volume rise to construct that.

00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:25.265
Great.

00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:27.860
So now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.894
a simple class and I'm going to show you how to create a constructor.

00:03:31.894 --> 00:03:34.790
And we are going to play all the rules which we discussed,

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.170
which is nothing but constructor name must be like a class name,

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.150
not the same as the class name,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.025
and no return type.

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:44.720
And it cannot be static,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.940
abstract, fine line, synchronized.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.710
Let's see it in real time.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.460
Example.
