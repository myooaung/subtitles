00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
Hello, welcome back.

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:06.960
So we have seen example an ester if,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.895
an if else example.

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:14.265
So what does another one which is lift the ladder if,

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:19.200
which means the else and if you felt.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.250
Okay.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.235
So, so how we are going to test that,

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.530
okay, we need to decide the scenario.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.980
For example, I have a monk as the input.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.670
So I'm going to decide the Great Basin and the mark.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.165
Okay, So let's create an example for that.

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:38.970
Just click Control N and click class,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.779
and it is going to be for example.

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:48.810
So the first thing, let's create a main matter.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.820
Okay, so now I have an input.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.220
Mark is equal to some predefined.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.590
So what I'm trying to do is the first condition,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:11.130
if Mark less than 35,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.450
which means it's failed.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.380
Failed. Okay?

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.855
So now we cannot do the else condition because that will be executed only one scenario.

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:28.775
But I wanted to multiple scenarios.

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:32.180
I want to check if and I had a cheap one more if condition,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.880
but it is not steady because nested if you need to use inside the if condition,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.080
but we are not going to use an ester if we are going to use else-if.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.520
So.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.680
Along with the if condition.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.335
So here you need to provide another condition.

00:01:48.335 --> 00:01:50.165
So what is the condition here?

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:53.990
So I'm going to check whether mark is greater than or equal to 35.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.235
Okay?

00:01:55.235 --> 00:02:04.050
So Mark greater than 35.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.185
Then we need to set the grade. Okay.

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:14.540
But when you're using if and else condition,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.475
we are checking all it's only one condition.

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:19.070
Why kinda do multiple conditions yet still we can do

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.800
it because we have a relational operations, right?

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.790
The and symbol, we can check multiple conditions in the if itself.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:36.440
So I'm going to get if Mark greater than 35 and Mark less than 50,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.985
which means they are belongs to D grade.

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:45.830
Which makes sense, right? Because if means it doesn't mean

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.820
we can check only one condition we can use and multiple conditions you can use.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.325
And one we're conditioning on more conditions.

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:57.785
Okay, so then I need to have a one more check because I wanted to say the C grade,

00:02:57.785 --> 00:03:00.755
big radiate, great rate and a plus grade also.

00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:02.120
So how we can do that?

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.340
So I'm going to write another else-if condition which will tells you

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:15.290
the mark greater than 50

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:26.750
and Mark less than 75.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.785
So if this condition is true,

00:03:29.785 --> 00:03:31.765
so then what I need to do,

00:03:31.765 --> 00:03:39.145
i'm, I'm saying this particular block is belongs to C grid.

00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:44.920
So if his mark is under this particular scenario is as a grad, see Goodfellow.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.990
So I need to have a one more else-if,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.210
because I need to derive b is a bigger.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.915
All right?

00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:55.420
So else, and if condition here to the mark is

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:03.990
greater than 75, mark.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.435
So less than what you can say.

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:12.350
You can say 90, 90.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.115
Then we need to provide,

00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:19.260
and this particular Shannon belongs to, be great.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.840
And we'll have one more else because we need to provide a grid also, right?

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.855
So else and Anna, if we're,

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:38.240
so here I'm gonna check mark greater than or equal to 90.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.655
We don't, we just keep 90.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.040
So then I don't know how digit

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.975
five less than or equal to 100 because Mark and I'd be more than,

00:04:45.975 --> 00:04:47.680
I mean greater than a 100, right?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.960
So I'm assuming mark greater than 90,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.420
It's all belongs to a grade or a grade successful.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.325
So a grade. Okay.

00:05:00.325 --> 00:05:03.775
And I'll have a one more thing called else.

00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:07.480
Which means what if not even falling any kind of scenario,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.055
which means it's a invalid scenario because he has to fall under any scenario,

00:05:12.055 --> 00:05:13.795
any one other scenario, right?

00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:16.520
So in valid.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.070
Okay, So now just go through the condition one more time.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.675
If greater than, less than 35,

00:05:22.675 --> 00:05:23.980
he's a failed student.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.360
And if it is greater than 30,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.885
40 to 50, and less than 50, the grid.

00:05:28.885 --> 00:05:33.220
The similar way we have a different kinds of conditions.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.960
Let's execute.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.850
So markets.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.920
So he will fall into this particular period rate,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.010
so he's supposed to be secret. Okay, Let's run.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.480
I'm seeing so the particular person is from C grade.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.960
Okay.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.150
Let me modify to 25.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.610
So he's supposed to be failed student.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.420
Yes.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.505
So this block of code that we executed,

00:05:57.505 --> 00:06:01.550
okay, let's check for a 100, let me check 95.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.200
95, which is great, right?

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.975
Okay. So a grade.

00:06:14.975 --> 00:06:21.259
So and now I'm going to check what will happen if it is a 110.

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.420
Because a 110 is not a valid scenario rate.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.335
But it is becoming a grid.

00:06:27.335 --> 00:06:33.005
The reason is in a grid I'm ticking mark greater than r is greater than 90.

00:06:33.005 --> 00:06:35.014
And we need to provide a control,

00:06:35.014 --> 00:06:42.240
like saying Mark less than or equal to a 100.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.445
Because 110 is not a valid right?

00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:48.410
So now you're going to end the code.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.570
Now we should be able to see the same village center.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.705
You cannot provide a student mark is equal to a 110.

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:57.950
So this is our unity is the else if condition.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.880
So these are all the example for entire IF statement.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.745
So first one is an if and second honest if we'd done a study if and the else.

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:11.165
And then finally if else if conditions.

00:07:11.165 --> 00:07:13.220
So the next example we'll,

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.085
we'll talk about something different,

00:07:16.085 --> 00:07:18.425
which is called SS, which case?

00:07:18.425 --> 00:07:22.170
We'll talk about it in the next video. Thank you.
