00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.505
Hello everyone.

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:03.795
Welcome back.

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:09.810
So we pretty much everything you need to know about Java, correct?

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.490
So now what we're going to do,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.235
we're actually able to do our first program.

00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:19.445
So we're gonna write our first Java program, right?

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:20.975
So what is the strip one?

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:26.480
The first thing, we already inserted Zhao in our mission and we set up our environment.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.655
Correct? So first thing,

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:35.660
open your notepad or any text and write our Hello World program.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.210
Okay, So how the Hello World program look like?

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.475
So this is our HelloWorld program.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:42.515
You may think, what kind of syntax is this?

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:44.915
I don't understand anything. Okay, don't worry about that.

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:48.680
We're going to talk about each and everything, correct.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.460
For now, I'm just going to show you how the Java code looks like and why do

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.630
we need to create them and how to compile them on how to run them.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.650
Once you see the outcome of your program in the skin you might feel okay,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.795
I just take the limit first Java program.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:07.400
Now let's talk about what is that in the program which I have the data already.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.660
Okay, for example, here we have a HelloWorld program. Correct?

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.240
So you can use Notepad or if you have

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.360
any IDs and if you're familiar with arrays, you can use it.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.385
Or even any text pad,

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:21.095
panther, for our example.

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:23.570
You can go at simple node pair.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.840
Because the reason why I'm not asking you to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.960
work with any IDs when you're working with the node pairs,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.190
when you compile the code,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.195
you know what is the editors are making, right?

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:36.620
But if you are using IDE,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.410
it always show you the error message.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.505
So it will never lead to you to understand the issue.

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:46.685
It will always tell you here is an issue, go and fix it.

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:49.205
But when you're compelled manually,

00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:51.950
you will know what is the issue which you've done in

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.550
your code and you can fix it What is correct?

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.050
So what are the next step?

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.415
So once the code has been typed, then what do you need to do?

00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:04.565
You need to say it as a HelloWorld.java,

00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:05.840
okay, so you might think,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.810
why should I need to save it as a HelloWorld.java?

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.675
Why can I save as my first Java program, Java?

00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:14.930
You might have thought right? We'll talk about that.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.310
Okay, Let's run, create our first example and random than Theta outcome.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.335
Okay, find me got our first program,

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:27.455
and then we'll move on to the what is the explanation for the program.

00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:30.905
So then once the program is saved,

00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:34.580
you need to compile the program, which is nothing but.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:43.985
So I see HelloWorld.java and execute the code with the help of Java space,

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:47.330
the class name. Right?

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.900
So now we know washington to be done.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.965
Right?

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:55.850
So what we can do now open an unpaired and implement the code.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.815
Okay, Let's move materials.

00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:02.390
Okay, So I'm going to use Notepad Plus, Plus.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.095
If you want, you can use any other ideas,

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:08.270
even if a nice note, but also it's fine.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.735
Okay, So I'm going to create a new normal text.

00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:13.490
So we know the syntax, right?

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:20.855
And so class HelloWorld, this file.

00:03:20.855 --> 00:03:23.375
And I'm going to have a main method,

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:28.160
public, static, void, main.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.450
We'll talk about why we're doing it in everything,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.415
string, arguments and open.

00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:45.005
Now we're going to print the data system dot out, dot, print LN.

00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:47.460
Here it can provide you with.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:55.950
And this is my first Java program.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.270
Okay, So now what is the next step?

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.655
So once the program is developed,

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:09.870
then we need to save this HelloWorld.java.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.870
Okay? Because my class name is Hello world, okay,

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.480
So whenever you see Agile or fail,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.970
it has to do with the class name.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.650
So we'll talk about everything.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.270
So now what I'm going to say,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.845
I'm going to create a folder.

00:04:27.845 --> 00:04:29.225
So I have a folder.

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:31.715
I'll go to C drive and the sea,

00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:33.320
I have a folder called workspace,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.360
and here I have a Java basics.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.865
I don't want this to be like this one.

00:04:37.865 --> 00:04:44.280
Yes, they can create Java basic tutorial.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.310
Okay, So here I'm gonna say SAS,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.750
helloworld dot Java, correct?

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.800
So now the first thing is then the HelloWorld program has been done.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.800
Now we need to compile the program and run.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.120
Okay, we'll do it in the next video.
