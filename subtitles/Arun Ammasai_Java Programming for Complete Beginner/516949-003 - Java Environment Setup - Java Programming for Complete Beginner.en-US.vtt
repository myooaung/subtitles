00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.335
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:02.430
Welcome back.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.145
So now we have installed the software.

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:12.180
So this is a time to check whether my installation completed successfully.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.070
We need to validate that, right?

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.935
So basically my program has been my software has been installed in CSI driver, okay.

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:22.170
Distinctively example, we normally won't do

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.160
any programming inside this EEPROM C drive actually,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.625
because these are used for installing some software,

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:30.380
are some operating system files.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.520
So normally what we do,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.215
so normally what we do,

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:40.400
we start coding in a different directory or

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.840
different drive and we'll create

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.855
our own folders and then we'll start our development, right?

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:46.460
That is how we will do right?

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.465
So now I'm gonna do is firstly,

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:55.925
let's check whether we should be able to access the Java, right?

00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:57.830
To check that what do you need to do?

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.145
Go to start and look for comment on,

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:04.550
or you can search for command prompt and you're gonna click that

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.690
or else you can open the prompt and you can type CMD.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.290
So just want to check, if you want to check whether the java is Intel,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.555
right? So what do you need to do?

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:14.960
Java C.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.555
But we got an error saying like

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:20.810
Java C is not a recognized the internal or external command.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.410
That means the system says I'm not able to access the Java.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.865
So what is the problem?

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:27.500
I'll tell you that isn't okay.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.640
So the software has been installed in JDK 14.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.500
And this particular location.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.140
This is the location where Java has been in step.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.410
If you come to this particular location and if you're trying to access the Java C,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.495
you should be able to access if you're getting these kind of some summary data,

00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:50.335
some commands like that,

00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:53.530
which means java has been installed successfully on their mission.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.790
So for now, we know Java has been installed in our mission,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.050
but it is not visible for all the directories are all the drives, right?

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.420
Because I will do coding from the directive or the river,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.195
whatever the dry which we have it in our local system, right?

00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:09.430
So if you're trying to access data from D drive,

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.110
it won't be accessible here.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.025
Correct?

00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:14.650
So for example, let me switch to the drain.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.835
So okay, so let's try it to Java c here.

00:02:18.835 --> 00:02:21.445
It won't be accessible here.

00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:24.280
Carry the reason is it is installed NSC,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.945
right, with a specific directory.

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.700
So now what do we need to do?

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.230
Okay, so now I need to set the path we used to call them as the environment part.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.935
Okay?

00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:38.950
So I'm going to create an environment

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.640
variable with this particular data because if you want to access the Java,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.590
you need to come to the installation directory

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.415
where the database install JDK food in 2000,

00:02:48.415 --> 00:02:51.640
the compiler are, the Dow sees nothing but it is

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.750
a Java compiler which is located in bin directory.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.115
So this particular location needs to be there in our environment setup.

00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:01.840
It is a kind of a global variable.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.070
So wherever you can go,

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.735
you can still access it, right?

00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:06.235
You have a Cloud system, right?

00:03:06.235 --> 00:03:08.215
You're accessing from your personal laptop.

00:03:08.215 --> 00:03:10.480
Or you can take an example of a Gmail.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.520
You're that you're able to access from your mobile,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.170
you are able to access from your laptop or even a new physical desktop.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.625
Okay, So the available it is common across all the platforms.

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:28.290
The similar way we need to keep our path visible to everyone in our center,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.460
a task to be visible to every directory.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.805
So what we're going to do, just copy this part.

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:41.080
Just Control C and copy and relate to your computer and go to Properties.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.285
And then you can see at one system settings, right?

00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:49.405
So here you have something called environment variables.

00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:50.650
Just click that.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.870
Now we have some temporary variables here.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.130
You don't have to worry about that.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.400
We need to create a new one for.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.810
But, so this is the part I'm want to set.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.795
The value is going to be the one that she copied.

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:03.635
Correct.

00:04:03.635 --> 00:04:07.580
So now I have a path which is visible for all my entire system.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.130
Correct? Okay, So now what you're gonna do, let's close them.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.445
Open the command prompt where we had to open a new one.

00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:19.940
Go to Stat and type command prompt.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.960
And now we are in C, Java.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.205
C.

00:04:25.205 --> 00:04:30.110
Initially, it was saying a general comment or not.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.035
For now, I'm able to access let's go to the D Drive.

00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:36.950
Installed that even okay.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.935
And we're gonna delay, right? So you see even in deed,

00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:45.650
I'm able to access it, go to the E Drive.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.780
So I'm gonna do the Java C here.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.635
So wherever you go,

00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:53.435
you should be able to access Java.

00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:56.150
That is called setting your enrollment.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.945
Okay.

00:04:56.945 --> 00:04:58.400
Thank you. Let's meet each other.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.030
Next video.
