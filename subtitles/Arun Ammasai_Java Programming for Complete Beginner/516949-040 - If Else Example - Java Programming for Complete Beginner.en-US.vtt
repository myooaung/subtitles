00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.975
So far we've discussed two scenarios.

00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:11.260
The first one is if if the condition is true, execute the block.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.870
And the next one, if the condition is true,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.475
execute the block, the similar one,

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:17.485
but we have a one more if condition.

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:20.260
If you want, you can have one more if condition inside this,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.035
particularly if condition, which means another if.

00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:24.715
So this isn't necessary.

00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:27.865
But we need to have a example.

00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:31.765
And when it have a scenario like if it is true, then do this.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.745
In case the condition is not true,

00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:36.925
then execute something else specifically.

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:43.460
So we can achieve that using if else block. Let's do that.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.005
I'm going to create a new class here and Control N.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.150
And I went to class.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:59.390
So here it is going to be eight else example, which will last.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.535
And now we're going to have a main matter.

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:05.300
Mine and control space.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.240
Got it. Now we have a main method.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:19.175
So let's create a variable int num is equals to a 100. Right?

00:01:19.175 --> 00:01:21.440
So we know that condition, right?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.235
If we didn't the brackets spirit of poverty condition.

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:35.165
So, um, my condition is going to be num greater than 100.

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:38.930
Then execute this particular block,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.020
which means we didn't this particular brackets.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:53.030
Okay? So here, so num is we get then a 100, okay?

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.945
So in case my number is not greater than a 100, what do I need to do?

00:01:56.945 --> 00:01:59.375
Just create this block of code.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:06.570
So here, CSF flow control phase number is smaller.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.860
Right?

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.395
So this is a place where we can provide,

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:16.685
if true, then do this or else do that.

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:18.530
And then the legs,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.305
a good rest of the block, like say slow.

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:26.700
So I can simply say outside, if else block.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.170
This can be achieved in any programs.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.940
Even you can do it in iterative and you're going,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.715
I didn't if our example also,

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:38.525
okay, Let's assume what is outcome.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.520
So number is a 100,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.645
so number greater than or equal to a 100.

00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:47.360
So let's have a 208 then.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.340
Because our first condition, so 200 is greater than a 100, which is true.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.910
So what happen? This block will be executed.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.085
And then it will go,

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:04.040
then it'll go to the rest of the code.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.530
So let's run it.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.520
See number is bigger than a 100, which is the line number 7.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.905
And the outset of the if-else block,

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:15.725
which means that they stopped the cord.

00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:20.075
Right? Okay, so let's modify the input.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.220
Let me keep it at 100.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.620
So what do you think it's gonna happen now?

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.460
Because so do you think a 100 greater than a 100?

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.820
And what is the outcome of a 100 greater than a 100?

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.025
It looks like both are same,

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:38.705
but it is not exactly the condition is true because a 100 is not greater than 100,

00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:41.240
because it is equal to a 100, right?

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.300
So basically overlap and this condition returns false.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.440
So it will go to the numbers smaller than a 100 and let's run this.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.850
See number is more than a 100,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.140
but it doesn't make any sense, right?

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.460
Because he would tundra.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.455
It's supposed to be checked.

00:03:57.455 --> 00:03:58.265
Okay.

00:03:58.265 --> 00:03:59.630
A 100 and 100 same rate.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.625
So basically what I need to do,

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:04.805
I need to check whether a number is greater than r is equal to a 100,

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:07.565
or even if I'm okay, it is equal to a 100.

00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:10.790
So in that scenario, what we need to do just we need to

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.865
use greater than or equal to a 100.

00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:15.500
So now what will happen?

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.830
So the condition is a 100 greater than or equal to a 100.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.320
The first condition, checking whether my

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.410
100 is greater than a 100 millimeters or greater than,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.990
then to check whether it is greater than or equal to a 100.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.045
Yes, it is equal to a 100.

00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:31.775
So which is retaining it true.

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:36.650
So it will execute the line number 7, just wanted again.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.825
So now you should be able to see number is bigger than a 100.

00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:44.240
So this is a simple example for AFL.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.910
In the next example, we'll talk about how the

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.850
if and else-if statement is going to work. Thank you.
