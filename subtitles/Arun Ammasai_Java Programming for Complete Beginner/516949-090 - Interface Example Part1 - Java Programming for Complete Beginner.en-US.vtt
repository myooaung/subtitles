00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Hey everyone, welcome back.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:09.450
We discuss about how it's looked like and how we can create your interface.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.550
Okay, Before we jump into an example,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.780
let me give you the example syntax for interface.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.480
So like this is how you create a class name,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.140
class name, and you'll provide the methods inside, correct.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.490
The similar way interface,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.730
pretty much like a class only so but instead of plasma to provide

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.600
interface, interface, interface name.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.120
So that's the difference between class and they introduce

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.639
both of them pretty much similar.

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:51.870
Both contain similar kind of a data methods and the members.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.760
So we discussed Laurel points ever interfaces, right?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.485
So what are the, what of that?

00:00:57.485 --> 00:00:59.330
So it's like it laugh but not a class.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.490
And it can have that declaration,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.010
and it can have variables.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.390
Okay, we're going to explore each and every point, right?

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.829
So let's go back to our Eclipse and let's create a example for interface.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.315
Okay, so we're going to create a new interface, right?

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:22.234
So create a new interface.

00:01:22.234 --> 00:01:26.880
My interface name is interphase example.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.780
Okay?

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.635
So this is my interface example, correct?

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:38.720
So the first thing, what we can,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.950
we can have my third declination.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.010
Right?

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.840
So I'm going to provide wide ad.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.380
This is method declaration, correct?

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.250
But Various abstract keyword.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.370
When you're declaring a method inside a interface,

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.690
you don't have to provide abstract because by default it's an abstract.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.275
But in abstract class that get opened up surplus.

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:24.650
Say in the abstract class you need to provide the abstract keyword to declare a method.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.870
Because it's not an interface.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.010
An interface you don't have to prove it because whatever you met that declaration,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.390
you provably instead they integrate.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.845
That's all considered as abstract in case I'm declaring a variable called in x.

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:40.955
Sorry.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.085
So index, which means even though you're not providing any data here,

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:48.425
I mean any type here,

00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:51.380
which is by default is a final.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.225
You don't have to provide that.

00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:54.200
Okay?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.525
We're going to talk about how we are going to implement this, right?

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:02.210
So if it is absurd class,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.030
I'm extending the class to the underclass.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.830
But if it is a interface,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.125
we can implement them.

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.190
Right?

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.070
So let's create one more class.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.979
And this time I'm going to create a class,

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:20.460
which is the interface demo.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.630
So let's have a main method in it.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.475
So how we need to extend here,

00:03:33.475 --> 00:03:37.105
we are not going to extend here big extended for abstract classes.

00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:39.325
Implements is we're interfaces.

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:44.660
So interface demo implements,

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.075
implements interface example.

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:54.580
So immediately you'll get an error.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.200
Because it is saying you're implementing some interfaces which has a method declaration.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.945
So if you're providing,

00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:09.635
if you're trying to extend or if you're trying to implement any interests subject matter.

00:04:09.635 --> 00:04:13.625
You need to provide the implementation for the partial methods,

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:15.905
okay, So when the enemies,

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:25.110
so add, so I'm going to provide some thing like hers as well.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.060
Another important thing which you need to keep in mind, okay,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.890
So I'm trying to implement the logic here,

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.315
but I'm still getting an ADA.

00:04:56.315 --> 00:04:59.660
The reason changed the method of its ability to public.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.740
So whenever you are trying to implement something from interface,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.630
that implementation should be public.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.770
Simple. So make sure when you're implementing the method should be public.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.710
Okay, so now I can create the object for my interest demo OBJ is equal to mu.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.005
So now we have object.

00:05:24.005 --> 00:05:26.555
Now we can call them better.

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:28.355
Can we?

00:05:28.355 --> 00:05:35.270
Yeah, Let's try that OBJ dot add method.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.245
Right?

00:05:36.245 --> 00:05:40.950
And then we can execute the code to see the outcome.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.910
So now we've got a message from the atom at that.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.910
So we are going to see one more example.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.900
How, what is the other way to access the same add method.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.160
We'll talk over the next video.
