00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.775
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:04.245
So now what we're gonna do,

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:06.000
we're gonna do the same thing,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.320
correct, but we have the object in place now.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.230
So I'm going to convert these wrapper into a primitive type.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
So I'm going to print a primitive types and I'm going to overwrite the data correctly.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.200
So this is going to be byte value.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.365
This is a short value and this integer value,

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:28.050
this is long value, float value,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.480
w value, car value with value.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.720
So here what I wanna do is I want to use the object which is nothing but byte object.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.030
And here we're going to use sharp object.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.005
And here we're going to use int object.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.880
And here, these are the variable names that you created for

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.420
the wrapper class object.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:10.025
And here we have a double object and object.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:15.290
And here we have a Boolean object at it.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.800
So now I can what are all the wrapper into a primitive type?

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.115
I'm going to create a print statement like this.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.395
It'll take a while, I'm gonna pass it for awhile.

00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:27.545
So I just created a print statement for printing all the primitive type.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:30.450
So let's run the code.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.250
Makes is that control the first eight values,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.520
which is called motor from the primitive to wrapper class and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.180
these wrapper to primitive type.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.340
So this is how you do make use of the wrapper classes.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.940
So where do you, because wrapper class is going to help us when

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.350
you are working with the collections because

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.540
collections all work with the wrapper classes,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.225
not a primitive data we'll talk about in a separate section.

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:00.660
Thank you.
