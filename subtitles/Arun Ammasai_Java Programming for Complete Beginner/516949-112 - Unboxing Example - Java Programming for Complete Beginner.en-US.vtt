00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.455
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.455 --> 00:00:05.595
Welcome back. So we know what is the rubber class and what it is used for.

00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:09.480
And we discussed able autoboxing, boxing.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.580
So now let's try the reverse one.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.525
Unboxing.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:17.610
We did boxing so we can do the unboxing,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.485
which is opposite to boxing.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.945
So I'm going to create a new class.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:29.460
Here. I'm going to call them as unboxing example and boxing example.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.390
So what we're gonna do, we're going to have

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.475
a wrapper class and I'm going to come out Endo perimeter.

00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:40.080
So let's have a main method in it.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.635
So what kind of data?

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:46.205
So we'll try to replicate the same whatever we did in boxing.

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:48.800
So I have integer value,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.180
which is nothing but an integer.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.285
I1 centers the class.

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:58.865
We can create the object, correct?

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:02.900
Like New India.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.070
And we're going to pass what kind of data I'm going to print.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.245
I'm going to pass ten here.

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:15.425
So now I have a value which is integer which holds ten.

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:19.040
So you might have seen some strike out here,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.084
which means this individual has been deprecated.

00:01:22.084 --> 00:01:25.115
So you don't need to create in digital like this anymore.

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:26.120
Here.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.030
In this scenario, we tried multiple ways.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.465
So in this way is equal to integrated value.

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:34.160
Or we can use integer b is equal to x.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.755
Instead of using value of the similar way,

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:40.895
you can create integer like this,

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:49.895
or you can create integer I is equal to 10.

00:01:49.895 --> 00:01:52.070
This also works.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.695
Let me print it and show you what the outcome of it.

00:01:54.695 --> 00:02:00.470
So I1 plus I1 and

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.290
I'm going to print I do as I do, and I do.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.275
So let me show you we are not still doing the unboxing.

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:11.690
I'm just trying to show you how to create an integer very re-entry.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.205
Both of them has the same value.

00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:14.000
Got it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.860
So now what we're going to do,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.965
we are trying to convert the data.

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:20.645
Correct?

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:22.520
So I have a wrapper class again.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.690
So what I need to do,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.990
I need to convert them into a primitive type, right?

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.580
So the way we can do that,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.530
for example, into, sorry, so into x.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.180
So what is a variable i2,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.160
which holds the wrapper class?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.985
Correct?

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:50.285
Dot syntax and bigger we can use the int value,

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:52.115
which we'll turn to India.

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:55.230
So now we can print x.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.230
All right, so now you can render it out.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.615
And then the court will get the primitive integer type.

00:03:08.615 --> 00:03:17.615
So we can order primitive wrapper breeze example now, purdue primitive.

00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:20.105
So in the next example what we're going to do,

00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:22.670
so we have 80 different types of wrapper class and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.750
eight different types of corresponding primitive datatype.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.580
So I'm going to create an example with contents all their lives.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.180
And we're doing boxing on along with the unboxing also.
