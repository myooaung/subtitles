00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.785
So we had just written our first Java program, right?

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:09.870
So now what is the next step?

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.950
We need to compile the code and we know how to compile the code java C space,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.690
the class name dot Java,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.930
and to run the code java space hello world,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.345
so that we can go and compile the code.

00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:27.020
You need to know that right? Because you need to open

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.195
the command prompt and you go to the exact location value, save the file.

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:35.090
So we know that location where the file has been saved, right?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.695
So it is in C drive,

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:39.935
workspace and Java basic tutorial.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:43.835
So in order to go to this particular location in command prompt,

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:46.865
so what you can do US Open command prompt,

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:50.795
command prompt, and there you can navigate.

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:59.135
Okay. Simply, just copy this URL and click Copy and go to command prompt and space CD.

00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:04.715
Cd, space CDs, nothing would change directory to this location and enter.

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:06.920
It is more to this particular location.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.520
Okay?

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.020
Sometimes you feel like I don't comfortable to navigating by this way,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.760
we have an even simpler options.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.360
Okay, just go to the location where that file is saved.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.829
So what do you need to do? Just right-click.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.830
But while click, while doing the right leg,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.290
hold down the Shift key and then do

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.440
the right-click that you can see open comment window here.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.915
You can click that evidence of Windows 10.

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:37.185
It will show you open shell window here.

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:39.530
They both will work.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.440
Now, the common point hasn't opened in the exact location.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.470
So if you want to see what are the files are available under the directory,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.210
we can use DAR comment,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.110
which is nothing but which will show you the list of files under the directory.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.790
So now I have only HelloWorld.java.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.490
First thing, we need to compile them,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.175
tell us his face, helloworld.com.

00:02:00.175 --> 00:02:04.480
So you might wonder how the Hello World dot Java, it suddenly came up.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.330
I just typed towards right two characters.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.285
So to do that, just use Java C and type

00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:13.240
first two or three letters and press the Tab on your keyboard.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.990
It automatically find out which failure looking for.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.935
If you have multiple failed, you can use multiple types.

00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:22.850
So I'm combining the code now.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.090
So now what will happen? So whenever you do compilation,

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.035
you will have the class file generated by the compiler.

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:32.930
So now we should have two files.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.300
We have HelloWorld.java and we compile the code.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.750
Now we should have class along with the Java file.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.760
Okay, let's do the DAR here.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.100
Now we have two files, right?

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.600
Dot class file.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.695
And also go to the location that you can find that as a new file creator,

00:02:48.695 --> 00:02:50.660
which is nothing but HelloWorld.java,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.920
which holds them bytecode.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.295
Right?

00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:58.460
Okay, So now let's run the code.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.905
We know how to run the code, right?

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:04.715
Let's see it. So using Java class name,

00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:08.720
that it is intact, so space,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.640
my class name is hello.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.785
All right, Hello World.

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:16.414
So just get ready for the execution.

00:03:16.414 --> 00:03:21.240
We are able to see our first Java program execution output.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.540
Paula.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.089
This is my first Java program.

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:28.715
So we're done our first program.

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:30.170
So we're good to go.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.865
This is the first step.

00:03:31.865 --> 00:03:32.645
Okay?

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:37.415
So we're we're keeping our food in the first step.

00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:39.170
But you might think, okay,

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.640
I've written my first Java program,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.965
but I don't understand what is there in the program.

00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:44.690
Correct?

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.600
You know, we have no idea what is class and what is

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.090
HelloWorld and what is this public static, void, main, and all.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.975
Correct.

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:54.170
So we're going to talk about what they eat and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.345
every key elements in our example in the next video, right?

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:05.480
I mean to say why you are providing class and weigh the same public static, void main.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.955
And we are providing something called stream arcs.

00:04:07.955 --> 00:04:09.560
And what is a system.out.print.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.010
Dylan will talk about everything in the next video.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.400
Thank you.
