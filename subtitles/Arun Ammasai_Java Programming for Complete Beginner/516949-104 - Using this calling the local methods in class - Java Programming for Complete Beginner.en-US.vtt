00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.955
So now we're moving to the fifth concept I'm in fifth topic in,

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:07.815
under the, this keyword.

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:10.450
So let me create a new class.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.020
Control N here.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.640
And we haven't created this given example number 5.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.800
So what we are trying to achieve here,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.860
using this keyword I want to call my own methods.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.275
I have multiple methods in my class, I want to call them.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.495
We tried calling constructor, which worked.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:29.370
We tried to calling return.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.215
Say mention. It worked.

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:33.675
You tried to calling the instance variable, which all work.

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:38.280
Now I'm going to call them matter because pretty much with the help of this keyword,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.150
you can do everything.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.985
Great.

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:44.300
So for now, I'm going to create a metal.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.135
The default method we always use written word ad.

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:50.105
So here, C as well.

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:52.475
And I'm going to print something always.

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:58.445
Message from metta. Had it.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:04.370
So now I want to call this particular method using this keyword.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.020
Okay, So I have another method called Show.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.940
So now I don't want to use any object reference to call that.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.805
I can use this keyword to call the method.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:21.090
Pretty simple, this dot add.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.600
You can still do that RLC or to create an object to call

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.175
them inside the main method message from momentum here.

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:37.085
Okay, So now what I'm gonna do is just create the object for every class.

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:38.360
And as I mentioned,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.640
rest is history current.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.560
So the matter we are trying to call us and show

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.085
my dad my dad internally calls they add method's.

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:50.910
Great.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.350
So now I'm going to run the code.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:04.220
See, I'm able to call at the same time and can access Zoom at that.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:12.065
So this is how you need to use this keyword to call the method instead, you will class.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.900
So what is there?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.550
One other thing which is left.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.915
So using this keyword as argument in the constructor call.

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:24.560
Okay, well, what does the constructor, constructor color?

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.170
So when you are using new and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.960
some class name that which means you are calling a constructor, right?

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.055
So, um, but that particular time we can pass this keyword.

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:36.990
So let's export in the next video.
