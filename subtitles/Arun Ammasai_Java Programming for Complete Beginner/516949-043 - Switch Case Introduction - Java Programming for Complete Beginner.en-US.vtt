00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.180
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.810
The next one which are going to discuss is a switch case.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.255
The first thing they've done this then what does it switch? Right?

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:18.105
So switch case, it's mostly used with the break statement even though if it is an option.

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:19.560
Okay, but that's the next point.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.950
But first thing, why even have us which case?

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.045
Okay, so when we have a number of options,

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:29.210
are you can see number of choices and we may need to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.825
pull from a different task but each option, correct.

00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:36.425
So you felt 12. So if it is one,

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:37.910
I wanted to perform an operation.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.610
If it is too, I wanted to perform different operations based

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.985
on each and every number I had to perform a different kind of operation.

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:50.765
So we can do that will help host which case? Right?

00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:52.880
So Canada an example and see how this,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.170
which gives us actually going to work correctly.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.615
So let's talk about what are the switch case.

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:03.365
So as I mentioned, when we have a number of options or choices,

00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:08.950
and we might need a different operation for each choice.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.320
And each case statements can have a break statement in order to stop the flow.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.465
For example, if you have a 10 flow,

00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:19.735
so our scenario fall into any one of the case.

00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:23.920
But once the case has been executed or unit of break it,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.600
if you're not breaking it,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.150
it will keep executing the following cases.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.660
But we don't want to do that because it's still isn't optional.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.550
And duplicate values are not allowed.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.650
For example, if you have a case one,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.840
case two, case three, you can have multiple Case 1.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.780
Okay?

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.170
And value for a case must be same type as a switch.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.810
So sin switch, you'll pass something.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.020
Correct. And the case you are receiving some data,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.410
both have to be same that we'll talk about in the original example.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.450
Okay? So the flow diagram,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.840
how the suitcase it is, it looks like.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.170
So it will start our programming and code.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.355
And we have an expression which is provided in the switch,

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:11.845
like a number or string.

00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:15.549
Initially switch case was widely supported by the numbers.

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.760
And then later, after seven Java 7,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.970
8 was modified to support the string literal.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.460
It's also alright.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.190
So the expression is defined.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.250
Basically the explanation is a switch, okay?

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.485
When you have a situation in your home, right?

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:36.490
So easy to switch belongs to some operation once which belongs

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.350
to turn on the lights and another one don't on the ACR,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.455
another one don't under mission or turn on the TV.

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:49.120
So each gaze, which has it's one operation. Okay?

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.310
So if you only post the switch means you are

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.560
going to decide which case you are going to execute,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.560
whether you are going to suture the AC or fan or light.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.895
So based on that,

00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:00.850
the operation will be executed properly.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.200
Correct? So this is the flowchart for the switch case.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.370
So that is a scenario.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.100
I have a case, but none of the cases has been executed.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.880
What happened by didn't go to the end,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.855
the gates, which is nothing but default case.

00:03:17.855 --> 00:03:21.185
So default case only executed when,

00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:24.050
that is no cases had been executed properly.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.760
So for example, here we have block one,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.235
block two block rewrite, or k1, k2, k3.

00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:30.035
If none of them are executed,

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:32.840
it will go to default block.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.605
Okay?

00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:39.980
So let's create a simple example and explored how the switch case is actually works.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.520
Thank you.
