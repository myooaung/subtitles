00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.065
Hello everyone.

00:00:02.065 --> 00:00:03.895
Welcome back.

00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:06.925
So they don't pick which are going to discuss today.

00:00:06.925 --> 00:00:08.455
It is Java.

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:14.080
Oops. Okay, So whenever people are talking about some programming language,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.600
one not a common thing is, oops,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.635
concept is nothing but object-oriented programming system that DOM is called. Oops.

00:00:23.635 --> 00:00:28.435
Okay, So before we are jumping into what exactly the book is doing,

00:00:28.435 --> 00:00:30.830
we need to understand what exactly.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.265
Oops, okay, so, whoops.

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:40.570
Basically it's a concept that works based on some principles, correct? That principle.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.855
I can list each and every one of them.

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:47.675
For now I'm going to tell you the principles is based on abstraction,

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:52.985
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:58.895
Okay, So these are the core heart of the object-oriented programming system.

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:03.080
Let's talk about what are the other things available in ofs.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.595
Okay, So these are the important things when you're talking about the wolves.

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:10.415
There are certain things which you need to know.

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:12.575
The first thing, object,

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:15.319
you need to know what is an object.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.125
And second thing, what is the glass?

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:26.210
And third one, inheritance and polymorphism and abstraction, then encapsulation.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.470
So each and every thing playing a big role in newer agent every day development activity.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.965
So now let's see what exactly the other things which dopes can do.

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:45.365
Okay, the first thing, as I mentioned earlier,

00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:48.755
is a concept that worked on based on some principles.

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:50.165
We know that principles, right?

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:55.490
And you can simply say it's a methodology to design a program using classes and methods.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.870
When you're creating a class,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.775
what will be there inside the class?

00:01:58.775 --> 00:02:02.075
Obviously method and the variables.

00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:03.650
Right?

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.475
Then.

00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:05.435
So what else?

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:06.575
The ops is olivine.

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:08.015
The whoops is growing.

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:11.390
We uses to create the object the way they want.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.185
Okay?

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:15.395
So they can create the program the way they want,

00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:20.105
and then they can create methods to handle those objects.

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:22.280
It's everything in our handy.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.550
I mean to say the individual developer hand.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.940
And the advantage of using it is increase the flexibility of programs.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.870
Okay, So when we, when we deep dive into OBS concept,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.990
we will understand why I said it is flexibility programs.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.195
And it brings data together in a single location.

00:02:47.195 --> 00:02:48.605
Exactly.

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:52.025
So I haven't met which handles some data.

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:54.860
I have a variable which holds some data.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.070
That data might be different for a variable and the matter,

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.905
but everything works together.

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:04.040
To process some data on some process,

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.235
everything happened in a single location as they're called ASA class.

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:15.079
And another important thing is pretty much easy to understand.

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.410
So once you understand the OVS coins,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.365
it easy for you to write coding.

00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:24.575
So the people are struggling to write Java codes.

00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:27.530
That problem is, they are not exactly understand what it, oops,

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.170
concepts studying ols concept is It's a different thing, okay?

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.765
But the studying is not an important thing.

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:38.210
Make sure you understand.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.290
So what is an oops,

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.305
concepts and why we need a whoops,

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.075
and how wood is going to help us.

00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:50.810
So the ultimate goal for us to understand the concepts.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.455
Okay?

00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:53.480
So what are the concepts are available?

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.370
So as I said, ofs,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.035
it is walking baseline, some amazing principles.

00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:01.895
So what are those?

00:04:01.895 --> 00:04:06.245
The first thing we thought up the thin.

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:10.490
So because Java is object-oriented programming language,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.400
so object is core for everything.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.715
So then next level class,

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:20.150
class condensed the methods and the Mimbres.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.400
Classes like a family which holds their family members and some other things.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.950
And abstraction, abstraction or not,

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.525
the powerful concept in,

00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:31.580
Whoops, we'll talk about that.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:39.125
And the next one is constructor and then encapsulation and inheritance.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:43.790
Okay, and last but not least, polymorphism.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:51.380
So from the next video we're going to talk about each and every concepts one by one.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.100
Thank you.
