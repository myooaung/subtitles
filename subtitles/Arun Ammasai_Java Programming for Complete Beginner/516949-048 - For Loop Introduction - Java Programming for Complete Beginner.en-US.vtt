00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.045
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:07.035
In Java, the other important thing is looping consumption.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:09.659
So basically when we need to use the labellings.

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:13.320
So loops are used to execute a set of instructions,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.930
functions repeatedly based on the condition which we provide.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.615
So the loop will keep on executing until the condition becomes false.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:26.085
And we have two types of them.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:28.290
And one is for loop and while and do-while.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.780
The first we'll talk about for loop, okay?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.360
And that is one more thing you need to keep it in mind.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.100
So when do you follow?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.415
Okay, So for example,

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.920
if you know the i iteration is fixed

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.755
and you know the how many times my follow-up is going to be ran.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:48.200
It is recommend to use a for loop.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.490
Okay?

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.290
So let's just set up a for loop here.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.245
So far loop is used to I take apart of a code

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:58.069
several times and it is based on some conditions.

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.070
And here it is. I iteration is fixed because

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.370
I know how many times I'm going to run this particular loop.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.245
So another one.

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:11.195
And inside of the for loop itself,

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:13.400
we have three different types of a loop.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.990
Not normal for loop, and the for age and a label for a loop.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.550
Everything pretty much similar,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.025
but all of them doing the same job in a different manner.

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:24.530
But pretty much will go to the first one.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.505
Okay?

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:30.350
So we need to know how the for loop syntax.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.425
So in order to write a for loop,

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:38.690
this is the syntax for do you remember how we create the if else condition, right,

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.430
So similarly for, so after the FAR,

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.430
we'll have a bracket which contains the initial value.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.035
And I teach in limit and the increment and decrement.

00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:53.720
So the first one is the initial value.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.390
And the second known as a dietitian limit,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.865
which means the condition which will provide,

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:01.310
as I mentioned, based on the condition,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.120
the loop will keep on executed until the condition is false.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.569
So once that notation limit condition is false,

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.985
the loop will be broken.

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.805
And next one is how to increment.

00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:19.610
Because the loop, we need to identify every time the loop runs as a different number.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.110
Because the first term is 0.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.720
Second thing is one. So how we are going to increment the data,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.280
the loop num should know.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.530
So this is the second loop, this loop, right?

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.360
So we need to have a increment R to tell the compiler that this is the second loop,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.540
the second number in the same loop.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.920
And insert that you can write our own gore and do some logic.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.955
Okay?

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:49.415
So this is how far it is looks like and the far loop and you need to use when,

00:02:49.415 --> 00:02:51.320
you know the second parameter,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.465
dietitian limit, if you know that,

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.950
you can go for FAR loop.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.750
Okay, So the next video,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.880
we are going to create a simple example to

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.310
talk about how the for loop is exactly the working.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.760
Thank you.
