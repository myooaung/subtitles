00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.785
So now we're going to talk about the, another simple example.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:09.945
But here we can control the flow based on some condition, right?

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:12.795
So I'm going to create a new example here.

00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:15.915
It will say create contour and create a new class here.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.455
And the kitchen Example 2 and finish.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:22.500
So now we have other class ready.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.165
Let's create a main method here.

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:25.695
So what do we need?

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:29.835
First place, we need a method which will keep on executing.

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.925
So I have count,

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:34.440
I'm going to use the counter now.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.910
So dick, I have a variable called count is equal to 0.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.795
But what is the shadow would say integer, right? So int.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:48.650
So here I would write a method here.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.550
So static wide.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.375
So basically what I'm growing once the method called,

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:08.375
I'm gonna increment the count count we can use plus, plus.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.520
And then I have a chair here,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.090
is my count less than and equal to ten?

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.125
Then do this here.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:30.480
Count number less.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.665
Okay?

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:36.200
So now what I'm gonna do.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.185
So once the statement has been executed,

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:42.455
I'm going to call the same method again.

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:44.945
So basically what law, but it will walk like a four.

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:48.095
I'm in the while loop. So every time the method calls,

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:49.880
the account value is getting increased.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.770
So when it does reach it to 10, it automatically stops.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.104
In previous example, we don't have the control over the execution,

00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:02.870
but here do have a control over the execution,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.120
but without one conditions.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.825
Okay?

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:08.750
So let's call that a question matter here.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.290
So it's ready, Let's run it now.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.040
See, unlike the previous mater,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.200
now we have a proper outcome.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.345
We have Account 12 ten,

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:26.015
which means we should be able to control that a consonant flow based on some condition.

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:27.155
Right?

00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:30.710
So with this particular recursion example,

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.850
you can try a lot of things.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.784
You can try factorial numbers.

00:02:33.784 --> 00:02:37.880
Or if you want, you can dry. Everything is possible.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.875
It's up to your warning.

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:42.035
Its own implementation.

00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:47.840
If you want to decide something that needs to be keep on executing.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.765
But it has to stop at certain point and you need to write logic to that certain point.

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:57.680
What we did here, count less than or equal 10, something like that.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.650
Okay, so in the next video,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.425
we're going to talk over down another important concept called value.

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:09.180
Let's see each other next video.
