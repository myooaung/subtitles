00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.390
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.370
So we discussed about what is a bytecode and why do we need the bytecode?

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.010
And how we are going to create a bytecode.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.040
So we discussed in the previous video.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.515
So now let's talk about Java Development Kit.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.860
We keep talking about JDK, right?

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.860
So let's talk about briefly, what is the JDK.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.420
Jdk, you can simply call JDK the Java software.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.025
Okay? So dirty case that total kid,

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:39.815
which contains all the parts of the software.

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:42.155
For example, in this case,

00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:48.320
you're writing Java program unit compiler to compile the program.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.955
And you need a JRE,

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:54.245
which is nothing but the runtime environment where you can run the code.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:58.985
And we have a Java document and we have the Java debugger.

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:03.785
So these are all part of a JDK grid cell.

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:06.860
So whenever you install JDK,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.850
it contains all the items which we just mentioned here.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.540
Okay?

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.060
So in order to create and compile it and run a Java code,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.080
we need JDK installed on your machine. Correct?

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.350
So we want to write a program you energetic, you want to compare them.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.765
You want to execute them usually 30 K,

00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:30.230
because in the previous slide I mentioned for neither Java program,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.060
we need one, the GRE alone.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.590
I'm in DynamoDB enrollment.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.250
But in the next video we'll talk about JIRA and then I'll

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.870
tell you why we don't need the daily gain.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.380
And here it comes at the entire package.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.730
And the next slide we'll go to only the JRE.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.665
So now let's talk about Java Runtime Environment.

00:01:57.665 --> 00:02:01.220
In the previous slide, I mentioned by new install JDK,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.410
which is nothing but Java.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.260
Jdk along with GOT,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.315
which will be installed on your local machine.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.715
Okay, so what is the URI?

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:13.865
Okay, so yeah, these are into enrollment.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:18.020
So for example, some people are

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.835
writing some code in Java and they compile the code and they're giving it to me.

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:23.675
Okay?

00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:26.825
I don't have the JDK, for example, I'm end-user.

00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:30.665
Okay, I don't need the development tools and on I just need

00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:36.225
some virtual machine that I can run the Java code.

00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:38.800
So we need only GREs.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.410
And so GRE is a place where you can run the code.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.630
As I mentioned, a lj, are you the place value you can run the code.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.955
You wouldn't be able to develop our compiler code with the help of GRE,

00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:58.255
this execution part, our output part, okay?

00:02:58.255 --> 00:03:01.750
In order to write program and compile it,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.605
you need to have a JDK in place.

00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:10.810
Okay, so don't get too much confusion about the JDK,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.735
JRE, TVM and OK.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.060
So everything coupled together.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.060
When you install JDK year you'll be available,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.625
JVM will be available, right?

00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:24.365
So instead the JDK,

00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:29.930
all the development tools available inside the JRE one leader running components are

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.815
available for the support component which we needed to execute a Java program.

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:39.605
What is the support will be there.

00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:41.600
For example, I have a Windows,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.220
Linux, and Mac machines.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.445
Okay, So I'm developing some program in my math mission,

00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:49.955
okay, for example, HelloWorld.java, right?

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:51.440
And I compile the program.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.730
Now I have the bytecode,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.115
which is nothing but the helloworld dot class.

00:03:55.115 --> 00:03:59.045
So I will share the class file with Windows and Linux.

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:00.980
They don't need to do it again, please.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.040
They need one legi alone is enough because

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.430
they're not trying to modify the code or trying to compile the code,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.180
okay, they're just trying to execute the class value,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.844
which is nothing but the bytecode.

00:04:12.844 --> 00:04:15.740
So in order to execute the bytecode alone,

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.365
you just need the addie.

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:19.595
That's all we need.

00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:22.430
Okay, so the platform that you can execute

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.015
the code not to double up the core to develop beneath JDK.

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:29.270
To execute, we need JRE, right?

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.880
So let's meet each other next video with another concept.
