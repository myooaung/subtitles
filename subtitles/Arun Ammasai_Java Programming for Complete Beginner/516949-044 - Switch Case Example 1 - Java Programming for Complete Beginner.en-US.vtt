00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.470
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.155
Let's create an example and we'll go through how the switch case is going to walk.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:10.800
Okay, so let me create a new example here.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.330
Switch case example.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.800
Which case example.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.890
And let's have a main method in the class,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.630
Main Control Shift Enter. So what are we going to do?

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.110
The first thing, we need to initialize the value?

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.760
Are willing to provide any input, right?

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.859
So far now I have an int I is equal to some beta.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.270
Okay?

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.060
So now we will look closely to the switch.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.445
The first, we are going to open the switch.

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:44.450
Because when you highlight switchboard,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.410
you can choose which suits you are going to use and you need to pass the data. I.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.035
Correct.

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:53.330
So you're going to open a block here.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.350
So the switch, this is the example of a switchboard.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.525
And here instead you have multiple switches,

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:02.359
which is nothing but multiple cases.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.440
Right?

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.985
So let's create a case for each and every scenario.

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:14.660
The first one is case 1.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.940
And this is what I mentioned earlier,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.420
let me write here.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.140
So this is going to be switch case one.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.320
Okay? So the one thing that you mentioned in the PBO,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.680
right, the switch and gaze data has to be same type.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.885
So what are the data which you are passing to switch?

00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:37.130
It is an integer, right?

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.790
So that case values must be India.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.440
If you're passing string.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.150
Here, it has to be a string.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.160
We'll talk about data example.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.250
Okay, so let's have another case here.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.080
So case 2.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.440
This is a colon or semi-colon.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.730
So here is whenever switch case to copy paste it.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:12.415
Control C. See what happened and they have a same kinda case.

00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:14.800
We cannot have the same case rate.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.485
So case 3, 4, 5.

00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:23.480
And this is going to be default.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.620
If none of them are executer.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.030
The final default will be execute.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.855
Right?

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:41.260
So now we're pretty good. Correct?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.005
So let's assume what's going to happen.

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:46.825
So I'm going to pass to my switch.

00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:49.500
So the case one is not a fire.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.920
So it'll go to Outlook is five,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.060
so it will find out,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.280
okay, So the switch is receiving five,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.900
so five belongs to this case.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.705
So execute this particular case.

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:00.485
Okay?

00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:03.995
So let me run it again right now.

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:06.980
So now we have a switch case to also,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.350
okay, so this is going to be default.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.535
See what happened. I executed the case file.

00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:17.780
Let's run it again.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.140
So we have a switch case and also we have a default.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.285
So what our understanding is,

00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:24.980
if any of the cases are executed,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.305
Dan only dash to go to default.

00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:29.315
But why is which gets us coming up?

00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:30.890
Okay, let me pass another data here,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.270
three to show you the difference.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.110
See such case, 3,

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.065
4, 5, and also default case.

00:03:41.065 --> 00:03:42.625
So why is that?

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:44.635
It has to go to any one of the switch, right?

00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:46.135
Or any one of the case.

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:48.400
So that is the impact of a break.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.610
Okay, So basically what will happen if any of the keys has got

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.760
executed the following SSL continuously executor,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.920
so they don't know how to stop it a flow.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.585
So in order to do that,

00:03:58.585 --> 00:04:00.069
so if your requirement,

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.720
so we have one case is executed,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.465
I need to stop the flow. So what do you need to do?

00:04:04.465 --> 00:04:06.880
Introduce the break. So we'll,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.755
we'll talk over the break also.

00:04:08.755 --> 00:04:12.160
So each case has to break is optional.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.150
There are some scenarios you need a break.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.910
Not necessary.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.395
You don't need a break at all.

00:04:18.395 --> 00:04:21.875
So let me run it again now we'll see the outcome of it.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:26.855
See now we have one less which gets because once the switch get in,

00:04:26.855 --> 00:04:30.320
the flow will be a break.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.615
Okay. Let me pass something called since we don't have case 4, 6.

00:04:35.615 --> 00:04:36.725
Correct.

00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:43.340
So admin run it, see it when do default because it's not fall into any of the cases.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.930
Right. Okay.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.770
This is how that case will work and will break. I knew without a break.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.720
The next example I'm going to show you another example how this, which gives a look.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.270
We can see one real-time scenario. Thank you.
