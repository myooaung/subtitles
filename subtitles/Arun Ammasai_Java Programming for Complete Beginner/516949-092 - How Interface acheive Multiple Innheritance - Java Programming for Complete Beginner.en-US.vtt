00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.505
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:05.249
So before we are moving into some other example,

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:07.380
right, the one thing we should discuss,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.945
the interface is also part of achieving them multiple inheritance.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.885
Let's talk about how it looks like.

00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:18.550
Let me create a simple.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.650
So I'm going to create a simple diagram to show you what did the multiple inheritance.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.480
Okay, let's take an example here.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.865
Okay? So I have a protocol Mesa,

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:36.105
class 1 and class 2.

00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:36.930
Okay?

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.740
So I'm going to name this as a class one,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:48.365
and this is class two.

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:52.070
The same time I have another class,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.110
which means we can, we can call that as a client, actually our user.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.420
So this is a class and some other classes.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.029
Okay? So let's talk about the abstract.

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:08.240
So this is a class.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.985
Can abstract any of the classes,

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:15.600
but can it extend both classes at the same time?

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.060
Is it doing that? It's possible.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.355
We just not possible at all.

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:24.120
The ways.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.925
User. So this is multiple inheritance,

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:34.450
which is not possible like normally how we write.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.130
For example, classy, extensive class B.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.900
Class C extends class.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.910
But there is no way you can create something like class extends class B and class C,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.770
which is not possible at all.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.850
At any time. One class can only extend one another class.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.220
But in case of interface,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.740
the concept is little bit different.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.575
Okay, let's take our example again. Let me show you that.

00:02:02.575 --> 00:02:07.080
So this is an interface and designer interface.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.880
Correct?

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.890
And again, I have a class here,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.500
the similar way, I have another user here.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:21.965
Okay? So this is my user and this is my interface 1.

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:27.185
And this is my interface to

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:33.919
the scenario of an interface to a single class can implement two different interfaces,

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.590
which is possible. That isn't.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.030
Here.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:46.100
It extends. And here it's implements.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.100
So then this ending here, Hey,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.515
class cannot extend multiple classes,

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:58.540
which means multiple inheritance not supported to I2 that we came to interface.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.245
So interface, for example, we have a user.

00:03:05.245 --> 00:03:13.450
A user can implement the interface one along with the interface to show not only that,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.130
the class implements, class a and class B are introduced.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.710
One oriented is to,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.330
not only that, for example,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.860
I have an interface here.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.590
It may take even a bigger picture here.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.560
Okay? So what I'm going to do here,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.505
I can make it bigger, even bigger. Okay?

00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:38.530
So I'm going to draw something here.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.760
So this is my interface, right?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.040
And on more interface here,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.185
I have one here.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:50.050
So let me put it in as an example.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.855
So it is my interface three,

00:03:52.855 --> 00:03:57.130
and this is going to be my interface.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.725
And this is my interface, another interface.

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:05.815
So here I have three interfaces, okay?

00:04:05.815 --> 00:04:09.895
Just like class can implement multiple interfaces,

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:17.930
that interface itself, it can implement multiple interfaces like this.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.740
It might not exactly clear for

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.054
now because we are all seeing able to think about the diagrams.

00:04:25.054 --> 00:04:27.605
But when we implemented through an example,

00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:29.255
we should be able to understand that.

00:04:29.255 --> 00:04:31.640
So in the next example, what we're gonna do,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.135
we're going to create a multiple interfaces.

00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:38.795
And then we're going to create a class to implement both of them.

00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:42.830
And the similar way we are creating another interface which

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.820
implements the both of the interfaces though class and interfaces,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.040
both of them can implement multiple interfaces.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.200
That is a constant here. Okay, So

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.720
let's see it in the next video and we'll create a Xamarin for that.
