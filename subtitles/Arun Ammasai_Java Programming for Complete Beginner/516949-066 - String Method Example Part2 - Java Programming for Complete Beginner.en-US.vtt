00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.215
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.215 --> 00:00:05.685
Welcome back. So before we are moving to somebody and I just remember something.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:07.680
So when we talk about string examined read,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.230
I had read hashCode, current hashCode.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.650
It's not exactly the memory location,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.145
it's just a hashCode of this string value, whatever value profit.

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:19.230
If both of them have same value,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.000
the hashCode must be the same.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.280
Okay, the memory to retrieve the memory,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.950
our dislocation, and that is a different way to do that.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.780
But right now I am not exactly,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.280
I just forgot it right now.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.990
So what I can do it this far now,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.020
what you're going to remember is if you're using a string literal,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.825
it always create a,

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:40.305
it's not always create a new instance because it will check whether this existing,

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:41.995
existing it is going to share.

00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:43.475
Here it will create new one.

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:46.490
I will give you an example with how

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.540
to identify the memory location we'll talk about in some other video.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.340
Okay, So we tried lot of methods, right?

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.605
So we can try some other mentors also.

00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:01.355
So we can use if and if conditions.

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:04.040
And so let me think.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.830
So what are the methods that we can try it out?

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.625
So now let's, let me create one more variable here.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:16.385
String STR 4 is equal.

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:18.830
Let me have a null value here.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.060
Okay?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.485
So we have an option to find out whether the data is existing or not.

00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:28.025
So what I can do SDR for dot,

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.720
the method call is empty.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.010
It will turn a Boolean.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.550
If it is true,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.365
which means the string values empty or not.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.490
If it is false,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.960
which means it has some data in it.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:59.390
So a 100 to save it first and to Red Lake.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.775
And save it. Okay.

00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:08.405
So NullPointerException, okay, So I'm just putting the arithmetic.

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:10.445
So this is empty.

00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:14.465
So which means your string without anything.

00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:16.445
We shouldn't prove it now there.

00:02:16.445 --> 00:02:17.450
See, Now it is.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.245
They're doing isEmpty, which meant it had needed true. What that means?

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.450
Which means the string literal is AMD.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.040
I don't have any data in there because

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.990
the double-quotes indicated is going to be a string,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.315
but instead the string double quotes, I don't have anything.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.240
For example, if I have to flex.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.800
So now if I run it,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.180
I'll, I'll get files,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.130
which means my string is not empty,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.095
so I'm returning a file.

00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:42.110
Okay, so let's try one more matter here.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.190
So let's say replace.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.950
So I have a string for which contains tuple x, right?

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.935
So I don't want it, I want something else.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:49.685
Okay?

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:53.330
So what I'm gonna do SDR for dark,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.805
we can use the replace method with like some two inputs.

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:00.650
So the first thing,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.840
what is the value which you are trying to replace and what is a value for it.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.940
So I'm going to replace two blacks, right?

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.600
So triple X from triplex to I'm going to update to Hulk.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.640
So when you run this,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.230
you cannot see anything here.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.460
Because even though if you are trying to print since well,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.130
as therefore again, STR four,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.855
you can still see two blanks.

00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:30.320
I'll tell you why. I am getting through and triplex because Vieira,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.490
since they're replacing it,

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.215
but you're not storing it in any value.

00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:34.775
So if you want to know that,

00:03:34.775 --> 00:03:38.330
you're staring us in one monitoring SDR five.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.580
So now what'll happen? That string for

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.624
replaced to plug the hole candidate is stored in HDF5.

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:51.080
So if you're trying to print the STL file now you should be able to see Hulk, right?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.805
So within the replisome,

00:03:52.805 --> 00:03:54.275
we have a multiple methods.

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:55.550
So what I'm trying to do now,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.325
so I don't want to replace all of them.

00:03:58.325 --> 00:04:00.590
So we're gonna do something like this.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.350
Sdr for dot, replace fast.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.465
So what are the value you are trying to replace?

00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:16.860
I want to replace dx and replaced with y.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:27.170
So I can save this in another variable entity string STR 6 is equal to.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.750
So now I'm going to print this.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.010
So now we can print SD F6.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.440
Now, let's run it again.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.370
So now you should be able to see only the first occurrence has been changed.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.565
So you might think so what happen if I do only x here?

00:04:46.565 --> 00:04:48.665
I'll show you that.

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:53.495
See what happens in each and every x becomes a Hulk.

00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:54.500
Great.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.195
So triplex becomes triple Hulk.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:59.540
So the entire sequence is 11,

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.615
so I replace one of the ones before. Correct.

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:08.180
So since now I just providing only one search parameter,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.605
which means just search for x and replace one with the first one.

00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:14.060
The similar way we can do that,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.580
replace last L. So let's do that.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.535
So SDR seven and introductory place first,

00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:24.930
we can do replace last.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.730
Sorry, my buret is not the last.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.360
And I'm going to do the same thing here.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.220
So now let's see what happens.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.765
So SDS seven here,

00:05:41.765 --> 00:05:43.670
I'm going to do SDS seven.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.070
So all x becomes y.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.100
Now, you might think so what are the other metrics that are available?

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.800
If you want to know that, just click the street,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.960
press the Control and click it.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.540
It will open.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.995
Because now I'm, I'm, I'm,

00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:03.815
I'm seeing the class.

00:06:03.815 --> 00:06:06.560
But in case if we have it become pillory newer ID,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.390
it will show you the code itself.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.755
So now we can,

00:06:09.755 --> 00:06:12.425
even here you can see the methods somehow.

00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:15.425
Let's go down and see.

00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:22.820
It's pretty hard to see here. Research for Glenn.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.105
Okay?

00:06:28.105 --> 00:06:30.775
So or else you can simply do one other thing.

00:06:30.775 --> 00:06:37.360
Can go to the browser and Java.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.445
Drink.

00:06:39.445 --> 00:06:41.800
Because I wanted to show you well done.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.660
A number of methods are available.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.850
So you can check in yellow point

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.690
also because I pretty much to call morpho day examples from here.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.585
See how many whatsoever methods and the descriptions.

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:01.500
We have around 28 methods that are available.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.240
We just tried to only 10, 20.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.300
I mean, we don't want to take a maximum.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.310
We tried to integrate. You can try all of them.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.450
You can try trim and you can try index off.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.520
We can try and replace deliberately try and conquer.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.755
We tried MTV, tried equals.

00:07:18.755 --> 00:07:21.590
You can use it when you have a if conditions,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.590
whether if both objects are same, you can do that.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.100
Okay?

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.220
So what else? You can find a NIMA at the Sandy can give it a try if

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.310
you're not able to identify how to fix that or how to do that,

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.840
just let me know I can help you on that.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.290
Thank you.
