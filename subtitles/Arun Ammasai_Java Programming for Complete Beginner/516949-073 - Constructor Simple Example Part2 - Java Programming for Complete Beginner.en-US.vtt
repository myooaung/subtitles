00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.680
We are going to continue the construct our topic again.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.590
We know that basic playground, right?

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.975
Which means how to create a constructor, okay?

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:13.525
And we know how to call a constructor also.

00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:16.115
When you create a new object,

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:17.810
the controller will be called,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.895
which means a default constructor will be called.

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:25.130
For example, I have something called name here, string name.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.255
Okay?

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:30.365
So what I'm trying to do is I want to overwrite the data.

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:31.460
Correct?

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.270
So what basically I'm going to do,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.370
I want to print the name, okay,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.255
so what I'm going to do, I'm going to remove.

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.430
So what I'm going to do here.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.920
So I'm going to write a seesaw here.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.035
So I'm going to print the name from the object that's on.

00:00:54.035 --> 00:01:01.780
Okay, so what will happen if I render code because name it does not have anything.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.270
It's just the initialization declination is here,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.890
but there is no data in it.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.430
Obviously what will happen? We'll get null, right?

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.490
The contractor is called again because since we are

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.130
going to object for that matter, I mean for the class.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.850
So that counter is initialized and it is called executed.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.420
Now the object that mean it is becomes null.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.395
So using construct that we can overwrite the data.

00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:28.240
For example, you have a name, right?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.505
So you can override it here.

00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:34.720
This dot name.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.660
Or you can provide to our basics.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.650
Welcome to Java basics.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.155
You might think, what is this?

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:50.155
There are two key with this and super.

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:53.890
And we have a separate sections for that.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.485
We'll talk about in that particular video.

00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:58.630
So basically what I'm trying to do here for now,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.015
just forward that this dot,

00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:03.385
okay, So what, I'm just kidding, I haven't named here.

00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:07.435
So instead of the concept that I am sending some data to my name.

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:10.930
So this is what I mentioned earlier in the previous video.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.815
So when you create a new object contract or will be called.

00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:16.240
So now we can consider,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.025
okay, my data has been loaded.

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:18.910
Okay?

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.720
So the name has been updated now.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.330
So initially it was null,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.240
but I am it to call the name.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.380
I just created my object while creating the object using constructor,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.435
I just override my name.

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:37.100
So now when I'm random method while while executing the court,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.725
when the court comes into the line number 13,

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:44.945
this time, we have a data available because as a bottom line number 2 L,

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:49.400
These piece of code execute the contract and it will overwrite the data.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.430
So now you should be able to see the outcome of it.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.505
Right? Let's run it.

00:02:55.505 --> 00:02:58.280
So welcome to Java basics.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.945
It is pretty cool, right?

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:04.175
So using constructor, you can load some default settings.

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:11.570
I think it's still based on your needs and based on your requirement.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.310
Okay, in the next video,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.815
we're going to use the same constructor.

00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:20.885
And we're going to create a parameterized constructor.

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:25.985
So far we have discussed how we can use the default constructor, right?

00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:31.620
The next video, we'll talk about the parameterized constructor. Thank you.
