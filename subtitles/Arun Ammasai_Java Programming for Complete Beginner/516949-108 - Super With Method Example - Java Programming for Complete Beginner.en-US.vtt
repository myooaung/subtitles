00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.725
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:03.780
So just like variables,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.975
now we are going to work with super with my thoughts.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:11.175
All right, so I'm going to create a new class here.

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:13.710
Super width method example,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.020
sober with mentor example.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.150
Okay, So this is super cure rate.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.470
So we need to have a parent and child, right?

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.590
So I'm going to create some thing called Person class.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.810
So instead the person I have a method called wide.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.430
We can ensure my red shoe.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.540
So here I'm going to provide some data here as well.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.030
So here, message from Paulson shown.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.990
So copy this.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.060
Let's create one more child class,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.965
glass and person here,

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:04.415
student, student or employee.

00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:07.980
And here it's extense person.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.910
So A1 in inside my paws,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.490
I'm in student also how I show my dad been here.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.240
Okay.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.495
So now basically what we're trying to do.

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:24.290
Okay, so I'm going to create a main method here.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.140
Let me show you the normal way and then we'll use the super keyword.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.390
So student S is equal to new student.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.800
Okay? So now what I can do is as shown.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.000
So let me run the code c.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.615
Now what happened?

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:52.190
Message from store and shop.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.815
But what you were expecting.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:56.810
So in my child class,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.280
I have a short matter,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.800
but here I12 access the material from wind pattern class.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.870
How are you going to do that?

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.610
So I have a show method here.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.290
So the pretty simple ways using the super.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.445
So I'm going to try this.

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:29.465
Let me try and most important thing, super dot c.

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:30.755
Now what happened?

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:36.410
So before we are executing this core as a first line, character,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.160
as a first line, I provide a super dad show,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.875
which means I'm super admins base class, right?

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.020
So baseless, that show,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.325
babies class that show.

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:48.695
So now I'm gonna run this.

00:02:48.695 --> 00:02:53.885
So now the messages from me say from person show because the first time I'm calling it.

00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:56.585
And then the following code.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:59.090
But unlike that, I want to have

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.910
a different matter like so I don't want to create like that.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.170
So what I'm trying to do,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.920
I'm creating another Madonna wide display.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.250
So here what do you can simply do is I wanted to show the metallic here show.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.590
So basically what happened here,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.975
this show method, which is available inside my student class.

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:30.605
And then I'm going to use super dot show,

00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:32.600
which is available from my base class.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.610
And now I don't want to call the show method.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.880
Let me call the displacement or the I'm

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.120
calling the display method displacement that has the two lines of code. Which one?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.490
The first language we'll call the method inside my parent child class.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.095
But when I'm using super,

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:49.460
super mains base class,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.505
outbound class, so Person.all.

00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:54.200
So now let me run this.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.780
We should be able to see the message from

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.200
student and then a message from the person show.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.675
So this is how you make use of super keyword while you're working with a similar names.

00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:06.775
I'm not similar name.

00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:10.490
Same name. When it is available from the parent and the child.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.590
All right, so in the next example,

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.590
we're going to work with that constructor with the super keyword.
