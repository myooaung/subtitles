00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:03.480
So in the third example,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.190
so what are we going to discuss?

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.230
So using this keyword,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.505
we are going to return the instance of a class.

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:13.770
Okay, So let me create a new class.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.240
So I'm going to name as a key well Example 3.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.945
And let's have a main method in it and finish.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:24.420
So what are we trying to do now?

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.110
You are trying to I to the third option.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.270
Using this, you are going to return the instance of my current class, okay?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.850
So I'm going to copy paste a few things from here.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.500
Control C.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.480
And until we hear.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.560
And I'm going to change the name. And I don't need this.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.880
Okay? So here I how constructor and I can directly send some values here.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.520
X is equal to 10 and y is equal to 20 at it.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.155
Okay, so now what we're trying to do using this keyword,

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:14.815
I want to return the instance.

00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:17.319
Instance means the object reference.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:21.530
Okay, so in here what we're basically doing here,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.555
example, OBJ is equal to mu, mu this.

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:36.130
Okay? So basically what is happening here when you're creating an object, correct?

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.065
When you're using new keyword.

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:40.390
This is returning your instance of

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.445
this particular class through this object name or a friend's name.

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:49.285
So now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a method here.

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:53.905
So the method which needs to be written the same type.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:56.140
So I want written as incense of my classmates.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.225
It had it in the same class name, right?

00:01:58.225 --> 00:02:00.700
So I'm using GET method,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.410
I'm creating a name called AND gate.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:11.605
So return this pretty strange rate.

00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:14.860
So written this, which means it is going to return

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.965
the instance for this class because this is my return type of the method, right?

00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:23.740
So this returns this.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.165
If you're passing 10,

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:31.000
it will throw an error because we're supposed to return this keyword example tree type.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.620
So if you modify that, Sorry, written this.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.660
This means the current,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.085
what is the current class?

00:02:39.085 --> 00:02:41.740
Current classes this keyword example tree.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.690
So when you're using written this,

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.165
this will return the same instance type of a class. Got it.

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:52.940
So I think we can use the show method also here.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.280
So show mater, so what I'm gonna do is here.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.330
So I'm not going to use this object to call him at the,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.400
I'm going to use in this object and

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.650
calling this method through this method I'm going to call

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.560
this is a kind of going inside and going another inside the DO level in inside.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.100
So object dot the first one that I'm going to call it matter,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.415
which will then this keyword example tree object.

00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:26.380
Okay, So again, using that,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.365
I can use Git or the matter is you're trying to call show, right?

00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:37.780
So now you can run it and fear the outcome.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.855
C message from default constructor.

00:03:40.855 --> 00:03:42.850
Okay, I'm, I'm ordering the data here.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.150
So the value is for directories that contain comma 20.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.340
So what we can do here,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.860
I don't quite understand this line of code.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.885
So what you can do is basically

00:03:55.885 --> 00:03:59.320
this get method which will return the instance of the estimator, right?

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.580
So what I'm gonna do, so OBJ

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.450
for clear understanding I'm relating dig and so j dot getMethod.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.325
That's because this is going to run the same instance of the class, right?

00:04:15.325 --> 00:04:19.160
So what you can simply do here, Introduction OBJ.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.075
You can use OBJ one direction,

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:25.700
which is pretty much the same thing.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.480
You can run the code and you'll be getting the same outcome.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.330
That outcome, I mean,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.680
the takeaway from this particular example using this keyword,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.835
return the instance of the same class time.

00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:41.720
Okay?

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.285
So in the next example, we are going to use this keyword as a method parameter,

00:04:47.285 --> 00:04:51.210
passing as a parameter we'll talk about in the next video.
