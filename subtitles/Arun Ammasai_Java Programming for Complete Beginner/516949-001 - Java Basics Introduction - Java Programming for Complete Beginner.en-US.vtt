00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.955
Hello everyone.

00:00:06.955 --> 00:00:09.715
Welcome to Java for beginners.

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:12.850
So Java is always been an outstanding language,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.130
is more than a decade, right?

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.800
So let's jump into Java and let's learn how Java as working in the,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.620
how to become a programmer in Java.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.205
And Java.

00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:28.720
So what are the new things in Java?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.834
We're going to talk about everything,

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:33.010
each and every topic.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.855
But as a first step,

00:00:34.855 --> 00:00:37.570
let's talk about who can learn this course.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.935
So we need another right?

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:42.070
So because I'm being in a different profession, can I learn this course?

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.195
I am a college. Let's see who can learn the course.

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:55.240
Or your school shouldn't use the courts to choose your career as a Java?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.525
Yes, even, even do if you're a school shooting,

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.090
you still able to understand all the concepts which

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.670
is unwilling to x in this particular course.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.610
Because the way I descend the course,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.655
it is easy for anyone done that stand.

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:14.710
It doesn't matter whether you have any programming background.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.925
So since it is cool, if you're open to everything,

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:21.310
should walk this empty.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.170
You can put anything into your box.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.490
So if you're a school,

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.340
you're good to go.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.635
Okay?

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:28.850
I'm a college student.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.100
So how can I at least the course?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.915
You're college students.

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:34.910
So maybe not one or two years you are

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.250
becoming a graduated fellow and you're going out and you're looking for a job.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.810
So before we are going out,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.580
do you need to choose a path?

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.380
You need to choose a technology,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.450
how we're going to start way in a world altar of your correlation.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.150
So you need to pick a language.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.300
So in case if you want to learn Java,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.560
you can pick this one.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.185
Okay?

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:01.760
And I'm a software professional.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.185
Why do I need to get Java?

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:04.340
Okay, take an example.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.035
I'm into Testing Department.

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:08.780
I wanted to be in development.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.340
I want to learn something which can help me into my career.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.160
Okay, so you might have an ID or a banner on,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.275
but it doesn't know how to work with the Java are how to learn a programming.

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:29.030
So this course is for you, right?

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.790
It doesn't matter whether they are experienced.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.335
You are a fresher aria,

00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:34.879
new to computer technologies.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.985
Everyone can use the course to learn Java programming because the content,

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:46.940
which will cover from the beginning to the end to the beginning means how to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.200
get start the software and bad to get

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.090
started and how to get started and what to know everything,

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.095
right? Okay. First step.

00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:01.970
What do we need?

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.885
The software installation setup, right?

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.270
That is always the first priority.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.495
So we are going to work with the Java, right?

00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:16.100
So we need to install Java in our machine does the first primary task.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.810
Correct?

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.410
And before that, I'll tell you something.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.960
You might have seen the screenshot, right?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.070
There are 3 billion devices run on Java because this is not the exact numbers,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.155
but it is more than 3 billion right now.

00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:32.530
Okay?

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.140
So the first step, you need to know how to download Java.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.980
Because you know, if you know where to download.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.070
You can download and you can install.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.520
And then once you have the software with you,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.790
then you should be able to install it.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.905
There is a second primary and we need to know about JDK JRE.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:06.340
Jdk is the whole gate which contains everything with our needs.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.045
And new DACA would JDK and gt and what

00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:14.415
JDK is and what G or is everything in a brief manner.

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:17.240
In upcoming videos.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.330
Then N neuron MN setup, okay,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.860
I guess installed Java software and my mission, am I good to go?

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.690
Actually, you are not.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.735
There are few things we need to set up before we're jumping into an actual coding.

00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:33.755
Okay?

00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:37.820
So a few than the environment setup.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.855
That's it.

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:40.325
All set.

00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:43.415
We are good to go.

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:46.640
Okay, so let's see the next video.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.160
We'll talk about how we are going to download the software and

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.115
how we're going to install them in information.

00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:53.910
Thank you.
