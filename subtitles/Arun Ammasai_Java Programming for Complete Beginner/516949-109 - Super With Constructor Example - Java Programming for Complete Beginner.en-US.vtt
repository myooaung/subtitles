00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.640
So we tried the forest of possibilities,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.020
which means super width variable and super weak methods.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:17.650
So now let's try with super width constructor.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.340
Okay, so we are looking at Super right?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.025
So first thing we need a parent and a child.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.330
Correct?

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.925
So basically what I'm trying to do here,

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:31.680
let's create one base class, okay,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.075
and so I'm going to call as them.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:37.655
Glass person.

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:40.385
I think Posen must be there already.

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:41.270
Okay.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.610
No, there is no class available as an MR.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.005
Person. And then I have a class called student or employee.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.500
Employee extends the person.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.220
Got it. So you're looking at what is happening in person.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.530
It's already defined, so end-use person one.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.980
Yes. Okay, cool now,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.795
okay, so take a look at the code.

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:09.920
I have a class one,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.650
which is person one, and class two is for employee.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.915
An employee extends Person one.

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:20.465
Okay, so I'm going to create a connection to that default constructor, support person.

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:22.490
And that is a message,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.160
just provide some message system.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.580
So person, default constructor.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.680
Okay, so then we have an employee, right?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.660
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna create a constructor for my employee roles.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.605
And let me print something similar to this.

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:57.450
So here I'm going to print employee default constructor.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.215
Okay?

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.060
So now I'm going to have a main method.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.220
So I'm going to create an object for my employee because centres in the kind of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.870
shut down when I'm creating

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.625
a new object for my class automatically the contrary the column,

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:28.430
so I can call it as employee E is equal to new hotels.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.935
We just need a different person.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.660
You're gonna create something like this also whenever you

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.435
are using a new keyword and there's a class here,

00:02:35.435 --> 00:02:37.610
this particular concept that will be called,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.280
okay, so here I'm calling employee.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.880
So let me run this and I'll show you what is the outcome.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.295
So now we've got the outcome.

00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:54.050
So person default constructor and employee default constructor.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.595
Why I just created the object one lifo, new employee, right?

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.460
So how come motor them as an executor?

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.960
So there isn't because we are extending the person 1.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.970
So employee can have access to all the data.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.760
But there's a trick here.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.930
I want to access my person one,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.500
I'm in my parent class constructor while I'm calling my employee.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.295
Okay, So how we can do that?

00:03:24.295 --> 00:03:27.655
Simple, just provide super keyword here.

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:28.660
That's all.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.030
So when you're providing super keyword here,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.875
which is nothing but super means you were baseless our parent class person.

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:39.820
And this bracket belongs to That's index.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.630
So basically it is just like person one.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.295
So this is, the definition will be,

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:50.560
so super belong to the person one,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.165
because Uber is referring the base class or the parent class.

00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:56.920
And the base classes,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.680
Person 1 and the brackets.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.255
But you might think,

00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:02.920
if we're going to do this here,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.860
you can see I'm going to come in this line.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.480
Okay?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.510
There is one important point which you need to keep in mind whenever you are

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.869
using the super keyword inside the constructor,

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:18.370
made sure the super keyword should be the first line.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.625
It has to be and the first line.

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:23.815
Okay, So now what I'm gonna do,

00:04:23.815 --> 00:04:24.880
I'm gonna run the same code.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.555
Now.

00:04:25.555 --> 00:04:29.485
The person default constructor will execute because we called

00:04:29.485 --> 00:04:33.400
our base class constructor using

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.885
the super keyword and then the employee default constructor.

00:04:37.885 --> 00:04:42.415
So this is how you do make use of construct that.

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:44.680
If you want to give it a try,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.880
you can do one thing because constructor,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.805
the super keyword rate.

00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:52.445
Now we tried with no arguments.

00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:58.200
You can create some contrast that with some arguments and you can try to override that.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.490
And just give it a try and let me know if you're not able to.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.970
Thank you.
