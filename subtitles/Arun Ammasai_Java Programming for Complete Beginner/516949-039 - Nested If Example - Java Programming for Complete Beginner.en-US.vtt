00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:04.500
So let's continue with our example.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.200
So this time we're going to talk about nested IF example.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.210
So let's create a new class.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.765
So if you want to create a new class, just click controlling.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:14.790
And then you can choose whether you want to create

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.770
a class or interface or something else.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.330
So I went to class right now.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.265
Jillian said counter shipment.

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:26.495
So now I can create a method I'm in class called Nestor Example,

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:28.040
and I need to have a main method.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.220
And so first thing, main method.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.135
So MATIN and Control Space and Enter.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.320
Correct.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.525
So now let's decide what we're going to do.

00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:40.145
So the similar way I have,

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:41.465
we know the syntax, right?

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:45.275
If you've conditioned, if within the bracket you have a condition.

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:48.290
And then we have a block.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.420
That is if necessary,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.225
if means you'll have one motif inside the reef condition.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:58.745
Got it. So int num is equal to 50.

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:00.890
So let's try to normal if condition,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.380
if my condition is going to be num less than R is.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.290
So if this condition is satisfied,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.795
that means if it returns true,

00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:22.045
then it will go inside this particular block.

00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:23.785
So here what I'm gonna do,

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:33.950
this phone number is less than a 100.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.615
So here I have a one motif condition.

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:43.280
If num less than

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.635
or greater than 25.

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:52.960
So we'll have another block here.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.320
So if this condition is true,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.455
this block code will execute, right?

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:01.435
And then we have a one more condition.

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:03.250
If this condition is true,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.810
this block will be executed.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.665
Okay?

00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:10.600
So since O control space,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.150
and now we can provide some.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.560
So the reason why we are providing inside the double-quotes string,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.400
which will be needed to provide intended double-quotes.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.790
Alright, so now mess.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:38.080
So num is greater than 25.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.025
Got it.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:43.435
So let's assume what is going to be outcome for now.

00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:46.630
Number equal to 50 and less than five?

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.700
Yes, 50 less than a 100.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.750
And so here it is going to be 50 less than a 100.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.320
It is true. So if it is true, it will go inside.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.935
So it will print the number is less than a 100 guarded.

00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:04.255
And then again need to check num greater than 25.

00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:09.130
So here the condition is 50 greater than 25,

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.835
of course it's a true because if P is greater than 25,

00:03:12.835 --> 00:03:17.765
so again, this will dinner drew, right?

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:19.250
Then it'll go inside this block.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.885
So both will be print out.

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:21.680
Correct?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.460
Let's run this. See now

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.585
we have number is less than a 100 and also number is greater than 25.

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:31.505
So which makes sense,

00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:32.705
both of them are executed.

00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:35.075
Let's try to modify something here.

00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:39.545
Like let me modify the data to 20.

00:03:39.545 --> 00:03:45.230
So now two and t less than 0, which is true.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.900
So the number is less than a 100 we'll print.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.200
And the second one to one t greater than 25,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.540
it is false because p is smaller than 25 by the condition which you're checking.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.315
20 greater than 25,

00:03:58.315 --> 00:04:00.770
built enough else so it won't execute.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.450
This piece of code gets executed.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.640
So number is less than 100.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.625
This one will not print out the reason this particular wave plug which returns false.

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:20.630
So the block will be one layer if it's true.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.025
Right?

00:04:22.025 --> 00:04:26.520
So the next example we'll talk about what a field is going to do. Thank you.
