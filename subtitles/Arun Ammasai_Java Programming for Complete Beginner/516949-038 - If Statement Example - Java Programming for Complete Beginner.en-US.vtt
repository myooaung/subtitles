00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.140
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.115
Welcome back.

00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:07.260
So let's start with a statement that is the first one, right?

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.585
So let me create a new class.

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:11.520
Inside my control statement.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.835
I click new and new class fail.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:20.925
So if example, got it.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:23.295
So we don't need that test.

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:26.170
Says delete that one.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.990
Okay, so now we have a,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.925
for example, the first thing first,

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:36.720
if you want to execute some class,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.490
we need to have a main method.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.005
So write the main method.

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.840
So you might worry, I just typed domain,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.930
how come the public 31 automatically upon done that?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.680
It's a simple thing. So what basically you need to do is

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.260
a main and Control Space and Enter it automatically append.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.040
Okay?

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.880
So the first one, and this is going to be my if condition, right?

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.960
So if condition.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.490
So how the if conditional log,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.915
we know that syntax, right?

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:17.250
So the syntax is going to be IF AND condition.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.664
So what I'm telling the compiler,

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:24.920
if condition is true, then do this.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.840
If not, I don't want to do anything else, then do this.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.260
So first we need to write a condition. So what is the condition?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.600
So let's have a integer higher.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.160
So int number is equal to 100.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.390
So I have a variable which is called as a number, which contains 50.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.785
So I'm ticking.

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:49.535
Number is greater than or equal to 25.

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:52.385
So I'm taking whether 50 greater than.

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:55.340
So if you want to put it in a single lane, simple way.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.485
So this is the condition which I'm trying to check.

00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:01.685
So 50 greater than 25, which is true.

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:06.830
And here we are using the operator, comparison operator, right?

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.120
So these are already discussed in the previous sections.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.450
So what happens if num greater than 25 and

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.450
it is true then we are going to print a message.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.085
You might again think,

00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:21.995
start out dot print LN automatically up underwrite

00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:25.400
the simple thing type Cisco and control space.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.240
It automatically appendices for the print Allen.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.140
Okay, So I want to check num greater than 25.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.510
Yes, if it is true,

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:46.680
then send num is greater or bigger.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.795
Right?

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:51.475
So now I'm grading has got 25 is equal to,

00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:53.560
now Miss, be good.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.780
Because good.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.880
Okay, so now we can run the code and see what's going to happen.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.145
So if number is equal to greater than 25, then do this.

00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:10.420
Or else you will not do anything if it is true only you can do something.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.010
Now right-click the code.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.140
And then as Java application.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.685
So num is bigger, correct?

00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:21.385
So let's sing lead, put 20 here.

00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:26.290
So what happened here? So our code will only execute if the condition is true.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.225
So if the condition is true,

00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:31.020
then it will go inside the if block,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.760
which means it will present now must be good.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.440
Now I'm going to undertake gain.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.270
Now we can't see anything because it's not going inside the if condition.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.075
Right? So this is a simple way to work with if condition when you don't need to do what?

00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:57.485
For example, if you want to check something and then do this or else ignored it.

00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:04.460
So next one we have the nested IF condition instead if I allow one more if condition.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.560
So we'll talk over the next few examples.
