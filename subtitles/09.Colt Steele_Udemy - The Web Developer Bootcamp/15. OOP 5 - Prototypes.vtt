00:00:00.420  -->  00:00:01.470
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01.470  -->  00:00:04.840
In this video we're going to be talking about prototypes.

3

00:00:04.920  -->  00:00:10.590
We'll first understand what the prototype object is we'll then describe and diagram the relationship

4

00:00:10.590  -->  00:00:16.290
between Dunder Prato prototype and constructor will then add methods and properties on the prototype

5

00:00:16.290  -->  00:00:18.720
object to write more efficient code.

6

00:00:18.750  -->  00:00:23.730
And finally we'll be able to explain the difference between adding methods and properties to the prototype

7

00:00:24.060  -->  00:00:25.890
versus the constructor function.

8

00:00:26.370  -->  00:00:31.920
But before we get deep into prototypes Let's quickly review one more time with the new keyword does

9

00:00:32.610  -->  00:00:35.730
first it creates an object out of thin air.

10

00:00:35.730  -->  00:00:42.180
Second it sets the value of the key word this to be that object created in the previous step.

11

00:00:42.190  -->  00:00:46.200
Third it adds a return to the constructor function.

12

00:00:46.200  -->  00:00:53.280
Finally it creates a link which we can access as Dunder Prato between the object created and the prototype

13

00:00:53.280  -->  00:00:55.950
property of the constructor function.

14

00:00:55.950  -->  00:00:58.020
Let's talk a bit more about that point.

15

00:00:58.050  -->  00:01:01.330
Better yet let's diagram this relationship.

16

00:01:01.440  -->  00:01:03.170
Don't be too intimidated by this diagram.

17

00:01:03.240  -->  00:01:06.330
Let's walk through it step by step as a guide.

18

00:01:06.330  -->  00:01:10.280
A circle is a function and a square is an object.

19

00:01:10.290  -->  00:01:16.500
So here we have a person constructor function which has a property called prototype which is an object

20

00:01:17.250  -->  00:01:23.160
that object has a property on it called constructor which points back to the original constructor function

21

00:01:23.160  -->  00:01:24.360
.

22

00:01:24.360  -->  00:01:31.320
If properties or methods are placed on the person prototype they can be accessible from any object created

23

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:37.860
from that constructor function the way in which these objects which are created by the constructor function

24

00:01:38.190  -->  00:01:43.650
get access to the prototype object is through the donder Prato link.

25

00:01:43.890  -->  00:01:47.720
This link gets established when the new keyword is used.

26

00:01:47.940  -->  00:01:52.860
To recap every constructor function has a property on it called prototype.

27

00:01:52.860  -->  00:01:58.150
The prototype property is an object which can also have methods and properties attached to it.

28

00:01:58.200  -->  00:02:04.320
These methods and properties are shared and accessible by any object that is created from that constructor

29

00:02:04.320  -->  00:02:05.100
function.

30

00:02:05.130  -->  00:02:07.620
When the new keyword is used.

31

00:02:07.710  -->  00:02:10.360
Now let's see what this looks like with the code example.

32

00:02:10.410  -->  00:02:14.370
I'm going to copy and paste this code in the chrome console and we can walk through each line of it

33

00:02:14.370  -->  00:02:14.970
.

34

00:02:15.180  -->  00:02:20.560
First I have the constructor function called person with a property called name.

35

00:02:20.610  -->  00:02:26.220
Since I created a function we can already see that there is a property on the function called prototype

36

00:02:26.220  -->  00:02:27.480
.

37

00:02:27.480  -->  00:02:33.830
Now I'm going to create two objects called an LP from my constructor function using the new key.

38

00:02:34.350  -->  00:02:40.110
Since I use the new keyword a property has been added to each of these objects called Dunder produ which

39

00:02:40.110  -->  00:02:43.400
points to the prototype property on the person constructor.

40

00:02:43.710  -->  00:02:48.360
We'll discuss in the next video why this prototype property is so useful.

41

00:02:48.360  -->  00:02:53.910
Finally the prototype object has a property on it called constructor which points back to the original

42

00:02:53.910  -->  00:02:55.440
constructor function.

43

00:02:55.530  -->  00:03:00.540
The constructor property is not something you'll be using or manipulating frequently but it's an important

44

00:03:00.540  -->  00:03:06.150
part in a concept called inheritance which we'll discuss in another series before we end this video

45

00:03:06.150  -->  00:03:06.340
.

46

00:03:06.360  -->  00:03:11.070
I want to jump back a couple of slides to the diagram so that we can go over it one more time.

47

00:03:11.340  -->  00:03:15.480
Remember circles are functions and squares are objects.

48

00:03:15.480  -->  00:03:20.820
So here I have two objects called Ellie and cold which were created from the person constructor function

49

00:03:20.820  -->  00:03:21.270
.

50

00:03:21.270  -->  00:03:22.290
The green circle.

51

00:03:22.290  -->  00:03:24.780
Since I use the new keyword when I created them.

52

00:03:24.960  -->  00:03:30.960
Each of these objects has a property called Dunder Prado which points to the prototype property on the

53

00:03:30.960  -->  00:03:32.530
person constructor.

54

00:03:32.940  -->  00:03:38.010
In the next video we'll examine the prototype object and see just how useful it is.

55

00:03:38.010  -->  00:03:38.460
See that
