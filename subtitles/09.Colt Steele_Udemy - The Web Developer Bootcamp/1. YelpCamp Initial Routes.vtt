00:00:00.460  -->  00:00:05.250
Well come back in this video we're going to start on the Yelp camp application that we're going to work

2

00:00:05.250  -->  00:00:07.010
on for the rest of this course.

3

00:00:07.050  -->  00:00:09.280
We're going to start by getting the basic set up going.

4

00:00:09.280  -->  00:00:12.720
Getting express app going and having our first few routes and templates.

5

00:00:12.720  -->  00:00:17.490
But before we talk about that I just want to explain the workflow here and how this will work as we

6

00:00:17.490  -->  00:00:19.890
continually add different features.

7

00:00:19.950  -->  00:00:25.080
I want you to be able to see the code at any point in time I don't want you just to see the final solution

8

00:00:25.080  -->  00:00:25.370
.

9

00:00:25.380  -->  00:00:28.370
So what I'm going to do is work in different folders.

10

00:00:28.470  -->  00:00:33.610
So I have a yelp camp directory and then instead of Yelp camp I'm going to add different versions.

11

00:00:33.720  -->  00:00:34.970
So you don't have to do this.

12

00:00:35.040  -->  00:00:39.780
You'll be able to just continually add to one version yourself if you want to follow along and make

13

00:00:39.780  -->  00:00:40.710
different versions.

14

00:00:40.710  -->  00:00:45.570
I'll always point out which version we're on but the goal is that if you want it to look back at what

15

00:00:45.570  -->  00:00:51.570
I added between version 2 and version 3 You could open up the version 2 and version 3 directories and

16

00:00:51.570  -->  00:00:52.580
compare them.

17

00:00:52.960  -->  00:00:55.770
OK now that that's out of the way let's get started here.

18

00:00:55.830  -->  00:01:01.950
What we're going to do is set up the basic app will install Express and each Yes we'll get the views

19

00:01:01.950  -->  00:01:05.050
directory going and then we'll add two different routes.

20

00:01:05.130  -->  00:01:09.660
So we're going to have a home page basically like a welcome to Yelp camp.

21

00:01:09.840  -->  00:01:11.750
Here's a little blurb about what we do.

22

00:01:11.880  -->  00:01:12.750
Here's a sign up button.

23

00:01:12.750  -->  00:01:15.760
Here is a contact link that won't actually work just yet.

24

00:01:15.840  -->  00:01:21.060
And then from there we're going to create the campgrounds page which will be the main page of our app

25

00:01:21.270  -->  00:01:25.410
that will list all of the campgrounds in our database and we don't have a database yet.

26

00:01:25.410  -->  00:01:30.600
So it's just going to be an array of campground just like we did in the last video with the friends

27

00:01:30.660  -->  00:01:31.930
where we had an array of friends.

28

00:01:32.010  -->  00:01:38.100
Very soon we will be migrating to a new database for now a campground is only going to have two different

29

00:01:38.100  -->  00:01:39.530
pieces of information.

30

00:01:39.840  -->  00:01:44.880
By the end of the Course campgrounds will have 10 to 15 different pieces but for now it's just a name

31

00:01:45.180  -->  00:01:51.120
like salmon creek or Dewey point or whatever the name of our campground is and then we're going to have

32

00:01:51.120  -->  00:01:55.000
an image that we can display and the image will just be a u r l.

33

00:01:55.380  -->  00:01:56.460
So let's get going.

34

00:01:56.760  -->  00:02:04.110
I'll start by running NPM in it and then we'll hit enter here and enter again.

35

00:02:04.380  -->  00:02:07.810
We'll just call this the cam v1.

36

00:02:08.640  -->  00:02:11.990
I'll make apt such as my entry point.

37

00:02:12.480  -->  00:02:13.790
And there we go.

38

00:02:14.060  -->  00:02:17.670
Author and hit enter.

39

00:02:17.700  -->  00:02:18.550
One more time.

40

00:02:18.780  -->  00:02:19.300
OK.

41

00:02:19.500  -->  00:02:23.920
Now let's run NPM install Express and yes.

42

00:02:23.940  -->  00:02:25.320
Dash dash save.

43

00:02:25.410  -->  00:02:29.580
I haven't shown you this yet but this is a much easier way if you want to install multiple packages

44

00:02:29.580  -->  00:02:33.540
at once you just separate them by a space.

45

00:02:35.820  -->  00:02:43.300
And if you look at the package stub Jason you can see it has SJS and express.

46

00:02:44.160  -->  00:02:45.590
So now let's create the app.

47

00:02:45.680  -->  00:02:57.840
Yes and open that up and inside of here add our basic express importing which you should be pretty comfortable

48

00:02:57.840  -->  00:03:00.700
with right now require Express.

49

00:03:01.050  -->  00:03:10.700
And then the app variable equals express function being executed and then will jump down and do the

50

00:03:10.700  -->  00:03:15.570
opt out listen which also you should be pretty familiar with by now process.

51

00:03:15.610  -->  00:03:22.980
Ian VI port process that EMV IP and the callback

52

00:03:25.680  -->  00:03:34.510
and and here I'll do a consular log that says Yelp camp is started.

53

00:03:35.100  -->  00:03:42.000
Let's do the camp server just like that and save.

54

00:03:42.320  -->  00:03:45.510
And now let's go back and start by adding our landing page.

55

00:03:45.720  -->  00:03:49.210
And like most applications the landing page is on the right path.

56

00:03:49.440  -->  00:03:52.770
So we're just going to add an app that get flash

57

00:03:58.770  -->  00:04:04.410
and we'll start with just a redstart send to make sure things work OK and we'll just send this will

58

00:04:04.410  -->  00:04:13.080
be the landing page soon and save and then we'll start the server make sure we get the camp server had

59

00:04:13.080  -->  00:04:18.010
started and then we go back and just refresh on our route path.

60

00:04:18.300  -->  00:04:18.700
OK.

61

00:04:18.720  -->  00:04:21.690
And we get the response that's all we're looking for.

62

00:04:21.810  -->  00:04:28.230
Now let's go ahead and set up our templates so we need to make a news directory that make directory

63

00:04:28.830  -->  00:04:36.680
views and we'll make a template called landing that each of us inside the views directory landing.

64

00:04:36.810  -->  00:04:39.080
Yes there we go.

65

00:04:39.240  -->  00:04:47.580
And then we'll open that up use slash landing and we'll just put a very simple markup in here.

66

00:04:47.580  -->  00:04:54.030
Landing Page and then done here we can put a paragraph.

67

00:04:54.030  -->  00:04:56.340
Welcome to the Oprah camp.

68

00:04:56.340  -->  00:05:00.720
And of course this will all be changed and will be styled very differently by the end of the course

69

00:05:00.740  -->  00:05:00.900
.

70

00:05:01.110  -->  00:05:03.750
But for now we just want to make sure that things are working.

71

00:05:03.810  -->  00:05:05.110
Then let's go back to APT.

72

00:05:05.120  -->  00:05:05.770
Yes.

73

00:05:06.030  -->  00:05:12.470
And the first thing we'll do is change this so that it's a rest render landing and we'll leave off the

74

00:05:12.480  -->  00:05:12.880
dot.

75

00:05:13.000  -->  00:05:13.560
Yes.

76

00:05:13.770  -->  00:05:23.490
And to do that I need to add in the app set view engine to be J.S..

77

00:05:23.880  -->  00:05:25.100
And then we don't have to write.

78

00:05:25.120  -->  00:05:30.630
E.J. as here and we'll save restart the server.

79

00:05:30.900  -->  00:05:35.770
James refresh and we get our landing page template.

80

00:05:36.180  -->  00:05:37.400
Great.

81

00:05:37.410  -->  00:05:39.880
Next let's work on the campground route.

82

00:05:40.110  -->  00:05:46.470
So we're going to have an app to get and the you auroral should be slash campgrounds and this should

83

00:05:46.470  -->  00:05:50.910
show all of the campgrounds that we have which right now we don't have anything.

84

00:05:51.030  -->  00:05:56.820
But we will shortly to request and response just like this save.

85

00:05:57.060  -->  00:06:02.760
And then we need to define the campgrounds array which remember will only be an array temporarily.

86

00:06:02.750  -->  00:06:07.500
The next big change you're going to make is adding a database and having our campgrounds be saved to

87

00:06:07.500  -->  00:06:12.960
the database for now it's an array and each campground has a name and an image.

88

00:06:12.960  -->  00:06:14.350
So it's going to look like this.

89

00:06:14.580  -->  00:06:19.840
Or we have an array and then each item in the array is an object.

90

00:06:19.950  -->  00:06:27.630
And each one has a name and then let's just say name is Salmon Creek somewhere I went camping recently

91

00:06:28.040  -->  00:06:37.520
and then image and then it will be an URL of an image like HTP whatever that GWW image dotcom.

92

00:06:37.560  -->  00:06:38.190
There we go.

93

00:06:38.490  -->  00:06:40.560
And then we'll have an array of these.

94

00:06:40.740  -->  00:06:45.570
So we might have 10 different campgrounds 100 by the end of the course.

95

00:06:45.690  -->  00:06:50.460
And each one of them has a name and an image and then eventually they'll have things like Latitude and

96

00:06:50.460  -->  00:06:57.780
Longitude city and state address capacity seasonality all these different attributes but we're starting

97

00:06:57.770  -->  00:06:59.950
simple name and image.

98

00:07:00.600  -->  00:07:02.110
Let's go back to Apter Yes.

99

00:07:02.310  -->  00:07:09.140
And what we're going to do is to find that array and we can start by just doing it in here so far we'll

100

00:07:09.240  -->  00:07:11.900
call it campgrounds it equals an array.

101

00:07:12.210  -->  00:07:17.740
And then inside the array and just format this a little bit better as we go inside the array we're going

102

00:07:17.740  -->  00:07:19.660
to have some starter objects.

103

00:07:19.800  -->  00:07:25.590
And the first one will have name and I'll just go with Semon creek.

104

00:07:26.000  -->  00:07:30.210
You can just make anything up and will have image and I'll come back and fill in the images.

105

00:07:30.330  -->  00:07:38.940
And then the next one will do this make up another site we'll call it to Granites hill and then one

106

00:07:38.940  -->  00:07:44.580
more patrol call mountain goats breast.

107

00:07:44.580  -->  00:07:45.110
All right.

108

00:07:45.120  -->  00:07:48.960
So three campsites three totally fictional names and for images.

109

00:07:48.960  -->  00:07:53.540
I'm actually going to use some creative commons photos just so I don't run to any issues.

110

00:07:53.550  -->  00:07:57.690
These are not going to correspond to any of the camp sites that I've actually visited but I'm just going

111

00:07:57.690  -->  00:07:58.920
to pick some images here.

112

00:07:59.070  -->  00:08:01.540
Let's go with this one to start.

113

00:08:01.690  -->  00:08:07.550
So I'm going to copy the image you or I'll go back in here and that will be mountain goats rest.

114

00:08:07.590  -->  00:08:08.340
Why not.

115

00:08:08.630  -->  00:08:13.160
And then we'll go back again and I'll take this one here.

116

00:08:13.590  -->  00:08:17.800
Copy him into RL And this will be Salmon Creek.

117

00:08:18.300  -->  00:08:21.630
And then we need one more and I'll just take this one.

118

00:08:21.690  -->  00:08:26.180
Of course this is not really a campsite but that's beside the point here.

119

00:08:26.340  -->  00:08:31.390
I encourage you to use a real campsite names in real camp site images if you care.

120

00:08:31.440  -->  00:08:36.120
If not if you hate camping which is something I thought about I did worry that this might alienate some

121

00:08:36.120  -->  00:08:41.540
people but if you do hate camping which I guess is understandable you could easily change this application

122

00:08:41.550  -->  00:08:42.660
over to something else.

123

00:08:42.750  -->  00:08:48.890
Once we finish it you could make it into an event app a party's application a restaurant review site

124

00:08:49.010  -->  00:08:53.040
anything like that but I recommend you wait until the end of the Course to do that so that you don't

125

00:08:53.040  -->  00:08:55.990
get confused with naming and different variables that we have.

126

00:08:56.190  -->  00:09:03.180
So campground Today's For now fake campgrounds and will save make sure we add or commas in between the

127

00:09:03.170  -->  00:09:05.410
different elements in the array.

128

00:09:05.420  -->  00:09:12.410
There we go and we'll start by rendering a template redstart render and it's going to be called campgrounds

129

00:09:12.920  -->  00:09:15.170
and we're not going to pass the data through just yet.

130

00:09:15.170  -->  00:09:18.170
We're just going to make sure the template is working correctly.

131

00:09:18.380  -->  00:09:28.380
Now we need to stop the server touch a new file views slash campground ups that E.J. us and then we'll

132

00:09:28.380  -->  00:09:29.370
open that up.

133

00:09:31.370  -->  00:09:35.000
It's like that and in here we'll add an H1.

134

00:09:35.030  -->  00:09:44.510
This is the campground page and save and let's make sure that we see that page when we start the server

135

00:09:44.510  -->  00:09:52.850
up we can refresh and let's go to slash campgrounds and we get.

136

00:09:52.850  -->  00:09:54.190
This is the campgrounds page.

137

00:09:54.440  -->  00:09:57.430
And while we're here it would be nice to add some blinks.

138

00:09:57.470  -->  00:10:03.560
So I'm going to add a link to the landing page that says View all the campgrounds and to do that and

139

00:10:03.560  -->  00:10:10.400
need to go to the lending template and just at the bottom on an anchored tag at the ref attribute and

140

00:10:10.400  -->  00:10:13.490
the ATF needs to be slash campground.

141

00:10:13.820  -->  00:10:24.890
And I'll just say you all campgrounds and save restart the server refresh view of campgrounds now takes

142

00:10:24.890  -->  00:10:26.610
us to the campground page.

143

00:10:26.630  -->  00:10:32.400
All right so now let's go and make sure that we pass the data through our campground into the rest of

144

00:10:32.400  -->  00:10:38.770
the render call and then we can loop through all of it and display each image and each name in our template

145

00:10:39.410  -->  00:10:45.800
will start by going to update us and adding in that second argument here which is an object of all the

146

00:10:45.800  -->  00:10:52.690
data we want to pass through and we'll pass in campgrounds under the name campgrounds.

147

00:10:52.700  -->  00:10:57.220
So remember this is the data we're passing in and this is the name we want to give it.

148

00:10:57.320  -->  00:11:00.950
We could call this anything we wanted but it's common to see them name the same thing.

149

00:11:01.160  -->  00:11:09.080
So we'll save now and go back to our template and we'll start by just doing this campgrounds and if

150

00:11:09.080  -->  00:11:11.770
we see anything it will look like object object.

151

00:11:11.810  -->  00:11:17.420
If we've done it correctly then we know that we've passed the data through restart the server or refresh

152

00:11:17.910  -->  00:11:21.800
Rigaud an array with three objects inside.

153

00:11:22.740  -->  00:11:26.840
So now let's loop through and display each title or each name and image.

154

00:11:27.290  -->  00:11:32.020
So I'll keep these brackets here but I'll get rid of the equal sign and we'll do a for each.

155

00:11:32.150  -->  00:11:41.270
So that will be a campground for each and then pass in that anonymous function the callback and we'll

156

00:11:41.270  -->  00:11:47.810
call it campground and we'll hit enter here and then we need to go back and make sure that we add in

157

00:11:47.810  -->  00:11:55.010
the correct closing Ejay us brackets and then down here we need to enclose this with each us as well

158

00:11:55.020  -->  00:11:55.640
.

159

00:11:56.240  -->  00:11:56.880
OK.

160

00:11:57.080  -->  00:12:01.820
So that should loop through campgrounds and then what we want to do for each one we'll just display

161

00:12:01.820  -->  00:12:02.850
the name first.

162

00:12:03.080  -->  00:12:05.190
So we'll start with an ally.

163

00:12:05.270  -->  00:12:05.890
Why not.

164

00:12:06.050  -->  00:12:13.520
And we'll just do our E.J. s with the equal sign and all make some space so that it's a little easier

165

00:12:13.520  -->  00:12:14.700
to see what's happening.

166

00:12:14.900  -->  00:12:18.190
And we're just going to display inside the Y campground.

167

00:12:18.340  -->  00:12:22.750
Dot name and save all space that's out.

168

00:12:23.120  -->  00:12:28.460
Now let's load up the page and refresh this and we get three campground names.

169

00:12:28.460  -->  00:12:31.880
The last thing I want to do is make sure that we display the images.

170

00:12:31.880  -->  00:12:39.470
So we'll go back in here and rather than an ally let's change this so that we have a div tag for each

171

00:12:39.470  -->  00:12:40.290
campground.

172

00:12:40.400  -->  00:12:44.390
And in the div tag will display a h.

173

00:12:44.390  -->  00:12:52.530
Let's do a 4 with the campground name and then below it will put an image tag.

174

00:12:53.450  -->  00:13:00.950
And what we need to do is give the image a source and inside the quotes rather than a u r l like this

175

00:13:01.490  -->  00:13:08.120
whatever you are ELAS are going to put the image from the campground and we can't just do campground

176

00:13:08.300  -->  00:13:09.160
that image.

177

00:13:09.200  -->  00:13:11.030
We need those Ejay as brackets.

178

00:13:11.330  -->  00:13:16.540
So we have to do it inside the quotes which is a little confusing to some of my students at first because

179

00:13:16.550  -->  00:13:19.250
campground that image is already a string.

180

00:13:19.700  -->  00:13:25.160
And you can see here but remember that when we when we take this and add it into the template those

181

00:13:25.160  -->  00:13:26.820
quotes don't come along with it.

182

00:13:26.900  -->  00:13:28.350
It's just added as text.

183

00:13:28.430  -->  00:13:33.800
So it would look like this HTP colon slash whatever we need quotes around it.

184

00:13:33.980  -->  00:13:39.080
So we have to make sure that we're adding the Ejaz tags inside of the quotes just like that.

185

00:13:39.410  -->  00:13:39.770
OK.

186

00:13:39.800  -->  00:13:45.800
So then what we want to do is campground image make sure we use image.

187

00:13:45.800  -->  00:13:46.540
There we go.

188

00:13:46.760  -->  00:13:54.670
I am A-G and we have that spelled here the exact same way and I'll stop the server restarted.

189

00:13:54.980  -->  00:14:01.650
Let's go back and refresh the page and we get the three campgrounds with the three images.

190

00:14:01.670  -->  00:14:02.300
All right great.

191

00:14:02.300  -->  00:14:07.270
So that's all I want to do in this video was get the basic structure set up of our two routes.

192

00:14:07.280  -->  00:14:10.060
Let's go back to make sure we did all the things we set out to do.

193

00:14:10.340  -->  00:14:15.740
So at the landing page yes we did that at the campground page that lists all the campground.

194

00:14:15.860  -->  00:14:19.390
We also did that each campground has a name and an image.

195

00:14:19.400  -->  00:14:19.760
All right
