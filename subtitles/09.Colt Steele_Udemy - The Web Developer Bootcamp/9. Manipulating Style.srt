1

00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:05,870
A few videos ago I introduced this concept of selecting elements and then manipulating them.

2

00:00:06,120  -->  00:00:13,050
So we select an H1 or all image tags and then we can change the color or animate them or make them do

3

00:00:13,050  -->  00:00:14,660
something when you click on them.

4

00:00:14,670  -->  00:00:18,360
So far we've only covered the selecting half and this video.

5

00:00:18,360  -->  00:00:24,090
We're going to introduce a few of the many ways to manipulate elements once we've selected them.

6

00:00:24,120  -->  00:00:26,760
So here are the four main things I want to talk about.

7

00:00:26,970  -->  00:00:29,320
The first one is how do we change an element style.

8

00:00:29,340  -->  00:00:32,050
How do we make it blue or make it hide.

9

00:00:32,070  -->  00:00:34,070
Change the font size.

10

00:00:34,080  -->  00:00:40,320
Next up we'll talk about adding and removing classes with javascript and then changing the content of

11

00:00:40,320  -->  00:00:40,920
a tag.

12

00:00:41,010  -->  00:00:44,490
So how do I change the text inside of an H-1 tag for instance.

13

00:00:44,490  -->  00:00:46,590
And then lastly changing attributes.

14

00:00:46,590  -->  00:00:52,040
So how do we change the source on an image tag or the ref on an AA tag.

15

00:00:52,230  -->  00:00:55,260
We're going to get started by talking about the style property.

16

00:00:55,260  -->  00:01:00,900
So when the DOM is constructed and an individual node is made or an object is made for every single

17

00:01:00,900  -->  00:01:07,560
element there is a property called style and the style property is a huge object hundreds of properties

18

00:01:07,830  -->  00:01:11,220
one for every single CSSA property that we could set.

19

00:01:11,370  -->  00:01:15,460
So we can write javascript that will then go style and element differently.

20

00:01:15,480  -->  00:01:23,580
So here I'm selecting an element by its Id highlight so select it save it to a variable called tag and

21

00:01:23,580  -->  00:01:24,730
then manipulating it.

22

00:01:24,750  -->  00:01:26,370
And what I'm doing I'm setting.

23

00:01:26,370  -->  00:01:34,190
Tag dot style dot color to be blue tag dot style dot border equals 10 pixels solid red.

24

00:01:34,200  -->  00:01:37,830
It's important to note that the right side must be a string.

25

00:01:38,280  -->  00:01:43,430
So even though in C Ss we don't need to put quotes around blue or around 70 P x.

26

00:01:43,440  -->  00:01:44,730
This isn't C Ss.

27

00:01:44,730  -->  00:01:45,720
This is javascript.

28

00:01:45,720  -->  00:01:48,820
So we still have to follow the regular javascript rules.

29

00:01:49,080  -->  00:01:53,550
So I have a simple web page set up that I'm going to use to demonstrate some of these properties.

30

00:01:54,240  -->  00:02:00,190
So this web page is super simple just one H-1 a paragraph instead of that paragraph.

31

00:02:00,200  -->  00:02:05,310
There's a strong tag and then two images of two adorable corgi mixes.

32

00:02:05,640  -->  00:02:11,100
So what I'm going to do is go to the Consul and I need to start by selecting something and I'm going

33

00:02:11,100  -->  00:02:13,770
to change the color and the border of this H-1.

34

00:02:13,770  -->  00:02:19,470
So I need to select it and there's multiple ways to do that in a new document that queries selector

35

00:02:20,650  -->  00:02:22,800
H-1.

36

00:02:25,320  -->  00:02:33,030
And then I'm going to show you H-1 style which is a giant object tons and tons of properties.

37

00:02:33,600  -->  00:02:41,680
So I'm going to try changing one of them like H-1 style dark color and make that yellow.

38

00:02:42,520  -->  00:02:45,560
And you could see it immediately changed to yellow.

39

00:02:45,570  -->  00:02:54,300
Same thing with border H-1 that style that border equals let's do five pixels solid pink.

40

00:02:56,100  -->  00:02:56,950
And there we go.

41

00:02:57,210  -->  00:03:01,190
So of course if we just wanted this to be yellow with a pink border.

42

00:03:01,290  -->  00:03:04,910
From the time the page loaded there's no reason to use javascript to do that.

43

00:03:04,920  -->  00:03:09,990
We just put it in our CSSA file we would use javascript if we wanted it turned yellow and have a pink

44

00:03:09,990  -->  00:03:15,210
border when the user has been on the page for five seconds or if he wanted it to happen when the user

45

00:03:15,210  -->  00:03:18,670
scrolled to a specific part of the page or in the user clicked on something.

46

00:03:18,690  -->  00:03:23,450
It's all about making things interactive and we'll see how to do that shortly.

47

00:03:24,960  -->  00:03:29,310
Well the nice thing about using the style property is that if you find yourself manipulating a bunch

48

00:03:29,310  -->  00:03:35,430
of files on an individual element like I'm doing here and changing five different properties on this

49

00:03:35,430  -->  00:03:38,150
one tag there's definitely a better way.

50

00:03:38,460  -->  00:03:40,740
And there's a few reasons that there's a better way.

51

00:03:40,740  -->  00:03:43,350
The first one is that this is not very dry code.

52

00:03:43,350  -->  00:03:46,740
There's a lot of repeated tagged out style tagged style.

53

00:03:46,740  -->  00:03:50,670
More importantly though there is this concept called the separation of concerns.

54

00:03:50,820  -->  00:03:57,210
So the separation of concerns is this concept that our H M L R C S s not javascript.

55

00:03:57,210  -->  00:04:00,840
Are each responsible for their own little domain and we don't want it.

56

00:04:00,840  -->  00:04:02,830
We don't want a lot of crossover between them.

57

00:04:02,850  -->  00:04:08,190
So in this diagram you can see that there's a little bit of crossover between each team with which is

58

00:04:08,190  -->  00:04:12,930
the structure and javascript which is that behavior and then see assess is presentation.

59

00:04:12,930  -->  00:04:18,690
And there's a little overlap with H html javascript but remember that it used to be before C Ss came

60

00:04:18,690  -->  00:04:25,050
along you had to write your styles individually in every single element where we actually use the style

61

00:04:25,050  -->  00:04:25,840
attribute.

62

00:04:26,130  -->  00:04:32,310
In that case our presentation the styling was actually woven into the structure and with C Ss we now

63

00:04:32,310  -->  00:04:33,500
have separated them out.

64

00:04:33,570  -->  00:04:38,710
So our HMO is pure structure and then our success is pure style.

65

00:04:38,880  -->  00:04:44,430
So what javascript fits in is that it should control the behavior of a page and sometimes that means

66

00:04:44,460  -->  00:04:50,490
changing how things look but rather than just changing the properties inside the javascript actually

67

00:04:50,490  -->  00:04:52,620
doing the styling in the javascript.

68

00:04:52,680  -->  00:04:57,530
What we can do is turn them on and off inside of the CSSA file.

69

00:04:57,570  -->  00:05:04,270
So one of the patterns that's really common is that we define a CSSA class like highlight and that highlight

70

00:05:04,270  -->  00:05:08,380
class will have five or six or however many different properties that we're changing.

71

00:05:08,380  -->  00:05:13,210
And then we can then select an element with javascript and give it that highlight class.

72

00:05:13,210  -->  00:05:18,930
So in Javascript with one line we can add a class that will then change five different properties.

73

00:05:19,150  -->  00:05:22,660
Let's take a look at how this would be implemented in Javascript.

74

00:05:22,690  -->  00:05:29,020
So rather than selecting a tag and then changing style but color to be blue and then styled up border

75

00:05:29,020  -->  00:05:35,770
to be 10 pixel solid red what we could do instead is to find a class in that class could be called anything

76

00:05:35,770  -->  00:05:36,200
.

77

00:05:36,250  -->  00:05:41,940
Usually you want it to be somewhat meaningful so reflecting what the class is supposed to do.

78

00:05:42,040  -->  00:05:45,040
Is it something that's being highlighted or is it a correct answer.

79

00:05:45,040  -->  00:05:49,840
A high score for whatever reason that you're applying the class trying come up with a good name.

80

00:05:50,170  -->  00:05:56,320
So this is not a good name but some class some class is changing the color to be blue and border 10

81

00:05:56,320  -->  00:05:57,820
pixel solid red.

82

00:05:57,820  -->  00:06:06,280
Then all I have to do is select my tag and then tag dot class list dot add some class and that will

83

00:06:06,310  -->  00:06:12,730
give my tag with the idea of highlight a new class called some class in all of these styles will be

84

00:06:12,730  -->  00:06:13,790
applied.

85

00:06:13,810  -->  00:06:16,030
There's a few other things we can do with class list.

86

00:06:16,270  -->  00:06:22,990
So in this example I show three methods add which we already saw which is how we can add a class remove

87

00:06:23,020  -->  00:06:29,200
which takes a class name and it removes that class name from the class list and then class list toggle

88

00:06:29,230  -->  00:06:30,760
which is extremely useful.

89

00:06:30,760  -->  00:06:31,960
It takes a class name.

90

00:06:32,080  -->  00:06:37,570
And if the given element has that class already it will then remove it if the element doesn't have that

91

00:06:37,570  -->  00:06:39,270
class then I will turn it on.

92

00:06:39,280  -->  00:06:40,550
So very very useful.

93

00:06:40,630  -->  00:06:42,180
We'll use it all the time later on.

94

00:06:42,400  -->  00:06:46,990
So let me demonstrate that to you before I go back to my example here.

95

00:06:46,990  -->  00:06:49,300
I'm actually going to define a new class.

96

00:06:49,690  -->  00:06:58,630
So rather than making a new style sheet and using a link I'm just going to use a style tag just for

97

00:06:59,500  -->  00:07:00,390
the sake of time.

98

00:07:00,530  -->  00:07:04,140
So I'm going to define a class you're just going to call it big.

99

00:07:04,990  -->  00:07:14,320
And what I'm going to do is change the font size to be 100 pixels and change the color to be orange

100

00:07:14,340  -->  00:07:14,670
.

101

00:07:15,010  -->  00:07:22,540
And then lastly let's give it a border of five pixel solid red.

102

00:07:22,960  -->  00:07:24,280
So I'll leave it at that.

103

00:07:24,370  -->  00:07:30,700
If I refresh my page nothing changes of course but when I want to do is apply that class to something

104

00:07:30,700  -->  00:07:30,900
.

105

00:07:30,950  -->  00:07:37,120
So I'm going to make this paragraph have the big class to do that I need to select it so far.

106

00:07:37,120  -->  00:07:44,900
Paragraph equals document that query selector paragraph.

107

00:07:47,180  -->  00:07:47,820
OK.

108

00:07:48,010  -->  00:07:53,130
And let's just start by taking a look at class list and you can see that it's empty.

109

00:07:53,140  -->  00:07:55,970
There are no classes assigned to this paragraph yet.

110

00:07:56,140  -->  00:08:04,090
So if I want to assign one all I need to do is say P-Dub class list dot add and I want to add the class

111

00:08:04,180  -->  00:08:05,310
big.

112

00:08:06,190  -->  00:08:07,240
And there we go.

113

00:08:07,720  -->  00:08:11,370
So it automatically reflects the new changes from my style sheet.

114

00:08:11,440  -->  00:08:13,540
All I had to do is add the big class.

115

00:08:13,780  -->  00:08:18,880
So hopefully you can see that this is a lot easier and that we're separating the responsibilities.

116

00:08:18,880  -->  00:08:24,940
So all that are javascript does is it turns on or off a specific part of the SS rather than actually

117

00:08:24,940  -->  00:08:27,610
manually manipulating individual properties.

118

00:08:27,610  -->  00:08:32,120
We're now just changing things as little as possible instead of our Javascript.

119

00:08:32,470  -->  00:08:42,430
So if I want to remove it all I need to do is do class classless not remove big and my favorite one

120

00:08:42,610  -->  00:08:45,940
which I mentioned is super useful is toggle.

121

00:08:45,940  -->  00:08:52,170
So if I hit toggle right now and hit enter there is no class assigned so it will assign it the class

122

00:08:52,180  -->  00:08:52,940
big.

123

00:08:53,320  -->  00:08:56,420
Now big is already assigned so it will remove it.

124

00:08:56,440  -->  00:09:04,030
So this is useful obviously not in this case to make this crazy orange in huge font class but what we

125

00:09:04,030  -->  00:09:09,610
might do is on something like a to do list if we want the user to be able to click on it to do.

126

00:09:09,880  -->  00:09:11,440
And that will cross it out.

127

00:09:11,650  -->  00:09:15,400
But they can click again and then it will uncross out or just go back to normal.

128

00:09:15,430  -->  00:09:16,400
That would be done.

129

00:09:16,410  -->  00:09:23,080
Or we could do it by toggling a class so we could have a class called done and I click applied click

130

00:09:23,080  -->  00:09:23,700
again.

131

00:09:23,800  -->  00:09:24,820
It's removed.

132

00:09:24,820  -->  00:09:27,000
That's just one example of when you might use toggle.

133

00:09:27,100  -->  00:09:29,740
But it's really really useful.

134

00:09:29,740  -->  00:09:34,090
The last point I'll bring up about class list is that it's technically not an array.

135

00:09:34,090  -->  00:09:37,840
So that means that we have to use an ad in order to add a class.

136

00:09:37,870  -->  00:09:39,900
We can't do something like push.

137

00:09:40,150  -->  00:09:44,000
So just a minor note but it's important to know that it's not technically an array.

138

00:09:44,470  -->  00:09:48,260
So we covered two different ways of manipulating style through our javascript.

139

00:09:48,280  -->  00:09:53,980
The first one is doing it manually one property at a time which is it's honestly fine if you're just

140

00:09:53,980  -->  00:09:55,340
doing one or two things.

141

00:09:55,690  -->  00:10:01,150
But if you're doing it in a batch or you're doing it to multiple elements it's much better more conventional

142

00:10:01,180  -->  00:10:04,930
better style to use a class and just turn the class on or off
