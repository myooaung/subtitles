00:00:00.110  -->  00:00:04.410
Well come back in the next few videos we're going to work on adding comments to your camp.

2

00:00:04.560  -->  00:00:08.280
So currently all that we have is a list of campgrounds.

3

00:00:08.450  -->  00:00:12.930
And when I click on a campground to go to the show page we see some information about it.

4

00:00:13.200  -->  00:00:18.270
But what we want to happen is for there to be a list of comments or reviews here and then a button that

5

00:00:18.270  -->  00:00:23.440
says I had a new review and we can then click on that and go to a form submit a new comment.

6

00:00:23.460  -->  00:00:26.560
Now take us back here and we'll see a list of comments.

7

00:00:27.000  -->  00:00:29.290
So there's a lot of stuff involved in getting that to work.

8

00:00:29.460  -->  00:00:31.120
We have to create the comment model.

9

00:00:31.140  -->  00:00:33.530
We have to associate it with the campground model.

10

00:00:33.530  -->  00:00:37.740
We have to require all the files correctly then we have to create all the routes that we have to create

11

00:00:37.740  -->  00:00:38.870
all the views.

12

00:00:39.540  -->  00:00:41.310
But we're actually going to start somewhere else.

13

00:00:41.430  -->  00:00:44.290
We're going to start by creating what's called a seed's file.

14

00:00:44.520  -->  00:00:49.340
And the point of a seed's file is that we can run it to seed our database with some data.

15

00:00:49.560  -->  00:00:53.240
So right now we have four campgrounds in the database.

16

00:00:53.430  -->  00:00:58.710
But what I want to do is write a file that I can run and what that file will do is empty everything

17

00:00:58.710  -->  00:01:03.240
in my database to start and then it's going to go in add in three or four campgrounds.

18

00:01:03.330  -->  00:01:04.910
And each one will have a few comments.

19

00:01:04.920  -->  00:01:07.080
So we have some sample data to work with.

20

00:01:07.140  -->  00:01:12.060
And the reason I'm doing this is so that when we add comments in we'll have a way to see immediately

21

00:01:12.060  -->  00:01:13.580
if the comments are working or not.

22

00:01:13.920  -->  00:01:18.810
Otherwise once we create the comment model then we'd have to get the comment new and create route working

23

00:01:18.820  -->  00:01:19.090
.

24

00:01:19.290  -->  00:01:23.260
And we have to do a lot more work before we can even tell if our comments are set up correctly.

25

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:28.730
So we're going to create a seed's file going to do that right now in the same directory.

26

00:01:28.800  -->  00:01:30.530
I'm still working in version 3.

27

00:01:30.630  -->  00:01:34.300
I'm going to create a new file called seeds that yes.

28

00:01:34.890  -->  00:01:38.630
And I'll open that up.

29

00:01:38.820  -->  00:01:44.100
So to reiterate in here we're going to create a bunch of campgrounds and a few comments for each campground

30

00:01:44.110  -->  00:01:44.240
.

31

00:01:44.430  -->  00:01:49.170
And at first we're going to get errors and this is what some people call error driven development where

32

00:01:49.170  -->  00:01:50.960
we write some code that we want to work.

33

00:01:51.180  -->  00:01:55.590
We get an error and then we write some code to make that error go away and then we keep doing that until

34

00:01:55.590  -->  00:01:56.460
it works.

35

00:01:56.460  -->  00:01:58.260
So we're going to require mongoose first

36

00:02:01.230  -->  00:02:07.630
just like that and then we're going to require a campground and that will be require.

37

00:02:07.680  -->  00:02:11.330
And this is in the models directory slash camp ground.

38

00:02:11.960  -->  00:02:15.810
And I need quotes can't forget that.

39

00:02:15.810  -->  00:02:17.270
There we go.

40

00:02:17.340  -->  00:02:20.890
And then what we want to do to start is just wipe everything out of our database.

41

00:02:21.030  -->  00:02:26.240
And the easiest way to do that with Mongoose is campground remove.

42

00:02:26.790  -->  00:02:32.940
And we're just going to ask it to remove everything and then we'll add in a callback function error

43

00:02:32.960  -->  00:02:33.550
.

44

00:02:34.800  -->  00:02:41.520
And then here just add a console that log removed campgrounds

45

00:02:44.840  -->  00:02:48.080
and let's see what our error is here expected error to be handled.

46

00:02:48.210  -->  00:02:55.110
OK so technically that's not a deal breaker but if we do get an error we'll add cancel that log error

47

00:02:55.230  -->  00:02:56.670
right here.

48

00:02:56.700  -->  00:02:59.730
The next thing I want to talk about is how we're going to run this file.

49

00:02:59.880  -->  00:03:06.150
So in my app taught us what I want to be able to do is actually require the seeds file and we'll call

50

00:03:06.150  -->  00:03:16.830
it something like seed D.B and that should be equal to requiring dot slash seed's which is the name

51

00:03:16.830  -->  00:03:20.570
of our file right here seeds and that in the same directory is actually yes.

52

00:03:20.700  -->  00:03:26.570
So we need the dot slash and then I want to be able to execute it afterwards and do something like seed

53

00:03:26.580  -->  00:03:30.200
the database seeded be at the beginning.

54

00:03:30.210  -->  00:03:33.450
Every time we start the server over this code should run.

55

00:03:33.600  -->  00:03:37.440
Right now though when we require this file we're not exporting anything.

56

00:03:37.710  -->  00:03:39.600
And we want to export a function.

57

00:03:39.630  -->  00:03:42.580
So let's go back and let's just write a function here.

58

00:03:42.720  -->  00:03:46.310
Function seed DBI.

59

00:03:47.190  -->  00:03:55.530
And we're going to move this code into here just like that and indent this a bit and then we're going

60

00:03:55.530  -->  00:04:00.250
to do a module that exports equals seed DB.

61

00:04:01.110  -->  00:04:02.240
Just like that.

62

00:04:02.310  -->  00:04:10.050
And so this will send this function out and it will be stored inside of CDB here and then we can execute

63

00:04:10.050  -->  00:04:15.210
it and it will run whatever's in this function and all that it does right now is removes all campgrounds

64

00:04:15.230  -->  00:04:15.590
.

65

00:04:15.930  -->  00:04:20.120
So if it works when we load up the page all the campground should be gone.

66

00:04:20.790  -->  00:04:25.620
Which seems a little counterintuitive for now but this will make more sense when we have the Creation

67

00:04:25.620  -->  00:04:26.490
working too.

68

00:04:26.790  -->  00:04:27.980
So let's do this now.

69

00:04:28.170  -->  00:04:32.480
Node Aptor Yes we get removed campgrounds.

70

00:04:32.490  -->  00:04:35.760
So call this function if we are fresh.

71

00:04:36.030  -->  00:04:37.940
We now have no campgrounds.

72

00:04:37.950  -->  00:04:38.580
All right.

73

00:04:39.000  -->  00:04:41.670
So let's clean this up and out a little comment here.

74

00:04:41.670  -->  00:04:47.700
Remove all campgrounds then what we want to do next is add in a few campgrounds.

75

00:04:48.030  -->  00:04:54.680
So add a few campgrounds and then we also want to add a few comments eventually.

76

00:04:55.380  -->  00:04:56.840
Let's start with the campground.

77

00:04:57.240  -->  00:05:01.080
So to create a campground we need to do a campground created.

78

00:05:01.440  -->  00:05:03.030
And we need to pass in data.

79

00:05:03.180  -->  00:05:07.500
But if we want to create a bunch of different campgrounds when I'm going to do is actually find some

80

00:05:07.500  -->  00:05:09.850
data up here we'll just call it data.

81

00:05:10.160  -->  00:05:11.210
And it's an array.

82

00:05:11.490  -->  00:05:17.610
And in that array going to have a few objects and each object is going to be the starter data or the

83

00:05:17.880  -->  00:05:19.570
data for one campground.

84

00:05:19.650  -->  00:05:27.150
So we'll have name and we'll just do Cloud's rest again and then I'll get a new photo or use this one

85

00:05:27.150  -->  00:05:28.280
for now.

86

00:05:30.620  -->  00:05:35.980
And then that will be image and then format this a little bit nicer.

87

00:05:36.580  -->  00:05:42.430
Let's put this on separate lines and then we need a description as well and our description will just

88

00:05:42.430  -->  00:05:44.480
be blah blah blah.

89

00:05:45.040  -->  00:05:52.930
OK so that's one piece of data and then I'm going to add in at least two more just like that and we'll

90

00:05:52.930  -->  00:05:54.410
do one more now.

91

00:05:55.210  -->  00:05:57.120
So we have three starter pieces of data.

92

00:05:57.130  -->  00:05:58.770
I will change the images.

93

00:05:59.020  -->  00:06:01.030
So let's take this one as an image

94

00:06:06.250  -->  00:06:10.890
and we'll call this desert Mesa or something like that.

95

00:06:11.140  -->  00:06:15.960
And then we'll add one more in and we'll go with this right here.

96

00:06:16.030  -->  00:06:24.430
Copy the image or L and we'll call this canyon floor and I'll paste that image in and then we'll keep

97

00:06:24.430  -->  00:06:25.790
the same description.

98

00:06:25.810  -->  00:06:26.040
All right.

99

00:06:26.050  -->  00:06:31.390
So what we've done so far we're not using this yet but we've to find an array that has three pieces

100

00:06:31.390  -->  00:06:37.060
of data and each one is an object that has a name image and description which is exactly what our model

101

00:06:37.060  -->  00:06:38.020
was expecting.

102

00:06:38.020  -->  00:06:42.490
If we go over here model his name image and description.

103

00:06:42.900  -->  00:06:43.230
OK.

104

00:06:43.240  -->  00:06:49.780
So then what we need to do is actually loop through this data and create a campground for each one so

105

00:06:49.780  -->  00:06:51.270
we can do it for each.

106

00:06:51.280  -->  00:06:53.390
So I'll do that right now.

107

00:06:53.500  -->  00:07:02.600
We'll do a data for each function and we'll just call it seed.

108

00:07:02.620  -->  00:07:05.190
So that seed is going to represent one of these.

109

00:07:05.410  -->  00:07:12.310
And then inside the loop we're going to do a campground or do you have it written here campgrounds create

110

00:07:13.040  -->  00:07:18.430
and what we're going to pass in is not an object in curly braces to give it seed just like that.

111

00:07:18.700  -->  00:07:26.040
And then our function here and this will have error and we'll also have data and we'll do it.

112

00:07:26.080  -->  00:07:36.460
If there's an error cancel out log error else Council vote log and we'll just you added a campground

113

00:07:36.470  -->  00:07:37.430
.

114

00:07:38.410  -->  00:07:44.170
So we've created this array of starter data three different objects that we want to add to the database

115

00:07:44.710  -->  00:07:50.120
and then we're looping through that and we're adding each one using campgrounds create.

116

00:07:50.140  -->  00:07:57.880
So if we run this now if we restart the server we should see Yelp server had started up camp server

117

00:07:58.090  -->  00:08:03.760
added a campground added campground added campground and then we get removed campgrounds and that might

118

00:08:03.760  -->  00:08:05.150
not be what you're expecting.

119

00:08:05.290  -->  00:08:07.970
But the reason that that's happening is really important.

120

00:08:08.020  -->  00:08:09.840
This is why we use callbacks.

121

00:08:10.030  -->  00:08:17.170
So remember when we run campgrounds remove there's no guarantee that this code is going to happen after

122

00:08:17.170  -->  00:08:20.290
this finishes unless we put it inside the callback.

123

00:08:20.320  -->  00:08:27.790
So we actually want to move all of this inside of this callback here right there campground out remove

124

00:08:28.690  -->  00:08:34.410
and we'll just paste that in and we'll indent this just like that.

125

00:08:34.720  -->  00:08:40.300
So what this will do now is wait until we remove all the existing campgrounds and then will add in our

126

00:08:40.300  -->  00:08:41.800
new campgrounds.

127

00:08:41.800  -->  00:08:42.260
All right.

128

00:08:42.490  -->  00:08:48.080
So now we should see those in a different order and we get removed campground added added added.

129

00:08:48.230  -->  00:08:52.620
And if we refresh we now see those three campgrounds.

130

00:08:52.990  -->  00:08:53.220
OK.

131

00:08:53.230  -->  00:08:58.990
So we have our sea data working now we want to work on comments and the way that I'm going to do this

132

00:08:58.990  -->  00:09:06.550
is after we create a campground inside the else I'm going to create our comments on each campground

133

00:09:06.850  -->  00:09:09.370
and we'll just do the same comment this time.

134

00:09:09.370  -->  00:09:15.610
So what we want to do is run comments that create which doesn't exist yet it's not going to work and

135

00:09:15.610  -->  00:09:17.060
that's fine we'll get an error.

136

00:09:17.380  -->  00:09:25.600
And the comment that we're going to create we'll have a text of this place is great but I wish there

137

00:09:25.600  -->  00:09:29.280
was Internet and let's form at this a little bit better.

138

00:09:29.290  -->  00:09:36.010
So we're going to create this comment that has text and will have an author of Homer.

139

00:09:36.530  -->  00:09:42.850
OK so this will create a comment and then we need our callback here function error and then the comment

140

00:09:42.880  -->  00:09:48.170
that was created you can see this is getting out of hand quickly with all these comments.

141

00:09:48.310  -->  00:09:50.440
You will see a way to refactor this soon.

142

00:09:50.440  -->  00:09:52.460
This is what's called Colback hell.

143

00:09:52.510  -->  00:09:59.200
If so many callbacks So this will run once the comment has created and once it is created we then want

144

00:09:59.200  -->  00:10:03.970
to associate it with the campground and then we're going to grab the campground that was created which

145

00:10:03.970  -->  00:10:05.450
we're currently calling data.

146

00:10:05.710  -->  00:10:11.170
And rather than calling it data let's just call it campground and then down here we're going to do a

147

00:10:11.260  -->  00:10:19.900
campground dot comments up push the new comment that we just created that has this text and this author

148

00:10:19.910  -->  00:10:20.200
.

149

00:10:20.440  -->  00:10:22.400
I don't need a comma here as well.

150

00:10:23.230  -->  00:10:29.590
And then once we do that we need to save the campground and then we also add the error handling in here

151

00:10:29.590  -->  00:10:31.090
so will add an if error.

152

00:10:31.300  -->  00:10:36.190
So if we can't create a comment then we'll constantly log an error.

153

00:10:38.250  -->  00:10:45.880
And if we can create a comment then we're going to associate it with the campground and we'll also do

154

00:10:45.930  -->  00:10:53.330
cancel that log in here that says created new comments.

155

00:10:53.350  -->  00:10:53.850
All right.

156

00:10:53.890  -->  00:10:55.460
So this is a little bit of a marathon.

157

00:10:55.570  -->  00:10:58.230
Let's let's go over some of this.

158

00:10:58.270  -->  00:11:04.260
So what we're doing we're starting by removing everything in the database all campgrounds.

159

00:11:04.300  -->  00:11:08.890
Technically we're not removing comments so we can come back and fix that once we have comments.

160

00:11:09.040  -->  00:11:14.170
But we are moving all campgrounds and then we're creating three campgrounds.

161

00:11:14.170  -->  00:11:17.460
Each one unique because of the seed data.

162

00:11:17.980  -->  00:11:23.680
And then once we create one we're going to create a comment for that one and the comments are all the

163

00:11:23.680  -->  00:11:24.370
same.

164

00:11:24.370  -->  00:11:26.310
So we're going to end up with three different posts.

165

00:11:26.380  -->  00:11:27.510
Three different campgrounds.

166

00:11:27.730  -->  00:11:33.520
But when you click on them we'll see if they have the exact same comment that says This place is great

167

00:11:33.550  -->  00:11:36.240
but I wish there was Internet written by Homer.

168

00:11:36.520  -->  00:11:41.260
And then once we create that comment we then have to associate it with the campground push it into the

169

00:11:41.260  -->  00:11:47.110
comments array on the campground and then save the campground and then we'll print out created new comment

170

00:11:48.010  -->  00:11:49.730
and you'll see we have a little warning here.

171

00:11:49.750  -->  00:11:51.270
Comment is not defined.

172

00:11:51.640  -->  00:11:55.670
We'll need to add a VAR comment.

173

00:11:55.990  -->  00:12:03.830
Equals require the non-existent dot slash models slash comment.

174

00:12:04.210  -->  00:12:06.160
And this is what I mean by error driven development.

175

00:12:06.160  -->  00:12:13.130
If I stopped the server and I restart I get a message that tells me I cannot find module models.

176

00:12:13.150  -->  00:12:17.650
Slash comment in the next video we're going to focus on making these errors go away.

177

00:12:17.650  -->  00:12:23.320
So what we've done is we set up a plan seed's file that works the way that we want it to work but it

178

00:12:23.320  -->  00:12:27.440
doesn't quite work yet and we now need to make it work.
