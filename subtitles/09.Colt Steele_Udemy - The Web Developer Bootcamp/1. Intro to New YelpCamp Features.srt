1

00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:03,760
Well come back in this unit we're continuing to work on your camp.

2

00:00:03,960  -->  00:00:06,260
But we have some important features to work on.

3

00:00:06,330  -->  00:00:10,190
So I think in my opinion this is where things really start to come together.

4

00:00:10,380  -->  00:00:14,460
We start to integrate full crud for campgrounds and comments.

5

00:00:14,460  -->  00:00:20,760
Plus we start to add in user authorization which we haven't talked about yet and we get a lot more complex

6

00:00:20,760  -->  00:00:21,780
logic going.

7

00:00:21,780  -->  00:00:22,890
So let me show you.

8

00:00:22,980  -->  00:00:24,590
Our end goal now.

9

00:00:25,030  -->  00:00:26,850
So I have a version open here.

10

00:00:27,000  -->  00:00:31,720
I only have two campgrounds in here for now but there's a few features I want to highlight.

11

00:00:31,770  -->  00:00:37,180
First is that if I sign up under a new account first of all we've now styled the forms a bit.

12

00:00:37,190  -->  00:00:43,440
So we'll be getting to that soon and I'll sign up as carrot face and password.

13

00:00:43,620  -->  00:00:48,180
As always it's just password.

14

00:00:48,180  -->  00:00:52,100
First thing you might notice I get a little message now successfully signed in.

15

00:00:52,380  -->  00:00:53,070
Which is great.

16

00:00:53,070  -->  00:00:54,280
I'll show you how to do that.

17

00:00:54,420  -->  00:00:57,020
And if I were fresh that message goes away.

18

00:00:57,030  -->  00:00:59,950
So it's what's known as a flash message.

19

00:01:00,000  -->  00:01:03,500
I see it one time but I don't constantly see it.

20

00:01:03,510  -->  00:01:10,110
The other thing I'll show you is that we have two campgrounds and for each one currently there are no

21

00:01:10,110  -->  00:01:12,570
buttons that say edit or delete campground.

22

00:01:12,570  -->  00:01:17,410
And that's because this campground was created by Charlie Brown not carrot face.

23

00:01:17,580  -->  00:01:26,310
If I went and added a new campground or use this image from an splash and we'll call this grassy plains

24

00:01:26,310  -->  00:01:28,820
or something like that.

25

00:01:29,010  -->  00:01:36,160
So Grassi and hit submit and we check out grassy plains.

26

00:01:36,390  -->  00:01:43,110
You can see I now have the option to edit that campground and I don't have that option for anything

27

00:01:43,110  -->  00:01:44,790
else that I didn't create.

28

00:01:44,880  -->  00:01:48,560
However I'm signed in as right now so I'll add in some exclamation points.

29

00:01:48,610  -->  00:01:51,720
Click Update and you can see that it updates.

30

00:01:51,900  -->  00:01:53,190
So we'll be working on that.

31

00:01:53,460  -->  00:01:58,290
And we'll also be working on doing the same thing for comments and we'll also be working on updating

32

00:01:58,290  -->  00:02:00,800
our landing page so that it looks a little bit nicer.

33

00:02:00,870  -->  00:02:06,530
And we also have this fade effect where it changes background images every five seconds.

34

00:02:06,660  -->  00:02:10,500
The first thing that will do is focus on campgrounds edit and delete.

35

00:02:10,710  -->  00:02:13,050
So I'm actually going to stop this server.

36

00:02:13,590  -->  00:02:15,430
This is the solution.

37

00:02:15,430  -->  00:02:21,730
I don't want to be working in there so I'm going to back out and we're working inside of the 10.

38

00:02:22,260  -->  00:02:28,040
So CD into 10 and then I'll show you what we have right now.

39

00:02:28,340  -->  00:02:32,130
Start the server and the fire fresh.

40

00:02:32,130  -->  00:02:34,700
We have four campgrounds.

41

00:02:35,400  -->  00:02:39,290
No edit buttons no delete buttons we can add a comment.

42

00:02:39,300  -->  00:02:41,270
Do you need to be signed in of course.

43

00:02:41,370  -->  00:02:45,600
We don't have a styled form at all or landing page needs work.

44

00:02:45,600  -->  00:02:47,130
So we have we have some stuff to do.

45

00:02:47,160  -->  00:02:51,620
But as I mentioned these next few videos is where I think stuff really starts to come together.

46

00:02:51,720  -->  00:02:57,350
We start to give our users a better experience where it kind of goes from being a silly toy.

47

00:02:57,750  -->  00:03:02,550
I didn't say that but but maybe some people might think it's a silly toy up to something that's a little

48

00:03:02,550  -->  00:03:05,240
more useable and a little bit more legitimate.

49

00:03:05,580  -->  00:03:09,350
So in the next few videos we're going to be working on a bunch of features starting out.

50

00:03:09,480  -->  00:03:12,560
We're going to add in credibility for campgrounds.

51

00:03:12,690  -->  00:03:17,580
Right now we have our campground index page right here.

52

00:03:17,580  -->  00:03:19,890
We have a show page.

53

00:03:19,890  -->  00:03:23,080
We don't have update and edit and we don't have destroy.

54

00:03:23,160  -->  00:03:24,750
So that's what we'll be doing to start.

55

00:03:25,080  -->  00:03:29,580
And then we'll work and go at the permissions or the authorization after the fact.

56

00:03:29,580  -->  00:03:30,260
So to start.

57

00:03:30,300  -->  00:03:32,040
Anyone can delete any campground.

58

00:03:32,040  -->  00:03:34,180
Anyone can update any campground.

59

00:03:34,180  -->  00:03:35,890
Then we'll go and fix that afterwards.

60

00:03:36,120  -->  00:03:37,290
OK I'll see you in the next video
