00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:01.080
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01.080  -->  00:00:06.360
In this video we're going to focus on adding the easy and hard buttons here that will impact the difficulty

3

00:00:06.360  -->  00:00:07.350
of the game.

4

00:00:07.350  -->  00:00:13.920
So when we load the page up hard is already selected and we see six different buttons here or six different

5

00:00:13.920  -->  00:00:14.590
squares.

6

00:00:14.760  -->  00:00:18.610
And then I can click on easy and that remains selected.

7

00:00:18.900  -->  00:00:21.180
And we only have three squares to pick from.

8

00:00:21.270  -->  00:00:23.270
And then I can go back to heart.

9

00:00:23.520  -->  00:00:26.860
We're going to start by adding in the two buttons that we need.

10

00:00:27.000  -->  00:00:31.050
So I'm going to go into my HMO and add in two buttons.

11

00:00:31.560  -->  00:00:33.800
The first one we'll say easy.

12

00:00:34.020  -->  00:00:37.470
The second one will say hard and will refresh.

13

00:00:37.900  -->  00:00:38.440
OK.

14

00:00:38.520  -->  00:00:40.610
And that looks fine for now.

15

00:00:41.160  -->  00:00:44.030
You'll notice our span isn't taking up any space yet.

16

00:00:44.300  -->  00:00:46.020
And I see there's some text shows up.

17

00:00:46.020  -->  00:00:51.600
It pushes those buttons away will focus on the styling later but there is one element of the styling

18

00:00:51.600  -->  00:00:57.600
that I do want to focus on which is making it look selected when the page loads or when we choose easy

19

00:00:57.600  -->  00:01:01.900
or hard the corresponding button should stay blue.

20

00:01:02.160  -->  00:01:06.540
And the way that we do that is using a class and turning that class on and off.

21

00:01:06.540  -->  00:01:11.940
So I'm going to define a class here and it's going to be simpler than this style styling here it's just

22

00:01:11.940  -->  00:01:12.780
going to be a color.

23

00:01:12.810  -->  00:01:18.390
So our background color and the class is going to be called selected because that's what we're doing

24

00:01:18.410  -->  00:01:18.520
.

25

00:01:18.720  -->  00:01:22.110
We're adding the selected class to the button that is selected.

26

00:01:22.440  -->  00:01:25.870
And it's just going to have a background set to you to start.

27

00:01:26.280  -->  00:01:33.820
And then what we're going to do is just give the hard mode button class equal selected.

28

00:01:34.500  -->  00:01:39.600
And if we refresh on our code you can see that hard is engaged.

29

00:01:39.810  -->  00:01:44.540
It's hideous Yes but it at least shows us that we're on hard mode.

30

00:01:44.550  -->  00:01:49.980
So then what we want to do is add the code that's a switch that when they click on easy and then the

31

00:01:49.980  -->  00:01:54.390
trickiest part is showing the three colors when you click on the easy and the six colors when you click

32

00:01:54.390  -->  00:01:55.070
on heart.

33

00:01:55.350  -->  00:01:56.340
OK.

34

00:01:56.610  -->  00:01:58.580
Let's get started here.

35

00:01:58.650  -->  00:02:03.750
So to make these buttons actually work we need to select them in our javascript and then have some quick

36

00:02:03.750  -->  00:02:08.460
listeners and do some and run some code when each of them is clicked.

37

00:02:08.520  -->  00:02:14.490
So let's make it easier to select and I'm going to start by giving them each an ID easy.

38

00:02:14.590  -->  00:02:22.650
DTN and then hard ETN and we will be changing this if you're seeing any red flags here or if you're

39

00:02:22.650  -->  00:02:24.230
thinking we're using too many ideas.

40

00:02:24.330  -->  00:02:26.660
We will be refactoring this in just a few moments.

41

00:02:26.760  -->  00:02:28.630
But we're going to start with two different IDs.

42

00:02:28.650  -->  00:02:30.500
Easy Button hard button.

43

00:02:30.660  -->  00:02:32.570
Go to our javascript and select them.

44

00:02:32.580  -->  00:02:40.100
So var easy ETN equals document doc query selector with Octa.

45

00:02:40.410  -->  00:02:42.430
Easy ETN.

46

00:02:42.600  -->  00:02:45.210
Make sure that we capitalize things the same.

47

00:02:45.270  -->  00:02:46.270
There we go.

48

00:02:46.650  -->  00:02:54.240
And the same thing for hard and I don't know if you caught that in sublime.

49

00:02:54.240  -->  00:02:59.940
If you select the word easy and you hit Kamandi it will then automatically select the next instance

50

00:03:00.000  -->  00:03:05.040
and I can keep doing that to select all of them but I just want these two and I'm going to type hard

51

00:03:05.070  -->  00:03:06.140
instead.

52

00:03:06.210  -->  00:03:09.670
So we have two buttons and then we can do something like this.

53

00:03:09.960  -->  00:03:13.690
Easy PTEN add event listener.

54

00:03:13.800  -->  00:03:23.950
Click and all we're going to do is just alert that the easy button was quit just like this.

55

00:03:24.600  -->  00:03:31.170
Alert easy button clicked and make sure that that works.

56

00:03:31.200  -->  00:03:38.340
So we refresh click on Easy OK says Easy button clicked and then we'll duplicate this for hard button

57

00:03:40.800  -->  00:03:47.640
and we'll say that hard button was quit and refresh easy still works and hard but it tells us that the

58

00:03:47.640  -->  00:03:49.050
hard button was clicked.

59

00:03:49.410  -->  00:03:56.250
So rather than just doing that let's work on getting the class the selected class to reflect which one

60

00:03:56.250  -->  00:03:57.390
is selected.

61

00:03:57.810  -->  00:04:02.020
So if we click on the easy button all we want to do is easy button.

62

00:04:02.070  -->  00:04:11.120
Doc class list add selected and if we refresh now I click on easy.

63

00:04:11.420  -->  00:04:12.920
It has a selected class.

64

00:04:12.940  -->  00:04:19.630
Easy but the problem is that it still remains on the hard button so that's easy to fix.

65

00:04:19.650  -->  00:04:29.460
We just want to have a hard button doc Cross list dot remove it and now if we click on easy the hard

66

00:04:29.460  -->  00:04:30.520
mode goes away.

67

00:04:30.660  -->  00:04:36.990
But if we click on hard we still don't have that logic so we can fix that by just copying this code

68

00:04:36.990  -->  00:04:46.740
over and we'll now have hard buttons classless that add selected easy button class list that remove

69

00:04:46.740  -->  00:04:47.630
selected.

70

00:04:48.160  -->  00:04:49.970
OK let's test it out.

71

00:04:50.890  -->  00:04:51.630
All right.

72

00:04:51.630  -->  00:04:57.450
So we now have the easier part done which is the two buttons showing which one is currently selected

73

00:04:57.680  -->  00:05:02.930
and I refresh and hard is automatically selected because we do have six elements.

74

00:05:02.940  -->  00:05:09.210
Next up we need to add the logic to actually change the difficulty not just the style of these buttons

75

00:05:09.210  -->  00:05:12.730
here but to only show three elements or six squares.

76

00:05:12.930  -->  00:05:15.840
So we need to do that next before we get started.

77

00:05:15.870  -->  00:05:19.110
Let's check again on the solution to see how it works.

78

00:05:19.110  -->  00:05:26.420
So if I refresh and I click on easy notice that we get new colors and we have to do that because there's

79

00:05:26.460  -->  00:05:33.450
a risk that I have six colors here and the color that is selected here might be one of these three that

80

00:05:33.450  -->  00:05:36.510
when I click on easy those three are removed.

81

00:05:36.510  -->  00:05:39.400
So that could be a pretty game breaking bug.

82

00:05:39.600  -->  00:05:42.860
So rather than deal with that we're just going to pick three new colors.

83

00:05:42.990  -->  00:05:45.870
So the process is we refresh that.

84

00:05:45.930  -->  00:05:51.840
So the process is when I click on the easy button we're going to generate three new colors for the colors

85

00:05:51.850  -->  00:05:54.640
array are going to pick one color from those three.

86

00:05:54.750  -->  00:05:57.490
We're going to update that appear with a picked color.

87

00:05:57.510  -->  00:05:59.450
We're going to update the three squares here.

88

00:05:59.640  -->  00:06:05.880
And the important part is that we also hide the three other squares so we don't delete them we just

89

00:06:05.880  -->  00:06:08.610
hide them by setting display to be none.

90

00:06:09.120  -->  00:06:11.010
And then same thing goes for hard.

91

00:06:11.010  -->  00:06:13.930
We generate six new colors in the colors array.

92

00:06:13.950  -->  00:06:16.080
We pick one to be our picks colored.

93

00:06:16.230  -->  00:06:17.850
We display that up here.

94

00:06:18.000  -->  00:06:23.740
Then we show the three squares at the bottom and then set each one to have a color.

95

00:06:24.270  -->  00:06:24.730
OK.

96

00:06:24.810  -->  00:06:26.570
So let's tackle this now.

97

00:06:26.820  -->  00:06:31.170
First of all when we click on the easy button let's start there.

98

00:06:31.380  -->  00:06:39.520
We're going to want to generate new colors so colors equals generate random colors this time 3.

99

00:06:40.410  -->  00:06:47.370
And then once we have that done we're going to want to pick a new picked color so picked color equals

100

00:06:47.880  -->  00:06:50.820
pick color just like that.

101

00:06:50.820  -->  00:06:56.490
So once we have our colors and our picked color we can start by just changing the display up here to

102

00:06:56.490  -->  00:06:58.400
show the new picture color.

103

00:06:59.070  -->  00:07:06.050
So that's as easy as saying color display text content equals picked color.

104

00:07:06.360  -->  00:07:11.410
And if we refresh I'm going to get some new colors here just to show you a few things.

105

00:07:11.580  -->  00:07:17.520
When I click on easy as you mentioned before the color is changing and behind the scenes there is a

106

00:07:17.520  -->  00:07:19.630
colors array that changes as well.

107

00:07:19.650  -->  00:07:25.100
So let's look at what colors is right now and then I click on easy mode and I look at what colors is

108

00:07:25.110  -->  00:07:27.490
again and it's different.

109

00:07:27.870  -->  00:07:30.990
And it also picked color is different.

110

00:07:30.990  -->  00:07:37.650
So now let's talk about how we hide the three bottom divs when we click on easy mode or we can hide

111

00:07:37.650  -->  00:07:38.190
the top three.

112

00:07:38.190  -->  00:07:38.730
It doesn't matter.

113

00:07:38.730  -->  00:07:43.260
But I'm going to do the bottom three the way that we'll do that is by looping through and setting the

114

00:07:43.260  -->  00:07:46.360
bottom threes display property to be none.

115

00:07:46.560  -->  00:07:48.440
So let me show you how that works.

116

00:07:48.510  -->  00:07:49.870
I'm just going to pick one of them.

117

00:07:49.980  -->  00:08:01.850
So let's do a document query selector all square or a square and then work with the fifth one.

118

00:08:02.250  -->  00:08:11.320
Well actually the sixth one with index of five and then set that style display to be none.

119

00:08:12.150  -->  00:08:13.760
And you'll see that it disappears.

120

00:08:13.770  -->  00:08:19.000
And then if I want it to come back which I will if we click on hard mode I just need to say style.

121

00:08:19.050  -->  00:08:22.160
Display equals lock.

122

00:08:22.500  -->  00:08:23.280
All right.

123

00:08:23.490  -->  00:08:28.980
So let's go ahead and implement this in our code the way that will achieve this is by looping through

124

00:08:29.250  -->  00:08:30.980
all six at first.

125

00:08:31.170  -->  00:08:34.820
And for the first three we're going to give them a new color.

126

00:08:35.040  -->  00:08:37.380
And for the bottom three we're going to hide them.

127

00:08:37.410  -->  00:08:40.380
So rather than having two loops to do that we'll do it at once.

128

00:08:40.560  -->  00:08:43.980
So for var I equals zero.

129

00:08:43.980  -->  00:08:48.140
I just less than squares out length.

130

00:08:48.300  -->  00:08:54.390
Plus plus we're going to take advantage of the fact that colors has three items in it.

131

00:08:54.390  -->  00:08:58.000
So we're going to do something like this if colors I.

132

00:08:58.440  -->  00:09:02.350
So if there is a next color so this will happen on the first three.

133

00:09:02.610  -->  00:09:11.020
We're going to write squares I style the background equals color.

134

00:09:12.660  -->  00:09:18.540
So for the first three in our case because colors only has three items we're going to loop through all

135

00:09:18.540  -->  00:09:22.740
of the squares and check if there is a color at that index.

136

00:09:22.770  -->  00:09:27.320
And if there is we're going to change the color of those first three.

137

00:09:27.390  -->  00:09:29.160
So let's let's make sure that works.

138

00:09:29.160  -->  00:09:33.990
I click on easy and you'll see only the top three are changing.

139

00:09:33.990  -->  00:09:35.470
So we're close.

140

00:09:35.520  -->  00:09:38.550
All we want to do now is hide the bottom three.

141

00:09:39.000  -->  00:09:41.040
So we'll do that with else.

142

00:09:42.370  -->  00:09:48.970
Squares I style that display equals none.

143

00:09:49.600  -->  00:09:56.770
And if we refresh and make it full screen if I click on easy mode you can see that we lose the bottom

144

00:09:56.770  -->  00:10:00.010
three and the colors of the top three are changing.

145

00:10:00.640  -->  00:10:03.010
And let's try to figure out which one this is.

146

00:10:03.050  -->  00:10:08.850
So hundred sixty three red 125 green and a little bit of blue.

147

00:10:08.950  -->  00:10:10.190
There we go.

148

00:10:10.300  -->  00:10:13.200
You can refresh try a few more.

149

00:10:13.210  -->  00:10:19.030
We do have one small problem as I refresh some of these and I click on easy mode.

150

00:10:19.030  -->  00:10:21.010
We're only generating three colors here.

151

00:10:21.140  -->  00:10:26.600
But if I click on the new colors button so I'll show you what colors looks like right now.

152

00:10:26.740  -->  00:10:27.640
It's three items.

153

00:10:27.760  -->  00:10:32.330
If I click on new colors though and then I look at colors.

154

00:10:33.070  -->  00:10:38.340
It's actually six items and that's because we're not keeping track of which mode that we're on.

155

00:10:38.350  -->  00:10:40.440
So that code is right here on the reset button.

156

00:10:40.510  -->  00:10:44.520
We're just saying colors is equal to generate random colors.

157

00:10:44.680  -->  00:10:46.370
So we need to fix that eventually.

158

00:10:46.600  -->  00:10:52.090
But before we do that let's get our hard button so that it sets us back to six squares and each one

159

00:10:52.090  -->  00:10:54.700
has its own color to do that.

160

00:10:54.850  -->  00:11:00.000
I'm going to just take some of this code and duplicate it down here which is always a bad sign.

161

00:11:00.490  -->  00:11:03.250
And that's why we're going to refactor this in just a little bit.

162

00:11:03.280  -->  00:11:04.870
So the first thing I want to do.

163

00:11:04.870  -->  00:11:09.380
I'm just going to copy all of it into our hard button event listener colors.

164

00:11:09.400  -->  00:11:16.000
It's going to be six colors picks color will be the same color display text content is the same.

165

00:11:16.000  -->  00:11:18.880
And then we're going to loop through all of them in this loop.

166

00:11:18.880  -->  00:11:20.590
We need to do two different things.

167

00:11:20.590  -->  00:11:24.200
The first is to assign a new color to every square.

168

00:11:24.460  -->  00:11:29.980
But we also potentially need to make sure that the three are unhidden at the bottom.

169

00:11:30.430  -->  00:11:36.910
So we're going to get rid of the if statement for now and we're just going to set all the squares to

170

00:11:36.910  -->  00:11:38.990
have a background color to be colors.

171

00:11:39.430  -->  00:11:43.880
And all the squares will have a display of block.

172

00:11:44.230  -->  00:11:49.960
So this is a little bit wasteful because we only need the last three technically and we're resetting

173

00:11:49.990  -->  00:11:51.710
all of them to be display block.

174

00:11:51.850  -->  00:11:54.940
But that's a really minor thing we can focus on later.

175

00:11:55.000  -->  00:12:02.440
So let's just see if this works refresh tells us we have a syntax error on line 36 Let's see what we're

176

00:12:02.440  -->  00:12:03.150
missing.

177

00:12:03.670  -->  00:12:05.600
And we just have an extra curly brace here.

178

00:12:05.710  -->  00:12:10.210
So if we save now and refresh we have six colors like we always have.

179

00:12:10.210  -->  00:12:12.190
If I click on easy we get three.

180

00:12:12.310  -->  00:12:15.260
If I click on hard I now go back to six.

181

00:12:15.370  -->  00:12:18.780
I get a new color up here and let's just make sure that that keeps working.

182

00:12:18.850  -->  00:12:23.280
So easy hard easy hard when I go to hard mode.

183

00:12:23.380  -->  00:12:25.510
Let's click on new colors again.

184

00:12:25.570  -->  00:12:29.570
Go back to easy go back to hard easy and hard.

185

00:12:29.650  -->  00:12:29.930
All right.

186

00:12:29.920  -->  00:12:32.320
And let's play this and see if it works.

187

00:12:32.320  -->  00:12:37.410
So pick color is 196 170 57.

188

00:12:37.450  -->  00:12:42.240
So a lot of read a lot of green and a little bit of blue.

189

00:12:42.460  -->  00:12:44.970
So that's a lot of red and green is a yellow color.

190

00:12:45.070  -->  00:12:46.650
So it's not going to be that one or that one.

191

00:12:46.660  -->  00:12:52.120
That one is going to be this one real quick and that looks like it's working just fine.

192

00:12:52.380  -->  00:12:55.880
If I click on easy again we go back to three colors.

193

00:12:56.050  -->  00:13:01.750
The most pressing issue facing us though is when I'm in easy mode and I click play again this is going

194

00:13:01.750  -->  00:13:07.960
to generate six colors not three and it's going to pick a random color out of six which may not be displaying

195

00:13:07.960  -->  00:13:11.350
to us which is going to be problematic to fix that.

196

00:13:11.350  -->  00:13:15.730
All we need to do is have a variable that keeps track of what mode that we're on.

197

00:13:15.730  -->  00:13:19.650
Easy or hard or the number of squares three or six.

198

00:13:19.840  -->  00:13:21.530
So we'll do that up here.

199

00:13:21.640  -->  00:13:29.620
We'll have a variable called number of squares and that will start at 6 and we'll just declare that

200

00:13:29.880  -->  00:13:39.220
up here and say colors equals generate random colors of number and let's make it number of squares or

201

00:13:39.490  -->  00:13:40.180
squares.

202

00:13:40.240  -->  00:13:41.080
It's a little easier

203

00:13:44.170  -->  00:13:47.020
like that and save.

204

00:13:47.140  -->  00:13:50.120
And then we need to replace that in a few places.

205

00:13:50.170  -->  00:13:57.970
So when we click on easy mode you want numb squares to be three and then we generate random colors with

206

00:13:57.970  -->  00:14:00.040
no squares.

207

00:14:00.430  -->  00:14:09.010
And then further down when we click on the hard button we want some squares to be 6 so numb squares

208

00:14:09.100  -->  00:14:17.290
equals six and then generate random colors squares and then there's a few other places right here when

209

00:14:17.290  -->  00:14:18.850
we click on that reset button.

210

00:14:18.850  -->  00:14:24.540
We want to generate the correct number of colors which would be Nahm squares there as well.

211

00:14:24.580  -->  00:14:28.970
So that should take care of it for us if we go back and refresh.

212

00:14:29.530  -->  00:14:33.080
We go to easy mode and let's win this one.

213

00:14:33.190  -->  00:14:35.280
So mostly red a little blue.

214

00:14:35.320  -->  00:14:37.350
Not this one.

215

00:14:37.660  -->  00:14:38.740
Not that one.

216

00:14:38.740  -->  00:14:39.830
There we go.

217

00:14:39.880  -->  00:14:47.140
And if I click on play again let's make sure when I type colors we only see three colors.

218

00:14:47.140  -->  00:14:55.240
And if I looked at picked color hopes picked a color you can see it's inside of the colors array.

219

00:14:55.450  -->  00:14:56.880
So we don't have to worry about that anymore.

220

00:14:57.040  -->  00:14:57.970
Our logic now works
