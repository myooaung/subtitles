00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:05.490
All right we have two more important command line commands to learn before we can move on to node and

2

00:00:05.490  -->  00:00:07.770
express and actually writing code.

3

00:00:08.190  -->  00:00:16.340
So those two commands are our AM and the other one is r.m dash Aref.

4

00:00:16.620  -->  00:00:23.580
Technically this is actually just one command r.m and this is something called a flag which is a way

5

00:00:23.580  -->  00:00:25.890
of changing what the command does.

6

00:00:26.370  -->  00:00:28.260
Let's begin with r.m.

7

00:00:28.260  -->  00:00:32.000
We use our m to delete a specific file.

8

00:00:32.340  -->  00:00:35.640
So in this case let's go to the fav colors directory.

9

00:00:35.760  -->  00:00:40.350
And as I mentioned before blue and green are not actually my favorite colors so let's get them out of

10

00:00:40.350  -->  00:00:42.390
there let's just delete them entirely.

11

00:00:42.630  -->  00:00:51.660
So we need to CD in two colors slash fav colors just like that and we can see blue green and purple

12

00:00:52.320  -->  00:00:54.750
to remove blue dot text.

13

00:00:54.750  -->  00:00:57.820
I need to first type on them and then the name of the file.

14

00:00:57.870  -->  00:01:04.910
So r.m Blue Dot T or use autocomplete member of that tab.

15

00:01:05.430  -->  00:01:09.190
And if I type LS It's now gone.

16

00:01:09.630  -->  00:01:14.060
I don't know if you noticed but it didn't actually delete from the file tree yet.

17

00:01:14.370  -->  00:01:19.980
And that's just a matter of it lagging a little bit behind because remember when we actually delete

18

00:01:19.980  -->  00:01:22.770
this file it's on a computer somewhere else.

19

00:01:22.890  -->  00:01:27.140
So on one of cloud nines computers that they've designated for me to use here.

20

00:01:27.360  -->  00:01:32.220
So when I delete something yes they send the command from my browser to their computer.

21

00:01:32.220  -->  00:01:37.620
It then deletes the folder or the file and then once it's been deleted it then sends something back

22

00:01:37.920  -->  00:01:43.640
to my file tree to tell it to remove blue dot to 60 from the display.

23

00:01:43.680  -->  00:01:48.300
So sometimes it likes a little bit which is another reason that it's good to just use the command line

24

00:01:48.310  -->  00:01:48.770
.

25

00:01:49.230  -->  00:01:51.670
Let's also remove the green tea XTi.

26

00:01:51.690  -->  00:01:54.480
So r.m green tea XTi.

27

00:01:54.930  -->  00:02:00.030
And now we're left with just Purple about THC which as I mentioned is my favorite color.

28

00:02:00.510  -->  00:02:03.220
So that's how we can remove individual files.

29

00:02:03.540  -->  00:02:09.180
And then the other command is r.m dash R.F. which allows us to remove entire directories.

30

00:02:09.540  -->  00:02:18.660
So I'm going to back out and one more time and I'm going to delete the entire colour's directory and

31

00:02:18.720  -->  00:02:25.560
that means getting rid of orange red and yellow that he XTi as well as fav colors and my beloved purple

32

00:02:25.560  -->  00:02:30.640
that THC going to get rid of all of them by using Ahram dash Aref

33

00:02:33.350  -->  00:02:36.970
the dash R.F. stands for something that you might not expect.

34

00:02:36.990  -->  00:02:44.250
It stands for recursive force which basically means that when we say delete colors it's going to delete

35

00:02:44.310  -->  00:02:47.730
all of the child directories that colour's contains.

36

00:02:47.730  -->  00:02:52.770
So not only the files here but it will delete fav colors and all the files inside of that.

37

00:02:52.770  -->  00:02:55.640
And that could go nested as many levels as we want.

38

00:02:55.680  -->  00:02:59.230
It's going to force delete everything inside of that directory.

39

00:02:59.280  -->  00:03:08.310
Technically Ahram and r.m dash R.F. are the same command line command and dash Areff is a modifier or

40

00:03:08.310  -->  00:03:11.480
what's called a flag for the r.m command.

41

00:03:11.520  -->  00:03:13.300
So it's still the r.m command.

42

00:03:13.440  -->  00:03:16.700
But dash R.F. will have it do something slightly different.

43

00:03:16.860  -->  00:03:21.070
And then we need to provide an argument which is the name of the directory to delete.

44

00:03:21.240  -->  00:03:23.750
And in this case it's colors.

45

00:03:23.910  -->  00:03:28.940
So r.m dash R.F. space colors and I hit enter.

46

00:03:29.370  -->  00:03:32.870
And you can see my entire colors directory just disappeared.

47

00:03:33.190  -->  00:03:36.830
If I type LS over here there is no colors director anymore.

48

00:03:36.900  -->  00:03:44.280
If I try and C.D into colors it tells me no such file or directory and it's all gone including my fav

49

00:03:44.280  -->  00:03:48.090
colors directory and my purple that TXI the file as well.

50

00:03:48.150  -->  00:03:54.810
To summarize r.m will delete an individual file and Ahram dash R.F. will delete an entire directory

51

00:03:54.820  -->  00:03:55.120
.

52

00:03:55.410  -->  00:04:02.190
One interesting note about r.m dash Areff is that if you're not careful and you use it in the root directory

53

00:04:02.220  -->  00:04:07.890
of your entire computer you could actually wipe everything from your machine.

54

00:04:07.890  -->  00:04:10.500
And I've never actually seen that or heard that happen.

55

00:04:10.500  -->  00:04:15.630
It's almost like an urban legend I guess at this point but it is something that is technically possible

56

00:04:15.630  -->  00:04:15.750
.

57

00:04:15.840  -->  00:04:23.220
If you did r.m dash RF slash which almost scares me to even type that even though I have nothing of

58

00:04:23.220  -->  00:04:25.280
value on this workspace yet.

59

00:04:25.560  -->  00:04:29.940
If I hit enter that could delete every single thing in this workspace.

60

00:04:29.940  -->  00:04:32.560
It's an interesting tidbit but it's also worth knowing about
