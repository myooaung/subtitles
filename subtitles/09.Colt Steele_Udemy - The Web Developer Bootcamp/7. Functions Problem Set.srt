1

00:00:00,600  -->  00:00:04,440
So it's now time for you to start writing some of your own Javascript functions.

2

00:00:04,440  -->  00:00:07,680
So I've written a problem set with three different problems.

3

00:00:07,680  -->  00:00:10,840
Each one you'll have to write your own javascript function.

4

00:00:10,980  -->  00:00:16,140
So I'm going to introduce all three problems and then in the next video we'll have solutions.

5

00:00:16,200  -->  00:00:18,170
So the first one is called is even.

6

00:00:18,450  -->  00:00:24,270
So you'll need to write a function called is even which takes a single argument which is a number and

7

00:00:24,270  -->  00:00:28,550
it returns true if the number is even and false if it's not.

8

00:00:28,890  -->  00:00:38,520
So there's a few examples is even of four returns true is even if 21 returns false is even a 68 is true

9

00:00:38,870  -->  00:00:41,120
3 3 3 is false.

10

00:00:41,130  -->  00:00:45,780
If you need to jog your memory on how you determine if a number is even you can watch some of the previous

11

00:00:45,780  -->  00:00:49,300
videos where we talked about modulo.

12

00:00:49,320  -->  00:00:52,290
Next up is a function called factorial.

13

00:00:52,290  -->  00:00:55,090
So most of you probably don't remember what factorial is.

14

00:00:55,110  -->  00:00:57,990
I think we talked about it like once in my high school math class.

15

00:00:58,200  -->  00:01:04,260
Basically you take a number like four and factorial is written with an exclamation point often.

16

00:01:04,290  -->  00:01:10,030
So for factorial is equal to 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

17

00:01:10,050  -->  00:01:18,330
So that gives us 24 6 factorial is six times five times four times three times 2 times 1.

18

00:01:18,330  -->  00:01:23,010
So basically you're going to write a function that takes a number and multiply that number by every

19

00:01:23,010  -->  00:01:26,800
integer below that between that number and 1.

20

00:01:27,150  -->  00:01:31,200
So there's one small caveat which is zero factorial is 1.

21

00:01:31,200  -->  00:01:36,240
So to write this function in need to have a variable that you're constantly multiplying by smaller and

22

00:01:36,240  -->  00:01:41,660
smaller numbers so you multiply by four then three and then two and then one and you'll stop.

23

00:01:41,700  -->  00:01:43,130
When you multiply by 1.

24

00:01:43,860  -->  00:01:45,850
So you can see a few examples here.

25

00:01:46,110  -->  00:01:53,580
Factorial of five is five times four times three times two times one which is a 120 factorial of two

26

00:01:53,820  -->  00:01:56,150
is just two factorial of 10.

27

00:01:56,160  -->  00:01:59,130
Is this massive number and factorial of zero.

28

00:01:59,130  -->  00:02:02,260
Remember it needs to return 1.

29

00:02:02,640  -->  00:02:05,090
So the last one here is a little bit different.

30

00:02:05,130  -->  00:02:07,260
It's called Khabab to snake.

31

00:02:07,320  -->  00:02:11,540
So if you recall there are different ways of writing strings different cases.

32

00:02:11,570  -->  00:02:15,350
There's snake case where we use underscores like you see here.

33

00:02:15,510  -->  00:02:17,680
Hello underscore world.

34

00:02:17,700  -->  00:02:22,330
There's Khabab case where we use dashes haloed dash world.

35

00:02:22,380  -->  00:02:28,260
So you're going to write a function called Khabab to snake which takes a single string argument that

36

00:02:28,260  -->  00:02:29,730
is going to be Khabab case.

37

00:02:29,760  -->  00:02:37,260
So it uses dashes between words and your job is to replace all those dashes with underscores to make

38

00:02:37,260  -->  00:02:38,490
it snake case.

39

00:02:38,850  -->  00:02:44,100
So in order to do that you may need to research a little bit about how you can replace characters in

40

00:02:44,100  -->  00:02:45,020
a string.

41

00:02:45,480  -->  00:02:50,190
So it's definitely intentional that this one is last in the problems that you may need to do a little

42

00:02:50,190  -->  00:02:50,930
bit of research.

43

00:02:50,940  -->  00:02:57,240
Do some googling figure out how you can replace all of a specific character in a string with another

44

00:02:57,240  -->  00:03:01,180
specific character so you can see some sample input and output.

45

00:03:01,440  -->  00:03:03,120
Hello Dasch world.

46

00:03:03,120  -->  00:03:07,880
When you pass it into Khabab to snake should return Hello underscore world.

47

00:03:08,460  -->  00:03:11,280
And one key point about all these exercises.

48

00:03:11,290  -->  00:03:12,420
No contact logs.

49

00:03:12,420  -->  00:03:14,210
These are all returned statements.

50

00:03:14,560  -->  00:03:16,990
OK so in the next video we'll go over some solutions.
