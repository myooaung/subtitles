00:00:00.320  -->  00:00:05.360
Well come back in the next few lessons we're going to had user authentication into camp.

2

00:00:05.580  -->  00:00:10.290
So we're going to take everything we learned in the last few lessons where we did the auth demo with

3

00:00:10.290  -->  00:00:13.470
the secret page and we're going to take that and apply it to camp.

4

00:00:13.680  -->  00:00:15.400
And it will be broken into a few steps.

5

00:00:15.420  -->  00:00:20.730
The first one is to add the user model and then also to install all of those packages that we needed

6

00:00:20.730  -->  00:00:21.240
.

7

00:00:21.240  -->  00:00:22.120
Let's get started.

8

00:00:22.300  -->  00:00:26.910
I mean instead of V-6 now I made a new version because we are going to make some substantial changes

9

00:00:26.910  -->  00:00:27.450
here.

10

00:00:27.870  -->  00:00:33.270
And the first thing I'll do is just run an NPM install and install all those packages we need.

11

00:00:33.270  -->  00:00:41.250
So we need passport passport dasht local and passport Dasch local Dasch mongoose and then we also need

12

00:00:41.640  -->  00:00:50.280
express Dasch session and then we'll do dash dash save and we already have Express we already have body

13

00:00:50.280  -->  00:00:52.520
parts or so we should be good to go.

14

00:00:52.860  -->  00:00:55.180
Let's just double check on our package that.

15

00:00:55.560  -->  00:01:02.000
Make sure it has all those packages good Rigaud everything looks good.

16

00:01:02.170  -->  00:01:09.180
OK let's open up abdicates And let's begin by importing some of those different packages.

17

00:01:09.360  -->  00:01:10.110
So we'll import.

18

00:01:10.110  -->  00:01:18.970
Passport is equal to require passport and then we have a local strategy.

19

00:01:19.110  -->  00:01:26.880
Require passport Dasch local and are safe there.

20

00:01:26.880  -->  00:01:32.160
Now let's go about creating our user model which will require here so we can actually start with that

21

00:01:32.220  -->  00:01:34.060
user.

22

00:01:34.150  -->  00:01:41.070
The schools require that slash models slash user which of course will crash right now if we try and

23

00:01:41.070  -->  00:01:41.760
run this.

24

00:01:41.910  -->  00:01:48.330
So let's make the user model so that needs to go inside that model's directory right here we want to

25

00:01:48.330  -->  00:01:49.350
make a file.

26

00:01:49.560  -->  00:01:52.150
Models slash user.

27

00:01:52.320  -->  00:01:53.500
Yes.

28

00:01:53.880  -->  00:01:57.020
And let's open that file.

29

00:01:58.050  -->  00:02:01.940
And then inside of there we're going to add in our basic mongoose code.

30

00:02:02.130  -->  00:02:05.990
So the first thing you want to do is require mongoose.

31

00:02:08.060  -->  00:02:08.660
OK.

32

00:02:08.880  -->  00:02:15.930
And then we need our user schema and remember that our user needs to have a username and password and

33

00:02:15.930  -->  00:02:16.950
both are strings

34

00:02:19.680  -->  00:02:20.980
already.

35

00:02:21.000  -->  00:02:28.340
So instead of here username is a string comma password is also a string.

36

00:02:28.860  -->  00:02:31.770
And then at the very bottom we'll do our module.

37

00:02:31.800  -->  00:02:41.270
Exports equals mongoose top model user Cingular and then the schema to construct it from.

38

00:02:41.550  -->  00:02:44.820
And that's everything we need to do to make a simple user model.

39

00:02:44.820  -->  00:02:49.900
It has no off yet it doesn't have passport plugged in or the passport local mongoose plug in yet.

40

00:02:50.070  -->  00:02:55.650
But let's try to just make sure that this requires working and if we do that now.

41

00:02:55.860  -->  00:02:58.080
Node Yes.

42

00:02:58.470  -->  00:02:59.720
Everything looks good.

43

00:02:59.730  -->  00:03:00.780
Stop the server.

44

00:03:00.930  -->  00:03:03.980
Now let's go and add in the passport local plug in.

45

00:03:04.470  -->  00:03:13.740
So we need to require that here our passport local mongoose equals require passport dash local dash

46

00:03:13.800  -->  00:03:16.390
Mangus which is that package we installed.

47

00:03:16.920  -->  00:03:26.280
And then we just need to do user schema plug in passport local mongoose and save and that's it.

48

00:03:26.550  -->  00:03:28.580
And again that makes it really easy for us.

49

00:03:28.620  -->  00:03:33.750
This basically takes the wheel and it starts to add in some methods to our user.

50

00:03:33.750  -->  00:03:34.950
Now let's test this out.

51

00:03:35.020  -->  00:03:37.750
It's just run the same code node app.

52

00:03:37.830  -->  00:03:38.570
Yes.

53

00:03:38.820  -->  00:03:40.350
Everything works just fine.

54

00:03:40.590  -->  00:03:42.610
Once again good to see.

55

00:03:42.870  -->  00:03:43.230
Great.

56

00:03:43.230  -->  00:03:48.360
So we now have installed all the packages and we've set up the user model and added in the passport

57

00:03:48.360  -->  00:03:53.670
local mongoose plugin which gives all these methods and important functionality to our user model.

58

00:03:53.670  -->  00:03:58.080
And that's all I wanted to do in this video in the next video will actually start working and the functionality
