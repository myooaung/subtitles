00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:00.980
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01.000  -->  00:00:03.720
In this video I want to run through the entire syllabus.

3

00:00:03.730  -->  00:00:09.090
Of course we're not going to talk about things in much detail but I do want to introduce you to everything

4

00:00:09.090  -->  00:00:10.210
we're going to talk about.

5

00:00:10.320  -->  00:00:16.350
And there's quite a bit as you can see this is a very long course lots material very comprehensive to

6

00:00:16.350  -->  00:00:17.370
start off.

7

00:00:17.430  -->  00:00:20.020
We do our course basics which is where you are right now.

8

00:00:20.100  -->  00:00:23.190
It's definitely the least substantial unit in this entire course.

9

00:00:23.200  -->  00:00:28.740
It discovers things about the syllabus and how the Course works and gives you some advice and then we

10

00:00:28.740  -->  00:00:30.820
really get going with introduction to front end.

11

00:00:30.960  -->  00:00:35.210
So we talk about what front end development is what back in development is how they're different what

12

00:00:35.260  -->  00:00:38.130
HDMI is what CSSA is what javascript is.

13

00:00:38.190  -->  00:00:43.170
But you still don't write a whole lot of code until this unit when we actually talk about aged him out

14

00:00:43.190  -->  00:00:43.460
.

15

00:00:43.710  -->  00:00:49.560
So there are two units on each team all introduction and intermediate aged him out and then once you've

16

00:00:49.560  -->  00:00:54.650
finished that and move on to see assess which is how we can make things look nice we add some style

17

00:00:54.660  -->  00:00:54.910
.

18

00:00:55.080  -->  00:00:57.820
So that's where the projects start to get a little more exciting.

19

00:00:57.960  -->  00:01:03.180
Have you make an image gallery for photography portfolio site and we also have you make a blog site

20

00:01:04.020  -->  00:01:06.690
so to units on CSSA intro and advanced.

21

00:01:06.720  -->  00:01:13.140
We talk about things like typography fonts including custom fonts using Google fonts forms validations

22

00:01:13.440  -->  00:01:14.550
lots of topics.

23

00:01:14.670  -->  00:01:20.160
Then we talk about Bootstrap which is a C S S and Javascript framework that helps to make nice looking

24

00:01:20.160  -->  00:01:22.120
Web sites really quickly and easily.

25

00:01:22.320  -->  00:01:28.800
And in that unit we make a few projects including a portfolio site and a startup landing page or a home

26

00:01:28.800  -->  00:01:30.350
page for a startup.

27

00:01:30.540  -->  00:01:34.890
Then we hit javascript and that's where things in my opinion at least start to get really interesting

28

00:01:34.890  -->  00:01:35.810
and exciting.

29

00:01:35.820  -->  00:01:41.340
We start talking about our first real programming language javascript so we start with the basics and

30

00:01:41.440  -->  00:01:47.040
there's a lot to talk about with javascript so you can see pretty much takes up from here down to the

31

00:01:47.040  -->  00:01:47.360
end.

32

00:01:47.460  -->  00:01:53.070
Everything involves javascript and to be fair Everything involves H-2 mounts assess as well but javascript

33

00:01:53.070  -->  00:01:54.260
becomes the focus.

34

00:01:54.270  -->  00:01:59.130
That's how we start making robust Web applications not just simple web sites.

35

00:01:59.140  -->  00:02:01.270
And I'll expand on that difference in the next unit.

36

00:02:01.470  -->  00:02:02.700
But let's keep moving.

37

00:02:03.030  -->  00:02:04.330
So jobs for basics.

38

00:02:04.350  -->  00:02:10.160
Then we talk about something called control flow which is how we add basic logic into our applications

39

00:02:10.170  -->  00:02:11.070
with Job scripts.

40

00:02:11.340  -->  00:02:16.560
And then something called functions javascript arrays and objects to different data structures.

41

00:02:16.920  -->  00:02:22.590
And then we move on to my favorite topic which is dominant emulation which is how we actually interact

42

00:02:22.590  -->  00:02:25.290
with each team around to assess using javascript.

43

00:02:25.290  -->  00:02:29.790
So some of you that might just be a bunch of random words you've never heard in your life or that you

44

00:02:29.790  -->  00:02:31.070
can't really make sense of.

45

00:02:31.290  -->  00:02:33.800
Basically it's how we start making things exciting.

46

00:02:33.840  -->  00:02:38.910
When I click on a page something happens we can start changing colors animating things moving things

47

00:02:38.910  -->  00:02:39.930
across the screen.

48

00:02:39.930  -->  00:02:41.870
It's very visual and fun.

49

00:02:42.000  -->  00:02:47.430
Then we have another unit on Dom events which is some other dumb manipulation that we can focus on.

50

00:02:47.700  -->  00:02:53.220
And then we have a color game project which is a substantial and pretty complex game that we make together

51

00:02:53.240  -->  00:02:53.390
.

52

00:02:53.520  -->  00:02:56.360
It's an entire unit it's eight or nine videos creating this game.

53

00:02:56.370  -->  00:02:58.610
So it's it's a pretty legit project.

54

00:02:58.770  -->  00:03:03.350
And then we move on to a really popular library called Jay Querrey and we focus on that forward three

55

00:03:03.360  -->  00:03:09.540
units introduction to Jay Querrey advanced Jay query and then we build a really nice looking responsive

56

00:03:09.540  -->  00:03:12.770
to do this project together so that Sokoto along as well.

57

00:03:12.820  -->  00:03:15.970
It's an entire unit seven or eight videos there too.

58

00:03:16.380  -->  00:03:22.410
And then we have a big switch so everything up until this point excluding the first course basics unit

59

00:03:22.680  -->  00:03:28.140
talks about front end web development which we talk about what that means and what the differences front

60

00:03:28.140  -->  00:03:29.370
and back and full stack.

61

00:03:29.370  -->  00:03:31.220
All that stuff in the next unit.

62

00:03:31.650  -->  00:03:34.670
But I'll just point out this is all front end.

63

00:03:34.950  -->  00:03:37.420
This is all back.

64

00:03:37.890  -->  00:03:41.140
So right here there is a big line where things shift.

65

00:03:41.250  -->  00:03:46.430
So we moved back and we start by talking about the very basics just like we did appear for front it

66

00:03:46.430  -->  00:03:46.790
.

67

00:03:46.800  -->  00:03:50.370
So what is the back and what are the different things that are involved.

68

00:03:50.460  -->  00:03:55.290
We talked we had some diagrams we draw some things out and I show you some examples of sites and how

69

00:03:55.290  -->  00:04:00.120
the back end is set up on some popular Web sites and then we talk about the command line.

70

00:04:00.150  -->  00:04:02.670
How do you navigate through the command line or the terminal.

71

00:04:02.670  -->  00:04:04.560
What are the different commands you enter.

72

00:04:04.560  -->  00:04:07.640
Definitely the most tacker looking thing that we cover.

73

00:04:07.740  -->  00:04:12.720
If you've ever seen like a stereotypical hacker scene in a movie they're usually typing things into

74

00:04:12.720  -->  00:04:13.520
the command line.

75

00:04:13.560  -->  00:04:17.030
So we will be talking about that and using that for the rest of the course.

76

00:04:17.190  -->  00:04:20.640
Then we talk about no G-S and this is an introduction to no.

77

00:04:20.670  -->  00:04:21.370
Yes.

78

00:04:21.510  -->  00:04:26.970
And then an introduction to express which is a node framework that we'll be using again and no that's

79

00:04:26.970  -->  00:04:31.710
just a bunch of words but it's a node framework will be using to create our Web applications.

80

00:04:31.890  -->  00:04:34.620
And we continue with those two things for the rest of the course.

81

00:04:34.830  -->  00:04:40.020
So then we talk about intermedia express basically some more advanced topics and then we get to something

82

00:04:40.020  -->  00:04:40.590
different.

83

00:04:40.830  -->  00:04:47.110
Yo camp basics and you'll notice there's a few different instances of Yotam the UPCAT basics you know

84

00:04:47.120  -->  00:04:53.090
camp data persistence you know camp comments you have camp adding art and you know camp cleaning up

85

00:04:53.330  -->  00:04:57.050
and you know camp definitely starts to sound weird after you repeat it enough times.

86

00:04:57.230  -->  00:05:02.660
But what it is is a complex application that we create together and it's one that we keep revisiting

87

00:05:02.660  -->  00:05:02.760
.

88

00:05:02.760  -->  00:05:08.810
So rather than one off small projects where it's really hard to get to something substantial with just

89

00:05:08.810  -->  00:05:14.990
one unit or just a few videos this is a big project that we continually revisit and don't worry we have

90

00:05:14.990  -->  00:05:16.730
plenty of shorter smaller projects.

91

00:05:16.730  -->  00:05:22.070
I'm a really strong believer that you should start by seeing a small instance of something working making

92

00:05:22.070  -->  00:05:26.890
a small project and then apply it to something big so that you get both end to that spectrum.

93

00:05:26.960  -->  00:05:31.660
You're not just thrown into the deep end immediately making a huge project but you're also not stuck

94

00:05:31.730  -->  00:05:34.130
making these tiny toys for your entire course.

95

00:05:34.160  -->  00:05:38.540
I want you to have something that you can be proud of and something that is really really complex by

96

00:05:38.540  -->  00:05:39.680
the end of the course.

97

00:05:39.740  -->  00:05:47.450
So yo camp is a yelp like clone for campground campsites and outdoor activities so you can create campgrounds

98

00:05:47.450  -->  00:05:52.070
have photos leave comments all sorts of fun things log in authentication.

99

00:05:52.070  -->  00:05:57.650
We talked about authorization and every time we learn a new feature we go added into UPCAT.

100

00:05:58.190  -->  00:06:00.020
So we start there you know camp basics.

101

00:06:00.020  -->  00:06:04.170
That's the first time we see the app and we set up the very basic structure.

102

00:06:04.370  -->  00:06:09.680
Then we talk about databases and we talk about Mongo DB which is the particular database that we'll

103

00:06:09.680  -->  00:06:17.330
use and we make a small project there and then we go back to camp and add in Mangu D-B so that we now

104

00:06:17.330  -->  00:06:23.120
have a database connected to Brokamp and then we talk about a really important topic called restful

105

00:06:23.120  -->  00:06:23.870
routing.

106

00:06:23.900  -->  00:06:29.600
This is an architecture it's a way of planning our applications a pattern that we follow called rest

107

00:06:29.960  -->  00:06:35.630
and we build a nice looking blog app using restful routes and a new CSSA javascript framework called

108

00:06:35.620  -->  00:06:42.470
semantic UI which is similar to bootstrap which we learn earlier in the course right here.

109

00:06:43.000  -->  00:06:46.240
And the idea there is just to expose you to another technology.

110

00:06:46.250  -->  00:06:47.920
Another popular framework.

111

00:06:48.050  -->  00:06:52.280
Hopefully you start to see some of the similarities and draw some comparisons there.

112

00:06:52.430  -->  00:06:56.400
Then we move on to one of the more important Unix Database associations.

113

00:06:56.420  -->  00:07:01.580
So how do we have multiple things in our database that are connected like users and comments or blog

114

00:07:01.610  -->  00:07:07.370
posts and comments and tags and votes and how are they all interrelated and connected to one another

115

00:07:07.380  -->  00:07:07.740
.

116

00:07:08.300  -->  00:07:11.620
And then we go back to camp and we add in comments.

117

00:07:11.660  -->  00:07:18.260
So we'll learn about database associations in a smaller project and then we added in the UPCAT then

118

00:07:18.250  -->  00:07:24.140
we move on to authentication user log in signing up signing out and locking in all of that.

119

00:07:24.200  -->  00:07:25.650
Using a tool called passport.

120

00:07:25.690  -->  00:07:28.700
Yes and we add that into our own application.

121

00:07:28.700  -->  00:07:34.220
We make an application with log in a smaller application and then just like before we go back to your

122

00:07:34.370  -->  00:07:40.630
camp and we add in authentication so that you now have to log in and log out to use the UPCAT or at

123

00:07:40.630  -->  00:07:42.390
least to use some features.

124

00:07:42.680  -->  00:07:47.480
And then we have another unit of our camp where at this point we've covered so much that we need to

125

00:07:47.480  -->  00:07:53.690
go back and clean some things up refactor which basically means move some code around rewrite some code

126

00:07:53.840  -->  00:07:58.660
so that it's cleaner shorter more modular so you'll see exactly what I mean in that unit.

127

00:07:58.750  -->  00:08:04.630
But it's devoted to reorganizing this large app because at that point it's gotten very large and then

128

00:08:04.630  -->  00:08:10.470
we talk about authorization which is another important topic which is basically user permissions.

129

00:08:10.630  -->  00:08:13.530
Different levels of things that users are allowed to do.

130

00:08:13.580  -->  00:08:16.580
So authentication is just letting people log in.

131

00:08:16.700  -->  00:08:24.110
Authorization is making sure that when I'm logged in I can only delete photos that belong to me or edit

132

00:08:24.110  -->  00:08:29.690
comments that I created I can't screw with somebody else's comments or someone else's posts unless I

133

00:08:29.690  -->  00:08:30.790
have permission to do that.

134

00:08:30.880  -->  00:08:32.180
So we talk about how that works.

135

00:08:32.300  -->  00:08:33.970
And we added into our camp.

136

00:08:34.190  -->  00:08:37.700
There's definitely a lot of stuff that we cover a lot of technologies.

137

00:08:37.750  -->  00:08:42.740
But the key point is that we go through this in a very logical and well-thought out order.

138

00:08:42.760  -->  00:08:47.980
I've taught all of these technologies multiple times over to tons different classes different students

139

00:08:47.990  -->  00:08:48.260
.

140

00:08:48.250  -->  00:08:53.330
It's much less intimidating that it might seem you don't have to be thinking ahead the entire time.

141

00:08:53.480  -->  00:08:58.690
But what I will do rather than just going straight ahead and just doing one unit at a time.

142

00:08:58.850  -->  00:09:04.430
We do have certain lectures that are optional these lessons that are looking ahead and looking back

143

00:09:04.420  -->  00:09:04.560
.

144

00:09:04.580  -->  00:09:09.790
So basically at certain points in the course I'll take a moment to say here's what we've covered here's

145

00:09:09.790  -->  00:09:14.160
where ever going so that you can start to have a mental map of of where we are.

146

00:09:14.180  -->  00:09:19.430
Often I found that students get lost sometimes and they don't have a big picture vision in their head

147

00:09:19.420  -->  00:09:20.200
of where they are.

148

00:09:20.270  -->  00:09:23.440
They just put their head down and focus on what's immediately in front of them.

149

00:09:23.720  -->  00:09:28.300
So that is important but it's also important to come up for air occasionally and talk about where we've

150

00:09:28.310  -->  00:09:32.260
come and how much further we have to go and basically draw that line.

151

00:09:32.300  -->  00:09:32.640
OK.

152

00:09:32.650  -->  00:09:36.550
So there's a lot of really exciting material lots of fun projects if we get to.

153

00:09:36.640  -->  00:09:40.430
Let's go ahead and get started by talking about an introduction to front and web development
