1

00:00:00,430  -->  00:00:01,110
OK.

2

00:00:01,260  -->  00:00:03,510
So it's time for yet another exercise here.

3

00:00:03,780  -->  00:00:09,540
And in this video we're going to work on creating a tic tac toe board as you can see over here on the

4

00:00:09,540  -->  00:00:12,830
left and this board obviously doesn't do anything.

5

00:00:12,840  -->  00:00:17,700
We can't do any logic there and actually complete the game until we get to the javascript unit.

6

00:00:18,270  -->  00:00:23,300
So the first thing that we need to do is talk about how this is actually structured.

7

00:00:23,520  -->  00:00:28,590
So I'm going to let you try and do this on your own but the first thing that I want to show is that

8

00:00:28,590  -->  00:00:30,080
this is a table here.

9

00:00:30,360  -->  00:00:37,730
So this is a table with three rows and then in each row there are three tiers.

10

00:00:37,740  -->  00:00:41,620
So one two three four five six seven eight nine.

11

00:00:42,210  -->  00:00:48,020
And then what we've done is given them a whit of 100 pixels and a height of 100 pixels and then we've

12

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:50,120
selected we turned on the border.

13

00:00:50,280  -->  00:00:57,150
So for these middle elements there's a left and a right border left right left right and then for the

14

00:00:57,150  -->  00:01:02,200
short the middle horizontal elements there's a top and bottom border top and bottom top and bottom.

15

00:01:02,440  -->  00:01:07,340
So I want to let you try and do that on your own first and then in the next video we'll do a solution

16

00:01:07,380  -->  00:01:08,440
as we go over together
