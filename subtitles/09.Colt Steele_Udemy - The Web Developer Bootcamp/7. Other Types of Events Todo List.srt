1

00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:01,810
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01,860  -->  00:00:07,110
In this video I want to talk a little bit more about some of the different types of events so far we've

3

00:00:07,110  -->  00:00:14,070
encountered the click event and the change event that we used on a text input or a number input in the

4

00:00:14,070  -->  00:00:15,640
score keeper app.

5

00:00:15,780  -->  00:00:18,930
I'm going to start by introducing the M.B.A. event reference.

6

00:00:18,930  -->  00:00:20,720
So that's the web page I'm on right here.

7

00:00:20,940  -->  00:00:26,790
And this web page is a reference to all the different events that are recognized by the DOM API.

8

00:00:26,910  -->  00:00:30,840
And if we scroll down you might be surprised at just how many there are.

9

00:00:31,260  -->  00:00:36,570
And I'm actually going to have you in the next exercise write some code just to count how many there

10

00:00:36,570  -->  00:00:41,040
are is a fun practical example of using the geometry of cons..

11

00:00:41,310  -->  00:00:45,990
So you're going to count how many there are but for now just know that there are a ton of them and there

12

00:00:45,990  -->  00:00:53,490
are probably five or six maybe up to 10 really common ones that will use all the time things like for

13

00:00:53,520  -->  00:01:00,120
drag and drop for a hovering event click events maybe double clicks key press events but otherwise a

14

00:01:00,120  -->  00:01:04,780
lot of the more obscure ones will never use or maybe you'll use them one time in a project.

15

00:01:05,190  -->  00:01:09,660
But it's good to know that this web page exists that there are so many events that we may never even

16

00:01:09,660  -->  00:01:10,510
use.

17

00:01:10,740  -->  00:01:15,240
And this video I'm going to focus on two event in particular that has to do with hovering so hovering

18

00:01:15,240  -->  00:01:16,980
over an element with your mouse.

19

00:01:17,100  -->  00:01:20,490
And those are called mouse over and mouse out.

20

00:01:20,790  -->  00:01:26,550
So I have a simple application and I'm going to make it's called to do that age him in my new file and

21

00:01:26,580  -->  00:01:31,910
I'm just going to add my regular boilerplate and this isn't going to be a complete To Do list.

22

00:01:31,920  -->  00:01:37,950
We won't be able to add new or that we're going to do is have a UL with three or four allies.

23

00:01:38,070  -->  00:01:51,060
Things like wash cat feed cat and we'll do feed cat to dog and save.

24

00:01:51,060  -->  00:01:54,340
So we have our three to do's and that's all we need for now.

25

00:01:54,630  -->  00:01:55,530
And what I want to do.

26

00:01:55,530  -->  00:01:58,590
I'm going to open this up in the browser.

27

00:01:58,590  -->  00:02:04,380
I want to be able to click and that should gray out the to do item and maybe strikethrough it put a

28

00:02:04,380  -->  00:02:05,190
line through it.

29

00:02:05,340  -->  00:02:09,250
But I also want to be able to hover and I want to know which one I'm hovering over.

30

00:02:09,270  -->  00:02:12,960
So I get this nice user feedback as I hover over one of these.

31

00:02:12,960  -->  00:02:18,210
Maybe you will have it change color or bold will start by just making it green and there are so many

32

00:02:18,210  -->  00:02:21,640
nice effects you can do for your user using these hover events.

33

00:02:21,810  -->  00:02:26,400
So I'll show that right now before we can actually write any javascript though we need to make our file

34

00:02:26,400  -->  00:02:26,870
.

35

00:02:26,940  -->  00:02:31,010
So I'm going to save a new file and I'll call it to do's.

36

00:02:31,180  -->  00:02:32,200
Yes.

37

00:02:32,520  -->  00:02:44,580
And as always I had my alert connected save go back here and add in our script at the bottom and our

38

00:02:44,580  -->  00:02:51,520
source is equal to the deuce dot J.S. and we'll save or refresh and we get our alert.

39

00:02:51,630  -->  00:02:53,190
That means it's working.

40

00:02:53,850  -->  00:02:58,710
Let's go at that first event that I mentioned and the first thing we need to do is select something

41

00:02:58,770  -->  00:03:00,100
before we can manipulate.

42

00:03:00,120  -->  00:03:03,050
So I'm going to start by just doing it to the first lie.

43

00:03:03,180  -->  00:03:12,810
So I'm going to use var first ally ECOs document and I'll do a query selector ally and remember this

44

00:03:12,810  -->  00:03:18,210
gives me the first lie because I didn't do a query selector all and then I'm going to add my event listener

45

00:03:18,270  -->  00:03:19,560
to first ally.

46

00:03:19,740  -->  00:03:27,750
So we went first ally add event listener and the event that we're listening for is not click it's mouse

47

00:03:28,290  -->  00:03:30,060
over.

48

00:03:30,060  -->  00:03:32,350
And then we give our callback function.

49

00:03:33,300  -->  00:03:38,650
And the way that mouseover works it's going to fire as soon as we start hovering over something.

50

00:03:38,790  -->  00:03:46,170
So if I was working with this last ally my mouse over it would fire right now and right now and the

51

00:03:46,170  -->  00:03:47,880
second one and right now and this first one.

52

00:03:47,880  -->  00:03:50,760
So it's about when the hover starts.

53

00:03:50,910  -->  00:03:57,570
So first of I'd add event listener mouseover and we'll just do a log instead of a callback mouse over

54

00:03:59,130  -->  00:04:05,730
and if we refresh open up our console remember we only did it to the first ally and there we go we get

55

00:04:05,730  -->  00:04:06,950
a mouseover.

56

00:04:07,080  -->  00:04:11,610
Also it's important to notice it's not continually firing every single time.

57

00:04:11,660  -->  00:04:16,050
You know we're over this it's when our hover over an element actually begins.

58

00:04:16,080  -->  00:04:20,610
So that's useful so that we're not constantly you know constantly logging or whatever the code is that

59

00:04:20,610  -->  00:04:21,770
we have in the callback.

60

00:04:21,780  -->  00:04:24,530
It only happens when we mouse over initially.

61

00:04:24,900  -->  00:04:29,660
So rather than just cancel that logging let's work on changing the color of the ally.

62

00:04:29,670  -->  00:04:30,640
Let's make it green.

63

00:04:30,720  -->  00:04:32,880
So when you hover over it turns green.

64

00:04:32,880  -->  00:04:43,870
So we need to do first ally dot style that color equals green and we save refresh and now watch I'll

65

00:04:43,880  -->  00:04:49,950
make him a little bigger and make this a little bigger here and refresh as I start my mouse over it

66

00:04:49,950  -->  00:04:50,800
turns green.

67

00:04:51,240  -->  00:04:55,300
And then when I go away it stays green which is not what we want.

68

00:04:55,410  -->  00:04:57,110
We just want this to be a hover effect.

69

00:04:57,150  -->  00:04:59,460
So when I hover over the ally it turns green.

70

00:04:59,490  -->  00:05:05,010
But when I stop it goes back to being black to do that we actually need another event and that event

71

00:05:05,010  -->  00:05:07,380
will fire when our hover is over.

72

00:05:07,410  -->  00:05:13,730
So when we leave this element and it's called Mouse out so we're going to do the same thing first ally

73

00:05:13,750  -->  00:05:13,940
.

74

00:05:14,090  -->  00:05:18,280
But at event Lessner mouse out.

75

00:05:19,680  -->  00:05:27,510
And then our callback function and we'll just do a first fly style attack color and set it back to black

76

00:05:27,510  -->  00:05:27,960
.

77

00:05:28,080  -->  00:05:37,130
Just like that and if we refresh you can see it goes green and then the mouse out goes back to black

78

00:05:37,130  -->  00:05:39,590
and mouse over a green and so on.

79

00:05:40,020  -->  00:05:45,000
So now we get this little hover effect that shows us what we're hovering over basically which to do

80

00:05:45,190  -->  00:05:46,960
is selected.

81

00:05:46,950  -->  00:05:50,130
So now let's get this to work for every single lie.

82

00:05:50,160  -->  00:05:52,230
It's just a few small changes that we need to do.

83

00:05:52,260  -->  00:05:55,460
And the first of them is we need to select all allies.

84

00:05:55,510  -->  00:06:02,940
Are going to change very variable to be far lies documented queries letter all allies so that gives

85

00:06:02,940  -->  00:06:05,070
us a list with the three allies.

86

00:06:05,400  -->  00:06:10,690
And then of course unfortunately we can't just do this lies that an event listener that doesn't work

87

00:06:10,690  -->  00:06:11,170
.

88

00:06:11,160  -->  00:06:14,860
We need to do a for loop four of our equals zero.

89

00:06:15,090  -->  00:06:18,950
I less than lies that link.

90

00:06:19,080  -->  00:06:20,710
Plus plus.

91

00:06:20,870  -->  00:06:25,150
And hopefully you're starting to feel a little more comfortable doing this adding events or manipulating

92

00:06:25,140  -->  00:06:30,100
something instead of a loop where we select a bunch of them and then we loop through and we do something

93

00:06:30,090  -->  00:06:30,990
individually.

94

00:06:31,180  -->  00:06:35,490
Like I said a few videos ago really common pattern really important that we start to get comfortable

95

00:06:35,500  -->  00:06:36,470
with it.

96

00:06:36,490  -->  00:06:40,550
So inside of here rather than doing first else I'd add event listener.

97

00:06:40,650  -->  00:06:45,760
We're working with allies bracket eyes so that's our individual ally.

98

00:06:45,930  -->  00:06:51,950
And then I'm going to just copy this code and there is a problem with this code.

99

00:06:51,960  -->  00:06:55,090
I mean it will work but it won't work in the way that we want it to.

100

00:06:55,360  -->  00:07:00,450
What will happen is we're adding an event listener to each ally allies.

101

00:07:00,960  -->  00:07:06,430
But when we mouse over any of them we're only changing first ally dot style black colored.

102

00:07:06,540  -->  00:07:09,800
And actually it won't work because first lie is not defined anymore.

103

00:07:09,810  -->  00:07:10,860
We changed the name.

104

00:07:11,040  -->  00:07:12,740
But that's not what we wanted anyways.

105

00:07:12,750  -->  00:07:17,220
We want it to be the ally that was hovered over that the mouse over event occurred on.

106

00:07:17,440  -->  00:07:21,110
So we can change this to the word this.

107

00:07:21,270  -->  00:07:26,400
Remember that the key word this instead of an event listener refers to the item or the element that

108

00:07:26,400  -->  00:07:28,020
the event was triggered on.

109

00:07:28,260  -->  00:07:33,210
So this style but colored equal screen and then we'll just duplicate this code again.

110

00:07:33,850  -->  00:07:41,940
But instead of mouse over we'll do a mouse out and instead of going to Green we'll go back to black

111

00:07:42,630  -->  00:07:48,780
and then we can get rid of this and refresh and there we go.

112

00:07:48,880  -->  00:07:50,710
We have our nice little hover effect.

113

00:07:51,060  -->  00:07:55,830
So the last thing they will talk about is adding a click listener just to make this a little more complete

114

00:07:55,830  -->  00:07:56,210
.

115

00:07:56,230  -->  00:08:07,150
So same thing like I thought had event listener click add or a callback function.

116

00:08:07,480  -->  00:08:10,610
And what we're going to do here is use a class.

117

00:08:10,830  -->  00:08:12,910
So I'm going to just add the class first.

118

00:08:12,900  -->  00:08:19,520
It doesn't exist but I'm going to say this does class list and will do toggle the start class list that

119

00:08:19,600  -->  00:08:20,290
toggle.

120

00:08:20,560  -->  00:08:22,680
And we'll just call the class done.

121

00:08:23,110  -->  00:08:29,930
So the point is I can click on one of these and it should Gray out and have a strikethrough effect.

122

00:08:30,030  -->  00:08:35,920
And even though I don't have a class done defined it's still added so I can show you that open up the

123

00:08:35,910  -->  00:08:38,720
console and let's inspect one of these.

124

00:08:39,070  -->  00:08:44,080
And then let's actually click on it and you can see or click on the first one you can see by the way

125

00:08:44,080  -->  00:08:48,470
the color green and black changing over here as a hover.

126

00:08:48,490  -->  00:08:52,920
But as I click on this first one you can see it adds class done.

127

00:08:52,920  -->  00:08:55,740
And then I click again and it goes away.

128

00:08:55,750  -->  00:08:58,070
So now we just need to define the class done.

129

00:08:58,330  -->  00:08:59,290
So let's do that now.

130

00:08:59,380  -->  00:09:07,350
I'll go over to sublime and make a new file and I'm going to save this as to do's that C Ss and the

131

00:09:07,360  -->  00:09:10,310
first thing we do is define our class done.

132

00:09:10,950  -->  00:09:16,960
And I'm going to give it a strikethrough effect which we do with text decoration and we set that line

133

00:09:16,950  -->  00:09:24,450
through and also change the opacity so opacity will be 0.5 and save.

134

00:09:24,820  -->  00:09:30,160
And then of course you need to link this to do start to assess to or aged him file with them like tag

135

00:09:30,900  -->  00:09:33,990
to Due's gutsiest us and we can save.

136

00:09:34,000  -->  00:09:35,440
Now let's test it out.

137

00:09:35,660  -->  00:09:36,830
You refresh the page.

138

00:09:36,850  -->  00:09:37,470
I hover.

139

00:09:37,500  -->  00:09:41,520
So get are two events changing the color black and green.

140

00:09:41,520  -->  00:09:45,360
And now I can click and we get a strikethrough effect.

141

00:09:45,540  -->  00:09:47,900
And this line through as well.

142

00:09:48,120  -->  00:09:53,550
There are a few small changes I would make However if we go back to our javascript file the first one

143

00:09:53,560  -->  00:09:56,590
is rather than changing the color manually here.

144

00:09:56,640  -->  00:09:58,350
Changing it to be green and black.

145

00:09:58,600  -->  00:10:00,800
I think it's still better to do it with our own class.

146

00:10:00,850  -->  00:10:07,240
So I'm going to make a new class and I'm going to call this one selected and then I'm going to say when

147

00:10:07,240  -->  00:10:12,060
it's selected text or color should be green just like that.

148

00:10:12,310  -->  00:10:13,880
And then we'll go with the Javascript.

149

00:10:13,990  -->  00:10:21,250
And when we mouse over all we want to do is say this class list add selected.

150

00:10:23,160  -->  00:10:29,340
And this comes back to that separation of concerns idea where we don't want our javascript's manipulating

151

00:10:29,350  -->  00:10:36,250
individual styles rather we can use javascript to turn on parts of our C Ss and the SAS will actually

152

00:10:36,250  -->  00:10:38,170
be in charge of the styling.

153

00:10:38,460  -->  00:10:44,550
So that will give it the class selected when we hover over and when we leave or when we mess out we'll

154

00:10:44,560  -->  00:10:55,040
do this dumb class list remove selected and if we save refresh you can see it looks pretty good.

155

00:10:55,530  -->  00:10:59,460
We click we get our strikethrough.

156

00:11:00,080  -->  00:11:00,590
All right.

157

00:11:00,610  -->  00:11:02,260
There's a little to do list.

158

00:11:02,740  -->  00:11:05,000
So this is a slightly nicer way of doing it.

159

00:11:05,050  -->  00:11:06,390
Functionally it looks the same.

160

00:11:06,420  -->  00:11:11,720
It's just a better practice to use classes rather than adding and tweaking styles one at a time.

161

00:11:11,740  -->  00:11:16,270
So to sum up here we saw two new events mouseover and mouse out.

162

00:11:16,530  -->  00:11:21,690
And we also got some more practice setting up events instead of a loop where we used this keyword
