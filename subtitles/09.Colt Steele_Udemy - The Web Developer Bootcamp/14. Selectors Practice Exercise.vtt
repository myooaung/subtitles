00:00:00.200  -->  00:00:02.540
All right so it's time for another exercise here.

2

00:00:02.820  -->  00:00:08.430
So this exercise is going to cover everything that we've talked about as far as SS selectors.

3

00:00:08.520  -->  00:00:14.700
So we're not going to actually build any sort of complete cohesive Web site that's coming next.

4

00:00:14.700  -->  00:00:17.930
We're going to make a little blog in the next exercise.

5

00:00:17.970  -->  00:00:23.460
This one is more of a traditional exercise with a bunch of problems very short problems.

6

00:00:23.460  -->  00:00:28.150
Basically I'm giving you a bunch of HMO it looks like this.

7

00:00:28.200  -->  00:00:29.900
It doesn't really mean anything.

8

00:00:29.910  -->  00:00:33.640
In fact all the text here is from a Web site called hipster ipsum.

9

00:00:33.650  -->  00:00:41.280
It's it's just like a dorm ipsum except it's using hipster words like farm to table and locavore and

10

00:00:41.280  -->  00:00:44.170
Portland and Williamsburg.

11

00:00:44.340  -->  00:00:45.940
So it's just a bunch of words.

12

00:00:46.260  -->  00:00:51.500
So the point is it doesn't matter what's here what does matter though is this file.

13

00:00:51.570  -->  00:00:54.700
The CSSA file that I also gave you and it's empty.

14

00:00:54.810  -->  00:01:00.250
Aside from a bunch of comments and these comments give you instructions for what you need to do.

15

00:01:00.360  -->  00:01:06.030
So up top is the most important line style the age HTML elements according to the following instructions

16

00:01:06.240  -->  00:01:09.250
do not alter the existing HVM else to do this right.

17

00:01:09.270  -->  00:01:11.020
Only CSI s.

18

00:01:11.130  -->  00:01:14.120
So that means don't touch this file.

19

00:01:14.190  -->  00:01:16.430
This is here just as starter code for you.

20

00:01:16.440  -->  00:01:17.690
This is the HVM.

21

00:01:17.970  -->  00:01:24.450
You're going to do everything in C SS So you cannot go in here and add new ideas or add new classes

22

00:01:24.750  -->  00:01:25.710
or add new elements.

23

00:01:25.710  -->  00:01:28.350
Just keep it exactly how it is.

24

00:01:28.580  -->  00:01:32.120
So the way that it works there are different problems.

25

00:01:32.190  -->  00:01:37.310
So the first one gives the body element a background of this color.

26

00:01:37.440  -->  00:01:45.210
We would just write the code into select the body and then give it a color like this.

27

00:01:45.210  -->  00:01:48.690
So I'll give you that one for free.

28

00:01:49.050  -->  00:01:51.200
I'm sure most of you could have done that.

29

00:01:51.300  -->  00:01:57.720
Same goes for all of these so make all h ones make all age to do something make all ally elements one

30

00:01:57.720  -->  00:01:58.350
note.

31

00:01:58.350  -->  00:02:04.020
Some of these will ask you to use a property that we haven't actually covered yet and that's deliberate

32

00:02:04.230  -->  00:02:04.510
.

33

00:02:04.590  -->  00:02:08.760
I just want you to have some experience for some properties that we haven't explicitly talked about

34

00:02:08.760  -->  00:02:09.750
in videos yet.

35

00:02:10.080  -->  00:02:11.960
So in that case here's one.

36

00:02:12.030  -->  00:02:18.600
Make all the paragraphs that are nested inside of divs 25 pixel fun and then in parentheses I give you

37

00:02:18.600  -->  00:02:22.700
the code that you need so font size 25 x.

38

00:02:23.070  -->  00:02:24.490
So there's a few more of those.

39

00:02:24.720  -->  00:02:32.160
Here's one and here's one more make all checked checkboxes have a left margin of 50 pixels so you need

40

00:02:32.160  -->  00:02:37.650
to use margin left 50 pixels and it's OK that you don't know exactly what it does that's coming in the

41

00:02:37.650  -->  00:02:39.330
next few videos.

42

00:02:39.450  -->  00:02:40.900
So one other note here.

43

00:02:41.040  -->  00:02:44.080
These get a little bit harder as they go along.

44

00:02:44.190  -->  00:02:52.020
So up top they start with just an element selector and then we talk about classes and ideas and then

45

00:02:52.020  -->  00:02:56.270
we start to talk about some of those other selectors that we mentioned in the last video.

46

00:02:56.430  -->  00:03:03.960
So make all of the paragraphs that are nested inside of divs make only inputs with type text.

47

00:03:03.960  -->  00:03:11.910
Have a great background and then things like give the second paragraph inside the third div 5 pixel

48

00:03:11.910  -->  00:03:13.160
white border.

49

00:03:13.710  -->  00:03:20.040
So the good news is that all of the selectors that you need to use here can be found in the 30s CSSA

50

00:03:20.090  -->  00:03:20.640
selectors.

51

00:03:20.640  -->  00:03:25.890
You must memorize article and you can easily find them on line and we've covered most of them.

52

00:03:26.130  -->  00:03:31.620
There are a few though that we didn't cover in the last video and those are under the bonus challenges

53

00:03:31.620  -->  00:03:32.410
section.

54

00:03:32.580  -->  00:03:39.870
So that includes things like making all checked checkboxes have a left margin so there's a way to select

55

00:03:39.990  -->  00:03:42.780
the checked checkboxes.

56

00:03:42.780  -->  00:03:44.050
Or here's another one.

57

00:03:44.110  -->  00:03:49.750
Make the first letter of the element with special green and 100 pixel font size.

58

00:03:49.950  -->  00:03:54.100
So there's a way to select just the first letter.

59

00:03:54.570  -->  00:04:00.150
Make the H-1 elements color change to blue when hovered over and make a tag elements that have been

60

00:04:00.150  -->  00:04:01.340
visited grey.

61

00:04:01.350  -->  00:04:05.070
So remember a tag is a link and you've probably seen this before.

62

00:04:05.190  -->  00:04:09.420
You can change or sites will change the color of a link that you've been to compared to a link that

63

00:04:09.420  -->  00:04:10.730
you haven't been to before.

64

00:04:11.100  -->  00:04:14.120
So there's a way of writing that would see assess.

65

00:04:14.310  -->  00:04:17.450
So as always in the next video we're going to go over a solution.

66

00:04:17.460  -->  00:04:23.880
Can it go bit by bit but I recommend you give this a shot go as far as you can try all of these bonuses

67

00:04:23.880  -->  00:04:24.660
.

68

00:04:24.660  -->  00:04:28.430
One thing I didn't mention here this one is slightly different.

69

00:04:28.500  -->  00:04:34.970
Make the label elements all uppercase without changing the h t m l so the selector here is actually

70

00:04:35.340  -->  00:04:41.430
simple we're just selecting all label elements but the property is a little challenging.

71

00:04:41.430  -->  00:04:47.250
There is a way using C Ss to make something all uppercase without actually changing the text in the

72

00:04:47.450  -->  00:04:47.870
HTML.

73

00:04:47.880  -->  00:04:51.720
You can do it through C Ss just like you would change the color or the border.

74

00:04:51.720  -->  00:04:55.320
You can change a property that will make it uppercase or lowercase.

75

00:04:55.560  -->  00:04:56.690
All right so see in the next video
