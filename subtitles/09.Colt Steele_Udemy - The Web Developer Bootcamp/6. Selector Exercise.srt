1

00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:05,100
All right so it's time for our first Jay queery exercise the way that this one works is that I'm going

2

00:00:05,100  -->  00:00:11,370
to give you some sample aged hymnal for divs some have classes some have ideas and they'll take those

3

00:00:11,370  -->  00:00:18,270
for divs and put them in your own age HTML file and you'll need to include Jay query correctly up to

4

00:00:18,270  -->  00:00:22,330
you how you do that if you want to use a Cdn or if you want to download it.

5

00:00:22,650  -->  00:00:27,720
And then there are four quick challenges that I want you to attempt using Jay Querrey and in particular

6

00:00:27,990  -->  00:00:32,040
the dollar sign to select and Dot see SS to style.

7

00:00:32,070  -->  00:00:33,130
So the first one.

8

00:00:33,270  -->  00:00:36,590
Select all divs and give them a purple background.

9

00:00:36,870  -->  00:00:43,200
The next one is selects the divs with class highlight and make them 200 pixels wide.

10

00:00:43,200  -->  00:00:49,800
The third one is to select the div with the ID third and give it an orange border up to you how wide

11

00:00:49,920  -->  00:00:51,930
and what style of the border.

12

00:00:52,110  -->  00:00:58,630
And then the bonus is to select the first div only and change its font color to be pink.

13

00:00:58,650  -->  00:01:00,120
So go ahead give this a shot.

14

00:01:00,120  -->  00:01:01,710
You'll need to post a video.

15

00:01:01,710  -->  00:01:03,280
Create a New Age HTML file.

16

00:01:03,330  -->  00:01:08,730
Include a query and then copy this code in or type it up yourself and then you'll need to solve these

17

00:01:08,730  -->  00:01:09,660
four challenges.

18

00:01:09,660  -->  00:01:11,130
So go ahead post a video.

19

00:01:11,130  -->  00:01:13,500
I'll be back in just a few seconds with the solution

20

00:01:20,970  -->  00:01:21,730
already.

21

00:01:21,750  -->  00:01:24,700
Let's go ahead and type up a quick solution to this.

22

00:01:25,050  -->  00:01:29,070
As always the first thing we need to do is make our each time file.

23

00:01:29,070  -->  00:01:30,220
So I have a new file.

24

00:01:30,240  -->  00:01:37,740
I called it exercise that h t m l and I'll save it and then add in my regular h tim l boilerplate and

25

00:01:37,740  -->  00:01:45,760
we'll just call this J query exercise in the title and then I'll go ahead and add in our starter DML

26

00:01:46,060  -->  00:01:48,780
and I'll just copy it in rather than typing it.

27

00:01:49,520  -->  00:01:52,080
OK so we have the four elements.

28

00:01:52,080  -->  00:01:54,660
Now let's go and add Jay Querrey.

29

00:01:54,780  -->  00:02:00,330
Remember we have two ways of doing that we can include it locally or we can link to a CDN.

30

00:02:00,480  -->  00:02:03,150
So I'll show both the first one.

31

00:02:03,510  -->  00:02:05,710
I'm just going to copy the file over.

32

00:02:06,030  -->  00:02:10,430
So I have to modify version here just to command c command V.

33

00:02:10,620  -->  00:02:14,350
So I now have it in the same directory as my exercise that age Simmo.

34

00:02:14,580  -->  00:02:21,540
And then I'll go over here and the first thing that I want to do is add a script tag script and then

35

00:02:21,600  -->  00:02:28,620
I'll add source equals and then I need to make sure that I match that correctly which is Jay dash to

36

00:02:28,660  -->  00:02:31,000
point 1.4 men.

37

00:02:31,080  -->  00:02:32,110
Yes.

38

00:02:32,190  -->  00:02:38,230
So Jay queery dash to point one point for Dot men.

39

00:02:38,390  -->  00:02:45,640
Jesus we'll save that and open it up in our browser and do our little test to see if it works.

40

00:02:46,650  -->  00:02:47,950
It looks like it found the file.

41

00:02:47,970  -->  00:02:55,920
Otherwise it would give us an error and we can always try doing something like a dollar sign div and

42

00:02:55,920  -->  00:02:56,910
see what we get.

43

00:02:57,030  -->  00:02:57,910
And it's working.

44

00:02:57,900  -->  00:03:00,060
It's selecting our 4 divs.

45

00:03:00,060  -->  00:03:02,670
We can also include A-J queries CDN.

46

00:03:03,180  -->  00:03:04,600
And I just google for that.

47

00:03:04,680  -->  00:03:07,510
Jay quercetin and then pick our version.

48

00:03:07,980  -->  00:03:09,690
So we don't want 3.0.

49

00:03:09,930  -->  00:03:10,670
I'm sure it works fine.

50

00:03:10,680  -->  00:03:12,940
But that's the newest version and it's still an alpha.

51

00:03:13,050  -->  00:03:15,070
So there's probably some bugs and some issues.

52

00:03:15,150  -->  00:03:22,500
So to point one point four is the most recent stable version then we'll copy this URL and then we'll

53

00:03:22,500  -->  00:03:27,870
add another script tag and I'll leave them both here and just comment one out and reset the source equal

54

00:03:27,870  -->  00:03:28,830
to that you are wrong.

55

00:03:28,950  -->  00:03:33,920
So either one works I'll use the Cdn since I already proved to you that we

56

00:03:37,260  -->  00:03:38,460
all use the Cdn.

57

00:03:38,490  -->  00:03:42,360
Since I already proved that this one worked just for variety sake.

58

00:03:42,510  -->  00:03:47,180
So we'll save and then refresh and double check does our code still work.

59

00:03:47,460  -->  00:03:49,830
Yes it's finding dollar signs just fine.

60

00:03:49,830  -->  00:03:51,510
It's connected to J Qwerty.

61

00:03:51,600  -->  00:03:58,320
One point that I'd like to make is that we include J queery up top in the head and we use it in our

62

00:03:58,320  -->  00:04:01,330
scripts that we write down in the body.

63

00:04:01,590  -->  00:04:06,930
And the reason we do that remember things load in the order that they're declared So we want Arjay query

64

00:04:07,200  -->  00:04:11,120
to definitely load before we use it instead of a script.

65

00:04:11,430  -->  00:04:18,620
So our script that we need to define is where we'll write our code and we'll just call it exercise.

66

00:04:18,640  -->  00:04:19,720
J s.

67

00:04:19,850  -->  00:04:28,200
And then we need to make that file exercise that J us and we'll put that right here in the same directory

68

00:04:29,550  -->  00:04:36,210
and what we can do is a really simple test to see if it's connected both to our h tim file and to the

69

00:04:36,210  -->  00:04:41,790
J query if it's able to see and use the J query method we'll just do something like this.

70

00:04:41,820  -->  00:04:54,140
If J query else will do something else so if there is J query we will alert a query loaded else we'll

71

00:04:54,130  -->  00:04:59,780
alerts know Jay Querrey sad face and save.

72

00:05:00,020  -->  00:05:03,540
And if we refresh now we get J query loaded.

73

00:05:03,760  -->  00:05:05,240
So that tells us two things.

74

00:05:05,260  -->  00:05:12,020
One this script is running exercise that Jesus is connected and two were able to use the Jay Querrey

75

00:05:12,010  -->  00:05:12,570
methods.

76

00:05:12,820  -->  00:05:20,200
If we did this in reverse order though and I put Jay query after I included my exercise Jay Yes and

77

00:05:20,200  -->  00:05:26,350
I save and refresh we get an error which tells us J query is not defined so you can see the importance

78

00:05:26,410  -->  00:05:28,260
of the order that we put things in.

79

00:05:28,510  -->  00:05:34,660
So we always want to put our libraries that our code depends on up top in the head at the very least

80

00:05:34,690  -->  00:05:37,540
we want to put them before our scripts that use them.

81

00:05:37,720  -->  00:05:42,850
Let's go back to the assignment and the first thing we need to do is correctly include Jay Querrey which

82

00:05:42,850  -->  00:05:44,020
we've already done.

83

00:05:44,020  -->  00:05:48,670
Next up we need to select all the divs and give them a purple background.

84

00:05:49,000  -->  00:05:55,530
So we'll go ahead and select all divs by using dollar sign instead of quotes.

85

00:05:55,690  -->  00:05:58,360
All we need to do is select div with CSSA.

86

00:05:58,390  -->  00:06:02,520
So just div dot C S S and we'll make them purple.

87

00:06:02,560  -->  00:06:09,230
So color or background in this case is purple or we could have used our own R.G. B shade of purple.

88

00:06:09,380  -->  00:06:14,320
And if you don't remember how we make purple with RGV then you need to go play the R.G. became a little

89

00:06:14,320  -->  00:06:15,560
bit more.

90

00:06:15,670  -->  00:06:20,110
So that's the first one we can save and check that that worked by refreshing.

91

00:06:20,530  -->  00:06:22,910
And we get four purple backgrounds.

92

00:06:23,200  -->  00:06:23,770
OK.

93

00:06:23,920  -->  00:06:25,050
So that's that.

94

00:06:25,090  -->  00:06:28,780
That is selecting all the divs and giving them a purple background.

95

00:06:28,780  -->  00:06:32,360
I'll just add a little note here and comment that out.

96

00:06:32,620  -->  00:06:38,670
Next up we want to select the divs with class equal to highlight and make them 200 pixels wide.

97

00:06:38,990  -->  00:06:45,340
So that will work very similarly but to select the divs with class equal to highlight what we need to

98

00:06:45,340  -->  00:06:47,390
do is use dollar sign again.

99

00:06:47,950  -->  00:07:02,770
And rather than div we can use dot highlight and then do C Ss with and that will be 200 peaks.

100

00:07:02,870  -->  00:07:07,660
It's worth noting that this technically selects anything that has a class of highlight.

101

00:07:07,660  -->  00:07:13,540
If you want it to be explicit and say only the divs that have the class of highlight we could have an

102

00:07:13,540  -->  00:07:18,470
anchor tag or a paragraph that also have that class we would write this selector.

103

00:07:18,670  -->  00:07:22,290
And this is C S S that says all divs with the class of highlight.

104

00:07:22,390  -->  00:07:24,370
But in this case it will make a difference.

105

00:07:24,380  -->  00:07:31,750
So 200 pixels with refresh and you can see these two divs have the class of highlight the second and

106

00:07:31,750  -->  00:07:35,260
the fourth div and they have a with 200 pixels.

107

00:07:35,890  -->  00:07:41,100
OK the next one is to select the div with the idea of third.

108

00:07:41,460  -->  00:07:50,320
And to give it an orange border so to select the div with that Id dollar sign again and instead of dot

109

00:07:50,590  -->  00:07:51,850
we need our to Thorpe.

110

00:07:52,300  -->  00:07:59,060
And then the name of the ID that SS order and it's up to us.

111

00:07:59,080  -->  00:08:00,680
All I said was color is orange.

112

00:08:00,870  -->  00:08:10,420
So let's do a two pixel solid orange border and save and refresh and we now have that orange border

113

00:08:10,420  -->  00:08:11,140
right there.

114

00:08:11,190  -->  00:08:14,680
I'll make it a little bit bigger so that it shows better in the screencast.

115

00:08:14,680  -->  00:08:15,280
There we go.

116

00:08:15,500  -->  00:08:20,360
And that's around a third div which has the ID of the word.

117

00:08:20,650  -->  00:08:26,710
So the last challenge which was a bonus is to select the first div only and change its font color to

118

00:08:26,710  -->  00:08:32,380
pink the way that will select the first div is using a CSSA pseudo selector.

119

00:08:32,380  -->  00:08:41,030
First of type so div colon first dash of dash type which you should be familiar with from some of the

120

00:08:41,020  -->  00:08:42,710
CSSA selector videos.

121

00:08:42,910  -->  00:08:53,440
And then we'll just make it pink that's the SS color pink and we save and refresh and you can see the

122

00:08:53,440  -->  00:08:55,730
color is pink.

123

00:08:55,730  -->  00:09:02,480
The other option that we have is there's actually a built in J query shortcut which is just Colan first

124

00:09:02,920  -->  00:09:05,350
and that also works just fine.

125

00:09:05,380  -->  00:09:11,800
An interesting note is that using colon first is actually a little slower than first of type because

126

00:09:11,810  -->  00:09:19,970
first of type is built in to see assess it is a CSSA selector versus first is a J query shortcut.

127

00:09:20,060  -->  00:09:23,590
So it's not native C Ss it's just ever so slightly slower.

128

00:09:23,770  -->  00:09:25,540
So I would use first of type.

129

00:09:25,880  -->  00:09:28,870
OK so that's it for this exercise in the next few videos.

130

00:09:29,000  -->  00:09:33,360
We're going to learn about other ways of manipulating things rather than just changing SEUS us
