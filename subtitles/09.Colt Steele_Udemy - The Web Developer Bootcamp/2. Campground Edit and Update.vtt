1

00:00:00.200  -->  00:00:01.160
OK we'll come back.

2

00:00:01.230  -->  00:00:04.020
So we're going to get started on editing campgrounds.

3

00:00:04.200  -->  00:00:10.080
So this is a little bit of review from the rest to unit where we made that blog up with semantic UI

4

00:00:10.740  -->  00:00:13.460
but we're going to add some new concepts on top of that as well.

5

00:00:13.470  -->  00:00:19.050
In particular when we get to comments to start though we're working on editing campgrounds so that when

6

00:00:19.050  -->  00:00:22.320
I go to the campground show page first off to start the server

7

00:00:25.320  -->  00:00:32.610
I should be able to see a button that says edit I can click that edit button takes me to a form I fill

8

00:00:32.610  -->  00:00:38.490
it out that forms submit to the update campground route and then that will redirect me back to the show

9

00:00:38.490  -->  00:00:38.900
page.

10

00:00:38.910  -->  00:00:40.340
And we should see those changes.

11

00:00:40.500  -->  00:00:42.220
And anyone can do this to start.

12

00:00:42.300  -->  00:00:44.410
No permissions no authorization.

13

00:00:44.430  -->  00:00:46.740
We'll talk about what that means in just a few videos.

14

00:00:46.770  -->  00:00:49.360
Once we cover the leading campgrounds as well.

15

00:00:49.380  -->  00:00:49.620
Great.

16

00:00:49.620  -->  00:00:51.030
So let's get started.

17

00:00:51.060  -->  00:00:54.800
First thing that we need to do is add in method override.

18

00:00:54.810  -->  00:01:02.220
And I'm going to pull up the restful routing chart that I made just so that we can remind ourselves

19

00:01:03.360  -->  00:01:04.890
the routes that we need.

20

00:01:04.890  -->  00:01:08.860
So let me just add this as another file in the same window.

21

00:01:09.270  -->  00:01:18.510
Remember that it is slash campground slash ID slash at it and update is sashed campground slash ID as

22

00:01:18.570  -->  00:01:19.630
a put request.

23

00:01:19.740  -->  00:01:28.800
So we need method override for that put request so we can start there NPM install method Dasch override

24

00:01:28.800  -->  00:01:29.020
.

25

00:01:29.160  -->  00:01:30.760
And I mentioned this in the last video.

26

00:01:30.810  -->  00:01:33.930
But just to remind you I'm working in V 10.

27

00:01:34.140  -->  00:01:35.540
So it's a new version.

28

00:01:35.910  -->  00:01:36.370
OK.

29

00:01:36.540  -->  00:01:40.800
Method over I'd dash dash save make sure that works.

30

00:01:40.860  -->  00:01:44.800
While that's going on closed this down and will open up.

31

00:01:44.800  -->  00:01:55.350
Actually yes and will also open up campground J s wraps and we're going to add a spot in after show

32

00:01:56.130  -->  00:01:58.750
for at campground row.

33

00:01:59.880  -->  00:02:03.440
And another one for update campground.

34

00:02:04.260  -->  00:02:09.640
And if you're forgetting why we need both of them you can review that restful route's video of that

35

00:02:09.640  -->  00:02:16.110
unit we went into a lot of detail but again it's just we need a form on it and the form has to submit

36

00:02:16.110  -->  00:02:17.870
somewhere which is update.

37

00:02:18.300  -->  00:02:23.580
OK so inside actress let's now configure it to use method overhead.

38

00:02:23.730  -->  00:02:26.630
So we first need to require it.

39

00:02:26.640  -->  00:02:30.300
So that's going to be method override.

40

00:02:30.300  -->  00:02:35.690
We can call it whatever we want of course but this matters method Dasch override.

41

00:02:36.660  -->  00:02:47.010
And then we have to do an apt use use method override and then we have to tell it what to look for and

42

00:02:47.010  -->  00:02:48.590
we want underscore method.

43

00:02:48.960  -->  00:02:51.260
That's the conventional thing that you'll see all the time.

44

00:02:51.270  -->  00:02:54.900
I think that's actually what they recommend on the method to override documentation.

45

00:02:55.140  -->  00:02:56.400
So underscore method.

46

00:02:56.400  -->  00:02:57.250
Great.

47

00:02:57.330  -->  00:03:02.160
Now we're going to actually take a step back and work on the Edit Raben so that we can get the form

48

00:03:02.160  -->  00:03:02.900
to show.

49

00:03:03.300  -->  00:03:06.500
So let's start there in our campground J.S. routes.

50

00:03:06.900  -->  00:03:12.890
The route is a get request and rather than app we're actually working on router.

51

00:03:12.990  -->  00:03:17.760
You can see so router get slash.

52

00:03:17.760  -->  00:03:25.860
And we don't need to say campgrounds slash ID slash at it because remember interrupts Yes we're requiring

53

00:03:25.860  -->  00:03:27.520
the route's right here.

54

00:03:27.960  -->  00:03:31.830
We're adding all of the campground routes after sosh campgrounds.

55

00:03:31.890  -->  00:03:32.940
So we don't need that.

56

00:03:33.030  -->  00:03:41.770
So we just need slash ID slash at it and then our requests and our response and the callback.

57

00:03:42.000  -->  00:03:48.820
And as always it's to arrest us and at that campground route and just make sure we see that.

58

00:03:49.610  -->  00:03:51.520
OK but start things up.

59

00:03:51.720  -->  00:03:54.100
Make sure we don't have any problems.

60

00:03:55.230  -->  00:03:59.960
Let's refresh and then just add on slash at it.

61

00:04:00.180  -->  00:04:00.740
Great.

62

00:04:00.810  -->  00:04:02.740
We see it at campground right.

63

00:04:02.880  -->  00:04:04.370
That's all we needed.

64

00:04:04.380  -->  00:04:07.230
Now let's go back and actually render a form.

65

00:04:07.230  -->  00:04:15.510
So rez render it needs to be campgrounds which is our views directory here.

66

00:04:15.510  -->  00:04:19.080
Slash at it which doesn't exist yet.

67

00:04:19.440  -->  00:04:21.600
So let's make that file now.

68

00:04:21.600  -->  00:04:26.440
So we want to do a touch fuse slash campgrounds slash at it.

69

00:04:26.460  -->  00:04:26.730
E.J..

70

00:04:26.730  -->  00:04:27.480
Yes.

71

00:04:27.810  -->  00:04:32.090
And then C9 that file again.

72

00:04:32.130  -->  00:04:39.840
Tab completion is your friend there and we'll start simple with just edit form and then let's add in

73

00:04:40.140  -->  00:04:45.550
another line just paragraph form goes here just so that we know for sure we're getting the right age

74

00:04:45.550  -->  00:04:45.570
.

75

00:04:45.580  -->  00:04:51.920
Tim I'll start the server again refresh and receive your template.

76

00:04:52.110  -->  00:04:52.860
Great.

77

00:04:52.920  -->  00:04:59.100
So now we're going to add a form here and rather than creating our own form from scratch I'm going to

78

00:04:59.100  -->  00:05:06.480
take the new form for campground just right here and copy this over because it's really similar to what

79

00:05:06.480  -->  00:05:14.530
we need so really the only difference between new and edit is where the form is going.

80

00:05:14.530  -->  00:05:18.100
That's one difference and the type of requests that we're making.

81

00:05:18.490  -->  00:05:24.430
So let's start by specifying the action and we can do what we need to do just yet because it needs to

82

00:05:24.430  -->  00:05:25.200
be campgrounds.

83

00:05:25.270  -->  00:05:31.500
Slash and Id like something like that slash at it but we need to get that ID.

84

00:05:31.660  -->  00:05:35.550
And right now we don't have that particular campground that we're editing.

85

00:05:35.770  -->  00:05:42.160
So inside that edit route not only do we render a template but we need to pass in a campground that

86

00:05:42.160  -->  00:05:43.280
we're editing.

87

00:05:43.300  -->  00:05:47.950
We haven't found that campground yet but I'm going to give it a variable name found campground that

88

00:05:47.950  -->  00:05:48.860
doesn't exist.

89

00:05:48.920  -->  00:05:52.050
You see we're getting complaints from cloud nine.

90

00:05:52.120  -->  00:06:02.080
Now we need to do a campground find by id and then the ID is right here request harams ID and then our

91

00:06:02.080  -->  00:06:12.310
callback error and otherwise we'll call it found campground just like that if there's an error.

92

00:06:12.820  -->  00:06:14.340
Let's do a rest.

93

00:06:14.830  -->  00:06:19.040
Redirect and we'll just go back to slash campgrounds.

94

00:06:19.300  -->  00:06:27.540
Otherwise we'll render the edit form and pass in found campground under the name campground.

95

00:06:28.000  -->  00:06:28.810
Great.

96

00:06:28.810  -->  00:06:34.990
Now instead of our template we'll use campground to set up the link for update route.

97

00:06:35.020  -->  00:06:40.870
So it's campgrounds slash campground down underscore ID Ejay Yes.

98

00:06:40.990  -->  00:06:47.170
So this is the value of the campground to ID the campground that we're passing to this template slash

99

00:06:47.170  -->  00:06:48.250
at it.

100

00:06:48.850  -->  00:06:54.640
And then the other tricky thing is that remember this needs to be a put request that we're making and

101

00:06:54.640  -->  00:07:02.350
to do that we actually have to send a question mark underscore method equals put and then we leave method

102

00:07:02.470  -->  00:07:03.510
as post.

103

00:07:03.940  -->  00:07:05.490
So that's one change we'll make.

104

00:07:05.500  -->  00:07:07.240
We'll also update what we say here.

105

00:07:07.360  -->  00:07:15.180
So I'll do it and then the name of the campground campground name and see what we get.

106

00:07:15.190  -->  00:07:24.040
So if we go restart refresh the page we get edit desert high that's named at the campground and we're

107

00:07:24.040  -->  00:07:25.090
close.

108

00:07:25.210  -->  00:07:30.850
We have a form that will submit if I if I click submit though we don't have the routes set up so it's

109

00:07:30.850  -->  00:07:34.000
telling me cannot put slash campgrounds.

110

00:07:34.740  -->  00:07:40.570
But to start let's fill in the data here so that when I edit a campground I see the data that I'm editing

111

00:07:40.600  -->  00:07:43.050
and or have to type it all from scratch.

112

00:07:43.240  -->  00:07:50.020
So that's simple if you remember back to the first video on it and update with the blog site rather

113

00:07:50.020  -->  00:07:51.530
than giving it a placeholder.

114

00:07:51.880  -->  00:07:57.820
We're going to give it a value and the value just needs to be campground and whatever the property is

115

00:07:57.850  -->  00:08:03.130
a campground name and I'll copy this down for the image you throw.

116

00:08:03.190  -->  00:08:05.740
So campground that image.

117

00:08:06.520  -->  00:08:14.130
And then finally campground that description I make sure I spelt that right.

118

00:08:14.410  -->  00:08:21.100
So remember what we're doing is looking up a campground in the route based off of the ID then rendering

119

00:08:21.100  -->  00:08:22.210
this template.

120

00:08:22.210  -->  00:08:28.760
And if I refresh you'll see that we're taking the data we found from our find by id passing that campground

121

00:08:28.760  -->  00:08:33.010
to the template and then displaying the information as the inputs values.

122

00:08:33.310  -->  00:08:34.700
So we have that done now.

123

00:08:34.930  -->  00:08:37.570
Now we need to work on when I actually submit this.

124

00:08:37.570  -->  00:08:39.070
So let's change this.

125

00:08:39.340  -->  00:08:44.180
So we see some changes add some extra symbols and hit submit.

126

00:08:44.290  -->  00:08:47.490
And of course I have this problem where we don't have the update route.

127

00:08:47.800  -->  00:08:49.410
So let's do that next.

128

00:08:49.960  -->  00:08:55.300
We can close out of our new I'll keep at it open for a little bit but we need to add in our update route

129

00:08:56.080  -->  00:08:59.550
which is just going to be a router dot put.

130

00:09:00.570  -->  00:09:06.550
And if you forget what it is update it's a put request to slash campgrounds slash.

131

00:09:06.550  -->  00:09:12.130
Id just like the show page except it to put request not a get request.

132

00:09:12.610  -->  00:09:16.850
So slash colon ID and that's it.

133

00:09:17.540  -->  00:09:20.760
Request in response and then we save.

134

00:09:20.960  -->  00:09:30.010
And inside of here what we need to do remember is we need to find and update the correct campground

135

00:09:31.120  -->  00:09:36.790
and then redirect somewhere usually the show page is what makes sense once you update an item you don't

136

00:09:36.790  -->  00:09:40.900
want to just go back to the whole list of campgrounds but you want to see your changes actually on the

137

00:09:40.900  -->  00:09:42.000
show page.

138

00:09:42.040  -->  00:09:46.330
So we'll begin with finding an updating which we could do separately.

139

00:09:46.360  -->  00:09:51.000
You could do a find by id and then do an update afterwards.

140

00:09:51.270  -->  00:09:58.510
But remember remember mongoose has that nice combination which is campground.

141

00:09:58.770  -->  00:10:05.160
Find by id and update and it takes in a few arguments.

142

00:10:05.160  -->  00:10:12.710
The first one is what we're finding what ID are looking for which is just request up harams ID from

143

00:10:12.720  -->  00:10:13.880
right here.

144

00:10:14.430  -->  00:10:22.650
Next is the data that we want to update and if we look at our form our data is name image and description

145

00:10:22.650  -->  00:10:23.520
.

146

00:10:23.520  -->  00:10:32.820
So what we could do is build a new object in here that looks like var data equals and then we'd say

147

00:10:32.940  -->  00:10:41.060
name is requests that body that name image is request body image.

148

00:10:41.280  -->  00:10:42.810
But that's a little bit of a pain.

149

00:10:43.110  -->  00:10:44.620
And I've shown this to you before.

150

00:10:44.750  -->  00:10:52.350
What we can do is wrap them all together inside of campground or whatever you want to call it.

151

00:10:52.530  -->  00:10:53.580
But I'll do campground.

152

00:10:53.730  -->  00:10:59.460
I'll just copy this down here and here at the closing bracket.

153

00:10:59.630  -->  00:11:01.820
Now if group these three things together.

154

00:11:01.880  -->  00:11:08.250
So if my Access Request up bodycam campground I now get name image and description all nested inside

155

00:11:08.250  -->  00:11:10.170
of a single object.

156

00:11:10.170  -->  00:11:16.750
So all I have to do now is pass in request of body campground just like that.

157

00:11:16.880  -->  00:11:25.030
And then my callback with error and then we'll call it updated campground.

158

00:11:26.750  -->  00:11:30.780
For now if there's an error we'll just do our standard.

159

00:11:30.840  -->  00:11:35.400
Not very usable but an easy fix for now is just to redirect back to campgrounds.

160

00:11:35.430  -->  00:11:40.300
Once we implement flash messages we'll be able to specify what the problem is and we can redirect somewhere

161

00:11:40.320  -->  00:11:42.150
else that makes a little more sense.

162

00:11:42.420  -->  00:11:47.880
But we won't really have any cause for an error just yet unless our database is turned off or something

163

00:11:47.890  -->  00:11:48.220
.

164

00:11:48.600  -->  00:11:57.760
And then if it works what we'll do is redstart redirect to the show page which needs to be sosh campgrounds

165

00:11:57.770  -->  00:11:57.940
.

166

00:11:58.170  -->  00:12:05.250
And the idea here which we need to add in the plus sign and we have a few ways of getting that ID we

167

00:12:05.250  -->  00:12:12.960
could do updated campground dot underscore ID or we can do requests dot parameters ID that's what we

168

00:12:12.960  -->  00:12:17.400
have right here in this wrap and will save.

169

00:12:17.390  -->  00:12:19.650
Now let's see what happens if I restart the server

170

00:12:22.880  -->  00:12:26.710
go back to the edit form refresh.

171

00:12:27.050  -->  00:12:35.360
Add in some noticeable data here submit and we have a small issue which is our route is still not quite

172

00:12:35.370  -->  00:12:38.210
working and it's actually that our route works fine.

173

00:12:38.220  -->  00:12:41.000
It's the form is submitting to the wrong place.

174

00:12:41.070  -->  00:12:45.200
Notice our request is campground slash ID slash at it.

175

00:12:45.330  -->  00:12:47.010
We don't want that slash at it.

176

00:12:47.190  -->  00:12:52.680
That's supposed to be the form has slash at it but where the form submit is supposed to be campground

177

00:12:52.680  -->  00:12:55.070
slash ID as a request.

178

00:12:55.920  -->  00:12:58.210
So we need to get rid of this.

179

00:12:58.620  -->  00:13:09.470
Now if we try that again refresh add some data and submit it works.

180

00:13:09.630  -->  00:13:14.850
It updated the campground it found it first and updated it and then redirected me back to the show page

181

00:13:14.890  -->  00:13:16.890
and I see my changes.

182

00:13:16.880  -->  00:13:20.810
The last thing that will do in this video is add in a button that says edit.

183

00:13:20.970  -->  00:13:27.290
So I can click on that button and go to that edit page without having to type slash edit manually.

184

00:13:27.660  -->  00:13:28.410
So that's simple.

185

00:13:28.410  -->  00:13:33.220
It's just a link that needs to go to this route and we'll do that on the show page.

186

00:13:33.360  -->  00:13:39.000
So campground show will do it just underneath everything else to start.

187

00:13:39.210  -->  00:13:48.050
So inside of the image responsive caption for not in the comment section but inside of the column medium

188

00:13:48.060  -->  00:13:50.200
nine inside the thumbnail.

189

00:13:50.550  -->  00:14:01.460
After are submitted by all this add in a button which will be an anchor tag ref needs to be slash campgrounds

190

00:14:02.340  -->  00:14:14.070
slash and then the ID with Aegeus campground dot underscore ID and then we need slash at it and then

191

00:14:14.070  -->  00:14:19.250
we'll just have a text be added but we also need a class to make it look a little nicer with bootstrap

192

00:14:20.150  -->  00:14:23.540
and we'll just do PTEN ETN.

193

00:14:23.550  -->  00:14:31.350
And I think a color that might make sense might be warning rather than danger will reserve danger for

194

00:14:31.350  -->  00:14:32.660
that delete button.

195

00:14:32.660  -->  00:14:34.340
So let's take a look now.

196

00:14:35.140  -->  00:14:37.680
I go back I refresh.

197

00:14:37.980  -->  00:14:43.050
We have an edit button which is actually a link I click and I get to the edit form.

198

00:14:43.230  -->  00:14:47.710
So let's take this back to normal submit.

199

00:14:47.850  -->  00:14:48.180
Great.

200

00:14:48.240  -->  00:14:49.080
So it's working.

201

00:14:49.130  -->  00:14:51.410
Let's go back and just update one other one.

202

00:14:51.480  -->  00:14:53.300
So we'll go back to sash campgrounds.

203

00:14:53.430  -->  00:14:55.420
Make sure that it works well.

204

00:14:55.440  -->  00:14:57.960
Update granite or lowly creek.

205

00:14:58.450  -->  00:15:04.590
What how did this change the image to be this image here.

206

00:15:05.110  -->  00:15:10.420
Pay set in submit and add up it's perfect in the next video.

207

00:15:10.440  -->  00:15:12.210
We'll focus on deleting campgrounds
