00:00:00.810  -->  00:00:05.880
This video I'm going to demonstrate how we can write javascript in a separate file that we can then

2

00:00:05.880  -->  00:00:09.280
include in an him file and get to run in the browser.

3

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:15.510
So rather than having to type all of our code in our consul here which only exists until we are fresh

4

00:00:15.510  -->  00:00:20.520
the page or close the window we can now get things to persist and save in a file.

5

00:00:21.210  -->  00:00:24.750
So to do this we need to have in each team file.

6

00:00:25.560  -->  00:00:30.610
So I have one here in sublime It's called index that each team I'll call it whatever you want.

7

00:00:31.020  -->  00:00:33.760
And we just need to put our basic him in here.

8

00:00:33.840  -->  00:00:36.930
So I'm going to call this script demo.

9

00:00:37.620  -->  00:00:40.160
And then we don't have to put anything here if we don't want to.

10

00:00:40.170  -->  00:00:50.040
But just to make it clear that it's the same page I'm going to put Julius do including J S files and

11

00:00:50.040  -->  00:00:51.300
save.

12

00:00:52.050  -->  00:00:56.130
So I'm going to go ahead and open this up in the browser just so we have it.

13

00:00:56.190  -->  00:00:59.100
So it looks like this including Geass files.

14

00:00:59.130  -->  00:01:03.900
And just like any other site I can open up the console if I wanted to and I could start typing some

15

00:01:03.900  -->  00:01:09.960
javascript here but the whole point was that we'd be typing a javascript in a separate file.

16

00:01:10.350  -->  00:01:13.560
So to do that I first need to make a separate file.

17

00:01:13.830  -->  00:01:18.900
So I'm going to make a new file and save it and I'm just going to call it script Dot.

18

00:01:18.940  -->  00:01:19.480
Yes.

19

00:01:19.500  -->  00:01:22.010
And the important part is the J.S. at the end.

20

00:01:22.380  -->  00:01:27.570
So that tells the browser tell sublime It tells everything this is a javascript file and I'm going to

21

00:01:27.570  -->  00:01:34.650
save it in the same directory and then I'm going to put a single line to javascript here to start.

22

00:01:34.980  -->  00:01:43.010
Alert Hello from the js file so we can just see if it's working.

23

00:01:43.080  -->  00:01:45.360
If we get this alert.

24

00:01:45.570  -->  00:01:50.370
So right now if we just refresh the page it's not connected the file.

25

00:01:50.370  -->  00:01:54.520
Or each time a file knows nothing about the javascript file so it doesn't work.

26

00:01:54.660  -->  00:01:59.190
So we need to connect them in the way that we do that is using a script tag.

27

00:01:59.550  -->  00:02:06.810
So you can either type script and hit tab and that will give it to and sublime or you can type it yourself

28

00:02:06.840  -->  00:02:13.150
and it looks like this script and it's not self-closing So we need to have the closing tag.

29

00:02:14.690  -->  00:02:20.640
And then we need the source attribute and that source attribute needs to be equal to the file that we

30

00:02:20.640  -->  00:02:21.700
want to load.

31

00:02:21.900  -->  00:02:26.070
And I'm actually going to start by putting a file that doesn't exist here just to show you something

32

00:02:26.640  -->  00:02:27.330
wrong.

33

00:02:27.480  -->  00:02:35.130
Yes and if I save this and go back to the browser and I refresh and I open up my console you'll see

34

00:02:35.130  -->  00:02:37.770
it tells me failed to load resource error.

35

00:02:37.770  -->  00:02:41.340
File not found it couldn't find wrong.

36

00:02:41.400  -->  00:02:44.770
Yes so that's all I want to show.

37

00:02:44.850  -->  00:02:49.320
If we put the wrong name there it will actually tell us that it can't find the file but only in the

38

00:02:49.320  -->  00:02:49.900
console.

39

00:02:50.010  -->  00:02:54.630
So it's not going to break the site it's just going to show it to people who know where to look.

40

00:02:54.630  -->  00:02:58.250
Mainly developers so I'm going to put the right file here.

41

00:02:58.290  -->  00:03:01.270
Scripts just Jesus save.

42

00:03:01.680  -->  00:03:05.890
Go back to the browser and refresh and I now get my alert.

43

00:03:06.030  -->  00:03:10.010
So any time this page loads that code is going to run automatically.

44

00:03:10.200  -->  00:03:14.820
So unlike my javascript console when code runs when I hit enter

45

00:03:16.750  -->  00:03:18.470
.

46

00:03:19.080  -->  00:03:23.160
So in this case whenever refresh the page the code runs.

47

00:03:23.250  -->  00:03:28.040
So what I want to do now is go back to the javascript file and just add a few lines instead of just

48

00:03:28.040  -->  00:03:28.790
the alert.

49

00:03:28.890  -->  00:03:34.620
I want to have a few lines that asks the user for his or her name and then it just prints out a message

50

00:03:34.820  -->  00:03:39.810
that says Nice to meet you whatever the user entered.

51

00:03:40.290  -->  00:03:43.690
So to do that we're going to use prompt.

52

00:03:43.810  -->  00:03:46.920
So that's our first line prompt.

53

00:03:46.950  -->  00:03:52.660
What is your name to capitalize that.

54

00:03:53.460  -->  00:03:56.940
And then we're going to store that in a variable so we can use that later.

55

00:03:56.970  -->  00:04:01.030
I'm going to save our user name equals prompt.

56

00:04:01.050  -->  00:04:03.010
What is your name.

57

00:04:03.330  -->  00:04:07.610
And then the next step is to use that username to then greet the user.

58

00:04:07.800  -->  00:04:10.790
So I'm just going to say Nice to meet you.

59

00:04:10.990  -->  00:04:11.810
Username.

60

00:04:11.940  -->  00:04:14.460
So we're going to do an alert and to cancel that log.

61

00:04:14.490  -->  00:04:19.010
So let's start with our alert alert.

62

00:04:19.020  -->  00:04:24.040
Nice to meet you make sure we have the right spacing in there.

63

00:04:24.320  -->  00:04:26.360
Plus user name

64

00:04:29.520  -->  00:04:31.910
and a that log.

65

00:04:32.130  -->  00:04:36.600
Just so we can see it in two places.

66

00:04:36.600  -->  00:04:41.520
Also great to meet you.

67

00:04:41.520  -->  00:04:43.520
Plus username.

68

00:04:43.710  -->  00:04:50.060
So we're concatenating the strings together two different times one to alert them in one to cancel bot

69

00:04:50.070  -->  00:04:50.970
log.

70

00:04:51.540  -->  00:04:55.250
So now let's go back to the browser we refresh.

71

00:04:55.350  -->  00:04:56.670
First thing that happens.

72

00:04:56.730  -->  00:05:01.870
It asks us for a name so we're going to put in my dog's nickname Tator.

73

00:05:02.220  -->  00:05:05.680
OK it tells me nice to meet you Tator.

74

00:05:06.270  -->  00:05:10.170
And if I opened up the console I'll see.

75

00:05:10.230  -->  00:05:11.840
Also great to meet you Tator.

76

00:05:12.510  -->  00:05:19.650
And also you can see it tells me script yes line 3 so later when we have crazy complicated files and

77

00:05:19.650  -->  00:05:25.990
something goes wrong we'll be able to see exactly where and what line number in our file.

78

00:05:26.160  -->  00:05:27.540
So that's all I want to show there.

79

00:05:27.540  -->  00:05:34.260
Those three methods we had prompt to ask the user for some input and it stores it in a variable alert

80

00:05:34.590  -->  00:05:40.320
just to be obnoxious and alert something in the little pop up and cancel about log which just print

81

00:05:40.320  -->  00:05:41.340
something to the console
