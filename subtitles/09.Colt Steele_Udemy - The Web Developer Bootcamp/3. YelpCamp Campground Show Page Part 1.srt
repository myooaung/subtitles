00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:05,430
Welcome back in this lesson we're going to talk a bit more about this concept of rest and what that

2

00:00:05,430  -->  00:00:07,280
is and what restful routes are.

3

00:00:07,350  -->  00:00:12,080
And we're going to review the restful route we've seen and then we're going to add another route in

4

00:00:12,080  -->  00:00:12,280
.

5

00:00:12,360  -->  00:00:14,970
That's called this show page or this show route.

6

00:00:14,970  -->  00:00:19,440
So we have four main things reviewing the restful routes we've seen so far.

7

00:00:19,680  -->  00:00:25,020
We're going to change the campground schema and add a description to each campground when to show you

8

00:00:25,020  -->  00:00:30,240
a quick Mongo command and then we're going to spend the bulk of our time on creating a show route and

9

00:00:30,240  -->  00:00:32,110
a template showed that each of us.

10

00:00:32,430  -->  00:00:35,120
Let's begin by reviewing restful routes.

11

00:00:35,220  -->  00:00:41,610
So just before I move on I'm still in version and before I move on I'm still using V-2 just in case

12

00:00:41,610  -->  00:00:44,090
you want to follow along using the code.

13

00:00:44,100  -->  00:00:44,520
All right.

14

00:00:44,630  -->  00:00:45,460
So.

15

00:00:45,640  -->  00:00:48,060
Yes let's take a look at what we have.

16

00:00:48,090  -->  00:00:55,850
We have two main routes apt get slash campground act up post slash campground and we have one more apt

17

00:00:55,860  -->  00:01:03,570
get slash campground slash new and those three routes follow what's known as restful routes and there

18

00:01:03,570  -->  00:01:09,310
are seven of them and the first one that we're going to talk about is known as the index route.

19

00:01:09,720  -->  00:01:13,040
And we're going to do this as an example for dogs again.

20

00:01:13,080  -->  00:01:20,280
So slash dog should be the you know as a get request and what it does or what it's supposed to do is

21

00:01:21,930  -->  00:01:25,570
display a list of all dogs.

22

00:01:26,400  -->  00:01:29,260
So let me make this a little bit of a table here.

23

00:01:29,700  -->  00:01:31,110
It's going to be pretty rudimentary.

24

00:01:31,110  -->  00:01:32,710
Don't want to spend too much time on it.

25

00:01:33,150  -->  00:01:41,820
And our headers are just going to be the name of the route and then we'll have the URL or the path and

26

00:01:41,820  -->  00:01:51,040
then we'll have the verb in this case you get and then we have the description of what it does.

27

00:01:51,550  -->  00:01:52,120
OK.

28

00:01:52,410  -->  00:01:59,430
So we have the index route which for now what we have is slash campgrounds which is going to show a

29

00:01:59,430  -->  00:02:03,280
list of all campgrounds which is what it does.

30

00:02:03,750  -->  00:02:09,540
Then the next one that we have talked about is called new and new is not what you think it is.

31

00:02:09,720  -->  00:02:13,210
It's not actually the post route that makes the new dog or the new campground.

32

00:02:13,410  -->  00:02:15,560
It's slash dog slash new.

33

00:02:15,900  -->  00:02:20,040
And it's the route that actually shows the form.

34

00:02:20,040  -->  00:02:24,200
So let me space this out a little more.

35

00:02:24,270  -->  00:02:24,950
There we go.

36

00:02:25,110  -->  00:02:26,710
And it to get route.

37

00:02:27,330  -->  00:02:34,970
And it displays form to make a new dog and then that form submits to what's known as create which is

38

00:02:34,970  -->  00:02:44,130
flash dogs the same exact as the indexers same Yoro except it's a post and this is supposed to add new

39

00:02:44,130  -->  00:02:46,420
dog to database.

40

00:02:46,450  -->  00:02:48,360
You might be wondering why does this exist.

41

00:02:48,360  -->  00:02:50,310
Why do we need to follow this pattern.

42

00:02:50,310  -->  00:02:55,650
The first answer is that it's always good to have some structure just for our own purposes but also

43

00:02:55,650  -->  00:02:59,130
this pattern is something that lots and lots of applications will follow.

44

00:02:59,130  -->  00:03:03,220
And it makes it reliable and predictable for us to interact with other applications.

45

00:03:03,240  -->  00:03:10,050
Once we talk about API is we'll know that if we want to get all of the users from the get hub API we

46

00:03:10,050  -->  00:03:17,430
can do API get hub dot com slash users and that will give us a list of all the users that the users

47

00:03:17,460  -->  00:03:18,900
index.

48

00:03:18,900  -->  00:03:20,100
So we'll come back to that.

49

00:03:20,280  -->  00:03:25,130
But again these are the three we've seen so index is right here and I'll go label these.

50

00:03:25,200  -->  00:03:26,520
This is our index route

51

00:03:29,240  -->  00:03:34,520
just right there show all campgrounds.

52

00:03:34,620  -->  00:03:47,880
This is our create route add new campground to database and this route is new which is show form to

53

00:03:47,910  -->  00:03:50,750
create new campgrounds.

54

00:03:50,880  -->  00:03:54,480
Remember we have to have two routes in order to send a post request.

55

00:03:54,480  -->  00:04:00,210
We need one to show the form and then we need that form to submit somewhere which is our create route

56

00:04:00,230  -->  00:04:00,620
.

57

00:04:00,990  -->  00:04:01,220
OK.

58

00:04:01,230  -->  00:04:03,450
So those are the three routes we've done so far.

59

00:04:03,780  -->  00:04:08,200
We're going to introduce another route right now which is called show.

60

00:04:08,520  -->  00:04:13,080
So imagine that we have our apps it up like this which you don't have to imagine we do have this set

61

00:04:13,080  -->  00:04:13,600
up.

62

00:04:13,820  -->  00:04:18,870
And if I wanted to be able to click on one of these and view more information and that's what we're

63

00:04:18,870  -->  00:04:24,360
going to do we want to be able to have a button here where I can view information like a map the different

64

00:04:24,360  -->  00:04:26,590
reviews the comments the ratings.

65

00:04:26,640  -->  00:04:31,890
Any other images or whatever other information I want to show that doesn't make sense to put right here

66

00:04:32,430  -->  00:04:34,410
which normally there's a lot to show.

67

00:04:34,410  -->  00:04:40,320
And we only show one or two things on the index page like a photo and the title just like on Reddit

68

00:04:40,440  -->  00:04:42,840
which I know I've been using a lot as an example.

69

00:04:42,900  -->  00:04:48,780
But if this is our index this is showing all of the posts that we have we're not going to show every

70

00:04:48,780  -->  00:04:50,690
single piece of information at once.

71

00:04:50,760  -->  00:04:56,460
It just shows that title shows the link the number of comments the time it was submitted.

72

00:04:56,460  -->  00:05:01,800
The user and then we can click to view the comments on a separate page and there's tons and tons of

73

00:05:01,800  -->  00:05:03,010
information to show here.

74

00:05:03,090  -->  00:05:08,790
But this isn't all just shown right away on the index page so what we're going to do is make another

75

00:05:08,790  -->  00:05:16,460
route which is called show and the URL looks like this slash Doug's slash ID as a variable and it's

76

00:05:16,470  -->  00:05:22,340
a GET request and it shows info about one dog.

77

00:05:22,820  -->  00:05:28,440
And the reason we put the ID there is that we need to know which dog we're showing because up until

78

00:05:28,440  -->  00:05:31,310
this point index always works the same way.

79

00:05:31,310  -->  00:05:33,410
It shows you all dogs no matter what.

80

00:05:33,560  -->  00:05:34,900
This always shows you a form.

81

00:05:34,940  -->  00:05:36,610
This always ends in a new dog.

82

00:05:36,720  -->  00:05:41,600
But show is a little different because now we need to show you information about one thing in particular

83

00:05:41,620  -->  00:05:42,050
.

84

00:05:42,480  -->  00:05:43,970
So to do that.

85

00:05:43,980  -->  00:05:46,610
Not sure how to open this up accidentally to do that.

86

00:05:46,620  -->  00:05:52,440
We need to define a new route and we're going to do that now go back here and we'll put it at the bottom

87

00:05:54,100  -->  00:06:03,270
and it's a GET request don't get slash campground slash colon ID and then we'll just add the basic thing

88

00:06:03,300  -->  00:06:07,630
here are basic callback with request and response.

89

00:06:07,700  -->  00:06:11,410
And then in here we'll do a redstart send.

90

00:06:11,430  -->  00:06:22,240
This will be the show page one day and save and let's start the app up and if we go to that you are

91

00:06:22,250  -->  00:06:23,780
out any you are all that follows.

92

00:06:23,790  -->  00:06:30,930
Campground slash ID any ID we get this will be the show page one day if we go to campgrounds slash new

93

00:06:30,930  -->  00:06:35,580
we still get the form and thats because the order of the route is correct.

94

00:06:35,570  -->  00:06:41,810
Remember if I switch These all that this pattern is saying is campground slash anything any single word

95

00:06:42,500  -->  00:06:45,400
which is technically what we have here campground slash new.

96

00:06:45,440  -->  00:06:48,420
So we need to be careful that this is declared first.

97

00:06:48,420  -->  00:06:54,360
Otherwise it will treat campgrounds slash new as a campground slash ID route and it will show us this

98

00:06:54,400  -->  00:06:54,640
.

99

00:06:54,880  -->  00:07:02,190
Okay so thats a minor note but its important what we'll want to do in here is find the campground with

100

00:07:02,190  -->  00:07:10,900
provided ID and then render show template with that campground and all set.

101

00:07:11,190  -->  00:07:15,330
So the show page is supposed to show more information about one item.

102

00:07:15,560  -->  00:07:20,860
Right now we're showing all the information that we have on the index page.

103

00:07:20,880  -->  00:07:22,600
We don't have anything else to show.

104

00:07:22,640  -->  00:07:25,790
I guess we have an idea technically but that's not really useful.

105

00:07:25,800  -->  00:07:31,110
So we're going to add a description to our campground and that description will just be a little bit

106

00:07:31,110  -->  00:07:34,790
of text that we can enter in when we create a new campground.

107

00:07:34,800  -->  00:07:43,170
So we'll do that now and we'll go up here to our schema and just add in description and we started out

108

00:07:43,160  -->  00:07:50,240
as a string and see if we have a small problem which is that the campgrounds that we have already there's

109

00:07:50,250  -->  00:07:52,690
three of them don't have a description.

110

00:07:53,000  -->  00:07:57,990
So we can either update everything in our database to have a description or we can be a little bit more

111

00:07:57,990  -->  00:08:04,530
destructive and just delete everything in a database with what's known as DBI data collection drop and

112

00:08:04,520  -->  00:08:07,650
we'll drop all the campgrounds which is what I'm going to do here.

113

00:08:07,730  -->  00:08:11,990
It is something that you do occasionally when you make some big changes to your data and you have some

114

00:08:12,000  -->  00:08:14,290
pre-existing data that you don't really care about.

115

00:08:14,340  -->  00:08:16,680
You would never really drop users stayed on purpose.

116

00:08:16,710  -->  00:08:19,370
But in this case it's just our starter our sea data.

117

00:08:19,380  -->  00:08:20,840
So I'm going to drop it.

118

00:08:20,960  -->  00:08:23,220
So I'm going to open up Mongo.

119

00:08:23,220  -->  00:08:24,970
I'm going to connect to the right database.

120

00:08:24,990  -->  00:08:25,740
Let's see.

121

00:08:25,740  -->  00:08:27,060
Show DVRs.

122

00:08:27,120  -->  00:08:33,840
We're going to use Yelp camp and then I'm going to do a show collections and we should see campgrounds

123

00:08:33,840  -->  00:08:33,990
.

124

00:08:33,990  -->  00:08:34,920
There we go.

125

00:08:34,980  -->  00:08:41,380
And then if I want to just check how many camp grounds we have let's do D-B campgrounds that find.

126

00:08:42,210  -->  00:08:45,950
And I want to delete all three of them DVDs campground.

127

00:08:46,050  -->  00:08:47,840
Drop just like that.

128

00:08:48,090  -->  00:08:51,160
So this collection refers to the name of the collection.

129

00:08:51,360  -->  00:08:55,400
And if I hit Enter now tells me true which means that it worked.

130

00:08:55,620  -->  00:08:59,400
And if I try and find all the campgrounds all the campgrounds are gone.

131

00:08:59,780  -->  00:09:00,090
All right.

132

00:09:00,090  -->  00:09:03,860
So let's get out of here now and go back to her address.

133

00:09:04,110  -->  00:09:06,670
And we've now added in a description.

134

00:09:06,750  -->  00:09:10,040
So now let's create a new campground that has a description.

135

00:09:10,080  -->  00:09:16,220
So I'm just going to go with what I have here and comment that to create a new campground with name

136

00:09:16,230  -->  00:09:22,870
Grant Hill image this image and then description will be.

137

00:09:23,220  -->  00:09:36,340
This is a huge granite hill no bathrooms no water beautiful granite.

138

00:09:37,120  -->  00:09:37,620
OK.

139

00:09:37,620  -->  00:09:42,150
And I'm pretty sure the image is not of a hill but that doesn't matter in our case.

140

00:09:42,200  -->  00:09:43,660
So we're going to create a campground.

141

00:09:43,760  -->  00:09:49,060
And of course I could have done this in the browser and by going to the form and creating one.

142

00:09:49,070  -->  00:09:52,480
But I just want you to get a little more practice doing this through mongoose.

143

00:09:52,690  -->  00:09:54,400
OK so let's run the code now.

144

00:09:54,680  -->  00:09:56,420
All I need to do is run after you.

145

00:09:56,450  -->  00:09:59,980
Yes we get newly created campground.

146

00:10:00,140  -->  00:10:00,950
There we go.

147

00:10:01,230  -->  00:10:02,580
And it has a description.

148

00:10:02,820  -->  00:10:07,590
And if we wanted to open up Mongo and check on that and I'll do that very very quickly.

149

00:10:07,590  -->  00:10:15,320
So we'll use your camp and then we'll do D-B campgrounds up find.

150

00:10:15,890  -->  00:10:17,590
And there's our new campground.

151

00:10:17,820  -->  00:10:18,050
All right.

152

00:10:18,060  -->  00:10:20,290
So let's get out of there let's clear the terminal
