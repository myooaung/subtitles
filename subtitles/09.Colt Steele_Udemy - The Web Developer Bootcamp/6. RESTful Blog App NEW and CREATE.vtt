00:00:00.200  -->  00:00:01.200
We'll come back.

2

00:00:01.200  -->  00:00:04.380
So now we're going to pick up with the rest of our restful routes.

3

00:00:04.470  -->  00:00:09.360
We did index and we took a break to add into mantic you i.e. the header and footer Parshall's.

4

00:00:09.360  -->  00:00:15.330
Now we're going to do new and create so that by the end of this video when I click on new post I should

5

00:00:15.330  -->  00:00:19.990
see a form and then I can go to that form fill it out and then hit submit.

6

00:00:20.010  -->  00:00:23.970
It will take me back to the index page and I should see another post.

7

00:00:24.000  -->  00:00:25.210
So let's get started.

8

00:00:25.530  -->  00:00:30.710
First thing we need to do is create the new route which remember new shows as a form.

9

00:00:30.770  -->  00:00:37.110
It's a GET request slash dogs or slash blogs slash new and it just shows a form.

10

00:00:37.380  -->  00:00:39.440
So let's start there.

11

00:00:40.590  -->  00:00:43.620
We'll do it after our index and let's add that in here.

12

00:00:43.650  -->  00:00:45.670
Index wrote.

13

00:00:45.960  -->  00:00:51.980
Now let's do the new route and I'll add in create as well.

14

00:00:52.050  -->  00:01:00.730
So for our new route and after I get slash blogs slash new and new it's really simple.

15

00:01:00.760  -->  00:01:06.790
It's the shortest one really because all that we have to do is render the same form every time.

16

00:01:06.930  -->  00:01:09.280
We don't have to look anything up in the database.

17

00:01:09.450  -->  00:01:11.730
We don't have to send any data to the form.

18

00:01:11.730  -->  00:01:16.490
All we need to do is render new.

19

00:01:17.190  -->  00:01:19.110
And then we need to make that file of course.

20

00:01:19.110  -->  00:01:28.340
So touch views slash new Ejay Yes C-9 views slash new.

21

00:01:29.100  -->  00:01:30.970
OK and let's start simple.

22

00:01:31.380  -->  00:01:34.150
And all of us use a little semantic UI here.

23

00:01:34.200  -->  00:01:43.400
So we'll do a div and this device will be simple just has a class UI main text container segment.

24

00:01:43.400  -->  00:01:44.720
So there's a lot of stuff there.

25

00:01:44.760  -->  00:01:46.270
I'll break it down in just a moment.

26

00:01:46.530  -->  00:01:54.930
And then instead of that let's add in a header to do that we can do a UI huge header and let's just

27

00:01:54.930  -->  00:01:58.520
call this new log.

28

00:01:59.300  -->  00:02:02.310
And if we see this we'll know that we succeeded.

29

00:02:03.030  -->  00:02:04.180
So start the app up.

30

00:02:04.300  -->  00:02:07.760
Oh and actually we need to include our partials too.

31

00:02:07.770  -->  00:02:11.980
Otherwise we'll see a diff but we won't we won't see any of the semantic styles.

32

00:02:12.150  -->  00:02:22.470
So we need our Ejay s include dot slash Parshall's slash header same line at the bottom Parshall's slash

33

00:02:22.600  -->  00:02:25.410
for save.

34

00:02:25.950  -->  00:02:29.830
Refresh this page and go to blog slash new.

35

00:02:30.840  -->  00:02:32.070
And we have two problems.

36

00:02:32.070  -->  00:02:34.550
The first is a spacing issue.

37

00:02:34.650  -->  00:02:37.540
We can fix that pretty easily but we're getting the right template.

38

00:02:37.800  -->  00:02:43.980
But I noticed something a little weird which is that our icon went back to being small on the home page

39

00:02:43.980  -->  00:02:44.000
.

40

00:02:44.010  -->  00:02:47.170
It's large on this page it's small.

41

00:02:47.370  -->  00:02:51.760
And I spent a while looking at this as kind of a weed error.

42

00:02:51.840  -->  00:02:52.490
I figured it out.

43

00:02:52.500  -->  00:02:57.540
It's really one of those frustrating ones that that come up every now and then where it's not terribly

44

00:02:57.540  -->  00:03:01.990
obvious at first but I'll walk you through briefly what I noticed.

45

00:03:02.160  -->  00:03:04.320
You can see it says in the console.

46

00:03:04.320  -->  00:03:11.740
It failed to load the stylesheet opt out C S S but it was looking for it under sashed blogs slash style

47

00:03:11.740  -->  00:03:16.250
sheets slash app that C S S and that's not where it should look.

48

00:03:16.290  -->  00:03:23.130
And so I looked at the link that we set up in the header file and I noticed I forgot one small thing

49

00:03:24.020  -->  00:03:25.030
a slash.

50

00:03:25.080  -->  00:03:29.080
So if you are fresh now you'll see that it finds it.

51

00:03:29.310  -->  00:03:31.680
And we don't get an error over here.

52

00:03:31.680  -->  00:03:38.640
And if you looked in the sources tab you can see that it doesn't look inside the blogs which is what

53

00:03:38.640  -->  00:03:41.820
it is for before now it looks outside of style sheets.

54

00:03:41.850  -->  00:03:44.990
And now we end up with that larger code icon in the not.

55

00:03:45.390  -->  00:03:51.900
Next let's tackle the issue of it now are overlapping the rest of our content and fixing this is fortunately

56

00:03:51.990  -->  00:03:54.690
very easy now that we have that style sheet set up.

57

00:03:54.900  -->  00:04:01.590
All we need to do is add some margin to the top of this element which is the container element.

58

00:04:02.250  -->  00:04:04.520
Everything we do will be inside of that container.

59

00:04:04.710  -->  00:04:14.430
So we'll select that in our style sheet after the assess and we'll just do container and then all we

60

00:04:14.430  -->  00:04:18.440
want to do is margin top in rather than sitting in number of pixels.

61

00:04:18.450  -->  00:04:23.280
I'm going to use E-M as well just so that you see it more often.

62

00:04:23.280  -->  00:04:29.700
We haven't really seen it much and just see we have another problem which is that the container we inspect

63

00:04:29.910  -->  00:04:32.640
is also inside the nav bar.

64

00:04:32.640  -->  00:04:34.640
Remember we have a container there.

65

00:04:34.830  -->  00:04:40.440
So we only want to target things that are containers that also are main or containers that are also

66

00:04:40.440  -->  00:04:43.800
segment's or something other than just general containers.

67

00:04:44.040  -->  00:04:46.060
So that's another easy fix.

68

00:04:46.170  -->  00:04:48.370
We'll go back and just do me.

69

00:04:48.390  -->  00:04:49.520
So that means something.

70

00:04:49.520  -->  00:04:55.070
I had both those classes now we refresh and it looks much better.

71

00:04:55.100  -->  00:04:56.170
So we didn't mess with it.

72

00:04:56.210  -->  00:05:02.250
The margins of this container here inside the Nav. the menu we just played with this one here and now

73

00:05:02.270  -->  00:05:02.930
for the styling.

74

00:05:02.930  -->  00:05:05.050
Now let's get the form to work.

75

00:05:05.150  -->  00:05:16.700
So instead of our new daddy yes we want to form and our form is sort of like this where it goes to slash

76

00:05:18.020  -->  00:05:25.940
logs which if you forgot we look at our restful routes and you can see create is flash dogs the same

77

00:05:25.940  -->  00:05:28.460
as the index as a post.

78

00:05:29.120  -->  00:05:37.760
So this form needs to go to slash logs where method is post and then inside of a form you want a few

79

00:05:37.760  -->  00:05:45.170
inputs the first one will just be type equals text just like that and typing close text and will give

80

00:05:45.170  -->  00:05:52.090
it a name equal to blog title and then a placeholder that's equal to title.

81

00:05:52.850  -->  00:06:00.550
And then we'll duplicate that exception rather than title will do it for image.

82

00:06:01.350  -->  00:06:07.430
And this should be review from sitting at the post requests from a few videos to go and then we'll do

83

00:06:07.430  -->  00:06:10.750
the same thing for content which we called body

84

00:06:13.340  -->  00:06:19.940
and just put it log post goes here as a placeholder.

85

00:06:19.940  -->  00:06:27.050
All right so we have that done and then we need a way to submit it so it will do input type equals submit

86

00:06:29.480  -->  00:06:35.680
just like that and then save and see what we get.

87

00:06:35.770  -->  00:06:38.230
Here's our form not really styled.

88

00:06:38.300  -->  00:06:39.600
We'll get to that soon.

89

00:06:39.740  -->  00:06:46.550
But it should work just fine if we submit we should get an error that says can not post to slash blogs

90

00:06:46.570  -->  00:06:46.820
.

91

00:06:47.060  -->  00:06:49.660
That's because our create route doesn't exist.

92

00:06:50.150  -->  00:06:53.960
So let's do that now slash dogs as a post.

93

00:06:54.110  -->  00:07:05.870
So instead of actually yes under the Create route comment we'll do an app post slash blogs or Colback

94

00:07:05.880  -->  00:07:07.260
.

95

00:07:07.700  -->  00:07:13.160
Perfect and in here we actually need to create that new blog.

96

00:07:13.160  -->  00:07:22.710
So we have two steps create blog then run a redirect and we'll redirect to the index for now.

97

00:07:23.780  -->  00:07:30.220
So to create the blog we need a blog create and the first thing is the data.

98

00:07:30.230  -->  00:07:31.990
So that won't work just yet.

99

00:07:32.060  -->  00:07:34.140
And the second thing is the callback.

100

00:07:34.580  -->  00:07:38.450
So our callback we can start with we have an error.

101

00:07:38.510  -->  00:07:47.360
And then if it works we'll have a new blog and the data that we're passing through remember from the

102

00:07:47.360  -->  00:07:54.200
video on the post requests it's all inside of request dot body dot and whatever we named in our form

103

00:07:54.740  -->  00:07:55.600
in our form.

104

00:07:55.610  -->  00:07:58.890
Everything is inside a blog and a group and together.

105

00:07:58.940  -->  00:08:05.120
So if we just request up body dump blog it automatically has a title image and body.

106

00:08:05.120  -->  00:08:10.160
We give it request a body blow August first argument it takes that data it creates a new blog when it's

107

00:08:10.160  -->  00:08:10.530
done.

108

00:08:10.530  -->  00:08:11.950
Cause this callback.

109

00:08:12.140  -->  00:08:14.760
And we do our standard if error.

110

00:08:15.030  -->  00:08:26.510
Let's do a let's instead of count about logging let's render the new form again else we'll do a rez

111

00:08:26.840  -->  00:08:27.620
redirect

112

00:08:30.110  -->  00:08:35.870
to slash logs and we should see the new blog show up there.

113

00:08:36.020  -->  00:08:43.410
If it worked let's move this comment and let's see what happens if we give it a shot.

114

00:08:43.520  -->  00:08:44.660
So we'll save.

115

00:08:44.870  -->  00:08:52.540
We have to restart the server and go all the way back to the root make a copy of this image URL just

116

00:08:52.540  -->  00:08:57.460
so we have an image or title of the blog post to.

117

00:08:57.620  -->  00:09:00.230
Here's our image in our blog post.

118

00:09:00.350  -->  00:09:03.740
Submit and it works perfect.

119

00:09:03.800  -->  00:09:11.330
And you can see we have a title an image a very short blog post the body in our created date is also

120

00:09:11.330  -->  00:09:12.020
display.

121

00:09:12.170  -->  00:09:12.860
Wonderful.

122

00:09:13.010  -->  00:09:19.790
So to recap all of that to routes new and create new is slash whatever the name of the model is.

123

00:09:19.790  -->  00:09:24.910
Dogs in our case are actually blogs slash and you get requests.

124

00:09:24.920  -->  00:09:32.580
It shows the form create is flash dogs just like the index was except it's a post request.

125

00:09:32.600  -->  00:09:35.350
And that's where the new form sends data to.

126

00:09:35.430  -->  00:09:39.080
To add to the database create new dog then it redirects back.

127

00:09:39.080  -->  00:09:43.820
It doesn't have to be the index most of time it's actually to show page which you'll see in the next

128

00:09:43.820  -->  00:09:44.660
video.

129

00:09:45.140  -->  00:09:47.550
Let's quickly style up our application.

130

00:09:47.580  -->  00:09:49.820
Let's do the form.

131

00:09:50.570  -->  00:10:02.000
So to use semantic first thing we'll do is give our form a class equal to UI form and then inside of

132

00:10:02.000  -->  00:10:10.070
that form each one of these inputs will be in a div and that div will have class equal to fields.

133

00:10:10.550  -->  00:10:13.330
And then look at how to label in which we don't have yet.

134

00:10:13.730  -->  00:10:19.860
And the first label will be title and then we'll take our title and put it right there.

135

00:10:20.390  -->  00:10:21.450
Perfect.

136

00:10:21.470  -->  00:10:24.630
And then we'll do this a few more times.

137

00:10:24.770  -->  00:10:32.120
We need one of these for the image change the label say image

138

00:10:34.840  -->  00:10:42.770
and then one change I do want to make is that rather than having our blog form the input like this I

139

00:10:42.770  -->  00:10:47.470
want to make it a text area where a user can type some more text like an actual blog post.

140

00:10:48.050  -->  00:10:54.920
And to fix that rather than making this an input we are going to have a div Chrisfield still in the

141

00:10:54.920  -->  00:11:03.140
label and we'll just call it blog content but rather than this input we're going to add a text area

142

00:11:03.140  -->  00:11:06.560
tag which we did see early on but we haven't really used much.

143

00:11:06.830  -->  00:11:10.280
And it's a little different than inputs we still give it a name.

144

00:11:10.400  -->  00:11:19.280
So still blog body and then we save but we don't give it a type of text because it's not an input it's

145

00:11:19.280  -->  00:11:24.590
its own designated tag that has an opening and closing tag and it behaves a little differently as well

146

00:11:24.590  -->  00:11:24.830
.

147

00:11:24.830  -->  00:11:26.130
When we get to add it.

148

00:11:26.270  -->  00:11:30.650
So we'll see that in just a moment to get rid of that and then we'll style our button.

149

00:11:30.650  -->  00:11:32.540
We take a look at what we have now.

150

00:11:32.740  -->  00:11:36.610
It looks pretty good except the button could be styled a little bit nicer.

151

00:11:36.790  -->  00:11:43.670
And if I pull up semantic UI and go to button there are way more buttons in semantic than in Bootstrap

152

00:11:43.690  -->  00:11:43.800
.

153

00:11:43.910  -->  00:11:51.780
So different types but also lots of colors basic buttons and then inverted buttons as well.

154

00:11:52.310  -->  00:12:00.680
So pick one of these that you like and when you go with the favorite let's do violet purple and if you

155

00:12:00.680  -->  00:12:04.890
take a look at the source code all that you need is class equal to you.

156

00:12:05.250  -->  00:12:07.950
The color basic button.

157

00:12:08.480  -->  00:12:12.780
And while I do this I'll explain why it's called semantic UI.

158

00:12:12.920  -->  00:12:21.910
And the main reason is that unlike bootstrap where we have this kind of weird jargon ETN ETN dash LGBT

159

00:12:21.910  -->  00:12:28.880
and dash default for instance which I loath bootstrap not really knocking it but the reason that sematic

160

00:12:28.880  -->  00:12:40.470
was created was in response to this kind of markup where instead we can have UI violate basic button

161

00:12:41.150  -->  00:12:44.590
or I can do UI Violet inverted button.

162

00:12:45.050  -->  00:12:46.820
So basic for now is fine.

163

00:12:47.060  -->  00:12:48.050
And that's all that it takes.

164

00:12:48.050  -->  00:12:49.630
Very simple.

165

00:12:49.760  -->  00:12:51.530
It's not that it's less characters.

166

00:12:51.560  -->  00:12:52.840
It's not about being shorter.

167

00:12:53.030  -->  00:12:58.340
It's about being meaningful where you can easily look at this and understand what it means.

168

00:12:58.340  -->  00:13:01.420
So if we go back now and refresh.

169

00:13:01.690  -->  00:13:06.900
I have that button and if I want to make it large it's really easy.

170

00:13:06.930  -->  00:13:09.050
All I have to do is type big.

171

00:13:09.050  -->  00:13:16.910
So I don't have to do BT and dash Elgie just big refresh and we get a bigger button and that's it.

172

00:13:16.910  -->  00:13:18.740
So let's test it out again.

173

00:13:18.740  -->  00:13:26.770
I mean I use the same bold argue well let's just call this my new dog.

174

00:13:27.980  -->  00:13:32.350
More blog Contac submit and it works fine.

175

00:13:32.420  -->  00:13:33.110
Great.

176

00:13:33.110  -->  00:13:38.240
All right so we have covered index we've covered New and create and I showed you a tiny bit of semantic

177

00:13:38.240  -->  00:13:41.480
You might get the forms and the buttons in the next video.

178

00:13:41.510  -->  00:13:42.650
We'll work on the show page
