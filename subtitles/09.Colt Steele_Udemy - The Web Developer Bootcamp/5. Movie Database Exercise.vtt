00:00:00.960  -->  00:00:04.850
Now it's time for you to write some of your own code using javascript objects.

2

00:00:04.890  -->  00:00:06.880
We're just going to do one quick exercise.

3

00:00:06.880  -->  00:00:10.020
You're going to build a movie database array.

4

00:00:10.020  -->  00:00:12.350
So that sounds much more complicated than it is.

5

00:00:12.360  -->  00:00:18.510
The idea is that you have an array called movies and inside of that array you have a bunch of movie

6

00:00:18.510  -->  00:00:19.650
objects.

7

00:00:19.650  -->  00:00:22.700
So it's just like the posting comments thing that we saw earlier.

8

00:00:22.740  -->  00:00:29.730
So a movie should have a title that's a string a rating that's a number and has watched which is a boolean

9

00:00:29.730  -->  00:00:30.050
.

10

00:00:30.090  -->  00:00:34.380
So that's just supposed to determine if you have seen the movie or if you haven't seen the movie.

11

00:00:34.380  -->  00:00:37.430
So I want to define an array with three or four different movies in it.

12

00:00:37.590  -->  00:00:42.120
Then you're going to loop through the array and print out something that looks like this.

13

00:00:42.120  -->  00:00:49.470
So on each line you will either say you have watched the movie title dash the number of stars the rating

14

00:00:49.830  -->  00:00:51.800
or if has watched is false.

15

00:00:52.030  -->  00:00:56.790
You're right you have not seen the movie title dash the rating.

16

00:00:56.790  -->  00:00:59.180
So again you're going to have an array of movie objects.

17

00:00:59.190  -->  00:01:02.650
Each one has a title rating and has watched which is the.

18

00:01:02.850  -->  00:01:07.720
Then you're going to loop through that array of movies and print out a line for each one.

19

00:01:07.890  -->  00:01:09.100
And that line will include.

20

00:01:09.270  -->  00:01:12.450
If you have or haven't seen the movie the title and the rating.

21

00:01:12.840  -->  00:01:18.030
OK so possible you attempt this on your own and then I'll be back in a few seconds to go over the answer

22

00:01:18.040  -->  00:01:18.420
.

23

00:01:18.760  -->  00:01:19.170
OK.

24

00:01:19.230  -->  00:01:20.890
So let's start writing the solution.

25

00:01:20.940  -->  00:01:24.690
I'm going to open up the console and declare a movie's array.

26

00:01:24.690  -->  00:01:29.550
So far movies equals an array.

27

00:01:30.360  -->  00:01:33.670
And then inside the Saray we're going to put a bunch of objects.

28

00:01:34.170  -->  00:01:37.110
So each movie object is going to have a title

29

00:01:40.170  -->  00:01:41.410
and I'm just going to do two.

30

00:01:41.430  -->  00:01:44.870
So we don't spend a lot of time here title in Bruges.

31

00:01:44.940  -->  00:01:47.080
Great movie if you haven't seen it.

32

00:01:47.580  -->  00:01:49.130
Has watched.

33

00:01:49.530  -->  00:01:53.470
That will be true for me and rating is five.

34

00:01:53.970  -->  00:01:59.220
And because that's just getting a little bit long I'm going to indent this put every property on its

35

00:01:59.220  -->  00:02:02.460
own line.

36

00:02:02.460  -->  00:02:05.500
It's just much more readable.

37

00:02:06.900  -->  00:02:21.120
So we'll do one more movie and that will be tidal frozen which I actually haven't seen.

38

00:02:22.410  -->  00:02:26.880
So that's false and rating will be four point five.

39

00:02:26.970  -->  00:02:31.440
That's just going based off of what I've heard and we'll leave our movies at that.

40

00:02:31.560  -->  00:02:34.000
So two movies each one has a title.

41

00:02:34.140  -->  00:02:38.000
A string has watched a boolean and rating a number.

42

00:02:38.220  -->  00:02:43.170
So let's hit enter and take a look at our movies array objects.

43

00:02:43.860  -->  00:02:45.210
Just like we expect.

44

00:02:45.600  -->  00:02:51.210
So now all we have to do is loop through the array and then print out this nice string for every movie

45

00:02:51.210  -->  00:02:51.930
.

46

00:02:51.930  -->  00:02:53.680
So I'm going to use a for each.

47

00:02:53.910  -->  00:02:56.730
So movies for each.

48

00:02:56.730  -->  00:03:01.610
But of course you could also easily use a for loop or whatever you prefer.

49

00:03:02.220  -->  00:03:09.510
So for each one we'll give it a placeholder name of movie and that will open this up and all that we

50

00:03:09.510  -->  00:03:12.810
want to do is print out a line for each movie.

51

00:03:12.840  -->  00:03:15.030
So that's going to be a long comp's thought log.

52

00:03:15.420  -->  00:03:19.930
And rather than do a giant Cazotte log that has a bunch of plus signs in it.

53

00:03:20.070  -->  00:03:23.990
I'm actually going to make a string called result.

54

00:03:24.180  -->  00:03:31.710
So that's going to look like this var results equals and it's going to start as you have because if

55

00:03:31.710  -->  00:03:35.170
you look over here they all start with you have you have.

56

00:03:35.220  -->  00:03:40.020
So I'm going to start my string off like that and then I'm going to have an if statement to decide what

57

00:03:40.020  -->  00:03:45.410
comes next I either I'm going to add watched or I'm going to add not seen.

58

00:03:45.720  -->  00:03:46.990
So to do that.

59

00:03:47.280  -->  00:03:51.860
Make sure you have your space right here and then on the next line just have an if statement.

60

00:03:52.170  -->  00:03:56.430
If movie has watched.

61

00:03:56.790  -->  00:04:06.720
So if we have watched it we're going to set result two plus equal watched with the space after it or

62

00:04:06.720  -->  00:04:17.530
else we're going to set result plus equals not scene.

63

00:04:17.730  -->  00:04:19.260
Also with the space after it.

64

00:04:19.260  -->  00:04:22.780
So we're basically building this string that we're going to print at the end.

65

00:04:23.100  -->  00:04:24.440
So it starts off.

66

00:04:24.630  -->  00:04:31.770
You have space and then depending on the value of has watched for each movie we're either going to add

67

00:04:31.770  -->  00:04:39.540
in or concatenate watched or not seen then the next step is to go ahead and add in the movie the title

68

00:04:39.560  -->  00:04:39.950
.

69

00:04:40.320  -->  00:04:47.790
So next we do a result for us equals and you will see there are quotes around the title.

70

00:04:47.880  -->  00:04:53.820
So if we wanted to make those quotes work we need to make sure that we have the backslash quote to escape

71

00:04:54.810  -->  00:04:55.690
the double quotes.

72

00:04:55.920  -->  00:04:59.990
So we're going to result plus equals and then we're going to start off with our quote.

73

00:05:00.090  -->  00:05:02.410
So this is a little bit weird looking.

74

00:05:03.000  -->  00:05:10.700
And then we're going to add plus movie dot title plus.

75

00:05:10.710  -->  00:05:15.810
And then the closing quote at the end which we have to just do backslash quote.

76

00:05:15.840  -->  00:05:17.860
So it's a lot of quotation marks.

77

00:05:17.880  -->  00:05:22.610
Remember that this turns into just a double quote and this turns into a double quote.

78

00:05:23.610  -->  00:05:33.060
And then let's add a space after that double quote and a dash and then the very last thing is to add

79

00:05:33.060  -->  00:05:37.930
in result plus equals the number of stars.

80

00:05:38.040  -->  00:05:47.700
So that's going to be you don't need quote movie rating plus

81

00:05:52.290  -->  00:05:55.710
stars just like that.

82

00:05:56.280  -->  00:06:01.770
And then we're going to cost that log result and we end up with this here.

83

00:06:01.830  -->  00:06:07.540
You have watched in Bruges five stars you have not seen Frozen 4.5 stars.

84

00:06:07.800  -->  00:06:10.230
And we can go ahead and add one more movie in here

85

00:06:15.410  -->  00:06:19.740
to title the miserables

86

00:06:23.160  -->  00:06:34.140
rating 3.5 and has watched set that to false.

87

00:06:34.220  -->  00:06:41.190
I've seen the musical never the movie and let's indent this just so that it's easier to read and read

88

00:06:41.190  -->  00:06:41.660
you this.

89

00:06:41.670  -->  00:06:48.030
So hit enter here and then run our code again to print things out and we can walk through this one more

90

00:06:48.030  -->  00:06:48.830
time.

91

00:06:48.930  -->  00:06:54.240
We make a result string each time in the for loop and we're going to slowly build that result string

92

00:06:54.250  -->  00:06:54.700
.

93

00:06:55.140  -->  00:06:57.520
So let's take the example of in Bruges.

94

00:06:57.900  -->  00:07:00.610
We're going to add you have space.

95

00:07:00.870  -->  00:07:05.990
And then if movie has watched is true which it is we're going to plus equals watched.

96

00:07:06.090  -->  00:07:12.270
So we end up with you have watched and then the space after that and then replace the coil in a double

97

00:07:12.270  -->  00:07:12.950
quote.

98

00:07:13.440  -->  00:07:15.870
Plus the movie title plus another movie quote.

99

00:07:16.020  -->  00:07:16.730
So then we have.

100

00:07:16.730  -->  00:07:25.260
You have watched double quote In Bruges and double quote dash space and then we add in the movie rating

101

00:07:25.350  -->  00:07:26.280
and stars.

102

00:07:26.490  -->  00:07:29.000
So that movie rating is five.

103

00:07:29.190  -->  00:07:35.810
So we end up with you have watched in Bruges dash five stars and we print that out.

104

00:07:36.320  -->  00:07:38.510
You can see it works just fine.

105

00:07:38.650  -->  00:07:42.750
And our newly added Les Miserables shows up as you have not seen.

106

00:07:42.750  -->  00:07:44.890
Les Miserables 3.5 stars.

107

00:07:45.150  -->  00:07:46.420
And that's all we needed to do.

108

00:07:46.590  -->  00:07:51.930
If you wanted to refactor this a little bit it might be a good idea is to move most of the logic in

109

00:07:51.930  -->  00:07:52.330
here.

110

00:07:52.410  -->  00:07:56.190
Aside from the printing move everything out into a separate function.

111

00:07:56.430  -->  00:08:04.200
So I'm going to copy this and make a function called Build string and that will take a single movie

112

00:08:04.200  -->  00:08:13.710
object and then inside if they're going to add all this code which takes a result variable and it slowly

113

00:08:13.710  -->  00:08:16.020
builds it up exactly the same.

114

00:08:16.020  -->  00:08:18.830
I kept it named movie so we don't have to change anything.

115

00:08:19.050  -->  00:08:27.150
And then the very last thing would be return result and that's all we need there and then we need to

116

00:08:27.150  -->  00:08:28.780
change our for loop a little bit.

117

00:08:28.920  -->  00:08:34.140
So we're going to do movie stuff for each function each movie

118

00:08:37.740  -->  00:08:48.730
and for each one what we're going to do is go ahead and run build string of movie and to print it will

119

00:08:48.750  -->  00:08:53.460
just run cancel that log filled string movie.

120

00:08:53.460  -->  00:08:55.130
So this cleaned it up a lot.

121

00:08:55.140  -->  00:08:59.020
Just remember when rerun build string we pass in each movie.

122

00:08:59.070  -->  00:09:01.910
This makes a string and it returns the result.

123

00:09:02.100  -->  00:09:07.020
So this right here is going to be replaced with whatever string is returned and that will be printed

124

00:09:07.020  -->  00:09:08.040
out.

125

00:09:08.290  -->  00:09:09.460
So we end up with this.

126

00:09:09.720  -->  00:09:11.100
So it's a little cleaner.

127

00:09:11.100  -->  00:09:12.900
We end up with this nice simple for each.

128

00:09:12.940  -->  00:09:14.760
That's very clear what's happening.

129

00:09:14.760  -->  00:09:16.760
Print Howsabout log.

130

00:09:16.980  -->  00:09:18.860
Build string for each movie.

131

00:09:18.900  -->  00:09:20.600
It makes a lot of sense if you just look at it.

132

00:09:20.610  -->  00:09:22.910
You can immediately tell what it's supposed to do.

133

00:09:22.910  -->  00:09:24.150
Based off of the name.

134

00:09:24.450  -->  00:09:25.480
OK so that's it.
