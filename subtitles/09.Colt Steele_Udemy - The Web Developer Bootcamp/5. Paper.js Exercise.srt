1

00:00:00,290  -->  00:00:00,650
OK.

2

00:00:00,690  -->  00:00:05,850
So as I mentioned we're going to do a quick exercise and it's going to be very underwhelming as far

3

00:00:05,850  -->  00:00:11,030
as the finished product goes but it's a good one just to get some practice with paperchase.

4

00:00:11,100  -->  00:00:14,920
So actually really simple 4 ish lines of code that you need.

5

00:00:15,150  -->  00:00:23,520
All that I want is a grid of circles and the exact measurements don't matter what I have here is a circle

6

00:00:23,640  -->  00:00:28,410
starting at zero zero and every 100 pixels.

7

00:00:28,620  -->  00:00:29,750
I'm drawing another circle.

8

00:00:29,750  -->  00:00:33,720
I think that radius is 10 all the way until 1000.

9

00:00:33,720  -->  00:00:36,540
So this is 1000 1000 right here.

10

00:00:37,260  -->  00:00:43,680
So it doesn't really matter just get 100 ish circles on the screen obviously without doing it manually

11

00:00:43,680  -->  00:00:45,380
one at a time that's the point.

12

00:00:45,390  -->  00:00:46,830
So how can you do that.

13

00:00:46,890  -->  00:00:48,240
That's up to you.

14

00:00:48,270  -->  00:00:53,220
You'll need to figure out how to generate those coordinates x and y coordinates that are increasing

15

00:00:53,220  -->  00:00:53,760
.

16

00:00:53,760  -->  00:00:57,440
And feel free to make them all purple or any color.

17

00:00:57,460  -->  00:01:00,250
It's not really the point or make them another shape.

18

00:01:00,270  -->  00:01:07,140
So try doing a square or a rectangle or try something more fun where you have the colors on a gradient

19

00:01:07,410  -->  00:01:10,810
so that as X gets greater the color gets redder.

20

00:01:10,970  -->  00:01:16,410
I remember well I guess not really remember I haven't told you this but that paper JSE you can do RGV

21

00:01:16,410  -->  00:01:17,840
colors hexadecimal.

22

00:01:17,970  -->  00:01:23,610
So you can generate a color where you're incrementing the red component or that green component.

23

00:01:23,820  -->  00:01:28,670
But at the very minimum I'm just looking for a grid of circles at least 100.

24

00:01:28,700  -->  00:01:29,260
And if you want.

25

00:01:29,270  -->  00:01:32,770
You could also randomize them so that they're all over the place.

26

00:01:32,850  -->  00:01:34,940
I just want you to get a lot of circles on the page.

27

00:01:35,010  -->  00:01:35,530
OK.

28

00:01:35,610  -->  00:01:37,540
So take a moment pause a video.

29

00:01:37,680  -->  00:01:39,020
Try this on your own.

30

00:01:39,030  -->  00:01:40,380
I recommend that you get lost.

31

00:01:40,380  -->  00:01:41,400
The docs are a bit.

32

00:01:41,430  -->  00:01:42,370
Try some things out.

33

00:01:42,390  -->  00:01:51,110
Look at the examples and then come back and we'll go over solution.

34

00:01:51,120  -->  00:01:51,480
All right.

35

00:01:51,480  -->  00:01:52,570
Great.

36

00:01:52,590  -->  00:01:58,780
So this is what I had before where I left off and I'm going to get rid of almost all of this code.

37

00:01:58,950  -->  00:02:00,940
So we don't want that line anymore.

38

00:02:01,230  -->  00:02:02,940
Any of that.

39

00:02:02,940  -->  00:02:03,930
Let's take a look.

40

00:02:03,930  -->  00:02:07,330
We solve that giant circle which we don't really need.

41

00:02:07,470  -->  00:02:12,780
We will want to keep that code so that we know how to make a circle but we don't want a giant one.

42

00:02:12,960  -->  00:02:15,500
So what we want to do here is use a loop.

43

00:02:15,930  -->  00:02:23,070
So we want to use a loop to make a circle here and then a circle here circle here basically will add

44

00:02:23,070  -->  00:02:28,610
10 or 100 actually to the x coordinate so we can start by doing that.

45

00:02:28,800  -->  00:02:34,080
So we'll make a loop and we'll start at zero loops for far.

46

00:02:34,110  -->  00:02:35,360
Equals zero.

47

00:02:35,650  -->  00:02:38,110
Itis less fun and this can be anything.

48

00:02:38,130  -->  00:02:40,080
I did it as 1000.

49

00:02:40,140  -->  00:02:43,980
And actually it lets me get X so it's clearer.

50

00:02:45,300  -->  00:02:46,780
And each time through.

51

00:02:46,800  -->  00:02:54,540
Rather than doing X plus plus which we could use to make a circle every single pixel will make jumps

52

00:02:54,870  -->  00:03:04,020
of 100 and then all that will do is copy this code and make a circle but we'll alter it a little bit

53

00:03:05,220  -->  00:03:05,890
if we left it.

54

00:03:05,930  -->  00:03:09,960
This would make us 10 circles at the exact same point the same race.

55

00:03:09,960  -->  00:03:19,050
So not what we want let's do X comma and y will be fixed as 0.

56

00:03:19,860  -->  00:03:27,260
So that should make us a line of circles all with y coordinate of zero and radius will make 10.

57

00:03:27,330  -->  00:03:35,840
And if we take a look at that refresh you can see here we get 10 circles going across every 100 pixels

58

00:03:35,850  -->  00:03:38,640
we get a new one.

59

00:03:38,670  -->  00:03:42,790
So what we want to do is basically repeat that again.

60

00:03:42,930  -->  00:03:45,670
So we have our first time through.

61

00:03:45,900  -->  00:03:49,700
We need one of these rows 10 times going down.

62

00:03:49,980  -->  00:03:52,790
And the best way to do that is by using another loop.

63

00:03:53,070  -->  00:03:58,820
So we want to take what we have here and just repeat all of this so we can make another loop.

64

00:03:59,340  -->  00:04:02,990
And this time we'll do it for the y coordinate.

65

00:04:03,060  -->  00:04:09,240
So why should go up and tell 1000 y plus equals 100 as well.

66

00:04:09,540  -->  00:04:12,130
And I'll walk you through exactly how this works.

67

00:04:12,150  -->  00:04:14,520
I think nested loops can be a little bit confusing

68

00:04:17,490  -->  00:04:21,560
if we just change 0 to be y Now that's actually all we need to do.

69

00:04:21,990  -->  00:04:24,940
So let's refresh you see if we get that grid.

70

00:04:25,080  -->  00:04:29,880
So not the most exciting thing but we very quickly added a bunch of circles.

71

00:04:29,910  -->  00:04:32,430
So let's take a look at this nested loop.

72

00:04:32,460  -->  00:04:37,210
So I drew a little diagram the first time through X starts at zero.

73

00:04:37,800  -->  00:04:43,610
So I'll do it like this where we have x and y.

74

00:04:44,220  -->  00:04:44,910
OK.

75

00:04:44,910  -->  00:04:48,970
Let me capitalize it so X starts at zero.

76

00:04:50,460  -->  00:04:55,840
And then while X is 0 we do this loop word Y starts at zero.

77

00:04:56,280  -->  00:04:58,540
Just like that.

78

00:04:59,400  -->  00:05:03,460
And then next time through this y loop X is still zero.

79

00:05:03,660  -->  00:05:06,210
But this time why is 100.

80

00:05:06,210  -->  00:05:13,610
Because we add one hundred and then x is still zero and Y is 200.

81

00:05:14,130  -->  00:05:15,350
Then X is zero.

82

00:05:15,390  -->  00:05:18,090
Why is 300 and so on.

83

00:05:18,280  -->  00:05:21,260
I'll do a dot dot dot and tell X is zero.

84

00:05:21,660  -->  00:05:31,800
Why is 1000 are actually because we have less then it will only get to 900 and then X changes over to

85

00:05:31,800  -->  00:05:37,590
be 100 and then Y changes over to go back to zero.

86

00:05:38,460  -->  00:05:44,690
So basically for every x we're generating 10 y's.

87

00:05:44,970  -->  00:05:49,500
So that ends up with us having 100 or 100 iterations.

88

00:05:49,530  -->  00:05:56,400
So it's a little confusing but it helps if you step through this X starts at zero y starts at zero but

89

00:05:56,400  -->  00:06:00,210
then X stays at 0 and y goes up to 100 than 200.

90

00:06:00,210  -->  00:06:03,370
And we're drawing a circle at each one of those intel.

91

00:06:03,420  -->  00:06:07,590
Why then resets and then X goes and increments.

92

00:06:07,890  -->  00:06:08,250
OK.

93

00:06:08,250  -->  00:06:12,060
So kind of in my opinion confusing.

94

00:06:12,060  -->  00:06:15,000
Last thing that we can do is a small change.

95

00:06:15,000  -->  00:06:18,430
We don't actually need to save this to a variable every time.

96

00:06:19,230  -->  00:06:26,070
We can just change this like this and it's slightly more efficient where we're not reassigning a variable

97

00:06:26,070  -->  00:06:29,740
constantly because we're never doing anything with those circles again.

98

00:06:30,120  -->  00:06:31,290
We're just making them once.

99

00:06:31,410  -->  00:06:37,650
So rather than rewriting and re initializing a variable every time through the loop we just make a new

100

00:06:37,650  -->  00:06:45,730
circle give it a fill color of purple or let's do yellow save refresh.

101

00:06:45,900  -->  00:06:46,560
There we go.

102

00:06:46,800  -->  00:06:47,220
OK.

103

00:06:47,370  -->  00:06:52,560
So this was a little bit of a diversion here but still pretty important.

104

00:06:52,560  -->  00:06:54,680
Again the motivation behind you doing that.

105

00:06:54,690  -->  00:06:55,380
Hopefully you did it.

106

00:06:55,400  -->  00:07:02,010
But the motivation was for you to just get practice combining javascript skills loops with paper yes

107

00:07:02,070  -->  00:07:08,550
and seeing that all you have to do is call you know a short line of code and it would run a bunch of

108

00:07:08,550  -->  00:07:13,620
code behind the scenes to actually make that circle OK in the next video will actually get on with the

109

00:07:13,620  -->  00:07:16,810
show and start really working on our pad attack clone.
