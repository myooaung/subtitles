00:00:01,230  -->  00:00:04,240
All right so we have another really quick exercise.

2

00:00:04,350  -->  00:00:07,140
This one is definitely a little easier than the last.

3

00:00:07,140  -->  00:00:08,990
Basically it's the same idea.

4

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:10,110
Here's an image.

5

00:00:10,110  -->  00:00:15,780
This is Tim himself that I wrote and I want you to reverse engineer it to take this.

6

00:00:15,780  -->  00:00:17,940
This is about my dog Rusty.

7

00:00:18,030  -->  00:00:23,340
You do not have to use the same image if you do want to and you want to use the exact same image make

8

00:00:23,340  -->  00:00:25,050
it look exactly the same.

9

00:00:25,050  -->  00:00:33,000
It's included in the description so I'll let you decide on which heading this is what this is right

10

00:00:33,000  -->  00:00:33,690
here.

11

00:00:33,930  -->  00:00:36,100
What heading this is.

12

00:00:36,360  -->  00:00:40,130
Decide on where this link actually goes to I.

13

00:00:40,160  -->  00:00:44,460
Rusty doesn't have an Instagram or not one of those dog owners Thankfully I decided to link to just

14

00:00:44,460  -->  00:00:48,270
some some Instagram that was just dogs of Instagram I think.

15

00:00:48,270  -->  00:00:49,960
So any link really will do there.

16

00:00:50,160  -->  00:00:56,820
So again pretty simple one image one link one list a few headings and one weird looking yet painfully

17

00:00:56,820  -->  00:00:58,130
adorable mutant dog
