00:00:01.170  -->  00:00:07.020
OK so to make this age calculator I have a simple calc that each time l file was empty.

2

00:00:07.170  -->  00:00:10.640
I'll fill it in with my standard boiler plate.

3

00:00:10.770  -->  00:00:13.290
Let's put age calc as the title.

4

00:00:13.920  -->  00:00:17.220
Let's put a little H-1 again that says

5

00:00:20.340  -->  00:00:25.440
age calc solution and save it.

6

00:00:25.590  -->  00:00:31.010
Next we're going to make our javascript file which I will call calc.

7

00:00:32.580  -->  00:00:41.400
And I'm going to put a alert in there just to make sure it's connected and have my files connected OK

8

00:00:41.410  -->  00:00:41.800
.

9

00:00:42.120  -->  00:00:51.790
I go to my calc h t m l and I'll add in my script tag with source equals calc that genius.

10

00:00:52.160  -->  00:00:54.010
And there's one thing I want to show you here.

11

00:00:54.210  -->  00:01:00.220
If I save this and I go open it in the browser.

12

00:01:01.830  -->  00:01:04.310
Notice that I don't see my H-1 yet.

13

00:01:04.920  -->  00:01:10.100
So it tells me javascript alert connected but my H-1 hasn't loaded as soon as I click OK.

14

00:01:10.680  -->  00:01:12.950
Then it has loaded.

15

00:01:13.440  -->  00:01:20.030
And the reason that's happening is that I'm putting my script before this HDMI actually loads.

16

00:01:20.340  -->  00:01:26.460
So if I wanted that each one to be there I could put the script afterwards and we will talk a lot more

17

00:01:26.460  -->  00:01:28.190
about where you should put scripts.

18

00:01:28.200  -->  00:01:29.580
Some of them should go in the head.

19

00:01:29.580  -->  00:01:31.340
Some of them should go in the body.

20

00:01:31.470  -->  00:01:33.840
In this case I'm going to put this one down here in the body.

21

00:01:33.840  -->  00:01:39.180
It doesn't really make a big difference but it is worth knowing that if you put this script up top it's

22

00:01:39.180  -->  00:01:40.900
going to run first.

23

00:01:41.280  -->  00:01:42.620
So save this.

24

00:01:42.950  -->  00:01:44.850
Now let's go finish our logic here.

25

00:01:44.940  -->  00:01:52.020
So let's start by asking the user for their age so let's do var age because prompt.

26

00:01:52.800  -->  00:01:56.680
What is your age save.

27

00:01:56.970  -->  00:01:58.310
And then just to make sure it works.

28

00:01:58.320  -->  00:02:04.490
Let's do this to an alert just age and that's it.

29

00:02:04.490  -->  00:02:08.850
Then let's go back and open the file up.

30

00:02:08.850  -->  00:02:09.960
What is your age.

31

00:02:09.960  -->  00:02:10.890
10.

32

00:02:11.220  -->  00:02:13.320
And then just print out 10 an alert.

33

00:02:13.690  -->  00:02:14.490
OK.

34

00:02:14.820  -->  00:02:21.830
So next up we're now going to go and add the logic in to figure out how many days someone has spent

35

00:02:21.830  -->  00:02:23.760
a life.

36

00:02:23.850  -->  00:02:29.040
So I'm going to make a variable to store that in and I'm going to just call it days.

37

00:02:29.040  -->  00:02:39.460
So far days equals age times 365 days in a year and save that and then we'll do our alert here.

38

00:02:39.480  -->  00:02:41.630
So lower.

39

00:02:43.230  -->  00:03:03.040
And then we wanted to say age plus years is roughly plus the number days for us the word days.

40

00:03:03.480  -->  00:03:10.050
So this should say whatever the ages years is roughly whatever the days is days.

41

00:03:10.110  -->  00:03:12.300
So let's test that out.

42

00:03:12.930  -->  00:03:15.570
Refresh What is your age.

43

00:03:15.570  -->  00:03:22.670
Three three years is roughly one thousand ninety five days.

44

00:03:23.010  -->  00:03:27.380
One small adaptation we can make is that this doesn't account for leap years.

45

00:03:27.570  -->  00:03:30.240
So there is a leap year every four years.

46

00:03:30.330  -->  00:03:34.220
So the easiest way to include that is just to average that out.

47

00:03:34.350  -->  00:03:42.240
So instead of multiplying by 365 you multiply by 365 point to five a quarter of a year.

48

00:03:42.240  -->  00:03:45.940
Now if we try this again let's say that we are 50.

49

00:03:46.380  -->  00:03:53.720
We now get 50 years is roughly eighteen thousand two hundred sixty two point five days.

50

00:03:53.940  -->  00:03:54.310
OK.

51

00:03:54.420  -->  00:03:55.970
So that's all we had to do here.

52

00:03:56.160  -->  00:04:01.360
So the only real difference between this and the stocker problem is that we're doing some math beforehand
