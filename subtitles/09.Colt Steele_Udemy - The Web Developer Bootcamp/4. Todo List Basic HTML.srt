00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:01,140
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01,320  -->  00:00:06,480
So now that we have the folder structure set up and we have our files created We're going to spend some

3

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:10,020
time in this video creating the actual team structure.

4

00:00:10,020  -->  00:00:12,590
So the elements that we need for our To Do list.

5

00:00:12,990  -->  00:00:18,060
Let's begin by taking a look at the final version that we are working towards throughout the course

6

00:00:18,090  -->  00:00:19,270
of this unit.

7

00:00:19,650  -->  00:00:21,400
So here's the final to do list.

8

00:00:21,600  -->  00:00:26,490
And the big elements that we have here we have a heading right here.

9

00:00:26,570  -->  00:00:29,200
You have a button here some sort of element.

10

00:00:29,340  -->  00:00:36,510
We have a text input here input type equals text and then this is a well and each one of these is an

11

00:00:36,510  -->  00:00:38,580
ally in that UL.

12

00:00:39,030  -->  00:00:44,960
And then each button right here is a span that we're showing and hiding and changing the with on.

13

00:00:44,970  -->  00:00:50,000
And we also need some sort of element to contain everything and we'll just use a device to do that.

14

00:00:50,040  -->  00:00:59,070
So we need a div inside that div we'll make an H-1 a text input a UL with a bunch of allies and then

15

00:00:59,070  -->  00:01:01,230
some span's in there as well.

16

00:01:01,230  -->  00:01:07,110
So we'll start by just writing out some aged him l no real C Ss and just to let you know the way that

17

00:01:07,110  -->  00:01:12,660
we're going to go about this is by creating a ugly to do list that functions and then going back and

18

00:01:12,690  -->  00:01:14,590
adding in the C S.

19

00:01:14,640  -->  00:01:20,280
So I want to get to the meat of this which is the J query and the logic of making new to do's and deleting

20

00:01:20,280  -->  00:01:24,380
them and then we'll go back and add some of the pretty stuff at the end.

21

00:01:24,610  -->  00:01:24,860
OK.

22

00:01:24,870  -->  00:01:26,990
So let's start with the HD.

23

00:01:27,300  -->  00:01:34,380
I'm going to make a div and let's give it an ID container and we're going to put everything inside of

24

00:01:34,380  -->  00:01:44,280
that div and then instead of that div will have an H1 and it will just say to do list and then we'll

25

00:01:44,280  -->  00:01:46,640
have a text input.

26

00:01:46,990  -->  00:01:50,580
So input type equals text.

27

00:01:50,580  -->  00:01:52,380
And let's just see how that's shaping up.

28

00:01:52,680  -->  00:02:00,650
I'm going to get rid of the purple background for now and let's go over here.

29

00:02:01,200  -->  00:02:04,230
And I'm also going to get rid of this alert.

30

00:02:04,230  -->  00:02:06,270
So let's do that now.

31

00:02:06,270  -->  00:02:07,240
There we go.

32

00:02:07,790  -->  00:02:08,140
OK.

33

00:02:08,190  -->  00:02:12,420
So we have our input we have our text for the H-1.

34

00:02:12,600  -->  00:02:15,450
I guess we should make it to dasht do list.

35

00:02:15,690  -->  00:02:18,970
And then the next thing we'll do is add the UL.

36

00:02:19,080  -->  00:02:24,240
So let's make those changes to Dasch do list.

37

00:02:24,240  -->  00:02:30,660
And after that we'll add in our UL and each to do is lie inside of there.

38

00:02:30,660  -->  00:02:35,130
And let's start by adding in three or four starter Tutu's.

39

00:02:35,430  -->  00:02:38,640
So I'll have go to Potions class

40

00:02:42,450  -->  00:02:48,350
new robes and we'll also add visit Hagrid.

41

00:02:48,360  -->  00:02:48,630
All right.

42

00:02:48,630  -->  00:02:51,740
So we have three to do this in our list.

43

00:02:51,750  -->  00:02:59,630
Very unremarkable list so far but we have our H-1 our text input and our three allies inside of it.

44

00:02:59,680  -->  00:03:06,150
Well now let's go ahead and add in a delete button and we're not going to have this trash can delete

45

00:03:06,150  -->  00:03:09,820
button with all the styling to start that will come afterwards.

46

00:03:09,840  -->  00:03:15,030
We're going to just have a simpler button and it's actually not even going to be a button.

47

00:03:15,180  -->  00:03:16,460
It's just going to look like this.

48

00:03:16,590  -->  00:03:23,400
So the letter X that we can click on and if we click on that X it will delete that to do.

49

00:03:23,460  -->  00:03:28,830
And that's just how we'll start out rather than just having the letter be part of the lie though I'm

50

00:03:28,830  -->  00:03:32,840
going to use a span so span with a letter X.

51

00:03:33,330  -->  00:03:38,200
So let's copy that down.

52

00:03:38,340  -->  00:03:39,810
We have three spand.

53

00:03:39,990  -->  00:03:44,080
Each one has a letter X there refresh.

54

00:03:44,100  -->  00:03:45,160
Nothing looks different.

55

00:03:45,450  -->  00:03:51,810
But now we can select that span separately and we'll be adding a quick listener.

56

00:03:51,840  -->  00:03:56,890
So when we click on that span we want to delete this to do or this whole lie.

57

00:03:57,290  -->  00:03:57,530
OK.

58

00:03:57,540  -->  00:03:59,820
So that's all the basic markup we need.

59

00:04:00,060  -->  00:04:02,750
Let's do a tiny tiny bit of styling.

60

00:04:02,790  -->  00:04:09,300
The first thing we'll do is center this div So the div is ID container.

61

00:04:09,720  -->  00:04:21,330
Let's go in here and select that in our CSSA file select the tidy container and let's give it a nice

62

00:04:22,020  -->  00:04:26,430
background Gray just to start and see what we get.

63

00:04:26,430  -->  00:04:28,670
You can see the div goes all the way across.

64

00:04:28,860  -->  00:04:32,590
Let's go ahead and add in a with so that it doesn't go all the way across.

65

00:04:32,820  -->  00:04:39,900
And then we'll try and center it in the middle of the screen so the width will do is three hundred and

66

00:04:39,900  -->  00:04:41,840
sixty six.

67

00:04:42,120  -->  00:04:48,930
And if we save that it's just the same width that I have with the final version.

68

00:04:48,930  -->  00:04:53,870
So 360 pixels and then the next thing we want to do of course is center that.

69

00:04:54,210  -->  00:04:57,000
And the easiest way is to use that margin trick.

70

00:04:57,150  -->  00:05:02,760
So we set the margin on top and bottom to be zero and the left and right to be Ahto.

71

00:05:03,570  -->  00:05:07,640
And if we refresh now we have a nice center to do list.

72

00:05:07,680  -->  00:05:11,650
So that's all the time out and assess that we can do to start here.

73

00:05:11,700  -->  00:05:13,760
We'll add in some things as we need them.

74

00:05:13,950  -->  00:05:18,930
And then once we get the basic functionality down we'll focus on making this pretty and getting the

75

00:05:18,930  -->  00:05:24,780
right you know the animations and the effects the fades and the slides and making things just look and

76

00:05:24,780  -->  00:05:26,470
feel a lot nicer.

77

00:05:27,060  -->  00:05:29,870
OK so in the next video we're going to start writing some inquiry
