00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:01.910
All right welcome back everyone.

2

00:00:02.010  -->  00:00:06.610
In the next few videos we're going to talk about deploying our express applications.

3

00:00:06.780  -->  00:00:12.120
Basically how do we get these apps that are currently running and they're working fine they're technically

4

00:00:12.120  -->  00:00:14.740
deployed using Cloud 9.

5

00:00:15.300  -->  00:00:21.960
We have a few RL You know when my camp server is running I have a U R L that I can send to my mom I

6

00:00:21.960  -->  00:00:26.170
can send it to my friends I can post it on Facebook and people can visit that application.

7

00:00:26.400  -->  00:00:34.410
But of course it's not really the same thing as having my app server somewhere running 24/7 on an Amazon

8

00:00:34.410  -->  00:00:38.010
server or on a Heroku server or on my own server.

9

00:00:38.100  -->  00:00:41.490
Basically anything other than Cloud Nine servers.

10

00:00:41.490  -->  00:00:43.460
Not that there's anything wrong with Cloud 9.

11

00:00:43.470  -->  00:00:48.370
It's just that it's not designed for actually deploying applications.

12

00:00:48.480  -->  00:00:53.880
Those deployments that we've been doing when we start our server when we run node apps.

13

00:00:54.000  -->  00:00:59.350
Yes that starts up a server on cloud 9 and it works fine.

14

00:00:59.730  -->  00:01:06.480
But as soon as Cloud 9 has any issues as soon as I stop that server I hit control-C or my workspace

15

00:01:06.480  -->  00:01:09.240
restarts then we run into problems.

16

00:01:09.240  -->  00:01:12.240
That application is no longer running.

17

00:01:12.240  -->  00:01:18.660
The other problem is that it's generally not a good idea to have one copy of your application that you're

18

00:01:18.660  -->  00:01:24.930
working on that is the same copy of the application that is being deployed or that's being served.

19

00:01:25.230  -->  00:01:31.370
So let's say that you know I want to add in a new feature I wanted to add in.

20

00:01:31.860  -->  00:01:38.220
I don't know Google Maps or I want to add in something involving some sending a text message whatever

21

00:01:38.220  -->  00:01:42.710
feature it is I would need to stop the server to actually do that.

22

00:01:42.720  -->  00:01:48.300
So I'd have to stop my Yelp camp app try things out because remember we have to restart the server for

23

00:01:48.300  -->  00:01:50.320
a lot of these changes to take effect.

24

00:01:50.430  -->  00:01:55.870
So then we have gaps in our service where if I want to try something out I want to debug something.

25

00:01:56.160  -->  00:02:01.380
I'm actually debugging it on the same copy of the code that everyone else sees.

26

00:02:01.410  -->  00:02:03.010
Whoever is using the application.

27

00:02:03.210  -->  00:02:05.430
So obviously that's a big issue as well.

28

00:02:05.730  -->  00:02:12.720
So what we're going to do is use a tool called Heroku and Heroku is basically just servers that you're

29

00:02:12.720  -->  00:02:13.670
renting out.

30

00:02:13.950  -->  00:02:16.450
It's a company sales force owns them actually.

31

00:02:16.650  -->  00:02:21.460
There's a bunch of options similar companies like Digital Ocean.

32

00:02:21.630  -->  00:02:29.610
There's one called node jitsu modulus modulo that there's hundreds of these companies out there.

33

00:02:29.880  -->  00:02:35.040
Heroku is probably the most well-known though and the main reason we're using it is that it has an ice

34

00:02:35.040  -->  00:02:40.230
free plan but it's also really really robust and powerful.

35

00:02:40.440  -->  00:02:42.800
Big companies use Heroku all the time as well.

36

00:02:42.840  -->  00:02:45.930
So it's not just you know amateur solution or something.

37

00:02:46.470  -->  00:02:52.440
So let's talk about what Heroku is what it is what they do what deploying is when you deploy an application

38

00:02:52.740  -->  00:02:55.980
all that you're doing is running it on someone else's server.

39

00:02:56.010  -->  00:02:58.970
Or it can be your own server as well but just a server.

40

00:02:59.000  -->  00:02:59.720
That's it.

41

00:02:59.730  -->  00:03:04.160
It's it's running on a server somewhere and it's just going 24/7.

42

00:03:04.440  -->  00:03:10.860
What we could do is just get our own server go out build a computer connected to the Internet and just

43

00:03:10.860  -->  00:03:14.050
have that sitting in the corner running 24/7.

44

00:03:14.370  -->  00:03:18.840
Of course that doesn't really make sense for this course and it actually doesn't make sense for a lot

45

00:03:18.840  -->  00:03:20.410
of companies that used to be.

46

00:03:20.430  -->  00:03:24.440
And if the only way of serving an application of deploying something.

47

00:03:24.690  -->  00:03:32.400
And then there came this huge huge surge or this tidal wave of companies that provide you know deployment

48

00:03:32.430  -->  00:03:35.170
and cloud services as a service.

49

00:03:35.190  -->  00:03:43.470
Things like Amazon AWOS Heroku all the other things all the other companies I mentioned earlier there

50

00:03:43.520  -->  00:03:49.510
are businesses that solely exist basically to rent you computer power correct you server space.

51

00:03:49.560  -->  00:03:51.240
So that's that's what we're doing here.

52

00:03:51.300  -->  00:03:56.940
When we're going to deploy to Heroku all that we have to do is get our application whatever that application

53

00:03:56.940  -->  00:04:02.170
is you yup camp or our blog app we're just trying to get it on to Heroku servers and then just start

54

00:04:02.170  -->  00:04:04.270
it there and that's it.

55

00:04:04.380  -->  00:04:05.830
Heroku will give us a you.

56

00:04:05.880  -->  00:04:11.460
We can customize that we can send it to reroute to our own custom domain can do whatever we want but

57

00:04:11.460  -->  00:04:17.490
the goal is just to have our application that works on this computer or in this workspace in cloud 9

58

00:04:18.090  -->  00:04:23.220
and do exactly what we did here except on another computer another server.

59

00:04:23.340  -->  00:04:27.810
So we're going to do that in the next few videos in the next video we're going to show you how to deploy

60

00:04:28.080  -->  00:04:32.720
a really simple simple application to route an express app yes.

61

00:04:32.910  -->  00:04:36.270
No database no mango no authentication none of that.

62

00:04:36.390  -->  00:04:38.380
And then I'll show you how to deploy Yelp camp.

63

00:04:38.400  -->  00:04:44.250
It is a little bit more complicated when you have to consider databases and security issues.

64

00:04:44.250  -->  00:04:46.190
So again we're going to start nice and simple.

65

00:04:46.380  -->  00:04:51.380
So in the next video we'll actually go about this process transferring code from this computer.

66

00:04:51.380  -->  00:04:56.310
This machine cloud 9 to HIEROCLES and making sure that it runs well and Heroku.

67

00:04:56.490  -->  00:05:02.730
And by the end of the next video you'll have a link that is actually deployed that you can share and

68

00:05:02.730  -->  00:05:04.550
that you don't have to worry about it going down
