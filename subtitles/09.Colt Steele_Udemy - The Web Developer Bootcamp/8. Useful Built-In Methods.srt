00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:06,360
In this video we're going to introduce javascript methods and we're going to use three built in methods

2

00:00:06,540  -->  00:00:09,340
which will be useful for the next set of exercises.

3

00:00:09,340  -->  00:00:19,560
So those methods are alert prompt and console dialog and I'm going to go ahead and make this a little

4

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:21,440
bit bigger here.

5

00:00:21,450  -->  00:00:27,990
One thing you'll notice is that I'm using javascript comments just like in CCS and in HCM all javascript

6

00:00:27,990  -->  00:00:34,320
has its own way of defining comments which is just notes and things that don't actually run and aren't

7

00:00:34,350  -->  00:00:35,130
executed.

8

00:00:35,130  -->  00:00:40,200
So we use double slashes and then whatever I put here won't actually be run.

9

00:00:40,230  -->  00:00:47,460
So if I did something like five plus 10 which normally would be 15 it just doesn't run it at all.

10

00:00:47,460  -->  00:00:49,390
So that's comments in javascript.

11

00:00:49,980  -->  00:00:54,750
I'm also going to show one quick thing here which you'll see me do occasionally which is Cleator my

12

00:00:54,760  -->  00:01:00,030
console and I type the words clear and follow it with open and close parentheses.

13

00:01:00,040  -->  00:01:07,020
And I hit enter you know what that will do is clear my console there so clear itself is something called

14

00:01:07,430  -->  00:01:08,490
a method.

15

00:01:09,000  -->  00:01:13,260
And we're going to spend a lot of time later in this class talking about method and writing our own

16

00:01:13,260  -->  00:01:14,540
functions and methods.

17

00:01:14,970  -->  00:01:20,790
But at their core there's some code that someone else wrote or that we wrote eventually but for now

18

00:01:20,910  -->  00:01:25,590
there are methods that come with javascript or pieces of code that come a javascript that I can recall

19

00:01:26,010  -->  00:01:27,330
and I can run.

20

00:01:27,330  -->  00:01:34,300
So think of it almost as a variable but rather than storing a piece of data like the string hello.

21

00:01:34,560  -->  00:01:38,440
It stores other javascript code which can be executed over and over.

22

00:01:38,550  -->  00:01:45,930
So there could be a hundred lines of javascript that when I write clear are being called Clear actually

23

00:01:45,930  -->  00:01:50,250
happens to be pretty simple but there are methods that will see and that we write that will be pretty

24

00:01:50,250  -->  00:01:50,990
long.

25

00:01:51,450  -->  00:01:57,390
So the first method we're going to touch on is called alert and alert is actually a little bit of noxious

26

00:01:57,390  -->  00:01:57,450
.

27

00:01:57,450  -->  00:02:02,070
What it does is it pops up a message to the user it alerts the user.

28

00:02:02,070  -->  00:02:06,980
So the syntax looks like this alert in parentheses.

29

00:02:06,990  -->  00:02:12,150
And then instead of the parentheses we pass in something that we want to be alerted.

30

00:02:12,660  -->  00:02:17,890
So I can put a message as a string like hello there.

31

00:02:18,570  -->  00:02:23,020
And if I hit enter I get this annoying pop up that says the page.

32

00:02:23,040  -->  00:02:30,290
Google says hello there but I could also give it a number.

33

00:02:31,650  -->  00:02:40,020
I could have it do a little bit of math in there like 9 teen or 198 times three and four or five and

34

00:02:40,020  -->  00:02:42,270
it will alert the result.

35

00:02:42,270  -->  00:02:47,850
So as I mentioned it's a little obnoxious but we're going to use it before we actually build apps that

36

00:02:47,850  -->  00:02:50,140
display things with each to mount the assess.

37

00:02:50,220  -->  00:02:55,920
We're going to build apps that just display alerts the next when I want to show is similar to alert

38

00:02:56,100  -->  00:02:58,110
except it's much less intrusive.

39

00:02:58,140  -->  00:03:01,030
It's called console dot log.

40

00:03:01,290  -->  00:03:05,690
And what this will do is print something to the javascript console.

41

00:03:05,730  -->  00:03:10,320
So if someone doesn't have the console open they'll never see it print.

42

00:03:10,500  -->  00:03:16,240
So it looks like this con. don't log parentheses and then give it something to print.

43

00:03:16,340  -->  00:03:26,020
So hello from the console and all it does is just print up that text.

44

00:03:26,610  -->  00:03:32,640
So just like alert you really only going to use cancel that log early on in this class as a way of printing

45

00:03:32,640  -->  00:03:33,990
things to ourselves.

46

00:03:34,050  -->  00:03:39,180
So not printing means to a user you would never expect your user to actually go into the console but

47

00:03:39,180  -->  00:03:40,920
just for our own purposes.

48

00:03:41,460  -->  00:03:43,640
And then the last one I want to show is a little different.

49

00:03:43,740  -->  00:03:51,090
It's called prompt and prompt is very useful for us early on because it lets us get input from a user

50

00:03:51,090  -->  00:03:51,770
.

51

00:03:51,870  -->  00:04:00,360
So I'll show you what it looks like prompt parentheses and then inside of the parentheses we give it

52

00:04:00,360  -->  00:04:02,630
some text to prompt the user with.

53

00:04:02,630  -->  00:04:07,420
So something like What is your name.

54

00:04:07,770  -->  00:04:10,880
And if we do that you'll see a pops up or something.

55

00:04:10,890  -->  00:04:11,550
What is your name.

56

00:04:11,550  -->  00:04:19,110
And then I can put I can type in my name and hit OK so I'll type something in here and I hit OK.

57

00:04:19,140  -->  00:04:24,130
And of course it doesn't do anything with that because we're not storing the value.

58

00:04:24,150  -->  00:04:32,700
So the second part of prompt is that I can store it in a variable so I can save var user name ECOs prompt

59

00:04:32,700  -->  00:04:34,550
.

60

00:04:34,620  -->  00:04:37,370
What is your name.

61

00:04:38,520  -->  00:04:40,390
And this will pop up again.

62

00:04:40,530  -->  00:04:42,380
I can type something in there.

63

00:04:42,810  -->  00:04:44,870
I'll do Rusty this time.

64

00:04:45,510  -->  00:04:46,710
OK.

65

00:04:46,730  -->  00:04:51,000
Now instead of user name I have Rusty.

66

00:04:51,000  -->  00:04:54,380
So we're going to use prompts to ask users for input.

67

00:04:54,630  -->  00:05:00,120
And again we wouldn't use this in a real production web site but for these early exercises it's nice

68

00:05:00,120  -->  00:05:03,240
to have some variable input coming from a user.

69

00:05:03,270  -->  00:05:08,280
So the next few videos we're going to build some simple exercises that actually get input from the user
