00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:03.770
So far we've talked about why dominate appellation is exciting.

2

00:00:03.960  -->  00:00:05.100
Why you should care.

3

00:00:05.100  -->  00:00:09.420
The different sites that use it the endless possibilities the games all the exciting things.

4

00:00:09.570  -->  00:00:12.710
But we still haven't really talked about what the DOM actually is.

5

00:00:12.810  -->  00:00:16.380
So we're going to do that in this video to start let's just define it.

6

00:00:16.380  -->  00:00:17.180
Dio am.

7

00:00:17.220  -->  00:00:20.040
Dom stands for Document object model.

8

00:00:20.190  -->  00:00:24.100
The meaning of those three words will make a little more sense in the coming slides.

9

00:00:24.100  -->  00:00:26.780
But let's start by defining it at a higher level.

10

00:00:26.820  -->  00:00:30.560
The Dom is the interface between your javascript and your age.

11

00:00:30.570  -->  00:00:37.080
Tim Mounty SS It's basically a bunch of special javascript objects javascript methods functions that

12

00:00:37.080  -->  00:00:42.870
we can use to interact with our H.M.S. assess we can change things we can add elements remove elements

13

00:00:42.870  -->  00:00:48.930
change colors animate things all sorts of exciting ways to interact with their H.M.S. assess.

14

00:00:49.380  -->  00:00:54.270
On this slide I talk a little bit about how the DOM is constructed and why it's called the document

15

00:00:54.330  -->  00:00:56.070
object model.

16

00:00:56.070  -->  00:01:02.180
So when we load up an email page it looks like this in a browser and it's just some simple edged him

17

00:01:02.180  -->  00:01:09.210
out so you have a title and a tag with my link as the text and an H-1 with my header as the text and

18

00:01:09.210  -->  00:01:09.950
that's it.

19

00:01:10.260  -->  00:01:16.360
So when I open this up in the browser I see this but behind the scenes the DOM is created.

20

00:01:16.380  -->  00:01:19.190
It's constructed from this right here.

21

00:01:19.320  -->  00:01:24.270
So what I mean is that this age Tim is turned into a bunch of javascript objects.

22

00:01:24.270  -->  00:01:27.440
Each object models one of these elements.

23

00:01:27.450  -->  00:01:31.340
That's where we get the object model part of document object model.

24

00:01:31.650  -->  00:01:37.530
So again just to reiterate we load up each team in the browser the browser displays things to us like

25

00:01:37.530  -->  00:01:38.060
this.

26

00:01:38.220  -->  00:01:43.890
But behind the scenes it actually makes this model of every single element with a javascript object

27

00:01:44.220  -->  00:01:47.490
just like we modeled my dog Rusty using a javascript object.

28

00:01:47.490  -->  00:01:50.770
He had a property name and an other one breed and age.

29

00:01:50.850  -->  00:01:55.080
These objects are fundamentally the same thing except the content is different.

30

00:01:55.110  -->  00:02:03.120
They're going to have things like type of tag text source attributes color background color text size

31

00:02:03.120  -->  00:02:07.290
all different properties that are all contained inside of each object.

32

00:02:07.290  -->  00:02:11.460
We're definitely going to spend a lot of time working with these objects so the specifics aren't important

33

00:02:11.460  -->  00:02:11.620
.

34

00:02:11.640  -->  00:02:14.970
All that I want to emphasize here is that we load up each tim L..

35

00:02:15.120  -->  00:02:21.810
It's displayed in the browser and the browser takes that Tim L and takes each element and turns it into

36

00:02:21.900  -->  00:02:22.610
an object.

37

00:02:22.680  -->  00:02:24.510
So that covers the object model part.

38

00:02:24.540  -->  00:02:25.860
What about the document.

39

00:02:26.070  -->  00:02:31.950
So you can see here this is a little diagram of the type of structure that we get from the DOM the top

40

00:02:31.950  -->  00:02:38.250
level object that everything is contained inside of our entire model of the H.T. mounseers us is called

41

00:02:38.250  -->  00:02:38.930
the document.

42

00:02:39.120  -->  00:02:41.200
So we can go to any web page at all.

43

00:02:41.220  -->  00:02:45.190
So I have Google open and I'm just going to type in the con. The word document.

44

00:02:45.390  -->  00:02:49.470
And when I do that I get this big thing that comes back this big object.

45

00:02:49.470  -->  00:02:51.900
Except it doesn't look like a javascript object.

46

00:02:51.900  -->  00:02:53.740
It's not really what we would expect.

47

00:02:53.760  -->  00:02:56.030
That's because the browser is kind of hiding it from me.

48

00:02:56.130  -->  00:03:01.860
What it actually is showing me is with the HQ mail looks like as text but it's not showing me the actual

49

00:03:01.860  -->  00:03:04.480
objects that are modeled on this Timo.

50

00:03:04.740  -->  00:03:11.550
So to get that we need to use cancel dot D I R which is another method on the console object and we're

51

00:03:11.550  -->  00:03:17.430
going to cancel that D.I.R. document all that this will do is print out the entire document object in

52

00:03:17.430  -->  00:03:19.990
this object syntax that we're familiar with.

53

00:03:20.070  -->  00:03:25.680
So you can see it's just a regular object just like the ones we've written on our own just the same

54

00:03:25.710  -->  00:03:30.220
as Rusty the dog object except there's a lot more information here.

55

00:03:30.510  -->  00:03:40.050
So we have things like fonts or images links but we also have things like body and this body represents

56

00:03:40.050  -->  00:03:41.040
the entire body.

57

00:03:41.040  -->  00:03:44.320
So every element that you see on here is inside of body.

58

00:03:44.340  -->  00:03:49.710
So if I open body up you'll see that we have a whole bunch of other properties including one called

59

00:03:49.710  -->  00:03:51.050
Child's nodes.

60

00:03:51.150  -->  00:03:57.960
So child nodes shows us that there is a div there's a script tag and there's another div inside of the

61

00:03:57.960  -->  00:03:58.590
body.

62

00:03:58.590  -->  00:04:00.710
And if we went to elements we would see that.

63

00:04:00.710  -->  00:04:03.360
So here's the body inside of body.

64

00:04:03.420  -->  00:04:07.990
We have that first div we have a script tag and we have the second div.

65

00:04:08.430  -->  00:04:15.480
And then what say we open up that third div we would expect to see two more divs inside if that second

66

00:04:15.480  -->  00:04:15.890
div.

67

00:04:15.900  -->  00:04:23.390
And if we go over to the consul and we look at the second div and then we look at child nodes we see

68

00:04:23.430  -->  00:04:28.360
OK there's two more divs So as you can see the dom gets really huge really fast.

69

00:04:28.500  -->  00:04:32.610
There's hundreds and hundreds of different properties and methods and different nodes and this whole

70

00:04:32.610  -->  00:04:34.730
crazy structure of nested objects.

71

00:04:34.890  -->  00:04:36.250
It's just so much stuff.

72

00:04:36.270  -->  00:04:39.570
It's one of those times that I mentioned at the beginning of this class where you're going to have to

73

00:04:39.570  -->  00:04:42.060
be comfortable not knowing everything.

74

00:04:42.420  -->  00:04:46.450
I can tell you now that most developers don't know half of the properties here.

75

00:04:46.500  -->  00:04:49.200
I'd say they work with about 10 percent at most.

76

00:04:49.200  -->  00:04:52.630
There's so much more stuff here that we almost never need to use.

77

00:04:52.680  -->  00:04:57.150
And then sometime down the line something comes up and we have to do something we've never done before

78

00:04:57.150  -->  00:04:57.280
.

79

00:04:57.330  -->  00:05:03.690
We google it and we find out oh alright so that's what the uncured change property is for.

80

00:05:03.750  -->  00:05:04.560
I had no idea.

81

00:05:04.680  -->  00:05:06.500
And that's really what it's like to be a developer.

82

00:05:06.510  -->  00:05:11.190
Up until now with javascript we've been working in a little bit of a small controlled world where we

83

00:05:11.190  -->  00:05:14.380
learn about functions and objects we learn about variables.

84

00:05:14.610  -->  00:05:19.110
And there's a finite number of ways of doing things and there's a very specific subset of knowledge

85

00:05:19.110  -->  00:05:21.440
that you just need to know with the DOM.

86

00:05:21.450  -->  00:05:25.500
Now we have this huge huge ecosystem to work in so many properties.

87

00:05:25.620  -->  00:05:28.020
So I just want to reiterate there's so much here.

88

00:05:28.170  -->  00:05:32.100
We're going to focus on the important pieces but the goal is not to memorize.

89

00:05:32.130  -->  00:05:34.780
The goal is not to master every single property.

90

00:05:34.920  -->  00:05:39.560
Again 10 percent at most is all that you need to be a competent web developer.

91

00:05:40.000  -->  00:05:43.080
OK so let's go back and I just want to go over this one more time.

92

00:05:43.080  -->  00:05:44.450
Summarize what we talked about.

93

00:05:44.700  -->  00:05:48.030
So the DOM stands for document object model.

94

00:05:48.150  -->  00:05:52.150
It's the interface between your javascript and your H.M.S..

95

00:05:52.280  -->  00:05:55.180
It's how we can use our javascript to make things interactive.

96

00:05:55.260  -->  00:06:01.800
It's how we do things like add a new element to the page or change the ref attribute of a link or change

97

00:06:01.800  -->  00:06:07.320
the background image on our body or how we can get the value out of a form or we can do custom validations

98

00:06:07.320  -->  00:06:13.160
and animations and interactive elements where you click in some code runs all these different possibilities

99

00:06:13.410  -->  00:06:18.960
all stemmed from the fact that the document object model connects our javascript with their H.M.S. access

100

00:06:18.970  -->  00:06:19.110
.

101

00:06:19.260  -->  00:06:24.930
So the object model part of document object model tells us that it's a bunch of javascript objects that

102

00:06:24.930  -->  00:06:27.470
are modeling elements in our H.T. amount.

103

00:06:27.870  -->  00:06:32.980
So we have an ATAC here we end up with an object here representing that atec.

104

00:06:33.180  -->  00:06:37.770
And then we end up with another object representing this H1 tag which we see over here.

105

00:06:37.980  -->  00:06:42.930
Lastly it's called the document object model because everything lives inside of that one object called

106

00:06:42.930  -->  00:06:43.740
the document.

107

00:06:43.830  -->  00:06:46.850
It's the root node where everything else lives inside of.

108

00:06:47.070  -->  00:06:49.030
So the next video we're going to start writing some code.
