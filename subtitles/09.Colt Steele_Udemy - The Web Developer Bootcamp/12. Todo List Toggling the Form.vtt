00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:08.460
The very last thing that we have yet to do is making this Tuggle work so that we can show and hide this

2

00:00:08.460  -->  00:00:09.420
input.

3

00:00:09.420  -->  00:00:11.640
And that's actually a matter of inquiry.

4

00:00:12.030  -->  00:00:16.360
So what we do is have a quick listener on this and when we click.

5

00:00:16.740  -->  00:00:19.610
All that will do is fade this in or out.

6

00:00:19.930  -->  00:00:21.660
So let's go to Arjay query.

7

00:00:22.290  -->  00:00:28.080
Open up our javascript file and we can just do it at the very bottom.

8

00:00:28.350  -->  00:00:34.900
We need to select that icon which has a class of F.A. dash plus.

9

00:00:35.130  -->  00:00:36.420
And then when we click on that

10

00:00:39.390  -->  00:00:46.170
what we want to do pass in this callback that will be executed for us and what we need to do is select

11

00:00:46.200  -->  00:00:47.410
the input.

12

00:00:47.490  -->  00:00:54.610
So I'll just copy this here input type because text and then will fade out.

13

00:00:55.050  -->  00:00:58.700
So fade out just like that.

14

00:00:58.920  -->  00:01:05.440
And let's go back and refresh and I'll now click on this and it fades out.

15

00:01:05.820  -->  00:01:08.460
But of course it doesn't fade back in.

16

00:01:08.460  -->  00:01:15.570
So we'll use fade toggle and fade toggle will keep track of the state if it needs to be fitted in or

17

00:01:15.570  -->  00:01:18.540
faded out automatically and all refresh.

18

00:01:18.790  -->  00:01:25.100
And now when I click it automatically fades in and out without me having to write all the logic.

19

00:01:25.950  -->  00:01:26.340
All right.

20

00:01:26.340  -->  00:01:28.280
So that's it here for the To Do list.

21

00:01:28.530  -->  00:01:30.790
A few minor things that we might want to talk about.

22

00:01:31.020  -->  00:01:36.890
If we go back to our C Ss it's it's pretty long and it's not really organized.

23

00:01:37.200  -->  00:01:40.390
So there are a few strategies for organizing success.

24

00:01:40.500  -->  00:01:47.700
One of them is to organize by order on the page so that we're selecting from top to bottom and the other

25

00:01:47.700  -->  00:01:51.670
one that's more popular is to order things by specificity.

26

00:01:52.320  -->  00:01:58.380
So we'll start with the least specific item up top which would be the body and then we'll add in the

27

00:01:58.380  -->  00:02:09.680
rest of our element tags and then we'll add the rest of our elements selectors like H-1 UL or body.

28

00:02:09.870  -->  00:02:14.530
And I just noticed we should just merge these two bodies together here.

29

00:02:15.240  -->  00:02:16.370
There's no reason to.

30

00:02:16.380  -->  00:02:18.480
It's like the body twice.

31

00:02:18.720  -->  00:02:20.060
So then we have our H-1

32

00:02:22.520  -->  00:02:24.080
Juelz.

33

00:02:24.570  -->  00:02:25.730
Let's add in the ally

34

00:02:29.670  -->  00:02:31.680
and we'll also add in span

35

00:02:34.680  -->  00:02:37.310
and this is just really a matter of preference here.
