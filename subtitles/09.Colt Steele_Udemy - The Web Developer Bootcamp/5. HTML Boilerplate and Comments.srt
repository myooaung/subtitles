1

00:00:00,230  -->  00:00:00,950
We'll come back.

2

00:00:01,140  -->  00:00:06,360
So in this lesson we're going to start by making a new file actually filling it with h t m l an opening

3

00:00:06,360  -->  00:00:11,930
in the browser and we're also going to learn about the underlying structure of every HTML document.

4

00:00:11,940  -->  00:00:17,190
So there's a few things that every document always has kind of boilerplate that we're going to learn

5

00:00:17,190  -->  00:00:17,820
about.

6

00:00:17,820  -->  00:00:22,880
So to start going to go to sublime and I'm going to make a new file.

7

00:00:23,100  -->  00:00:29,610
So file new file or command and and then I'm going to save the file and give it a name.

8

00:00:29,610  -->  00:00:33,340
So file save or command as.

9

00:00:34,080  -->  00:00:37,040
So once I do that we're going to give it a name.

10

00:00:37,140  -->  00:00:42,980
Let's call it first page the page T.M. and this part is very important.

11

00:00:42,990  -->  00:00:44,950
Dot h Timo.

12

00:00:45,690  -->  00:00:47,120
So I'll hit save.

13

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:50,170
And that dot each team l tell sublime.

14

00:00:50,340  -->  00:00:55,790
And when I open it in Chrome it tells chrome This is an h tim I'll file treated as such.

15

00:00:56,220  -->  00:00:58,000
So we can write to Tim Allen here.

16

00:00:58,260  -->  00:01:04,460
So we'll start with just the one tag we've seen so far are one of the tags which is an H-1.

17

00:01:04,800  -->  00:01:06,740
And you'll notice that it's highlighted for me.

18

00:01:06,780  -->  00:01:08,040
So let's fill this in.

19

00:01:08,040  -->  00:01:16,470
This is my first tag and save this file and you'll see sublime knows it's H D M L so it highlights it

20

00:01:16,770  -->  00:01:19,020
makes corresponding tags red.

21

00:01:19,020  -->  00:01:19,950
In my case.

22

00:01:20,130  -->  00:01:25,680
Now what we want to do is actually open this file and view it because remember each time out it's just

23

00:01:25,680  -->  00:01:31,910
text but our browser interprets it and turns it into something like this or this.

24

00:01:31,920  -->  00:01:36,230
So to actually get Chrome to open it there's a few solutions.

25

00:01:36,270  -->  00:01:41,370
The first one is just double click on it and it will open it in your default browser.

26

00:01:41,490  -->  00:01:47,100
If that is not chrome it will still work but it will open it in Safari or Firefox or Internet Explorer

27

00:01:47,580  -->  00:01:53,690
and you can see though as it opens it it's not showing me the actual h t m l it is taking the h him

28

00:01:53,690  -->  00:01:58,090
out underlying it and turning it into this nice visual representation.

29

00:01:58,470  -->  00:02:03,340
As always I can view my page source and you'll see it's just one tag.

30

00:02:03,510  -->  00:02:07,470
So definitely simpler than something like this.

31

00:02:09,330  -->  00:02:11,670
But underlying they're exactly the same.

32

00:02:11,940  -->  00:02:15,910
And there's probably an H-1 on this page as well.

33

00:02:15,960  -->  00:02:17,770
So one other way of doing this.

34

00:02:18,000  -->  00:02:25,110
You can take the file right click and click on open with Google Chrome or you can click on it and drag

35

00:02:25,110  -->  00:02:27,720
it to Chrome and that will open it as well.

36

00:02:27,720  -->  00:02:32,640
Same thing goes for sublimest well so if you accidentally close the file you can drag it here and it

37

00:02:32,640  -->  00:02:33,470
will reopen it.

38

00:02:33,570  -->  00:02:40,200
So just to show you that click and I can open it.

39

00:02:40,440  -->  00:02:44,380
So unfortunately I have to break the news that are simple.

40

00:02:44,370  -->  00:02:47,650
It's Tim L that we've written so far is actually slightly wrong.

41

00:02:47,850  -->  00:02:52,140
The e-mail tag itself is fine but this isn't a valid document.

42

00:02:52,140  -->  00:02:57,260
And that's because we're missing the underlying structure that every page needs to have.

43

00:02:57,840  -->  00:02:59,320
So it looks like this.

44

00:02:59,490  -->  00:03:01,370
It is a lot compared to what we've done so far.

45

00:03:01,380  -->  00:03:03,950
But the good news is there's two pieces of good news.

46

00:03:03,960  -->  00:03:05,560
One it's always the same.

47

00:03:05,900  -->  00:03:12,120
And two sublime has a nice shortcut that gives this structure to us very very quickly with just four

48

00:03:12,120  -->  00:03:13,880
letters that we have to type.

49

00:03:14,280  -->  00:03:18,570
So we're going to go over these pieces individually and just a little bit but I'm going to start by

50

00:03:18,570  -->  00:03:25,650
just showing you how to get it in sublime so sublime instead of h tim l file we can type the word h

51

00:03:25,650  -->  00:03:29,690
tim L and then hit tab and we automatically get this structure.

52

00:03:30,000  -->  00:03:32,400
So let's go over what this does.

53

00:03:32,400  -->  00:03:33,460
First we're going to save.

54

00:03:33,570  -->  00:03:39,090
So there's this doc type H him out up top and it's kind of weird because there isn't a corresponding

55

00:03:39,090  -->  00:03:48,650
closing doc type like there is H-G M-L and head and title and body doc type is on its own.

56

00:03:48,690  -->  00:03:55,320
So let's go to M.D. and just showing you how you would get there I would type MT-NW and then doc type

57

00:03:55,850  -->  00:04:00,510
and it might seem silly to really talk about that but this is important because finding this information

58

00:04:00,510  -->  00:04:03,700
out is really what being a developer is googling something.

59

00:04:03,720  -->  00:04:05,500
How do you find the right answer.

60

00:04:05,520  -->  00:04:07,740
I'm going to be a complete broken record on that.

61

00:04:07,770  -->  00:04:12,660
My students laugh every time I talk about the art of googling but it really is important.

62

00:04:12,930  -->  00:04:13,760
So I'm here.

63

00:04:13,800  -->  00:04:14,910
Let's take a look.

64

00:04:15,030  -->  00:04:20,210
It says the doc type for each Timofei is simple to indicate that your HMO content uses HDMI.

65

00:04:20,210  -->  00:04:26,970
Five simply use doctype H-2 him out with an exclamation point in front of it and we do want to use HMO

66

00:04:26,970  -->  00:04:27,770
5.

67

00:04:27,870  -->  00:04:31,530
We'll talk exactly about what a schmuck a 5 is and what it isn't.

68

00:04:31,530  -->  00:04:32,580
In a future video.

69

00:04:32,790  -->  00:04:34,070
But we do want to use it.

70

00:04:34,140  -->  00:04:36,720
It's basically just the newest version of aged him out.

71

00:04:36,990  -->  00:04:38,660
So we put this up top.

72

00:04:39,030  -->  00:04:42,330
So the next thing we're going to talk about is the h t m l element.

73

00:04:42,510  -->  00:04:47,490
So this one is a little harder to find by searching who do MT-NW an HMO.

74

00:04:47,670  -->  00:04:48,540
If we just element

75

00:04:51,470  -->  00:04:56,030
there we go I always look for this empty end in the name.

76

00:04:56,040  -->  00:05:01,350
And this tells us the aged him root element represents the root of an HMO document.

77

00:05:01,500  -->  00:05:04,930
All other elements must be descendants of this element.

78

00:05:05,040  -->  00:05:06,500
So it's pretty self-explanatory.

79

00:05:06,620  -->  00:05:10,310
Basically everything that we write needs to go inside of each element.

80

00:05:10,710  -->  00:05:18,360
And more importantly under permitted content it tells us one head element followed by one body which

81

00:05:18,360  -->  00:05:22,640
is what we have one head and one body.

82

00:05:23,820  -->  00:05:28,140
So let's take a look at what head is the head element.

83

00:05:28,140  -->  00:05:34,190
Provide general information metadata about the document including its title and links to are definitions

84

00:05:34,200  -->  00:05:36,010
of scripts and style sheets.

85

00:05:36,330  -->  00:05:41,200
So what that means is basically everything that we don't see on the page as a user.

86

00:05:41,400  -->  00:05:48,210
So things like font files in our stylesheet files or javascript files all of those go in the head and

87

00:05:48,210  -->  00:05:53,200
then the body is where we put all of our content.

88

00:05:53,610  -->  00:05:57,210
It represents the content of an age HTML document.

89

00:05:57,210  -->  00:06:03,760
So if we go back here I can assure you one more thing which is how to write comments and niched him

90

00:06:03,750  -->  00:06:04,300
out.

91

00:06:04,530  -->  00:06:14,870
If I wanted to write a note to myself if I just wrote this content goes in the body and then appear

92

00:06:14,910  -->  00:06:21,000
I wrote a data goes in head.

93

00:06:21,750  -->  00:06:26,580
Fortunately that won't work because this will actually show up on the page.

94

00:06:26,720  -->  00:06:31,070
Its team will treat this like text and I want it just to be a note to myself.

95

00:06:31,230  -->  00:06:33,570
So this is something you can do in every programming language.

96

00:06:33,690  -->  00:06:41,040
You can turn this into a comment and a comment looks just like this starts with a less than sign exclamation

97

00:06:41,040  -->  00:06:47,100
point two dashes and then some content and then on the other side two dashes and a greater than sign

98

00:06:47,110  -->  00:06:47,830
.

99

00:06:49,050  -->  00:06:52,420
So he can type that hear yourself type it manually

100

00:06:57,000  -->  00:06:59,680
and you can see it kind of goes gray in sublime.

101

00:07:00,000  -->  00:07:05,220
But another really nifty shortcut is that you can select a line you don't have to select it just go

102

00:07:05,220  -->  00:07:08,360
to align and hit command slash

103

00:07:12,570  -->  00:07:21,160
and you can also see it can go up to it and you can go to comment toggle comment.

104

00:07:21,180  -->  00:07:24,230
So in case you forget this and you don't want to write it out.

105

00:07:24,260  -->  00:07:25,200
Another nice thing.

106

00:07:25,250  -->  00:07:30,380
Let's say I had a bunch of notes to myself I can select all of them and do the same thing.

107

00:07:30,420  -->  00:07:33,000
Command slash.

108

00:07:34,440  -->  00:07:35,320
Great.

109

00:07:35,400  -->  00:07:38,860
So I'm going to keep these comments here that are just notes to myself.

110

00:07:39,000  -->  00:07:40,740
My content goes in the body.

111

00:07:40,830  -->  00:07:43,000
It goes in the head.

112

00:07:43,830  -->  00:07:50,880
So that means that if we're following our own notes our content here needs to go inside of our body

113

00:07:50,900  -->  00:07:51,670
.

114

00:07:52,680  -->  00:07:57,450
So we should have nothing floating around outside the H Tim L element except for doctype.

115

00:07:57,540  -->  00:08:02,280
Everything else goes in head or in body.

116

00:08:02,280  -->  00:08:06,570
So let's go ahead and open this up make sure it looks the same as it did before.

117

00:08:06,570  -->  00:08:07,470
Double click.

118

00:08:07,620  -->  00:08:09,250
You can see it looks identical.

119

00:08:09,420  -->  00:08:12,960
Let's view the page source looks the same.

120

00:08:12,960  -->  00:08:17,580
Notice that our comments are not showing up of course only our H-1 shows up.

121

00:08:17,580  -->  00:08:20,590
One thing that we're missing while we're here is a title.

122

00:08:20,880  -->  00:08:27,570
A title is important not because it shows up on the page it will not show up in our actual page here

123

00:08:27,570  -->  00:08:27,670
.

124

00:08:27,690  -->  00:08:28,980
Remember it's in the head.

125

00:08:29,040  -->  00:08:32,660
So it's just metadata what it does do is two things.

126

00:08:32,700  -->  00:08:37,270
One it's going to determine the name or the text that goes in our tab appear.

127

00:08:37,740  -->  00:08:43,710
And it's also important for search engines and for other pages when other pages linked to your site

128

00:08:44,070  -->  00:08:49,890
or when you go to Google and you search for MDA on these names here.

129

00:08:49,880  -->  00:08:52,770
These come from the title elements.

130

00:08:52,760  -->  00:08:58,070
So for instance M.D. and celebrates 10 years of document in your web you click on that.

131

00:08:58,470  -->  00:09:02,120
You can see up here it says MDA and celebrates it gets cut off.

132

00:09:02,190  -->  00:09:07,500
You can inspect the page look for a title element.

133

00:09:07,500  -->  00:09:08,730
So a lot of stuff here we go.

134

00:09:08,760  -->  00:09:12,250
Title and celebrates 10 years of documenting your web.

135

00:09:12,600  -->  00:09:13,810
The mizzle blog.

136

00:09:14,340  -->  00:09:16,340
So title is important.

137

00:09:17,070  -->  00:09:24,710
So let's give ArcSight a title let's just call it my first page refresh watch right here and it updates

138

00:09:24,730  -->  00:09:25,680
.

139

00:09:25,710  -->  00:09:27,080
That's it for now.

140

00:09:27,090  -->  00:09:28,420
Remember two things.

141

00:09:28,540  -->  00:09:31,640
This boilerplate can just type H him l tab.

00:09:31,770  -->  00:09:33,720

00:09:33,890  -->  00:09:37,850

00:09:41,900  -->  00:09:42,340
