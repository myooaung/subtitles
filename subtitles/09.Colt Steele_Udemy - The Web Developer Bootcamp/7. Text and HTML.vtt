00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:04.980
Already Welcome Back in this video we're going to talk about some of the other common J Querrey methods

2

00:00:05.070  -->  00:00:07.430
that we'll want to use.

3

00:00:07.470  -->  00:00:11.940
So here are the seven methods that I want to discuss and the way that I'm going to do this here is I'll

4

00:00:11.940  -->  00:00:14.750
make an HTML file which already have.

5

00:00:15.090  -->  00:00:17.700
I call that method study Timo.

6

00:00:17.880  -->  00:00:22.530
And then I'll add in my basic age L and I'll just call it J.

7

00:00:22.560  -->  00:00:25.380
Queery methods in the title.

8

00:00:25.380  -->  00:00:31.950
And I'm going to just steal the CD and script that I added from the last exercise just so I don't have

9

00:00:31.950  -->  00:00:35.800
to go through that whole process so I'll just use the Cdn.

10

00:00:36.090  -->  00:00:40.360
And then I'm going to add some HTL here that we're going to work with and I'm going to use this H.T.

11

00:00:40.400  -->  00:00:43.340
mouth to demonstrate how all of these methods work.

12

00:00:43.560  -->  00:00:45.750
And as always I encourage you to follow along.

13

00:00:45.960  -->  00:00:51.420
So the first thing that I'm going to do is add some H to him all in have an H1 and it will just say

14

00:00:51.800  -->  00:01:03.510
J Query methods demo page and then we'll add in a text input and put type equals text and we'll give

15

00:01:03.510  -->  00:01:09.320
it a placeholder that just says your name just like that.

16

00:01:09.420  -->  00:01:20.160
Make this a little bit bigger and then we'll add in a well again with some allies and these allies will

17

00:01:20.160  -->  00:01:22.060
be different types of candy.

18

00:01:22.260  -->  00:01:28.780
So we'll have skittles and starburst and twix.

19

00:01:29.190  -->  00:01:33.040
OK so three types of candies instead of Elyse instead of a single.

20

00:01:33.170  -->  00:01:39.210
Well we'll just start with this and let's open it up in the browser see what we're working with.

21

00:01:39.210  -->  00:01:39.890
All right.

22

00:01:40.170  -->  00:01:42.890
And we'll open up the console to double check that we have.

23

00:01:42.900  -->  00:01:45.970
Jay Querrey So there's a lot of ways we can do that.

24

00:01:46.080  -->  00:01:52.860
We can type Jake where we can do dollar sign and select H-1 and make sure we get the right each one

25

00:01:53.070  -->  00:01:53.920
which we do.

26

00:01:54.150  -->  00:01:58.200
So now we know that J query is correctly added to our page.

27

00:01:58.230  -->  00:01:58.730
All right.

28

00:01:58.980  -->  00:02:02.250
So the first method that I want to talk about is called text.

29

00:02:02.310  -->  00:02:07.410
I'm going to go to the J CT documentation and show you how you can find specific methods.

30

00:02:07.410  -->  00:02:13.260
So what I like to do is just go to the API documentation home page and this actually contains every

31

00:02:13.260  -->  00:02:14.410
single method here.

32

00:02:14.430  -->  00:02:16.050
So we're looking for text.

33

00:02:16.110  -->  00:02:20.330
I would usually do a command f just to search the page for text.

34

00:02:20.390  -->  00:02:23.720
So when to show you how many there are and as you can see there's quite a few.

35

00:02:24.420  -->  00:02:29.070
And we'll get to text down here right here.

36

00:02:29.070  -->  00:02:36.060
TEXT And I'll open that up and what it tells us is that it gets the combined text contents of each element

37

00:02:36.360  -->  00:02:40.270
in the set of matched elements including their descendants.

38

00:02:40.440  -->  00:02:44.340
Or we can use it to set the text content of the matched elements.

39

00:02:44.340  -->  00:02:47.310
Think of it as the J Querrey version of text content.

40

00:02:47.730  -->  00:02:50.420
So the J Querrey docs always have good examples.

41

00:02:50.580  -->  00:02:55.950
You can see here they have some h tim else that up and they're selecting the div with the class of demo

42

00:02:55.950  -->  00:03:02.940
container which is this div and running dot text on it and they say that it could produce this result

43

00:03:02.970  -->  00:03:03.390
here.

44

00:03:03.540  -->  00:03:08.350
So all the text demonstration box list item one list item 2.

45

00:03:08.640  -->  00:03:10.850
It works just like text content in vanilla.

46

00:03:10.900  -->  00:03:11.580
Yes.

47

00:03:11.610  -->  00:03:12.980
So I'll demonstrate that.

48

00:03:13.230  -->  00:03:21.930
Let's zoom in a little bit and we can do something like this on H-1 that text and that just tells us

49

00:03:22.140  -->  00:03:25.760
the text of the H-1 is Jay Querrey methods demo page.

50

00:03:26.070  -->  00:03:28.590
I could do the same thing by selecting the UL

51

00:03:31.400  -->  00:03:37.510
dot text and that gives me all of the text content instead of the UL.

52

00:03:37.590  -->  00:03:41.500
So it strips out all the elements and only gives me the text.

53

00:03:41.940  -->  00:03:46.130
Another thing we could do is try to do it on ally.

54

00:03:46.680  -->  00:03:52.650
So I'm going to select all the allies and remember that will give me a list of three allies and then

55

00:03:52.650  -->  00:03:55.890
I'll run that text on that.

56

00:03:55.890  -->  00:04:02.490
What this will do is give me all of the text for all the allies and it will return one string.

57

00:04:02.490  -->  00:04:07.170
The other thing we can do with text that will make it really useful is we can pass in a value and that

58

00:04:07.170  -->  00:04:10.210
value will actually update what the text is.

59

00:04:10.230  -->  00:04:18.330
So I can do something like H-1 that text and change it to new text with some exclamation points and

60

00:04:18.330  -->  00:04:19.110
hit enter.

61

00:04:19.410  -->  00:04:25.290
And that changes the one that was selected so that it's text content is new text.

62

00:04:25.290  -->  00:04:32.630
So now if I ran one text with no argument it tells me it's now new text.

63

00:04:32.970  -->  00:04:39.150
And what's really cool about a query as we saw with C Ss is we can apply something to a collection and

64

00:04:39.150  -->  00:04:41.010
we don't have to loop through manually.

65

00:04:41.040  -->  00:04:53.700
So if I wanted to get all of the lies text and change it to the string rusty cold's dog is adorable

66

00:04:54.390  -->  00:04:55.410
which is true.

67

00:04:56.250  -->  00:04:57.550
And I hit enter.

68

00:04:57.600  -->  00:05:02.640
This will change all three allys text to be rusty cold's dog is adorable.

69

00:05:02.910  -->  00:05:05.100
So that's definitely really useful.

70

00:05:05.100  -->  00:05:11.370
What we would have to do with vanilla yes is select all three allies loop through with a for loop and

71

00:05:11.370  -->  00:05:16.490
for each one set the text content to be rusty cardstock is adorable.

72

00:05:16.500  -->  00:05:16.800
All right.

73

00:05:16.830  -->  00:05:18.590
So that's the text method.

74

00:05:18.630  -->  00:05:25.210
The next one I want to talk about is HMO so you can probably gather that h tim l works just like inner

75

00:05:25.240  -->  00:05:25.970
aged.

76

00:05:26.220  -->  00:05:28.370
And I'll just do a search on here for HMO.

77

00:05:28.410  -->  00:05:29.390
There it is.

78

00:05:30.180  -->  00:05:36.450
And read it here says that it gets the HMO contents of the first element in the set of matched elements

79

00:05:36.810  -->  00:05:40.760
or set the HMO contents of every matched element.

80

00:05:41.040  -->  00:05:44.540
So let's go back to our code here and I'm going to refresh.

81

00:05:44.760  -->  00:05:50.080
So we reset our code and I'm going to ask for the h m l of this ul.

82

00:05:50.130  -->  00:06:00.320
So I select UL dot aged humo and that will just retrieve the inner h him out of the UL.

83

00:06:00.480  -->  00:06:07.560
So the text method corresponds to the text content property and M L corresponds to inner aged him out

84

00:06:08.520  -->  00:06:16.290
just like before I can actually provide an argument to that HMO and that will update the H.T. malcontent

85

00:06:16.380  -->  00:06:16.650
.

86

00:06:16.860  -->  00:06:27.150
So I'll update the out of the UIL to be a new ally inside of there that says I hacked your UL just like

87

00:06:27.150  -->  00:06:30.600
that and those the to allies.

88

00:06:30.630  -->  00:06:31.890
So I'm going to duplicate this

89

00:06:35.100  -->  00:06:36.240
and paste that back.

90

00:06:36.330  -->  00:06:41.380
And this other ally will say Rusty is still adorable.

91

00:06:42.060  -->  00:06:50.260
So we have one ally two allies instead of a string and we're updating the UL.

92

00:06:50.300  -->  00:06:51.300
Hit enter.

93

00:06:51.510  -->  00:06:54.160
And you can see that it updates the enraged him.

94

00:06:54.590  -->  00:06:58.910
And if we had multiple Juelz on this page it would update both of them.

95

00:06:59.370  -->  00:07:08.910
So for instance if I select both allies with Dollar Sign ally and I change the age mail to be an anchor

96

00:07:08.910  -->  00:07:22.470
tag and just like that anchor tag and we'll have a Tref equals Google dot com and then click me to go

97

00:07:22.470  -->  00:07:23.390
to Google.

98

00:07:23.460  -->  00:07:26.850
We're updating the HD mail content inside of this.

99

00:07:26.850  -->  00:07:34.020
And if I hit enter you can see that it updates both allies to now reflect that new content.

100

00:07:34.020  -->  00:07:35.130
One quick side note.

101

00:07:35.280  -->  00:07:40.110
You might think that we could use text to do the same thing but we actually can't and that's because

102

00:07:40.110  -->  00:07:47.070
text is considered Tomales safe which means that it's not going to treat what you pass it as HMO.

103

00:07:47.130  -->  00:07:48.790
It's going to treat it as text.

104

00:07:49.020  -->  00:07:50.180
So I'll show you what I mean.

105

00:07:50.250  -->  00:07:58.850
If I try and change the text of both ALWIS to be this what will actually do is just give me the text

106

00:07:58.950  -->  00:08:02.500
so it won't treat it like aged him well which is a good thing actually.

107

00:08:02.790  -->  00:08:08.400
If we wanted a user to type something into the text box and when he or she hit Enter we wanted to add

108

00:08:08.400  -->  00:08:15.090
a new ally with whatever I typed here the user could potentially write their own h team out here and

109

00:08:15.090  -->  00:08:20.260
mess up our site or even worse he or she could write some javascript and run that.

110

00:08:20.430  -->  00:08:22.830
So if we're letting our user types something in.

111

00:08:22.830  -->  00:08:26.790
We don't want to just treat it as HVM Well we usually want to treat it as text
