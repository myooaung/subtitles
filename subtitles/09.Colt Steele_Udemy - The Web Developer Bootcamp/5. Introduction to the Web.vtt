00:00:01.410  -->  00:00:02.270
Welcome back.

2

00:00:02.520  -->  00:00:07.520
So this video is going to function as a sort of crash course in how the Internet works.

3

00:00:07.530  -->  00:00:13.410
For someone who wants to be a developer so it's meant to take you from avid Internet user like me who

4

00:00:13.410  -->  00:00:18.240
maybe doesn't understand a lot about how the Internet works because you don't have to to someone who

5

00:00:18.240  -->  00:00:22.980
still uses the Internet all the time but understands a little bit about how it works at a high level

6

00:00:22.980  -->  00:00:23.180
.

7

00:00:23.220  -->  00:00:27.960
It might be surprising but developers really don't need to know that the very low level nitty gritty

8

00:00:27.960  -->  00:00:33.810
about different data protocols and how they work in this TCAP IP stack in things that you may hear that

9

00:00:33.810  -->  00:00:35.030
are very intimidating.

10

00:00:35.190  -->  00:00:41.130
That's an entire discipline there's entire college majors and courses devoted towards how the Internet

11

00:00:41.130  -->  00:00:42.450
works at a low level.

12

00:00:42.690  -->  00:00:48.420
As a developer things are abstracted away so that we only need to understand the very basics more than

13

00:00:48.420  -->  00:00:49.940
your typical user of the Internet.

14

00:00:50.070  -->  00:00:55.590
But we don't have to be experts on all this very intimidating nitty gritty stuff.

15

00:00:55.590  -->  00:00:57.250
So few things we want to do here.

16

00:00:57.420  -->  00:01:00.150
We want to understand at a high level how the Internet works.

17

00:01:00.270  -->  00:01:05.340
Things like HGP IP domain names you are elsewhat are all those.

18

00:01:05.340  -->  00:01:06.550
How do they work together.

19

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:09.920
We want to understand the difference between front end and back end element.

20

00:01:10.170  -->  00:01:12.540
Also full stack where does that fit in.

21

00:01:12.570  -->  00:01:16.420
And then we also want to be able to view the H Tim L on any website.

22

00:01:17.220  -->  00:01:20.340
So the first thing that I want to do here is actually watch a video.

23

00:01:20.550  -->  00:01:22.080
So the link is in the slide.

24

00:01:22.140  -->  00:01:25.900
It's also in the description of this video going to go ahead and open it up.

25

00:01:26.040  -->  00:01:28.430
Feel free to watch it on your own.

26

00:01:28.440  -->  00:01:33.270
I'm going to watch it in this video and just pause it a few moments and highlight a few important pieces

27

00:01:33.270  -->  00:01:43.470
.

28

00:01:43.620  -->  00:01:48.960
Have you ever wondered what happens when someone in England visits the World Science Festival web page

29

00:01:52.170  -->  00:01:53.210
first.

30

00:01:53.220  -->  00:01:58.470
Their computer needs to ask the World Science Festival server for a copy of that web page.

31

00:01:58.710  -->  00:02:04.830
The computer sticks this request into a virtual envelope called a packet wrapped with specific information

32

00:02:04.830  -->  00:02:12.150
about that request including the world's science festivals IP address the computer sends this packet

33

00:02:12.180  -->  00:02:18.450
out of the house and below the street via a large underground copper wires it passes through small regional

34

00:02:18.450  -->  00:02:22.130
networks before ending up here at Telehouse north in London.

35

00:02:22.440  -->  00:02:25.700
Telehouse north is England's main Internet hub.

36

00:02:25.740  -->  00:02:31.220
The IP address on this packet tells the hub that the world science festival server is actually in Lausanne

37

00:02:31.250  -->  00:02:36.120
and the first thing I want to just highlight there the user in this case went to a Web site.

38

00:02:36.180  -->  00:02:43.140
World Science Festival Web site or type that in and then hit enter and all of this is happening before

39

00:02:43.140  -->  00:02:44.680
the user sees anything.

40

00:02:44.760  -->  00:02:49.210
The idea is that a user is asking for a website or requesting it.

41

00:02:49.260  -->  00:02:52.140
And that's what it's called it's an H TTP request.

42

00:02:52.170  -->  00:02:59.460
So when I opened up this video YouTube dot com slash this you know when I hit Enter I'm asking for the

43

00:02:59.460  -->  00:03:05.640
contents of this page and that has to go all the way to YouTube somewhere and they have to send it all

44

00:03:05.640  -->  00:03:07.040
the way back to me.

45

00:03:07.050  -->  00:03:11.030
So so far we're still just getting the request to the right place.

46

00:03:11.430  -->  00:03:17.370
So Telehouse North sends the packet out is like across the Atlantic over fiber optic cables buried deep

47

00:03:17.370  -->  00:03:18.620
beneath the ocean.

48

00:03:18.780  -->  00:03:26.310
The packet ends up here 60 Hudson Street New York City the largest Internet hub on the East Coast.

49

00:03:26.760  -->  00:03:32.010
This hub sends the packet through a series of regional networks connecting New York to Los Angeles where

50

00:03:32.010  -->  00:03:34.760
the World Science Festival server resides.

51

00:03:35.220  -->  00:03:39.570
The server reads the request and gets ready to send the web page to English.

52

00:03:40.260  -->  00:03:46.170
But web page is made up of images and text are too large to send as a single packet of data.

53

00:03:46.170  -->  00:03:49.440
So how do we get it back to England.

54

00:03:49.440  -->  00:03:50.380
Imagine that.

55

00:03:50.450  -->  00:03:56.670
So at this point the request has made it all the way to the correct server and it's told that I'm looking

56

00:03:56.670  -->  00:03:57.650
for this page.

57

00:03:57.810  -->  00:04:02.880
And so now everything is on the return journey going from the server all the way back to the computer

58

00:04:02.940  -->  00:04:09.630
that asked for this specific page group of 5000 tourists visiting New York City in a single gigantic

59

00:04:09.630  -->  00:04:10.850
tour bus.

60

00:04:10.950  -->  00:04:15.730
They are way up in Harlem but they want to visit the Statue of Liberty before it closes.

61

00:04:15.840  -->  00:04:18.560
But it's rush hour on a Friday.

62

00:04:18.580  -->  00:04:23.490
There's no way that giant bus is going to fit through those crazy congested streets.

63

00:04:23.580  -->  00:04:28.260
So they decide to get off the bus and spread out some take the subway.

64

00:04:28.260  -->  00:04:34.480
Some take cabs a few rent bikes and some even take kayaks down the Hudson River.

65

00:04:34.650  -->  00:04:39.890
How they get there doesn't matter as long as they get there on time.

66

00:04:39.930  -->  00:04:42.740
Likewise for the Internet to work efficiently.

67

00:04:42.780  -->  00:04:49.410
This web pages pulverized into thousands of tiny packets of data each one racked with all of the information

68

00:04:49.410  -->  00:04:57.280
that needs to rebuild itself in the the kids are sent to L.A. one will sure hub which checks the traffic

69

00:04:57.280  -->  00:05:01.350
report before sending them on through miles and miles of land.

70

00:05:01.350  -->  00:05:07.270
They travel checking in through different hubs like are New York City tourists those packets don't care

71

00:05:07.270  -->  00:05:11.630
how they get there as long as they get there as fast as possible.

72

00:05:12.040  -->  00:05:17.080
Most of them will go through 60 Hudson in New York where they are redirected back to England is like

73

00:05:17.530  -->  00:05:20.640
riding a fibre of glasses thick as a silver dollar.

74

00:05:20.800  -->  00:05:26.960
Then back on copper wire through regional British networks into all the packets reached their destination

75

00:05:26.970  -->  00:05:27.000
.

76

00:05:27.010  -->  00:05:37.000
And and this epic journey it all happens in about a second along with trillions upon trillions of similar

77

00:05:37.000  -->  00:05:44.020
journeys that happen each and every day on this remarkable easy to take for granted network of networks

78

00:05:44.020  -->  00:05:47.850
we call the Internet.

79

00:05:48.070  -->  00:05:50.180
So hopefully you found the video fascinating.

80

00:05:50.200  -->  00:05:55.250
It certainly blows my mind even you know someone who does this a lot and who uses the Internet a lot

81

00:05:55.250  -->  00:05:55.300
.

82

00:05:55.300  -->  00:05:57.360
Makes Web sites makes applications.

83

00:05:57.370  -->  00:06:02.950
It's still so amazing the process that happens behind the scenes just for every single page that loads

84

00:06:04.150  -->  00:06:05.320
just reiterate.

85

00:06:05.320  -->  00:06:10.720
Let's take this example of when I go to this you around here and we dot com slash courses and I hit

86

00:06:10.720  -->  00:06:11.950
enter.

87

00:06:12.010  -->  00:06:18.220
Remember I'm asking for something and I'm getting something back and requesting something and the server

88

00:06:18.220  -->  00:06:19.810
is responding.

89

00:06:19.810  -->  00:06:21.660
And there's a lot of stuff that happens in between.

90

00:06:21.670  -->  00:06:24.900
But that's the core concept.

91

00:06:24.940  -->  00:06:29.680
So the very first step that happens and actually before I start there I want to let you know this is

92

00:06:29.680  -->  00:06:31.290
not something you need to memorize.

93

00:06:31.300  -->  00:06:35.740
This is purely conceptual stuff that is nice to know but you can always come back.

94

00:06:35.740  -->  00:06:36.680
You can look this up.

95

00:06:36.700  -->  00:06:38.400
You can watch this video up.

96

00:06:38.410  -->  00:06:44.320
The one thing I really want you to memorize and to be confident in is this idea of requests and responses

97

00:06:44.620  -->  00:06:49.530
asking for data and a server giving you that data and then your browser displaying it.

98

00:06:49.720  -->  00:06:56.620
So this step here when I go to you or I hit enter the first thing that happens is my computer needs

99

00:06:56.620  -->  00:07:00.520
to know the exact address to send a request to.

100

00:07:00.520  -->  00:07:04.750
Which is just like when you send a letter you need to have a unique address.

101

00:07:04.750  -->  00:07:07.200
No home has the same address as another home.

102

00:07:07.240  -->  00:07:10.840
They might look the same but they're in a different city or different different zip code or different

103

00:07:10.840  -->  00:07:11.600
country.

104

00:07:11.620  -->  00:07:12.460
They are unique.

105

00:07:12.550  -->  00:07:17.290
So we need that address so that our request goes to the right place.

106

00:07:17.290  -->  00:07:20.270
So the Sinko DNS it takes that domain name.

107

00:07:20.310  -->  00:07:25.840
You do need outcome and it translates it into this IP address which is a string of numbers and dots

108

00:07:25.910  -->  00:07:26.410
.

109

00:07:26.420  -->  00:07:28.560
This is a unique identifier.

110

00:07:29.050  -->  00:07:34.270
Once we have that then we actually send a letter to when we actually make the request.

111

00:07:34.270  -->  00:07:40.700
So in this case when I hit enter I am figuring out where my computer computers figuring out what does

112

00:07:40.880  -->  00:07:43.860
that mean to me Dotcom's IP address.

113

00:07:44.230  -->  00:07:44.700
OK.

114

00:07:44.740  -->  00:07:50.370
We have the IP address now but send a request asking for the course's page.

115

00:07:50.530  -->  00:07:55.690
So we make a request with an HTP request we'll talk a lot more about what that is and what they look

116

00:07:55.690  -->  00:07:56.130
like.

117

00:07:56.230  -->  00:07:59.260
And remember it's not just a one way direct shot there.

118

00:07:59.290  -->  00:08:04.480
Basically the request bounces around from server to server until we get to the server we're looking

119

00:08:04.480  -->  00:08:05.640
for.

120

00:08:06.370  -->  00:08:11.650
So when we get to the server the first part is that the server is going to figure out what am I asking

121

00:08:11.650  -->  00:08:19.330
for and my asking for the home page I'm asking for Slash courses page we're asking for the sign up page

122

00:08:19.820  -->  00:08:21.640
the become an instructor page.

123

00:08:21.670  -->  00:08:26.140
There's all sorts of different pieces here that I could be asking for and they're all different.

124

00:08:26.140  -->  00:08:30.500
So the service job is to figure out what to send back.

125

00:08:30.610  -->  00:08:35.950
When we do back in development that will be your job figuring out what content to send back.

126

00:08:35.950  -->  00:08:42.190
So then the server often interacts with the database that pulls out information and it makes the combination

127

00:08:42.190  -->  00:08:44.540
of each team l javascript and C S S.

128

00:08:44.560  -->  00:08:51.010
So then our server responds back sends us this combination of each team s and Javascript it's a bunch

129

00:08:51.010  -->  00:08:51.800
of code.

130

00:08:51.820  -->  00:08:55.450
It's not very readable for humans in our browser steps in.

131

00:08:55.450  -->  00:09:01.270
And it turns it into this it's the whole job our browser takes that information and it makes it easy

132

00:09:01.270  -->  00:09:02.910
to understand for humans.

133

00:09:03.340  -->  00:09:06.210
So this process happens on every single page of is it.

134

00:09:06.310  -->  00:09:11.260
And you can actually see the underlying H.M.S. assess on any page and Javascript.

135

00:09:11.290  -->  00:09:14.390
So there's a few ways of doing it in Chrome.

136

00:09:14.500  -->  00:09:16.570
And this is why we're all using Chrome.

137

00:09:16.570  -->  00:09:17.530
You can go.

138

00:09:17.680  -->  00:09:19.800
Let's go to this page here.

139

00:09:20.470  -->  00:09:27.070
I can right click and click View page source and it opens up a new window that actually contains all

140

00:09:27.070  -->  00:09:32.680
of the H.M.S. s s and javascript that is the underlying source for this page.

141

00:09:32.710  -->  00:09:36.520
Same thing on YouTube right click View page source.

142

00:09:36.520  -->  00:09:38.570
And so this is on every single site.

143

00:09:38.740  -->  00:09:40.430
So there's no way to hide this.

144

00:09:40.480  -->  00:09:42.490
The whole Java the browser takes this.

145

00:09:42.490  -->  00:09:45.520
And it turned it into this.

146

00:09:45.520  -->  00:09:47.950
So browsers are definitely complicated things.

147

00:09:47.950  -->  00:09:50.800
The good thing is you don't have to know how that works the browser.

148

00:09:50.800  -->  00:09:52.150
That's the whole drop her browser.

149

00:09:52.150  -->  00:09:54.870
It takes that code and it turns it into this.

150

00:09:54.880  -->  00:09:56.390
So another way you can do it.

151

00:09:56.500  -->  00:10:03.030
There's a shortcut in Chrome you can do a command option view on a PC.

152

00:10:03.030  -->  00:10:08.420
I believe it's control option you if not you can just right click and chrome and view it as well
