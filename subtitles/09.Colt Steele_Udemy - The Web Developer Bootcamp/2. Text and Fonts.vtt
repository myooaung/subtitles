WEBVTT
1

00:00:01.020  -->  00:00:07.590
So this video is going to focus on fonts in success and obviously having fun and picking fonts for a

2

00:00:07.580  -->  00:00:09.880
web page is really really important.

3

00:00:10.110  -->  00:00:14.660
But we're also going to cover a lot of other properties that are related to fonts and to text.

4

00:00:14.730  -->  00:00:23.470
And those are font family font size font weight line height text a line and text decoration.

5

00:00:23.610  -->  00:00:26.530
So in this video we're going to stop and cover all of those.

6

00:00:26.730  -->  00:00:32.670
And the first thing we're going to do is get our simple text up that we're going to style.

7

00:00:33.030  -->  00:00:39.080
So I have a simple Funk's that is Jim M-file and I'm going to go ahead and add in your mouth.

8

00:00:39.080  -->  00:00:42.660
So I'm just going to do an H-1 so that we can see a header and style.

9

00:00:42.750  -->  00:00:44.180
And then some paragraphs.

10

00:00:44.490  -->  00:00:51.720
So I'm just going to call this font's demo page and then the next thing rather than just typing some

11

00:00:51.720  -->  00:00:57.450
random words or some jibberish like this which actually doesn't really reflect what the English language

12

00:00:57.450  -->  00:00:59.580
looks like on a page.

13

00:00:59.620  -->  00:01:02.610
I'm going to use a Lorem Epsom generator.

14

00:01:02.610  -->  00:01:08.640
So for those of you who don't know Lorem Ipsum generators are used to generate a bunch of random text

15

00:01:08.730  -->  00:01:09.980
that is English words.

16

00:01:09.990  -->  00:01:13.550
It doesn't mean anything at all but it at least looks like real words.

17

00:01:13.560  -->  00:01:15.570
So it is placeholder text.

18

00:01:16.110  -->  00:01:23.310
So I have it kind of funny article open of 10 of the best or the most hilarious Lorem Ipsum generator's

19

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:24.350
for web designers.

20

00:01:24.570  -->  00:01:30.480
And I'm just going to go with this first one bacon ipsum so I'm going to generate a few paragraphs here

21

00:01:30.480  -->  00:01:31.090
.

22

00:01:31.560  -->  00:01:31.910
Quick.

23

00:01:31.920  -->  00:01:34.370
Give me bacon and you can see it just give me some text.

24

00:01:34.470  -->  00:01:41.080
But this is real text that actually looks like a potential you know something you would have on a Web

25

00:01:41.070  -->  00:01:41.670
site.

26

00:01:41.700  -->  00:01:43.430
It doesn't look like just jibberish like this.

27

00:01:43.440  -->  00:01:45.890
So it's a better representation of a font.

28

00:01:46.110  -->  00:01:48.010
So I'm going to go ahead and paste that in.

29

00:01:48.120  -->  00:01:52.100
I'm going to make two paragraphs out of this.

30

00:01:54.140  -->  00:01:54.570
All right.

31

00:01:54.570  -->  00:01:59.510
And we'll leave it at that for now and we'll come back and add a little bit later.

32

00:01:59.670  -->  00:02:02.580
Let's just open this up and see what we have.

33

00:02:03.300  -->  00:02:03.720
OK.

34

00:02:03.750  -->  00:02:08.670
So here's a site that we're going to be styling and the first thing that we want to do is talk about

35

00:02:09.030  -->  00:02:11.840
how do we actually just assign a font to anything.

36

00:02:12.180  -->  00:02:17.790
And before we can even do that we have to talk about what font we even have available to us in the browser

37

00:02:17.790  -->  00:02:18.510
.

38

00:02:18.510  -->  00:02:23.370
So there's no easy answer as to which fonts a computer has available in the browser.

39

00:02:23.550  -->  00:02:26.420
And that's because they're different on every machine.

40

00:02:26.670  -->  00:02:28.360
And I have this site open here.

41

00:02:28.640  -->  00:02:30.070
She says fonts stack.

42

00:02:30.270  -->  00:02:34.250
That actually shows depending on if you're on a Mac or Windows.

43

00:02:34.350  -->  00:02:38.280
What's the percentage of those machines are that have a given font.

44

00:02:38.670  -->  00:02:42.820
And so these are just kind of the standard web fonts that we'll see a lot of the time.

45

00:02:42.840  -->  00:02:51.030
So if we look at one like Helvetica you can see that every Mac has America but very few windows have

46

00:02:51.450  -->  00:02:52.130
installed.

47

00:02:52.290  -->  00:02:55.430
And so these are the system fonts that come on a machine.

48

00:02:55.950  -->  00:03:00.650
So these are not the only fonts that you can use but these are some that are safer bets.

49

00:03:00.660  -->  00:03:05.790
So if you wanted one that he knew for sure would work on every machine you would pick like Arial black

50

00:03:06.270  -->  00:03:07.590
or aerial.

51

00:03:08.160  -->  00:03:10.310
Obviously these fonts though are pretty limited.

52

00:03:10.350  -->  00:03:14.030
So we're going to see how we actually include custom fonts later in this video.

53

00:03:14.130  -->  00:03:16.230
But for now let's just pick one of these.

54

00:03:16.260  -->  00:03:19.750
So let's go with Ariel Sharon Ariel.

55

00:03:20.010  -->  00:03:24.720
So to use that we're going to assign that to our paragraphs here.

56

00:03:25.370  -->  00:03:27.700
So we're going to go into my C S S which I have linked here.

57

00:03:27.720  -->  00:03:31.840
Styles that C S S and the property is called the font family.

58

00:03:32.040  -->  00:03:40.820
So I'm going to select paragraphs and I'm going to say font family is Arial just like that.

59

00:03:41.060  -->  00:03:46.390
And if I refresh you'll see I now have Arial font here.

60

00:03:46.410  -->  00:03:51.830
One quick note I can also put quotes around this which is totally valid.

61

00:03:51.840  -->  00:03:57.200
Sometimes you'll have to do this if you have a font that has a number at the beginning.

62

00:03:57.200  -->  00:04:02.160
Not that this is a real font but if that was I would have to put quotes around it because this is not

63

00:04:02.160  -->  00:04:04.360
a valid CSSA line.

64

00:04:04.830  -->  00:04:10.660
OK so I can give it Aeriel like that and you can see we get Aeriel.

65

00:04:10.830  -->  00:04:12.970
So there are other fonts you can play around with.

66

00:04:12.990  -->  00:04:16.340
Let's try Georgia.

67

00:04:16.800  -->  00:04:19.290
So let's give our H-1 Georgia

68

00:04:24.150  -->  00:04:28.520
just like that refresh.

69

00:04:28.860  -->  00:04:33.100
And you can see it changes font so don't despair if you're a designer.

70

00:04:33.120  -->  00:04:36.810
We're going to see how to use a lot more fonts and how to include custom ones.

71

00:04:37.110  -->  00:04:42.390
But for now we're just going to focus on the built in system default fonts which are a little bit limited

72

00:04:42.410  -->  00:04:42.500
.

73

00:04:42.600  -->  00:04:48.780
And even then there's no guarantee as you can see there's not any that 100 percent of machines have

74

00:04:51.570  -->  00:04:57.370
so the next property I want to talk about is font size so font size does sort of sounds like it controls

75

00:04:57.490  -->  00:05:00.990
how big the font is or how small the font is of a given element.

76

00:05:01.240  -->  00:05:07.230
So we can select something and let's do it to our H-1 and let's make each one a lot bigger.

77

00:05:07.590  -->  00:05:12.460
So we do font size and there are different units that we can use.

78

00:05:12.450  -->  00:05:18.170
And the first one is called pixels or peaks and we've seen it a little bit before with Forder.

79

00:05:18.330  -->  00:05:25.770
So we're going to just give it something huge like 200 pics and if we go back to the browser you can

80

00:05:25.770  -->  00:05:31.740
see if we get this gigantic fun 200 pixels what we can do just in case.

81

00:05:31.750  -->  00:05:35.640
If you want to play around with font sizes you're not sure how big you want this to be.

82

00:05:35.680  -->  00:05:36.610
We can inspect it

83

00:05:40.410  -->  00:05:46.470
and then we can go over here and we can click on this and we can change this number so we can change

84

00:05:46.470  -->  00:05:55.190
it to 100 or 60 or 85 or whatever we want and we can play around in the browser and just see it the

85

00:05:55.200  -->  00:05:57.010
change reflected immediately.

86

00:05:57.270  -->  00:06:01.570
So that's a really nice feature when you're playing around with font sizes.

87

00:06:01.560  -->  00:06:06.310
So as I mentioned though this is not the only way of picking a font size.

88

00:06:06.450  -->  00:06:07.650
It's not the only unit.

89

00:06:07.900  -->  00:06:15.730
There's another popular unit called IEMs and E-M is basically a relative font size.

90

00:06:15.840  -->  00:06:23.250
So I'm going to go ahead and open up the font size M.D and page and go to the E-M section and I'm going

91

00:06:23.250  -->  00:06:29.790
to read from here for just a moment the size of an E-M value is dynamic and E-M is equal to the size

92

00:06:29.790  -->  00:06:33.500
of the font that applies to the parent of the element in question.

93

00:06:33.880  -->  00:06:36.900
So what that really means is I'm going to show you a quick example.

94

00:06:37.320  -->  00:06:47.580
If I put Let's go inside of here under strip steak I'm going to put a span element in all that a span

95

00:06:47.580  -->  00:06:48.120
does.

96

00:06:48.120  -->  00:06:50.300
This is probably our first time seeing them.

97

00:06:50.380  -->  00:06:57.510
Is it just a way to group text together without actually making a difference visually so it's just a

98

00:06:57.510  -->  00:07:01.050
way to kind of make an element around the word strip steak.

99

00:07:01.050  -->  00:07:03.470
But if I refresh.

100

00:07:03.510  -->  00:07:04.710
Nothing changes at all.

101

00:07:04.750  -->  00:07:09.230
Well the search for the font size but nothing changes down here and where I have this span.

102

00:07:09.780  -->  00:07:13.540
So it's a way to highlight or to single out some line and then do something to it.

103

00:07:13.550  -->  00:07:15.620
And we're just going to make it a lot bigger.

104

00:07:16.020  -->  00:07:22.890
So we use an E-M or we use the E-M units and we're if we wanted to make this double the size of the

105

00:07:22.890  -->  00:07:26.380
font of this paragraph we just go into here.

106

00:07:26.520  -->  00:07:38.290
So let's span and then we just say font size 2.0 E-M and so that is going to be double the font size

107

00:07:38.460  -->  00:07:41.940
of the enclosing element of the parent element which is this paragraph.

108

00:07:41.940  -->  00:07:49.220
So you'll see that here if I refresh this span is double the font size of this.

109

00:07:49.240  -->  00:07:53.170
But we didn't actually explicitly tell it how many pixels to make it.

110

00:07:53.160  -->  00:07:56.430
It just knew how big this was and then it doubled it.

111

00:07:56.440  -->  00:08:02.430
So this is dynamic which is why a lot of people like it is that if for some reason I needed to change

112

00:08:02.440  -->  00:08:05.930
the font size of this this would automatically change.

113

00:08:06.190  -->  00:08:08.320
So let me show you another example.

114

00:08:08.460  -->  00:08:12.600
Let's increase the font size of paragraph's

115

00:08:16.800  -->  00:08:27.140
font size and let's make them 40 pixels and you can see that this still stays double.

116

00:08:27.150  -->  00:08:32.410
So then the one question about E-M that comes up a lot is what is the initial value of v and what is

117

00:08:32.400  -->  00:08:33.500
the top level.

118

00:08:33.580  -->  00:08:38.840
Because we can't just keep inheriting from a parent and that parent there has to be some source of truth

119

00:08:38.840  -->  00:08:38.860
.

120

00:08:38.860  -->  00:08:45.120
There has to be like at the very top level element that actually has a font size and that actually changes

121

00:08:45.660  -->  00:08:48.580
depending on the browser which is a little bit frustrating.

122

00:08:49.050  -->  00:08:55.480
But according to SDN it's usually about 16 pixels so that's no guarantee but it's usually around 16

123

00:08:55.480  -->  00:08:56.060
pixels.

124

00:08:56.160  -->  00:09:01.680
So what most people would do is set a font size on the body at the very beginning.

125

00:09:01.950  -->  00:09:07.960
So something like this body font size.

126

00:09:08.220  -->  00:09:16.860
And let's give it a let's do something really small to start like 10 pixels and then must change or

127

00:09:16.890  -->  00:09:23.560
each one so that it's five times larger than the body.

128

00:09:23.620  -->  00:09:30.330
So that's going to look like five porno E-M and then we go on our paragraph to be twice as large as

129

00:09:30.340  -->  00:09:31.090
the body.

130

00:09:31.120  -->  00:09:33.000
So 2.0 E-M.

131

00:09:33.180  -->  00:09:37.230
And then lastly we want our span to be twice as large as a paragraph.

132

00:09:37.360  -->  00:09:40.810
So that's also 2.0 because remember it's nested inside.

133

00:09:41.080  -->  00:09:46.710
So let's do some text outside of a paragraph just like that and you'll see it's pretty small.

134

00:09:47.010  -->  00:09:50.080
And then we made this five times larger than this.

135

00:09:50.160  -->  00:09:51.820
We made this twice as large.

136

00:09:52.000  -->  00:09:54.300
And this is twice as large as the paragraph
