Hi everyone you might have just noticed that the voice you're hearing is not close.

2

00:00:04,830  -->  00:00:06,460
So let me introduce myself.

3

00:00:06,540  -->  00:00:11,370
I'm Ali and I've worked with Colt for the past couple of years at a few coding tools in San Francisco

4

00:00:11,700  -->  00:00:17,550
and I'm really excited to teach you all some intermediate javascript in this video.

5

00:00:17,550  -->  00:00:20,160
We're going to be talking about the key word this.

6

00:00:20,250  -->  00:00:25,050
The key word this is a bit tricky to wrap your head around and learning intermediate javascript but

7

00:00:25,050  -->  00:00:30,390
it is the foundation for object oriented programming and other trickier concepts like call apply and

8

00:00:30,390  -->  00:00:34,640
bind which will cover in a later video to get started.

9

00:00:34,650  -->  00:00:37,800
We're going to try to understand what the key word this is.

10

00:00:38,040  -->  00:00:43,680
We're then going to analyze the four ways the key word this is determined so that we can always know

11

00:00:43,800  -->  00:00:46,020
what the value will be.

12

00:00:46,020  -->  00:00:51,210
Finally I'm going to try as hard as possible not to use the word this in a sentence.

13

00:00:51,210  -->  00:00:51,970
Here we go.

14

00:00:52,380  -->  00:00:54,550
So what is the key word this.

15

00:00:54,570  -->  00:01:01,140
First off it is a reserved keyword in javascript which means we can't set it as the value of any variable

16

00:01:01,140  -->  00:01:01,910
.

17

00:01:02,070  -->  00:01:06,910
More importantly the value of the keyword this is determined by how a function is called.

18

00:01:07,110  -->  00:01:10,170
We usually call this the function's execution context.

19

00:01:10,530  -->  00:01:16,230
But the most important thing about the keyword this is that if you understand the four rules of how

20

00:01:16,230  -->  00:01:24,060
the value of the keyword this can be determined global implicit explicit and new you will never have

21

00:01:24,060  -->  00:01:27,160
a problem with the keyword this.

22

00:01:27,240  -->  00:01:29,670
So let's get started with the most broad rule of them all.

23

00:01:29,670  -->  00:01:31,430
The global context.

24

00:01:31,580  -->  00:01:36,920
This rule applies when you see the keyword this outside of a declared object.

25

00:01:36,930  -->  00:01:38,590
What do I mean by declared object.

26

00:01:38,730  -->  00:01:39,960
Excellent question.

27

00:01:39,960  -->  00:01:46,280
What we mean here is that there has not been an object defined which contains the keyword this.

28

00:01:46,700  -->  00:01:48,390
You can also think of it as the keyword.

29

00:01:48,390  -->  00:01:52,700
This is in the wild when we see the keyword this in the global context.

30

00:01:52,920  -->  00:01:59,610
It's a value refers to the global object which in the browser is the window object.

31

00:01:59,640  -->  00:02:06,750
In fact every variable that you declare in the global scope is actually attached to the window object

32

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:07,170
.

33

00:02:07,170  -->  00:02:10,130
Let's see what that looks like.

34

00:02:10,350  -->  00:02:16,260
I'm going to make a variable called person and also that equal to alley.

35

00:02:17,040  -->  00:02:24,750
Now this variable person is actually attached to the window object which means the window person is

36

00:02:24,750  -->  00:02:29,950
actually the same exact thing as this person variable that I need.

37

00:02:30,180  -->  00:02:36,540
Now that we have an idea of what the window object is let's come back to the keyword this on the first

38

00:02:36,540  -->  00:02:37,920
line we see the key word.

39

00:02:37,920  -->  00:02:39,360
This is in the wild.

40

00:02:39,360  -->  00:02:41,620
It is not inside of any object.

41

00:02:41,790  -->  00:02:42,990
So what's its value.

42

00:02:43,230  -->  00:02:43,920
You guessed it.

43

00:02:44,040  -->  00:02:46,960
Or maybe you just saw in the comment It's the window.

44

00:02:47,070  -->  00:02:54,510
Simple enough when the keyword this is outside of an object its value is the global object which in

45

00:02:54,510  -->  00:02:58,150
the case of the browser is the window object.

46

00:02:58,170  -->  00:02:59,840
So what have we learned so far.

47

00:02:59,880  -->  00:03:05,190
The key word this is a reserved keyword that can be determined using one of four rules.

48

00:03:05,190  -->  00:03:11,550
We saw a bit of the first rule which stated that when the keyword this is not inside of a declared object

49

00:03:11,940  -->  00:03:15,810
its value is the global object in the next video.

50

00:03:15,840  -->  00:03:19,780
We're going to see what happens when the keyword this is inside of a function.

51

00:03:19,940  -->  00:03:20,480
So either
