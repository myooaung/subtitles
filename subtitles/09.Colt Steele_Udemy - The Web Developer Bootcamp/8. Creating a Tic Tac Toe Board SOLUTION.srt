1

00:00:00,760  -->  00:00:01,370
OK.

2

00:00:01,620  -->  00:00:05,960
So in this video we're going to recreate this tic tac toe board exercise from scratch.

3

00:00:06,060  -->  00:00:09,120
So we're going to start from the very beginning with an empty file.

4

00:00:09,130  -->  00:00:13,880
I Coppermine board that HVM l can add in our boiler plate.

5

00:00:14,460  -->  00:00:21,210
Just going to call it T T T board and the way that this works just to jog your memory.

6

00:00:21,420  -->  00:00:22,550
It's a table.

7

00:00:22,560  -->  00:00:23,950
This whole thing is a table.

8

00:00:24,000  -->  00:00:30,330
It has three rows one two and three and each row has three Tweedy's.

9

00:00:30,360  -->  00:00:32,270
So we end up with a three by three board.

10

00:00:32,430  -->  00:00:38,760
And then what we'll do is go in and on these three TVs we're going to turn left and right border on

11

00:00:39,390  -->  00:00:42,890
and then on these three we're going to turn the top and bottom border.

12

00:00:43,560  -->  00:00:48,020
So we need to start with our table and then three tiers.

13

00:00:48,810  -->  00:00:53,490
And I'm actually going to go and do three tiaras and do the t D's first.

14

00:00:53,520  -->  00:00:56,400
So we get three TVs and then just going to duplicate that

15

00:00:59,340  -->  00:01:01,450
once more.

16

00:01:01,590  -->  00:01:06,650
Now we have our three rows with three elements three TVs in each one.

17

00:01:06,720  -->  00:01:12,940
So we'll save that and if we open this in the browser you'll notice that we don't see a thing.

18

00:01:13,500  -->  00:01:18,600
And that's because even though our table is there there's first of all there's nothing in our table

19

00:01:18,600  -->  00:01:18,860
.

20

00:01:18,900  -->  00:01:23,910
And then also we don't have any styles applied because it is possible to have an empty table and still

21

00:01:23,910  -->  00:01:25,910
see things which is actually what this is here.

22

00:01:25,910  -->  00:01:27,950
There is no data in these tables.

23

00:01:28,080  -->  00:01:32,700
In this example here it's just a table and then it's styled.

24

00:01:32,700  -->  00:01:34,790
So that has a with it has a border.

25

00:01:34,980  -->  00:01:36,320
So we need to do that.

26

00:01:36,360  -->  00:01:42,120
So just to prove to you though that it's here let's add some style and I'm going to do it in a style

27

00:01:42,120  -->  00:01:45,210
tag this time which you should know by now.

28

00:01:45,360  -->  00:01:51,170
It's not a great idea in the long run but just for a solution video just for the ease of watching here

29

00:01:51,170  -->  00:01:55,960
so they don't have to watch me flip between files and get confused about what goes where I'm just going

30

00:01:55,970  -->  00:01:59,370
to do in one file here at the top in the style tag.

31

00:01:59,880  -->  00:02:09,540
So the first thing I'm going to do is just select the T's and give them a width and that's because right

32

00:02:09,540  -->  00:02:11,550
now if we inspected the TT's

33

00:02:19,380  -->  00:02:22,920
you would see that they are basically not there at all.

34

00:02:22,930  -->  00:02:24,830
They're two pixels by two pixels.

35

00:02:24,960  -->  00:02:28,720
So they're really really small and that's because there's nothing there and we haven't assigned to them

36

00:02:28,770  -->  00:02:30,680
a with or a height.

37

00:02:30,690  -->  00:02:36,570
So what I want to do is give them a width and we're going to start with 100 pixels and then we're going

38

00:02:36,570  -->  00:02:43,130
to do the same thing for height and we save and refresh and we still don't see anything.

39

00:02:43,500  -->  00:02:46,860
And again that's because we haven't given them anything to display.

40

00:02:47,010  -->  00:02:55,380
But if we go and inspect now we can see each Tedy is now a square a 100 by 100 pixels.

41

00:02:55,380  -->  00:02:59,160
So let's go and give them a background just so you can see that they're there.

42

00:02:59,310  -->  00:03:02,330
Say backgrounders pink save.

43

00:03:03,000  -->  00:03:05,970
And now we can see we have the beginnings of our board.

44

00:03:06,120  -->  00:03:08,360
So I'm actually going to undo that background color.

45

00:03:08,370  -->  00:03:11,400
I just wanted to show you that the tiles are there.

46

00:03:11,400  -->  00:03:12,630
We have our TVs.

47

00:03:12,930  -->  00:03:18,750
And now what we need to do is figure out how to selectively turn on the border.

48

00:03:18,930  -->  00:03:22,800
So we're going to start on these three elements.

49

00:03:22,800  -->  00:03:25,380
We want to turn on the left and the right border.

50

00:03:25,380  -->  00:03:26,990
So if I refresh the page.

51

00:03:27,140  -->  00:03:36,310
But let's start by taking this top one right here and giving it a left and a right quarter.

52

00:03:36,480  -->  00:03:40,990
So I'm going to go and that's the second TD instead of the first TR.

53

00:03:41,070  -->  00:03:47,250
I'm just going to give it a class and I'm just going to call this one vertical and I'm going to make

54

00:03:47,250  -->  00:03:52,120
a class for these three called vertical where we just get the left and right borders.

55

00:03:52,320  -->  00:03:53,820
So class equals vertical.

56

00:03:53,820  -->  00:04:00,240
And then over here we're going to select vertical and just give it a border left

57

00:04:04,560  -->  00:04:11,570
and let's do one pixel black for now and do the same thing for border.

58

00:04:11,570  -->  00:04:12,530
Right.

59

00:04:12,780  -->  00:04:18,280
And if we save and we are fresh you'll see we have the first square completed.

60

00:04:18,690  -->  00:04:23,520
So now we need to add the t d that's below it and the TV that's below that.

61

00:04:23,790  -->  00:04:29,020
And that's why I made it a class because we're going to use it more than once.

62

00:04:29,220  -->  00:04:34,800
So rather than making this an ID and then doing another ID for this element and another ID for this

63

00:04:34,800  -->  00:04:40,840
one which I totally could have done I could have done something like ID middle and then this one to

64

00:04:40,850  -->  00:04:45,730
be id middle bottom or something.

65

00:04:46,530  -->  00:04:49,570
Well I can have a space there but something like that.

66

00:04:49,680  -->  00:04:51,760
Thats actually not a great idea.

67

00:04:51,780  -->  00:04:57,120
We dont want to have multiple ID so Im just going to give it a class and then our class is vertical

68

00:04:57,120  -->  00:04:57,410
.

69

00:04:57,660  -->  00:05:01,350
So Im going to give it to this one as well.

70

00:05:01,560  -->  00:05:04,280
This is our middle element thats right below it.

71

00:05:04,440  -->  00:05:07,440
And then the other one which is below that.

72

00:05:07,440  -->  00:05:13,000
So those three now have class vertical and you can see we get our three vertical lines.

73

00:05:13,650  -->  00:05:17,770
So we now we just need to repeat the same process on the horizontal lines.

74

00:05:18,570  -->  00:05:20,740
And so we want this element here.

75

00:05:20,850  -->  00:05:26,250
This one here and this one here to have a border top and a border bottom.

76

00:05:26,670  -->  00:05:34,590
So this time I'm going to start with the class and we get a horizontal and underspin a copy this except

77

00:05:34,590  -->  00:05:43,080
change border left to border top and border bottom and then all we need to do is sign this horizontal

78

00:05:43,080  -->  00:05:45,270
class with the correct elements.

79

00:05:45,270  -->  00:05:52,260
So the ones that we want that to be on are this one right here so this is going to be the first T.T.

80

00:05:52,260  -->  00:05:54,500
in the second TR.

81

00:05:54,870  -->  00:05:56,100
So I'm just going to go ahead and do that.

82

00:05:56,100  -->  00:06:01,420
Class equals or is on TL and copy that.

83

00:06:01,440  -->  00:06:07,320
Then we want it in this middle one here and you'll see we already have a class vertical and we haven't

84

00:06:07,320  -->  00:06:09,910
actually seen this before where we have more than one class.

85

00:06:09,930  -->  00:06:10,910
It's really easy.

86

00:06:10,920  -->  00:06:13,880
All we do is add a space.

87

00:06:13,890  -->  00:06:16,350
So this is not one class called vertical horizontal.

88

00:06:16,350  -->  00:06:19,780
It is two vertical and also horizontal.

89

00:06:20,190  -->  00:06:27,030
And then we'll do the same thing to this last CD which would be this one here and if we save and we

90

00:06:27,030  -->  00:06:31,840
refresh the page we now have our completed tic tac toe board.

91

00:06:31,950  -->  00:06:36,930
So the very last thing that I want to do here is just move this over so that it's centered and it's

92

00:06:36,930  -->  00:06:38,800
actually really easy.

93

00:06:38,910  -->  00:06:42,460
It's just one line of success on our table.

94

00:06:42,720  -->  00:06:47,820
We're going to give it a margin of order and there we go.

95

00:06:47,850  -->  00:06:49,820
That margin is automatically computed.

96

00:06:49,830  -->  00:06:51,270
You can see as I scroll.

97

00:06:51,330  -->  00:06:57,140
I mean as I resize the window that margins increasing and decreasing and then one last thing if we wanted

98

00:06:57,150  -->  00:07:04,440
to add that each one in at the very top that just says tic tac toe

99

00:07:07,620  -->  00:07:08,520
can do that.

100

00:07:08,550  -->  00:07:12,690
But you'll notice that this element Phi inspected.

101

00:07:13,200  -->  00:07:16,480
Well you can see without even inspecting it that it's all the way over on the side.

102

00:07:16,650  -->  00:07:22,900
So if I wanted to go in the middle the element actually takes up all the way across the screen.

103

00:07:23,150  -->  00:07:24,620
You can see this blue here.

104

00:07:24,870  -->  00:07:31,710
So I can just Center the text and that will give us the effect that the H-1 is actually in the middle

105

00:07:31,710  -->  00:07:31,980
.

106

00:07:31,980  -->  00:07:40,720
So I just it H-1 text align center and I save.

107

00:07:41,130  -->  00:07:43,230
And there we go we've got a tic tac toe board
