00:00:01.050  -->  00:00:01.500
OK.

2

00:00:01.740  -->  00:00:06.600
So in this lesson we're going to discuss a lot of the different ways of describing and representing

3

00:00:06.750  -->  00:00:14.040
colors in C Ss and up until now if we go to the assess that we've been writing We've just been using

4

00:00:14.040  -->  00:00:20.520
simple elementary school colors like red and green and purple and obviously those work OK but they're

5

00:00:20.520  -->  00:00:22.880
not particularly nice shades not nice colors.

6

00:00:22.890  -->  00:00:28.440
In my opinion and you'd probably never use them because most designers and most people making websites

7

00:00:28.770  -->  00:00:30.900
have a very specific color palette.

8

00:00:31.320  -->  00:00:36.210
Whether it's something that you know is following the brand's color like a very specific shade of green

9

00:00:36.210  -->  00:00:39.070
for a brand or if it's a color palette.

10

00:00:39.250  -->  00:00:45.300
I'm a designer or someone has created almost nobody uses just the plain default red or green or purple

11

00:00:45.300  -->  00:00:46.760
.

12

00:00:47.130  -->  00:00:52.670
With that said there are quite a few built in colors and CSSA that have names.

13

00:00:52.980  -->  00:00:55.380
And in fact there's probably more than you would think.

14

00:00:55.500  -->  00:00:59.370
And there are way more than most people ever remember.

15

00:00:59.370  -->  00:01:06.710
So there's things like cornflower blue or dark orchid and there's I think 147 different colors.

16

00:01:06.870  -->  00:01:10.530
And this site here which I've actually really never used.

17

00:01:10.540  -->  00:01:15.350
I just want to show it to you it's a way to visualize all the different named colors and see assess

18

00:01:15.350  -->  00:01:15.800
.

19

00:01:16.080  -->  00:01:22.980
And of course the problem with using these is still it's only 147 colors and you might want a color

20

00:01:22.980  -->  00:01:29.070
that just like this gold color but slightly lighter or slightly darker or slightly redder and there's

21

00:01:29.070  -->  00:01:31.500
not going to be a perfect option for you.

22

00:01:31.500  -->  00:01:36.310
And then the other problem is that it's just hard to remember these names like light slate gray.

23

00:01:36.360  -->  00:01:37.750
Nobody remembers that.

24

00:01:37.770  -->  00:01:44.910
So I really only use named colors like red orange purple just for very quick debugging purposes to make

25

00:01:44.910  -->  00:01:45.940
sure something's working.

26

00:01:45.960  -->  00:01:48.410
I'll just turn it red and see if that works.

27

00:01:48.540  -->  00:01:54.080
And also just for educational purposes but most people would never use these colors.

28

00:01:54.730  -->  00:01:58.940
So CSS provides a few different color systems that we can work with.

29

00:01:59.280  -->  00:02:03.410
And these are color systems by the way that exist outside of the SS.

30

00:02:03.540  -->  00:02:10.320
So if you have some familiarity with photography or printing and you've worked with colors before you

31

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:11.790
may have encountered some of these.

32

00:02:12.120  -->  00:02:17.700
So the first one is something called hexadecimal and before we talk about why it's called hexadecimal

33

00:02:17.910  -->  00:02:21.970
and what that means let's just take a look at a few examples.

34

00:02:21.990  -->  00:02:28.650
So over here the first thing we're doing is selecting all H-1 and changing their text color to be black

35

00:02:28.650  -->  00:02:29.740
.

36

00:02:30.030  -->  00:02:34.860
The next thing we're doing is selecting all the tattoos changing the color to be a shade of purple and

37

00:02:34.860  -->  00:02:39.550
then selecting all age threes and teaching them to be a shade of pink.

38

00:02:39.600  -->  00:02:46.150
So what you'll notice is that rather than having a word like red or purple We now have this hash symbol

39

00:02:46.220  -->  00:02:50.710
and it's technically called an octave Thorpe followed by six digits.

40

00:02:51.270  -->  00:02:56.100
So to get black it's six zeros to get purple.

41

00:02:56.160  -->  00:02:59.690
You'll notice it's numbers but there's also a letter B in there.

42

00:02:59.940  -->  00:03:07.000
And lastly to get this pinkish color it's again numbers and letters this time letter F..

43

00:03:07.020  -->  00:03:09.200
So what's happening here.

44

00:03:09.390  -->  00:03:12.300
I'm going to go ahead and open up some notes that I have.

45

00:03:12.630  -->  00:03:18.120
And we're going to do a really short math lesson is this more just for something I think is interesting

46

00:03:18.120  -->  00:03:23.620
but it's also informative and will help understand how hexadecimal works.

47

00:03:23.640  -->  00:03:28.410
So if you go back to middle school when I was in school at least we talked a lot about the decimal system

48

00:03:28.890  -->  00:03:35.080
and how let's suppose I wanted to create a three digit number.

49

00:03:35.310  -->  00:03:39.660
We have our once place the 10th place in the hundreds place.

50

00:03:39.690  -->  00:03:45.660
So if I wanted a number the largest three digit number I can create is nine hundred ninety nine the

51

00:03:45.660  -->  00:03:52.710
smallest three digit number technically is 111 or 0 0 or 1.

52

00:03:53.190  -->  00:04:01.500
But the idea is that each place in our regular base 10 which is what this means base 10 decimal number

53

00:04:01.500  -->  00:04:07.560
system I have 10 choices for every slot I can do 0 through 9.

54

00:04:07.980  -->  00:04:14.950
So that's base 10 that's what we're used to working with our digits are 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

55

00:04:15.390  -->  00:04:17.630
But there are other number systems.

56

00:04:17.790  -->  00:04:21.940
So you may have heard of binary before and that's based two.

57

00:04:21.960  -->  00:04:25.360
And so that means we only have 0 and 1 as our options.

58

00:04:25.770  -->  00:04:32.690
So if I wanted to build a three digit binary number the largest one I can build is 1 1 1.

59

00:04:32.700  -->  00:04:35.560
That is not the same as one hundred and eleven.

60

00:04:35.580  -->  00:04:42.350
So this is not really the time to really go over how binary works but you may see things like this in

61

00:04:42.370  -->  00:04:46.960
like CSI shows or any sort of show where they're trying to show you what hacking looks like and they're

62

00:04:46.960  -->  00:04:48.310
totally wrong.

63

00:04:48.490  -->  00:04:53.230
But it is true that binary is a really really important part of how computers work.

64

00:04:53.470  -->  00:04:54.850
So that's based too.

65

00:04:54.910  -->  00:04:57.030
So we just have two choices zero or one.

66

00:04:57.370  -->  00:04:59.850
So hexadecimal is base 16.

67

00:05:00.340  -->  00:05:07.300
So that means that we have 16 choices and those choices go from zero to nine and then rather than going

68

00:05:07.300  -->  00:05:10.480
to 10 11 12 13 14 15.

69

00:05:10.810  -->  00:05:17.380
Those are two digit number two digit numbers which is problematic X more and that includes letters.

70

00:05:17.380  -->  00:05:22.070
So we have 0 through 9 and then ABC DCF.

71

00:05:22.270  -->  00:05:33.090
So the largest hexadecimal number three digit number would be F F F and the smallest 0 0 0.

72

00:05:33.910  -->  00:05:37.500
So it's just like any other number system except we have 16 choices.

73

00:05:37.690  -->  00:05:45.520
And the reason that hexadecimal is used rather than using just decimal to name a color is that it gives

74

00:05:45.520  -->  00:05:50.610
us a lot more choices while keeping the names of recolors relatively short.

75

00:05:50.920  -->  00:05:55.370
So basically has hexadecimal is just taking colors and giving them numeric names.

76

00:05:55.390  -->  00:05:59.200
And if we use base 10 we only have 10 choices per digit.

77

00:05:59.200  -->  00:06:05.410
So we need to use more digits if we use binary and we'd need to use a ton of digits to represent colors

78

00:06:05.430  -->  00:06:05.760
.

79

00:06:05.770  -->  00:06:07.870
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of digits.

80

00:06:07.930  -->  00:06:12.820
So hexadecimal numbers are six digits long start's than Octa Thorpe.

81

00:06:13.030  -->  00:06:18.590
And then one digit two three four five six.

82

00:06:18.730  -->  00:06:22.010
And the way that it works it's not just random numbers.

83

00:06:22.240  -->  00:06:24.590
There's actually a little bit of a system.

84

00:06:24.640  -->  00:06:31.600
So the first two numbers correspond to how much red is in the color the next to correspond to how much

85

00:06:31.600  -->  00:06:36.220
green and in the last two correspond to how much blue is in the color.

86

00:06:36.760  -->  00:06:40.300
So I'm going to go ahead and switch over to our See assess and show you what I mean.

87

00:06:40.810  -->  00:06:43.510
So let's just work with our H-1 here.

88

00:06:43.600  -->  00:06:46.880
We have three H ones and must style them.

89

00:06:47.050  -->  00:06:51.790
So to use hexadecimal all we do is taper Octa Thorpe and then six digits.

90

00:06:52.180  -->  00:06:58.090
So let's start by defining a red color and remember the first two are red.

91

00:06:58.090  -->  00:07:04.370
So our first two digits if we wanted full red would be f f because that's the highest number.

92

00:07:04.990  -->  00:07:07.630
And then everything else can be zero.

93

00:07:07.630  -->  00:07:10.370
So this is going to save turn red all the way up.

94

00:07:10.660  -->  00:07:12.050
No green and no blue.

95

00:07:12.280  -->  00:07:13.270
And if we do that.

96

00:07:13.570  -->  00:07:19.810
Let's go ahead and open up our file you'll see that are h ones are bright red.

97

00:07:19.870  -->  00:07:26.400
So let's go back and let's play with this a little bit and now to introduce a little bit of green.

98

00:07:26.860  -->  00:07:35.030
So let's give it eight and you'll see we get this slight orange and you might be wondering how is green

99

00:07:35.260  -->  00:07:36.280
red orange.

100

00:07:36.520  -->  00:07:42.700
And the answer is that this is not the same color system that you're used to be mixing paints for instance

101

00:07:43.930  -->  00:07:46.000
RG B works slightly different.

102

00:07:46.150  -->  00:07:48.190
And again that's something for another video.

103

00:07:48.220  -->  00:07:57.820
But essentially if we added up red green and blue all the way up so full red full green and full blue

104

00:07:59.530  -->  00:08:03.160
the resulting color is not like a brown or black like you might expect.

105

00:08:03.160  -->  00:08:07.350
It's actually white and this is actually how light works in the real world.

106

00:08:07.420  -->  00:08:12.430
If you could take to leave the lights or three LCD lights a red green and blue and combine them and

107

00:08:12.430  -->  00:08:13.740
shine them together.

108

00:08:13.810  -->  00:08:15.560
You would actually get white light.

109

00:08:15.790  -->  00:08:17.690
So that's how this color works.

110

00:08:18.060  -->  00:08:18.310
OK.

111

00:08:18.310  -->  00:08:23.380
So most of the time you're actually not coming up with these colors from scratch.

112

00:08:23.380  -->  00:08:24.410
So it's not really.

113

00:08:24.520  -->  00:08:29.890
I mean it's a nice skill but you don't have to be able to identify this color

114

00:08:33.370  -->  00:08:38.980
as some sort of you know shade of purple or green or whatever it is that's not really the scope what

115

00:08:38.980  -->  00:08:42.750
you most often will do is have a color picker.

116

00:08:43.350  -->  00:08:46.670
And so let's say I want like a dark purple shade.

117

00:08:46.750  -->  00:08:48.160
There's all sorts of color pictures.

118

00:08:48.190  -->  00:08:53.110
There's some that are on your machine depending on if you have a Mac or PC you can download one.

119

00:08:53.110  -->  00:08:59.770
Some of them are included but we can also just go online and if I want like a dark purple shade I can

120

00:08:59.770  -->  00:09:01.400
just find this purple.

121

00:09:02.290  -->  00:09:03.160
Let's say

122

00:09:06.220  -->  00:09:07.300
this color here.

123

00:09:07.840  -->  00:09:10.160
And then I can just copy.

124

00:09:10.230  -->  00:09:12.080
I think that copied it.

125

00:09:12.140  -->  00:09:14.050
No you just copy.

126

00:09:14.160  -->  00:09:17.950
There it is this color

127

00:09:21.320  -->  00:09:24.900
and use that refresh and we get a dark purple.

128

00:09:24.980  -->  00:09:28.090
So this is most often what you'll do you'll have a color picker.

129

00:09:28.340  -->  00:09:32.390
Initially you'll pick your colors and then you just refer back to them.

130

00:09:32.390  -->  00:09:33.870
So it's not the most intuitive.

131

00:09:34.010  -->  00:09:42.770
It is nicer if it said something like dark eggplant but then of course that's not going to be as precise

132

00:09:42.770  -->  00:09:42.920
.

133

00:09:42.920  -->  00:09:44.540
That is just one shade of dark purple.

134

00:09:44.540  -->  00:09:47.070
And if I want to change it I'm out of luck.

135

00:09:47.120  -->  00:09:50.420
So that's hexadecimal.

136

00:09:50.420  -->  00:09:57.410
The next color system we're going to talk about is R.G. b so RGV works very similarly except the syntax

137

00:09:57.410  -->  00:09:58.910
is slightly different.

138

00:09:58.910  -->  00:10:02.600
So R.G. B there are three channels just like with hexadecimal.

139

00:10:02.630  -->  00:10:04.620
There's red green and blue.

140

00:10:05.120  -->  00:10:08.380
And what's different is that RGV is still in base 10.

141

00:10:08.810  -->  00:10:17.540
So what we do we have three different channels red green blue and the syntax is color colon and then

142

00:10:17.600  -->  00:10:24.110
the word are the letters R.G. B parentheses and then the value of our read the value of our green and

143

00:10:24.110  -->  00:10:25.360
the value of our blue.

144

00:10:25.640  -->  00:10:29.340
And those range from zero to 255.

145

00:10:29.900  -->  00:10:39.350
So in this case we're saying all age ones are R.G. be where Red is zero green is all the way up in blue

146

00:10:39.350  -->  00:10:40.170
is zero.

147

00:10:40.670  -->  00:10:49.070
And we get this bright green and this one we're setting all age twos to be R.G. be where Red is about

148

00:10:49.070  -->  00:10:50.150
halfway up.

149

00:10:50.300  -->  00:10:52.100
Green is completely gone.

150

00:10:52.340  -->  00:10:57.920
And Blue is about halfway up and we get a nice purple and then this one we're setting all age threes

151

00:10:58.370  -->  00:11:04.140
to be mainly blue with a little green and even less red and we get this shade of blue.

152

00:11:04.700  -->  00:11:07.420
So let's do a few examples.

153

00:11:08.960  -->  00:11:13.720
Let's go for a let's do a purple again.

154

00:11:13.820  -->  00:11:19.480
So we just text the word our G-B parentheses and then we need our channels.

155

00:11:19.640  -->  00:11:27.180
So the first one if we want a purple or want some red let's do 60.

156

00:11:27.200  -->  00:11:28.800
I don't know 68 red.

157

00:11:29.360  -->  00:11:37.580
Zero green and this will be a blue or purple then than a red or purple so we'll do a hundred blue and

158

00:11:37.580  -->  00:11:39.840
we save it.

159

00:11:41.660  -->  00:11:45.560
And of course it doesn't look like much of a change but it did change slightly.

160

00:11:45.560  -->  00:11:53.920
So let's go ahead and now turn up the read quite a bit 240 and you can see we get a pinkish purple.

161

00:11:54.500  -->  00:11:55.820
And if I introduce some green

162

00:11:59.800  -->  00:12:01.700
and if I turn everything all the way up

163

00:12:05.930  -->  00:12:13.900
just like before with hexadecimal full red green and blue actually gives us white and to get black.

164

00:12:13.900  -->  00:12:18.080
You want zero for all three channels.

165

00:12:18.080  -->  00:12:20.690
So our B is very similar to the decimal.

166

00:12:20.750  -->  00:12:22.660
The only difference is the syntax.

167

00:12:22.940  -->  00:12:34.660
So rather than writing out something like this where we have two channels or two digits for red to for

168

00:12:34.670  -->  00:12:43.040
green and two for blue instead we have three slots and we just go from zero to 255.

169

00:12:43.040  -->  00:12:49.880
So just another syntax and one other syntax I want to talk about is our GPA.

170

00:12:50.270  -->  00:12:56.150
So R-GA works just like R.G. B except there's one small twist which is there's a fourth channel called

171

00:12:56.210  -->  00:12:59.100
Alpha which is how you can make colors transparent.

172

00:12:59.270  -->  00:13:05.950
So R.G. V-A is great if you want to have one color that you are making more or less transparent.

173

00:13:06.230  -->  00:13:12.410
So the way that it works it's the same exact syntax except we write R.G. be a and then we have four

174

00:13:12.410  -->  00:13:13.830
channels that we need to fill out.

175

00:13:14.150  -->  00:13:16.560
And the first three just like before.

176

00:13:16.580  -->  00:13:23.900
They range from zero to 255 but the last chant on the alpha channel ranges from zero to 1.

177

00:13:24.470  -->  00:13:26.370
So I'll give you a few examples here.

178

00:13:26.540  -->  00:13:33.650
Here we're setting all three to be the exact same color as far as the RG and B channels are concerned

179

00:13:33.660  -->  00:13:33.800
.

180

00:13:33.920  -->  00:13:35.080
So 11 red.

181

00:13:35.170  -->  00:13:37.850
Ninety nine green 950 blue.

182

00:13:38.480  -->  00:13:42.840
And then the fourth channel we're changing the alpha or changing the transparency.

183

00:13:42.860  -->  00:13:47.950
So with four Alpha with all everything all up no transparency at all.

184

00:13:48.050  -->  00:13:49.810
We end up with this flu.

185

00:13:50.480  -->  00:13:56.340
When we said Alpha to be point six we get this much lighter and and more transparent blue.

186

00:13:56.690  -->  00:14:01.640
And then we set it to be Point two we get this which is barely there.

187

00:14:01.880  -->  00:14:09.300
So let's do another example let's do Archie B-A and this time let's do a green.

188

00:14:09.440  -->  00:14:17.420
So 200 or so green and a little bit of blue and then we need our alpha and let's just start with one

189

00:14:17.690  -->  00:14:18.860
.

190

00:14:18.860  -->  00:14:23.080
Refresh the page and we get this green.

191

00:14:23.180  -->  00:14:30.830
So now let's do the same thing but make it slightly paler So let's do point eight.

192

00:14:30.960  -->  00:14:34.330
I'm going to refresh and you can see it got a little bit paler.

193

00:14:34.460  -->  00:14:41.810
Now let's be more drastic down 2.2 and you can see it gets a lot more transparent.

194

00:14:42.920  -->  00:14:47.480
So to summarize we have the built in colors which most people don't use.

195

00:14:47.690  -->  00:14:49.460
We have hexadecimal.

196

00:14:49.460  -->  00:14:50.900
We have R.G. B then.

197

00:14:50.900  -->  00:14:53.960
RG B.A where the A stand for Alpha
