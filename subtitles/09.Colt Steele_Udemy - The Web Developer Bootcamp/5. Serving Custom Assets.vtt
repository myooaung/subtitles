00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:06.390
Up until this point our express reps have sent back completely unstaged h t m l no javascript included

2

00:00:06.390  -->  00:00:08.740
no C Ss just pure h t m l.

3

00:00:08.830  -->  00:00:14.160
In this video I'm going to show you how we can start to include assets like a stylesheet or some Javascript

4

00:00:14.160  -->  00:00:14.730
.

5

00:00:14.730  -->  00:00:19.650
And I'm also going to show you how we can dry up our templates using what are known as Parshall's.

6

00:00:19.650  -->  00:00:20.730
So let's get started.

7

00:00:20.740  -->  00:00:24.530
I'm using the same app that I've been using for the past two videos where we have our app.

8

00:00:24.630  -->  00:00:26.920
Yes and we have three main routes.

9

00:00:27.060  -->  00:00:34.380
We have the route route which renders the home that Ejay as template that has an H1 and the adorable

10

00:00:34.380  -->  00:00:40.140
image of the Palm C and then we also have the fall in love with Slash thing.

11

00:00:40.170  -->  00:00:46.890
The variable thing route which will then render the love toward each template and it will display you

12

00:00:46.890  -->  00:00:49.540
fell in love with and then whatever we wrote in the route.

13

00:00:49.770  -->  00:00:55.800
And then if statement and then a little paragraph at the bottom and then we also have the slash posts

14

00:00:55.800  -->  00:01:00.230
route that renders the posts E.J. as template and inside of that.

15

00:01:00.330  -->  00:01:01.740
We have two loops.

16

00:01:01.950  -->  00:01:04.290
Now let's say that we want to include some styles.

17

00:01:04.560  -->  00:01:07.250
So as you know by now I like the color purple.

18

00:01:07.380  -->  00:01:13.410
Let's say I wanted to make all of the bodies purple all the text color on all the different templates

19

00:01:13.500  -->  00:01:14.760
should be purple.

20

00:01:14.760  -->  00:01:22.950
Let's start with the Post page and what I could do is include a style tag so that style opening and

21

00:01:22.950  -->  00:01:30.990
closing and then I can write my style in here body and will do color purple just like that and save

22

00:01:30.990  -->  00:01:31.230
.

23

00:01:31.440  -->  00:01:36.390
And remember that this isn't really the ideal way of including styles and I'm showing it to you first

24

00:01:36.390  -->  00:01:41.220
for a reason because we're going to refactor it and improve it in just a moment but let's just make

25

00:01:41.220  -->  00:01:41.970
sure it works.

26

00:01:41.970  -->  00:01:43.880
So color purple on the body.

27

00:01:44.010  -->  00:01:46.920
Let's start the server node app.

28

00:01:47.010  -->  00:01:55.150
Yes let's go over to the browser and refresh on the Post's page and you can see we get purple.

29

00:01:55.830  -->  00:01:59.210
And if I went to another route I don't get purple.

30

00:01:59.360  -->  00:02:04.650
And that's because they're totally separate templates and we only added the style tag to the post template

31

00:02:04.680  -->  00:02:04.900
.

32

00:02:05.340  -->  00:02:11.820
So if I want everything to be purple on all three templates I could add in another style tag in home

33

00:02:11.820  -->  00:02:15.710
that Ejay us and the same style tag on love.

34

00:02:15.900  -->  00:02:25.500
Yes and save restarting the server refresh my page and I get a purple H-1 here and if I go to fall in

35

00:02:25.500  -->  00:02:30.040
love with Rusty I also get purple text here from that style tag.

36

00:02:30.090  -->  00:02:32.320
There are two main issues facing us here.

37

00:02:32.340  -->  00:02:36.810
One is the issue that this code is being repeated three different times.

38

00:02:36.810  -->  00:02:41.640
If you want identical styles on three different templates there has to be a better way to accomplish

39

00:02:41.640  -->  00:02:42.020
that.

40

00:02:42.060  -->  00:02:42.710
And there is.

41

00:02:42.810  -->  00:02:44.560
And we're going to address that second.

42

00:02:44.610  -->  00:02:49.330
We're going to start by addressing this issue of using the style tag which is not a good idea.

43

00:02:49.500  -->  00:02:56.130
What we want to do instead is use an external style sheet and linked to that style sheet using the link

44

00:02:56.130  -->  00:02:56.900
tag.

45

00:02:57.330  -->  00:03:02.010
So I'm going to write that link tag first which won't work because we don't have a style sheet yet but

46

00:03:02.010  -->  00:03:03.150
we'll create that second.

47

00:03:03.340  -->  00:03:08.990
So link and we need to provide raÃºl equal style sheet and then.

48

00:03:09.090  -->  00:03:14.300
And this needs to be the name of our style sheet and we'll just call it Dot.

49

00:03:14.340  -->  00:03:20.580
SS Okay so this is only on the Post's E.J. as template will save now.

50

00:03:20.700  -->  00:03:22.390
And let's go create that apt.

51

00:03:22.430  -->  00:03:28.860
C Ss except rather than creating it in the same directory as are apt J Yes we're actually going to make

52

00:03:28.860  -->  00:03:34.010
another directory where we'll put all of our style sheets all the javascript's that we write and then

53

00:03:34.010  -->  00:03:38.400
any other assets that we want are available and we're going to call it public and they can be named

54

00:03:38.430  -->  00:03:42.340
anything but public is a very common and conventional name for this directory.

55

00:03:42.430  -->  00:03:43.660
Well make sure when the right place.

56

00:03:43.800  -->  00:03:53.280
And then make directory public and will also create inside a public public slash app that see assess

57

00:03:53.400  -->  00:03:59.220
which is the name of our file here and save and you might be thinking OK wait a minute shouldn't this

58

00:03:59.220  -->  00:04:01.060
be public.

59

00:04:01.180  -->  00:04:02.720
Slash assess.

60

00:04:03.180  -->  00:04:04.940
And unfortunately the answer is no.

61

00:04:05.010  -->  00:04:10.500
We will leave it as apt upsy SS will tell express that our style sheets and javascript's are inside

62

00:04:10.500  -->  00:04:15.840
of the public directory and it will serve the public directory up for us so that we can link to things

63

00:04:15.960  -->  00:04:19.250
by just using the file names so I'll show you that in just a moment.

64

00:04:19.500  -->  00:04:26.370
Let's open up the public slash app that see SS file and add in some styles.

65

00:04:26.600  -->  00:04:27.920
Let's do something different.

66

00:04:28.020  -->  00:04:30.290
Will do body or background.

67

00:04:30.510  -->  00:04:31.290
It's going to be hideous.

68

00:04:31.290  -->  00:04:35.540
We will do background us yellow and color still purple.

69

00:04:35.900  -->  00:04:41.130
OK so now we have a really gross style she defined we can close out of here and we'll know if it's working

70

00:04:41.150  -->  00:04:41.290
.

71

00:04:41.400  -->  00:04:47.430
If this post E.J. as template shows up with a hideous yellow background in purple text it's not going

72

00:04:47.430  -->  00:04:51.760
to work just yet but I'll show you just so that you see that for yourself.

73

00:04:51.780  -->  00:04:53.270
So Noad apt.

74

00:04:53.370  -->  00:05:01.250
J.S. and we go back and refresh the page and we need to go to the post page and we don't get anything

75

00:05:01.260  -->  00:05:01.470
.

76

00:05:01.600  -->  00:05:05.880
And if I open up the consul here I get an error that says failed to load research.

77

00:05:05.950  -->  00:05:11.040
The server responded the status of 404 and it couldn't find apparat success.

78

00:05:11.110  -->  00:05:13.040
And the reason for this is pretty straightforward.

79

00:05:13.180  -->  00:05:18.550
When you create a web app and we use Express to start a web server it doesn't just automatically serve

80

00:05:18.610  -->  00:05:22.610
every single file that it sees it doesn't know that we want to do that.

81

00:05:22.660  -->  00:05:25.360
And the default is to not serve anything at all.

82

00:05:25.360  -->  00:05:27.370
Aside from the views directory.

83

00:05:27.670  -->  00:05:33.940
So if we want anything else we need to tell express explicitly hey I need you to serve my public directory

84

00:05:34.120  -->  00:05:36.030
or whatever other directors we have.

85

00:05:36.250  -->  00:05:41.470
We need to tell express to do that and likely express provides an easy way for us to do that inside

86

00:05:41.470  -->  00:05:42.390
of our act.

87

00:05:42.430  -->  00:05:48.490
Yes up top I'm going to add an app to use and then in parentheses.

88

00:05:48.700  -->  00:05:50.290
EXPRESS Does static.

89

00:05:50.440  -->  00:05:54.950
And then in parentheses again the word public which is the name for our directory.

90

00:05:55.180  -->  00:05:59.530
And this will tell express to serve the content of the public directory.

91

00:05:59.530  -->  00:06:07.690
And now if I restart my server and refresh the page over here close the consulate we get our yellow

92

00:06:07.690  -->  00:06:13.840
background and our purple font and we don't get any errors in the council.

93

00:06:13.840  -->  00:06:18.910
And if you want to include those style sheets on other pages you would just go and copy this link tag

94

00:06:20.440  -->  00:06:22.250
and put it up top.

95

00:06:22.450  -->  00:06:26.560
And of course we could have multiple style sheets as well if we wanted to and we could just link to

96

00:06:26.560  -->  00:06:30.800
them by giving them different names and making sure they're both in the public directory.

97

00:06:30.910  -->  00:06:35.830
Before we move on to Parshall's want to take a moment to show you a really quick thing we can do to

98

00:06:35.830  -->  00:06:41.020
make your code a little bit shorter notice that we're typing home that each E.J. yes loved.

99

00:06:41.050  -->  00:06:43.180
E.J. has posted E.J..

100

00:06:43.180  -->  00:06:48.630
Yes this is really minor but we can actually tell express that we're going to use Ejay us ahead of time

101

00:06:49.000  -->  00:06:55.240
and we can leave these off and just write home and evolve and it will automatically expect the files

102

00:06:55.240  -->  00:06:56.840
to be Ejaz files.

103

00:06:57.040  -->  00:07:06.040
And to do that we use app data set view engine and then we pass the second argument as E.J. s just like

104

00:07:06.040  -->  00:07:06.670
that.

105

00:07:06.790  -->  00:07:13.440
And if we save restart the server it will now expect those files to be Ejaz files.

106

00:07:13.450  -->  00:07:14.470
And if we refresh.

107

00:07:14.470  -->  00:07:16.560
Nothing should change at all.

108

00:07:16.560  -->  00:07:17.510
It still works.

109

00:07:17.650  -->  00:07:21.240
And now we don't have to explicitly say that Ejay us.

110

00:07:21.310  -->  00:07:22.930
So that's a very minor change.

111

00:07:22.930  -->  00:07:26.920
The next thing I want to show you is a little more significant and it's going to help us dry up our

112

00:07:26.920  -->  00:07:27.650
template.

113

00:07:28.000  -->  00:07:29.730
Right now we have this style sheet.

114

00:07:29.740  -->  00:07:35.680
This link to the style sheet repeated in all the templates but there's also something much more significant

115

00:07:35.680  -->  00:07:39.570
that we're missing which is our entire time boiler plate.

116

00:07:39.860  -->  00:07:43.250
We're missing the duct tape here.

117

00:07:43.420  -->  00:07:49.960
Andrew missing are aged him old tags and all the regular boilerplate that we expect head and inside

118

00:07:49.960  -->  00:07:51.120
of the head.

119

00:07:51.310  -->  00:07:54.220
We need the title and we'll give our app the title.

120

00:07:54.220  -->  00:08:00.550
Call it demo app and then we need the body as well.

121

00:08:00.550  -->  00:08:08.200
And then inside the body we should be putting this content and then we need to do that exact same thing

122

00:08:08.590  -->  00:08:09.760
on all of the other files.

123

00:08:09.760  -->  00:08:15.160
And I'm not going to do that because it's a waste of time and there's an easier solution where we don't

124

00:08:15.160  -->  00:08:20.230
have to copy this code and put it on every single template just like we shouldn't have to copy this

125

00:08:20.230  -->  00:08:23.840
single link tag and put that on every single template as well.

126

00:08:23.950  -->  00:08:28.870
And the way that we get around that is by using what are called Parshall's and Parshall's are basically

127

00:08:28.870  -->  00:08:35.500
files templates that we can write that we can include in other templates will create a template that

128

00:08:35.500  -->  00:08:36.780
looks like this.

129

00:08:36.820  -->  00:08:41.080
So we'll have the upper half of our boiler plate everything in the head.

130

00:08:41.320  -->  00:08:46.030
This will almost always be the same on every single page that we create on a given site.

131

00:08:46.060  -->  00:08:47.970
Same style sheet the same title.

132

00:08:48.160  -->  00:08:50.590
So we'll just make this its own template.

133

00:08:51.130  -->  00:08:54.680
And then at the bottom we'll make this its own template here.

134

00:08:54.850  -->  00:09:00.790
And then in between the two will have our content that changes depending on what template we're on or

135

00:09:00.810  -->  00:09:02.220
depending on what page we're on.

136

00:09:02.470  -->  00:09:05.680
So what we'll do is basically turn this into its own template.

137

00:09:05.860  -->  00:09:11.740
Turn this into its own template and then we just use those templates we refer to them in each one of

138

00:09:11.740  -->  00:09:12.520
these files.

139

00:09:12.670  -->  00:09:19.930
So we would say something like And this isn't valid code but we would do something like include header

140

00:09:20.350  -->  00:09:27.330
template and then at the bottom would do the same thing except for the footer.

141

00:09:28.180  -->  00:09:33.130
So we need to create those templates or Parshall's and to do that we'll make a new directory instead

142

00:09:33.130  -->  00:09:37.110
of views and we'll call that directory Parshall's.

143

00:09:37.240  -->  00:09:42.830
So we'll do and make directory views slash Parshall's just like that.

144

00:09:42.970  -->  00:09:49.750
And then instead of Parshall's we're going to make two files and the first one will be use slash Parshall's

145

00:09:50.200  -->  00:09:59.060
slash hetter that each us and then we'll make another partial exact same except footer and you could

146

00:09:59.060  -->  00:10:05.330
also call these like top and bottom Ejaz first and second whatever you want to call them but header

147

00:10:05.330  -->  00:10:07.530
and footer is definitely the standard name.

148

00:10:07.700  -->  00:10:13.640
So I'll make those two files and then I'll open them up and this time on the school over here and open

149

00:10:13.640  -->  00:10:21.770
up the header and I'm going to copy in this boilerplate just cut it out and put this over here instead

150

00:10:21.770  -->  00:10:22.330
of header.

151

00:10:22.430  -->  00:10:28.280
So this is what we want at the top of every page and then instead of footer all that we really want

152

00:10:28.880  -->  00:10:35.850
is the bottom of our template which is just the body and the closing team tag.

153

00:10:35.930  -->  00:10:36.810
Just like that.

154

00:10:36.970  -->  00:10:38.390
And if we wanted something else.

155

00:10:38.390  -->  00:10:40.670
So I'll do something a little more obvious.

156

00:10:40.790  -->  00:10:48.900
Let's just do a paragraph at the bottom that says something like trademark or some other footer text

157

00:10:48.920  -->  00:10:50.250
that we would see on a Web site.

158

00:10:50.270  -->  00:10:51.460
We'll just leave it at that.

159

00:10:51.530  -->  00:10:55.340
And so we expect to see this on every page where we include the footer.

160

00:10:55.370  -->  00:10:56.090
Partial.

161

00:10:56.310  -->  00:10:56.530
OK.

162

00:10:56.540  -->  00:10:58.010
So the two partials are done.

163

00:10:58.010  -->  00:10:59.400
Close those out.

164

00:10:59.570  -->  00:11:03.560
Fix this one just like this.

165

00:11:03.580  -->  00:11:05.110
All right save.

166

00:11:05.480  -->  00:11:07.660
And now we want to include the partials.

167

00:11:07.760  -->  00:11:09.200
So let's start with our love.

168

00:11:09.240  -->  00:11:12.500
Each of us and now we'll include that header partial.

169

00:11:12.500  -->  00:11:18.640
So we need to use a new bit of code in Ejay as tags erate include.

170

00:11:19.070  -->  00:11:23.680
And then the name of the file which is just hetter and we don't have to add that Ejay us because it

171

00:11:23.680  -->  00:11:25.620
is already looking for Ejaz files.

172

00:11:25.790  -->  00:11:30.620
So just include header and this actually won't work right away and I'll show you why.

173

00:11:30.680  -->  00:11:34.680
Let me put the footer one aswell in here.

174

00:11:35.510  -->  00:11:42.040
And if I start the server make sure I'll just clear some space here and then node.

175

00:11:42.140  -->  00:11:43.400
Apogee Yes.

176

00:11:43.550  -->  00:11:47.910
And if you refresh the page and this is only included on the love study J.S. template.

177

00:11:48.140  -->  00:11:50.450
So we need to go to slash.

178

00:11:50.450  -->  00:11:53.680
Fall in love with resti and we get an error.

179

00:11:53.780  -->  00:11:55.420
No such file or directory.

180

00:11:55.680  -->  00:11:58.420
Yes demo slash views slash hetter.

181

00:11:58.430  -->  00:11:59.310
E.J. Yes.

182

00:11:59.330  -->  00:12:00.750
So this tells us two things.

183

00:12:00.770  -->  00:12:03.430
One it knows it's supposed to be an Ejaz file.

184

00:12:03.470  -->  00:12:04.590
It's looking for a header.

185

00:12:04.700  -->  00:12:07.920
Yes but it's looking directly in the user directory.

186

00:12:08.000  -->  00:12:14.150
But we want it to look in views slash Parshall's slash heterodox Ejay us as you can see here views slash

187

00:12:14.150  -->  00:12:15.000
Parshall's.

188

00:12:15.110  -->  00:12:20.480
So we need to change our path here a little bit and we need to change it to say Parshall's slash Hetter

189

00:12:20.990  -->  00:12:23.660
and Parshall's slash footer.

190

00:12:23.660  -->  00:12:25.880
However that's still not going to fix it.

191

00:12:26.300  -->  00:12:31.790
And I'll show you one more time what happens when I start this up again and refresh the partial has

192

00:12:31.790  -->  00:12:33.010
been included just fine.

193

00:12:33.110  -->  00:12:39.100
And if we go to the elements you can see that we get the footer at the bottom and we have the body.

194

00:12:39.170  -->  00:12:43.100
And each time closing tags but the styles aren't being applied.

195

00:12:43.100  -->  00:12:46.670
It should be purple and yellow and it's just black and white.

196

00:12:46.670  -->  00:12:52.210
And if we look in the head we do have our link tag and it's linking to a file called apcupsd.

197

00:12:52.240  -->  00:12:53.940
SS But this isn't working.

198

00:12:54.140  -->  00:12:59.510
And if we look at the sources tab you'll see that we have this Rustie file that was sent back and it

199

00:12:59.510  -->  00:13:05.290
has our header and it has the main content and it also has the footer.

200

00:13:05.300  -->  00:13:10.550
So this is like the one assembled file because remember we send one thing back one response.

201

00:13:10.550  -->  00:13:15.500
So it makes this one file for us with our three Parshall's or two Parshall's Plus our content and it

202

00:13:15.500  -->  00:13:16.660
sends this back.

203

00:13:17.000  -->  00:13:20.710
And then there's also this ACT-UP see says that's totally empty.

204

00:13:20.870  -->  00:13:25.020
And what that means is that we've linked to our APS-C assessed incorrectly.

205

00:13:25.100  -->  00:13:30.530
So it's just appearing as an empty file and it's a really simple fix although we need to do is add a

206

00:13:30.530  -->  00:13:31.880
slash right here.

207

00:13:32.120  -->  00:13:36.920
I went through all that for a reason which is to show you the importance of paths and making sure that

208

00:13:36.920  -->  00:13:38.710
we have our paths set up correctly.

209

00:13:38.840  -->  00:13:45.170
So there's a difference between ACT-UP success and slash after the assess when we add the slash.

210

00:13:45.170  -->  00:13:51.050
It basically says look for us says not in the same directory that you're in right now but in the root

211

00:13:51.050  -->  00:13:51.930
directory.

212

00:13:51.990  -->  00:13:53.930
Let me show you a better illustration.

213

00:13:53.930  -->  00:14:00.270
Right now it's looking for success in the same directory as this Rusti template.

214

00:14:00.680  -->  00:14:08.550
Now if I go save it with the slash and restart the server they go back here and I refresh now.

215

00:14:09.290  -->  00:14:09.970
Take a look.

216

00:14:09.980  -->  00:14:10.970
Our styles work.

217

00:14:11.000  -->  00:14:17.090
Also notice we have the file with the h t m l and we have our apt the SS that is now outside of that

218

00:14:17.090  -->  00:14:21.890
directory it's not in the same folder and it has the correct styles which means that it found the file

219

00:14:21.890  -->  00:14:23.410
that we needed to find.

220

00:14:23.570  -->  00:14:27.360
So that slush seems like it's very minor but it's actually an important detail.

221

00:14:27.650  -->  00:14:31.940
So slash and then the name of our style sheet anything inside the public directory.

222

00:14:32.060  -->  00:14:38.570
So eventually it will look something like Slash stylesheets slash ACT-UP see assess and then we'll have

223

00:14:38.630  -->  00:14:46.370
a script tag where we have our source code to slash scripts slash maynt.

224

00:14:46.430  -->  00:14:46.990
Yes.

225

00:14:47.150  -->  00:14:52.720
And so we'll have inside the public directory scripts directory and stylesheets directory.

226

00:14:52.940  -->  00:14:56.760
For now though we only have one style sheet so we'll leave it like this.

227

00:14:57.440  -->  00:15:01.900
Let's quickly finish up and add in the partials to the other files as well.

228

00:15:02.330  -->  00:15:09.650
So in this one our home that each of us will pay set in and then at the bottom pasted in a swell and

229

00:15:09.650  -->  00:15:13.800
change it to be footer and save and then post it.

230

00:15:13.850  -->  00:15:14.410
Yes.

231

00:15:14.630  -->  00:15:15.520
Same thing.

232

00:15:15.920  -->  00:15:17.630
We want the header and footer.

233

00:15:17.680  -->  00:15:20.690
Get rid of that as well on all of the files.

234

00:15:20.900  -->  00:15:22.650
Parshall's slash footer.

235

00:15:23.270  -->  00:15:24.700
And that should be good for us.

236

00:15:24.710  -->  00:15:30.920
Let's refresh restart the server back here and this should look the same.

237

00:15:30.920  -->  00:15:39.440
Now if we go to the right path we also get our styles and if we go to slash posts we get the styles

238

00:15:39.440  -->  00:15:41.470
there as well.

239

00:15:41.480  -->  00:15:41.890
All right.

240

00:15:42.020  -->  00:15:43.550
So let's recap all of this.

241

00:15:43.610  -->  00:15:47.900
One of the first things that we did was create the public directory and add a style sheet inside of

242

00:15:47.900  -->  00:15:54.080
it and in order for that to work we had to make sure to tell express to serve the public directory.

243

00:15:54.380  -->  00:15:59.690
Then once we did that we made a small change which was to tell express that all of our templates will

244

00:15:59.690  -->  00:16:02.480
be yes unless otherwise noted.

245

00:16:02.540  -->  00:16:05.960
So we don't have to write each Yes after every template name.

246

00:16:06.410  -->  00:16:09.380
And then the big change that we made was introducing Parshall's.

247

00:16:09.530  -->  00:16:12.650
So we made a directory called Parshall's can be named anything.

248

00:16:12.650  -->  00:16:16.130
Some people call it layouts Parshall's is also very common.

249

00:16:16.130  -->  00:16:21.890
And then we had two files or header and footer and the whole point of this was just to help dry up our

250

00:16:21.890  -->  00:16:25.510
code so that we didn't have to add this to every single template.

251

00:16:25.880  -->  00:16:32.300
Instead we go to our template and all that we have to do is write include Parshall's slash hetter and

252

00:16:32.300  -->  00:16:37.610
we're not limited just to header and footer we might have one for the nav bar if we have a nav bar on

253

00:16:37.610  -->  00:16:38.750
every single page.

254

00:16:38.840  -->  00:16:42.880
We could have another partial that we include old Parshall's slash neph.

255

00:16:42.970  -->  00:16:45.300
So there aren't any rules on what we can and can't do.

256

00:16:45.410  -->  00:16:49.080
But most common are header and footer.

257

00:16:49.610  -->  00:16:50.520
All right so that's it
