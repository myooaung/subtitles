1

00:00:00,420  -->  00:00:01,690
Already Welcome back.

2

00:00:01,980  -->  00:00:03,600
So I have some very good news.

3

00:00:03,600  -->  00:00:08,130
It's finally time for us to take javascript and combine it with our H.M.S. assess.

4

00:00:08,250  -->  00:00:10,160
This is by far my favorite unit.

5

00:00:10,170  -->  00:00:13,800
My favorite topic to teach out everything that I've spent my life teaching.

6

00:00:13,860  -->  00:00:16,180
It's really where javascript starts to payoff.

7

00:00:16,200  -->  00:00:18,480
So we've been doing some simple apps up until this point.

8

00:00:18,540  -->  00:00:23,340
Simple to do list using alerts and prompts and I know it's not very exciting but that's all going to

9

00:00:23,340  -->  00:00:27,310
change now because we're about to really unleash the power of Javascript.

10

00:00:27,510  -->  00:00:31,830
And then this unit we're going to do things like make an interactive game we're going to make a real

11

00:00:31,830  -->  00:00:38,070
to do list with a real form with real buttons and checkboxes and Javascript behind it and animations

12

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:43,200
and all sorts of really interesting exciting things where you really feel like you made something not

13

00:00:43,200  -->  00:00:48,360
just a little command line or a little javascript console app but something real that you could share

14

00:00:48,360  -->  00:00:48,830
.

15

00:00:48,840  -->  00:00:55,410
So the way that we do all of this is through a technology called the DOM t o m it's that.

16

00:00:55,530  -->  00:01:00,210
So this lesson is going to serve as an introduction to the DOM going to talk about a few things in next

17

00:01:00,210  -->  00:01:01,090
few videos.

18

00:01:01,140  -->  00:01:05,450
I want to start by defining what the DOM is what those letters stand for.

19

00:01:05,460  -->  00:01:08,300
I want you to have a good understanding of why this is exciting.

20

00:01:08,310  -->  00:01:12,180
I'm going to show you some cool applications that other people have built using this stuff that we're

21

00:01:12,180  -->  00:01:17,000
going to learn then we're going to talk about what I call the select then manipulate workflow.

22

00:01:17,250  -->  00:01:19,230
So let's get started.

23

00:01:19,230  -->  00:01:20,910
So why should you care about all of this.

24

00:01:21,000  -->  00:01:22,550
Well there are so many reasons.

25

00:01:22,680  -->  00:01:29,550
Virtually every big web app out there right now things like Twitter and Facebook Instagram YouTube Gmail

26

00:01:29,790  -->  00:01:35,610
they all use a ton of javascript and most of that javascript is interacting with the dog interacting

27

00:01:35,610  -->  00:01:40,890
with each team out and the SS So we interact with the Dom to do things like games.

28

00:01:41,130  -->  00:01:46,740
We could make tic tac toe we could make a platform a game like Mario we can use it to do more practical

29

00:01:46,740  -->  00:01:50,780
things like drop down menus form validations.

30

00:01:50,980  -->  00:01:52,760
Thats how we make web pages interactive.

31

00:01:52,770  -->  00:01:54,470
Its how we can add animations.

32

00:01:54,600  -->  00:01:59,520
And the last one here really sums it up pretty much every awesome site ever although really just in

33

00:01:59,520  -->  00:02:04,710
the last few years uses a lot of javascript to manipulate the Dom as I mentioned earlier I am going

34

00:02:04,710  -->  00:02:09,270
to show you a few examples first before we start defining these terms talk about what the DOM is how

35

00:02:09,270  -->  00:02:10,040
it works.

36

00:02:10,080  -->  00:02:11,870
I want to show you a few web sites.

37

00:02:12,540  -->  00:02:17,370
So the first one is just google and I dont know how much you pay attention to this but when you start

38

00:02:17,370  -->  00:02:20,910
to search for something on Google like Halo.

39

00:02:21,000  -->  00:02:27,060
Notice how I get this thing that appears this is all its Timo this is some sort of div or something

40

00:02:27,060  -->  00:02:33,000
thats being hit in and shown and its changing as I type things like if I type hello kitty I get new

41

00:02:33,000  -->  00:02:34,020
results.

42

00:02:34,020  -->  00:02:38,190
Thats all done with javascript but this is the kind of thing that we're going to be able to do after

43

00:02:38,190  -->  00:02:39,080
a few videos.

44

00:02:39,120  -->  00:02:43,140
Of course we won't be able to write the backend that Google has but we'll be able to do the front end

45

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:43,770
stuff here.

46

00:02:43,770  -->  00:02:49,090
All of the HMO all the success all these effects that you see will easily be able to replicate.

47

00:02:49,110  -->  00:02:54,000
So the next thing that I want to highlight is on you Tomi's website there's this Brough's courses button

48

00:02:54,380  -->  00:02:59,280
and when I click on it I get the slide out menu that pushes everything over to the right and I have

49

00:02:59,280  -->  00:03:01,000
all these categories to pick from.

50

00:03:01,290  -->  00:03:06,400
And as a hover over a category you can see I get this sub menu that pops up.

51

00:03:06,660  -->  00:03:11,140
So that's all them javascript things are being added to the page new aged him out elements.

52

00:03:11,140  -->  00:03:13,230
These are probably list items and anchor tags.

53

00:03:13,350  -->  00:03:17,970
They're being added to the page being hidden and shown in color is changing as I scroll over things

54

00:03:18,420  -->  00:03:19,790
lots of interactivity.

55

00:03:19,830  -->  00:03:22,430
So the next thing that I want to show is one of my favorites.

56

00:03:22,650  -->  00:03:24,560
It's a Web site called pad attack.

57

00:03:24,780  -->  00:03:26,030
So this is a little bit different.

58

00:03:26,100  -->  00:03:31,410
It's not really a web application that you would use but it's a really fun toy and a great tech demo

59

00:03:31,410  -->  00:03:33,210
of what you can do with H.T. mouse.

60

00:03:33,250  -->  00:03:37,940
SS In javascript so I highly recommend that you go ahead and try this on your own.

61

00:03:38,080  -->  00:03:45,660
Patta tap dot com and I have to do is start typing on my keyboard in every key that I press corresponds

62

00:03:45,660  -->  00:03:48,810
to a sound that plays and a cool animation that plays.

63

00:03:48,900  -->  00:03:51,940
So let me show you an example.

64

00:03:52,080  -->  00:03:54,100
Here's another one.

65

00:03:55,860  -->  00:03:57,040
So you can get lost somewhere

66

00:03:59,100  -->  00:04:02,230
.

67

00:04:03,510  -->  00:04:06,010
So this sums up the kind of thing that we can do.

68

00:04:06,120  -->  00:04:11,880
We have interactivity where I'm pressing a key so the code is running only when I press a particular

69

00:04:11,890  -->  00:04:19,710
key and then that code is not only playing as sound but it's also changing what we see visually.

70

00:04:19,710  -->  00:04:23,970
So it's not just constantly logging it's not just using alerts it's actually changing the screen the

71

00:04:24,200  -->  00:04:26,280
came out in the CSSA that we see.

72

00:04:26,700  -->  00:04:31,110
So hopefully those examples got you at least a little bit excited about all of the awesome stuff we're

73

00:04:31,110  -->  00:04:31,790
about to learn.
