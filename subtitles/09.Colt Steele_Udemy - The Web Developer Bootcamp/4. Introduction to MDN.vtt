00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:05.760
OK so before we actually get started writing any code I want to take a moment to highlight a really

2

00:00:05.760  -->  00:00:11.470
important resource which is something called Mozilla Developer Network or MDA and for short.

3

00:00:11.670  -->  00:00:16.200
So to get there I often just end up typing MT-NW as I'm searching something.

4

00:00:16.200  -->  00:00:19.910
So let's say I wanted to know how functions work in javascript.

5

00:00:20.010  -->  00:00:25.060
I might say MT-NW functions and then click on one of these links.

6

00:00:25.080  -->  00:00:30.030
It's just a really really good resource for everything around H.T. Melchior says in Javascript.

7

00:00:30.060  -->  00:00:34.590
So the reason I'm showing it to you is we're going to use it a lot and refer back to it.

8

00:00:34.590  -->  00:00:38.250
It's sort of going to be our encyclopedia of knowledge and examples.

9

00:00:38.250  -->  00:00:42.890
Lots and lots of real developers use MDA and it's an excellent resource for students.

10

00:00:42.900  -->  00:00:48.990
It has lots of tutorials and demos and it's an excellent resource for serious developers who just need

11

00:00:48.990  -->  00:00:49.710
a reference.

12

00:00:49.770  -->  00:00:53.030
While we have it open I'll show you a little bit about it.

13

00:00:53.250  -->  00:00:56.580
So we want to focus mainly on this web platform side of things.

14

00:00:56.640  -->  00:01:00.000
So H M L C Ss and Javascript.

15

00:01:00.000  -->  00:01:05.430
So if you take a look at the HCM page we've got a bunch of things including a reference which we're

16

00:01:05.430  -->  00:01:11.050
going to see in a little bit a guide to each team out and some tutorials and a great introduction.

17

00:01:11.070  -->  00:01:16.740
So I actually recommend that you pause the video here and you read this entire introduction it's not

18

00:01:16.740  -->  00:01:17.570
very long.

19

00:01:17.820  -->  00:01:22.070
It's a great intro to everything that we're going to talk about in the next few videos.

20

00:01:22.080  -->  00:01:26.880
One thing that I always recommend is that you do a little reading before the videos especially for some

21

00:01:26.880  -->  00:01:29.190
of the more advanced topics and newer topics.

22

00:01:29.190  -->  00:01:33.900
Do some reading before them so that when you watch the videos you're able to draw some connections from

23

00:01:33.900  -->  00:01:37.950
something you've already read to something that I'm mentioning or some code that I'm showing you.

24

00:01:37.950  -->  00:01:43.260
So in summary though MDA an excellent excellent resource you could spend hours and hours on here.

25

00:01:43.260  -->  00:01:48.510
We will and the class highly recommend that you just get in the habit of typing MDMA in your Google

26

00:01:48.510  -->  00:01:51.830
searches or going to developer dupped Mozilla dot org.
