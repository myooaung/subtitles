00:00:01.140  -->  00:00:04.320
So this video is going to be a solution video.

2

00:00:04.350  -->  00:00:08.640
So like all solution videos you do not have to watch them if you just want the code.

3

00:00:08.670  -->  00:00:09.580
It's in the description.

4

00:00:09.600  -->  00:00:10.840
You can just view the file.

5

00:00:10.890  -->  00:00:14.030
But I'm going to go through the actual process of writing it here.

6

00:00:14.700  -->  00:00:19.950
So the first thing I want to do is make a new file and save it and I'm going to call this just solution

7

00:00:20.020  -->  00:00:22.140
that HTML.

8

00:00:22.950  -->  00:00:27.450
Every time we make an HMO document we create our boiler plate.

9

00:00:27.650  -->  00:00:29.210
Each Tim I'll hit tab.

10

00:00:29.370  -->  00:00:31.860
Or you can type it all from scratch.

11

00:00:32.400  -->  00:00:34.900
Let's start with our title let's fill that in.

12

00:00:34.950  -->  00:00:37.490
Things I've Learned.

13

00:00:38.400  -->  00:00:39.440
All right.

14

00:00:39.450  -->  00:00:42.670
So next up we're going to actually fill out the body.

15

00:00:42.870  -->  00:00:43.630
I'd like to start.

16

00:00:43.650  -->  00:00:48.390
Let's identify the big elements of the headings on the page.

17

00:00:48.390  -->  00:00:50.190
So we're going to have an H1

18

00:00:53.280  -->  00:00:57.290
and that is going to say things I've learned.

19

00:00:57.340  -->  00:01:02.850
Remember H-1 is for the largest thing on the page the largest heading on the page.

20

00:01:02.850  -->  00:01:06.670
So then we also had an H two

21

00:01:09.900  -->  00:01:18.870
and this one is Internet basics and then we have another age to just for the record you might see me

22

00:01:18.870  -->  00:01:21.780
duplicating things very quickly.

23

00:01:21.780  -->  00:01:27.630
I'm not copying and pasting it's actually all done with a short cut and sublime on a Mac it is command

24

00:01:27.720  -->  00:01:28.550
shift.

25

00:01:28.540  -->  00:01:32.180
D OK.

26

00:01:32.700  -->  00:01:35.650
Another h to this one for each out.

27

00:01:36.060  -->  00:01:38.440
So let's take a look at how this is going so far.

28

00:01:38.580  -->  00:01:40.840
Let's open it up.

29

00:01:40.860  -->  00:01:41.280
All right.

30

00:01:41.310  -->  00:01:42.440
So far so good.

31

00:01:42.690  -->  00:01:44.830
Now we need to go in and fill out the list.

32

00:01:44.850  -->  00:01:50.830
So let's start with this one so that it's going to be an ordered list.

33

00:01:50.880  -->  00:01:52.730
We're going to have three list items.

34

00:01:52.740  -->  00:01:59.970
First one is HTP requests and then we're going to have another one IP address

35

00:02:03.030  -->  00:02:08.440
and another one server's hopes.

36

00:02:08.460  -->  00:02:09.970
I put that in the wrong place.

37

00:02:10.020  -->  00:02:13.600
You want to put that below Internet basics.

38

00:02:14.190  -->  00:02:15.490
Let's refresh the page.

39

00:02:15.920  -->  00:02:16.470
OK.

40

00:02:16.620  -->  00:02:17.500
Looks good.

41

00:02:17.730  -->  00:02:22.200
So now we're on to the tricky part which is this nasty nested list.

42

00:02:22.950  -->  00:02:29.330
So the outer list this whole thing is in an ordered list.

43

00:02:30.540  -->  00:02:34.110
And we have a few allies so we've got stands for.

44

00:02:34.110  -->  00:02:38.640
And then we have hypertext markup which is a strong tag

45

00:02:41.130  -->  00:02:47.080
hyper text markup language.

46

00:02:47.250  -->  00:02:47.840
OK.

47

00:02:48.120  -->  00:02:54.900
If another ally which has lots of tags and I'm actually going to finish out just double check it this

48

00:02:54.900  -->  00:02:55.440
works.

49

00:02:55.440  -->  00:02:56.630
Before we move on.

50

00:02:57.060  -->  00:02:58.930
OK that looks good.

51

00:02:58.980  -->  00:03:04.690
So now we're going to work on the nested list inside of the first unordered list.

52

00:03:04.680  -->  00:03:06.170
We have another unordered list.

53

00:03:06.510  -->  00:03:10.920
So just do that right here.

54

00:03:11.040  -->  00:03:13.680
It helps to be very particular with your indentation here.

55

00:03:13.680  -->  00:03:19.770
It won't actually impact anything but it will help us just to be able to view our code and know what

56

00:03:19.830  -->  00:03:21.400
is nested inside of what.

57

00:03:21.660  -->  00:03:27.730
So we have a UL and then we have one two three four five allies.

58

00:03:28.650  -->  00:03:30.730
So I'm just going to go ahead and write those.

59

00:03:30.960  -->  00:03:32.420
One two three four or five.

60

00:03:32.430  -->  00:03:33.780
You can copy and paste them.

61

00:03:33.780  -->  00:03:35.580
Type them manually.

62

00:03:36.090  -->  00:03:38.310
First one is boilerplate.

63

00:03:39.450  -->  00:03:48.690
And I'm going to finish out the list first so headings paragraph and then we have

64

00:03:51.270  -->  00:04:01.170
E-M tag with the word E-M inside of it and a strong tag with the word strong instead of it just to hammer

65

00:04:01.170  -->  00:04:02.460
this home one more time.

66

00:04:02.550  -->  00:04:04.380
You probably should do this in quite a few times.

67

00:04:04.440  -->  00:04:06.770
You can type the name of a tag and hit tab.

68

00:04:07.110  -->  00:04:08.450
Very useful.

69

00:04:09.060  -->  00:04:10.820
So let's double check this.

70

00:04:11.150  -->  00:04:11.880
OK.

71

00:04:12.060  -->  00:04:13.770
We're getting close.

72

00:04:13.770  -->  00:04:16.280
Now we just need this final nesting.

73

00:04:16.410  -->  00:04:21.250
Well two things actually of an ordered list and another ordered list.

74

00:04:21.510  -->  00:04:24.040
So that goes inside of boiler plate.

75

00:04:24.210  -->  00:04:25.410
So we find that ally

76

00:04:29.310  -->  00:04:36.450
and now we're going to have an ordered list and we have one two three four allies.

77

00:04:37.020  -->  00:04:41.220
We have one that says dock type.

78

00:04:42.510  -->  00:04:49.490
We have another one that says each time I'll have another one that says head and one that says body

79

00:04:51.180  -->  00:04:51.780
OK.

80

00:04:51.780  -->  00:04:52.970
So we're very close now.

81

00:04:53.070  -->  00:04:56.910
The last thing we need is the title that goes instead of head.

82

00:04:56.930  -->  00:04:58.100
You'll notice there's a number.

83

00:04:58.140  -->  00:04:59.650
So it's an ordered bust.

84

00:05:00.030  -->  00:05:01.110
So if we open up head

85

00:05:04.350  -->  00:05:08.590
we're going to type ordered list again lie again.

86

00:05:09.070  -->  00:05:13.210
Title.

87

00:05:13.260  -->  00:05:14.220
All right.

88

00:05:14.220  -->  00:05:15.470
And that's all we need to do.

89

00:05:15.480  -->  00:05:20.130
So let's just compare the side by side check if anything is different.

90

00:05:20.250  -->  00:05:21.300
Looks good to me.

91

00:05:21.300  -->  00:05:27.340
Titles are the same ones age twos first list and all of these lists done here.

92

00:05:27.360  -->  00:05:28.740
They look identical.

93

00:05:28.740  -->  00:05:29.220
Great.

94

00:05:29.340  -->  00:05:32.970
So if you have any questions feel free to take some time go through the code.

95

00:05:32.970  -->  00:05:34.660
Again it's in the description.

96

00:05:34.860  -->  00:05:38.860
This is not something that you'll have to do all the time creating these nasty lists.

97

00:05:38.940  -->  00:05:43.350
But what it really is about and the reason that I had to do this is that it's important that you're

98

00:05:43.350  -->  00:05:49.050
able to combine tags you can put a strong tag instead of an ally or an emphasis tag inside of another

99

00:05:49.050  -->  00:05:53.680
ally or an oh well as that of an ally or an ally instead of a UL and so on.

100

00:05:53.700  -->  00:05:57.830
It's important that you get comfortable with the basic boiler plate as well.

101

00:05:57.960  -->  00:05:59.320
So hopefully you enjoyed that.
