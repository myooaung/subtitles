00:00:00.380  -->  00:00:02.130
OK we'll come back.

2

00:00:02.130  -->  00:00:05.070
So I think it's time for you to give some of this a shot on your own.

3

00:00:05.400  -->  00:00:07.310
So I have a quick exercise.

4

00:00:07.560  -->  00:00:14.730
All that you need to do is create a new age or file a new javascript file and add a single button to

5

00:00:14.730  -->  00:00:15.620
the age to my file.

6

00:00:15.630  -->  00:00:16.920
That's it.

7

00:00:16.920  -->  00:00:23.490
And then when I click that button all you need to do is change the background color of the body from

8

00:00:23.490  -->  00:00:24.780
white to purple.

9

00:00:24.780  -->  00:00:25.600
How you do that.

10

00:00:25.600  -->  00:00:27.190
I'll leave it up to you.

11

00:00:27.240  -->  00:00:31.620
There's a few different ways that you could do it given the different things that we've talked about

12

00:00:31.620  -->  00:00:36.570
so far but you need to run some code when you click on the button and that code should change the background

13

00:00:36.570  -->  00:00:41.280
color between two colors whether it's purple and white or you pick some better colors.

14

00:00:41.280  -->  00:00:42.220
Totally up to you.

15

00:00:42.510  -->  00:00:44.010
So Pasic video right now.

16

00:00:44.190  -->  00:00:45.560
Give that a shot on your own.

17

00:00:45.580  -->  00:00:50.160
That's really important that you do that and then come back when you're ready and we'll go over a solution

18

00:00:50.160  -->  00:00:52.460
together.

19

00:00:54.620  -->  00:00:55.280
OK.

20

00:00:55.350  -->  00:00:58.110
So let's talk about how we can make this work.

21

00:00:58.110  -->  00:01:04.870
First things first we need an aged female file which I have right here need to add in my HMO.

22

00:01:05.310  -->  00:01:14.550
Let's call this color toggle and all we need is a single button and we'll just add click me just like

23

00:01:14.550  -->  00:01:16.590
that.

24

00:01:16.650  -->  00:01:22.850
Now we need our javascript file and we could easily do something where we just add a script tag right

25

00:01:22.860  -->  00:01:27.260
here and at our javascript in there but it's not a great practice.

26

00:01:27.270  -->  00:01:34.170
So just to get you in the right habit and make a new file we'll just call it toggle.

27

00:01:34.190  -->  00:01:42.540
J.S. in the same directory and inside like I always like to do I'll add an alert just to make sure they're

28

00:01:42.540  -->  00:01:47.910
connected OK and then we need to go and link to that script

29

00:01:51.130  -->  00:01:57.450
and that needs to be source equals toggle dot Jay Yes just like that.

30

00:01:57.510  -->  00:02:02.880
So let's go ahead and open this file in the browser and see what we get.

31

00:02:02.880  -->  00:02:04.640
First thing that I'll point out here.

32

00:02:04.800  -->  00:02:10.770
Notice that we got the alert that says things are connected but the button isn't on the page yet.

33

00:02:11.220  -->  00:02:14.710
So we don't actually see the button until I get rid of the alert.

34

00:02:15.030  -->  00:02:17.450
And that's really important and we want to fix that.

35

00:02:17.490  -->  00:02:24.210
What that tells us is that our code over here is running first before the button is on the page at all

36

00:02:25.140  -->  00:02:30.060
and the code that we're going to write is going to rely on the fact the button is on the page.

37

00:02:30.150  -->  00:02:36.810
We can't add a quick listener otherwise the event listener is only going to work and add events to items

38

00:02:36.810  -->  00:02:39.100
that are on the page at the time that it's run.

39

00:02:39.450  -->  00:02:41.290
So we have a few ways of fixing this.

40

00:02:41.310  -->  00:02:47.040
The simplest one for now is just to move our script down to the end of the body so that we know for

41

00:02:47.040  -->  00:02:49.710
sure OK this button has loaded.

42

00:02:49.710  -->  00:02:55.020
We will learn about another way of doing this when we get to Jay query but this works perfectly fine

43

00:02:55.020  -->  00:02:55.680
for now.

44

00:02:55.980  -->  00:02:59.440
So if we refresh now you'll see the buttons already there.

45

00:02:59.610  -->  00:03:03.140
And then we get the alert that says connect it.

46

00:03:03.210  -->  00:03:05.470
So now let's talk about the logic.

47

00:03:05.490  -->  00:03:09.460
Let's go to our toggle J.S. and select the button.

48

00:03:09.660  -->  00:03:19.920
So var button equals document queries selector button and that's just one way to select it of course

49

00:03:19.920  -->  00:03:20.620
.

50

00:03:20.970  -->  00:03:28.030
And then we want to add our event listener so button that add event listener click

51

00:03:30.930  -->  00:03:36.650
and then our function that will run the callback function just like that.

52

00:03:37.290  -->  00:03:44.100
And I always like to start again with an alert that just says clicked just to make sure that we're selecting

53

00:03:44.100  -->  00:03:46.450
the right thing and that this function is being run.

54

00:03:46.470  -->  00:03:51.910
When we do click so refresh Let's click and we get clicked.

55

00:03:51.960  -->  00:03:52.860
So that's great.

56

00:03:52.860  -->  00:03:59.280
Things are hooked up correctly now all we need to do is change the background color of the body.

57

00:03:59.700  -->  00:04:04.920
So I would start by just doing document dump body and let's just set it to be purple.

58

00:04:05.100  -->  00:04:14.980
So document up body style that background equals purple and you'll see I used document dot body.

59

00:04:15.150  -->  00:04:24.830
We could also do document that queries selector and give the body tag name or something like document

60

00:04:24.840  -->  00:04:35.510
diked get elements by tag name body zero but it's much easier just to use document dot body.

61

00:04:35.670  -->  00:04:38.730
It's just a shortcut that's built into the document.

62

00:04:38.730  -->  00:04:42.970
So I do that I change it to purple and we should be good to go here.

63

00:04:43.110  -->  00:04:50.770
If I click we get a purple body but of course part of this problem was toggling back and forth.

64

00:04:50.940  -->  00:04:56.310
So when I click here it goes back to white and then I click again and goes back to purple and it keeps

65

00:04:56.310  -->  00:04:57.870
switching between the two.

66

00:04:58.290  -->  00:05:06.030
So what we'll need to do is add some logic and our logic is going to look something like this if White

67

00:05:09.150  -->  00:05:16.040
may get purple else make it with something like that.

68

00:05:16.350  -->  00:05:21.550
So the way that I'm going to handle this I'm going to create a boolean value called is purple Savar

69

00:05:21.630  -->  00:05:29.130
is purple and it's going to start as false because when I refresh the page it's not purple so purple

70

00:05:29.130  -->  00:05:29.930
is false.

71

00:05:29.970  -->  00:05:37.950
And then what we'll need to do is inside of our javascript we're going to check if is purple.

72

00:05:38.910  -->  00:05:45.450
So if it is purple then we're going to want to make the background color white

73

00:05:49.200  -->  00:05:50.370
just like this.

74

00:05:50.520  -->  00:05:51.630
And change has to be white

75

00:05:54.690  -->  00:06:02.020
and then Otherwise we'll do the same thing except we will make it purple.

76

00:06:02.040  -->  00:06:06.930
The only issue of course is that is purple right now is always false.

77

00:06:06.930  -->  00:06:08.610
We're going to want to change that.

78

00:06:08.880  -->  00:06:16.230
So if is purple if it is purple document up body style but background is equal to white and then we

79

00:06:16.230  -->  00:06:23.190
would say is purple is now called the false because we just change it to white and then when we said

80

00:06:23.190  -->  00:06:27.610
it to be purple we would say is purple equals true.

81

00:06:27.840  -->  00:06:35.130
And this needs to be a boolean value of course not the string true or the string false.

82

00:06:35.160  -->  00:06:38.280
So what we've done here is create our own little target tracker.

83

00:06:38.280  -->  00:06:41.020
This boolean is purple start's is false.

84

00:06:41.070  -->  00:06:43.590
The first time through it is purple.

85

00:06:43.590  -->  00:06:44.510
That doesn't happen.

86

00:06:44.610  -->  00:06:49.990
So we go to the else we change the background to be purple and then is purple is now true.

87

00:06:50.190  -->  00:06:54.460
So next time the user clicks it is purple that's now true.

88

00:06:54.480  -->  00:06:58.890
So if we change the background to be white and then is purple is set to false and we keep switching

89

00:06:58.890  -->  00:06:59.930
back and forth.

90

00:06:59.970  -->  00:07:03.640
So refresh checker council makes sure we have no errors.

91

00:07:03.900  -->  00:07:08.910
And now let's try clicking purple white purple and white.

92

00:07:09.450  -->  00:07:15.030
So there's a small re factor that we can do which is we don't have to set is purple to be false and

93

00:07:15.090  -->  00:07:18.180
is purple to be true inside the if statement.

94

00:07:18.180  -->  00:07:21.110
We have a shorter way of doing that just by writing.

95

00:07:21.150  -->  00:07:25.360
Is purple equals not is purple.

96

00:07:25.770  -->  00:07:31.280
So that's just going to switch it between true and false or false and true just negates it.

97

00:07:31.440  -->  00:07:33.660
So that is a nice shortcut.

98

00:07:34.200  -->  00:07:40.080
You can see here it now it's Heigl's and it's a little bit shorter but there's an even shorter way of

99

00:07:40.080  -->  00:07:46.000
doing office which hopefully some of you thought about when we learned about the class list.

100

00:07:46.110  -->  00:07:48.230
There was a method called toggle.

101

00:07:48.240  -->  00:07:55.320
So if we define a CSA as class and let's go ahead and do that instead of my style I'm just going to

102

00:07:55.320  -->  00:08:01.590
make a style tag for now and add a class called Dot.

103

00:08:01.590  -->  00:08:04.650
And let's just call it purple or just purple.

104

00:08:04.650  -->  00:08:12.630
That's a class name and we'll just say background is purple and that's all we need to do what we're

105

00:08:12.630  -->  00:08:16.680
going to do is toggle this class on and off on the body.

106

00:08:16.680  -->  00:08:25.140
So go back here and I'm going to just copy this for now and counted out and all we need to do is when

107

00:08:25.140  -->  00:08:31.720
you click on the button and they comment this out or get rid of this get rid of this as well.

108

00:08:31.740  -->  00:08:37.820
All of this all we want to do is document up body.

109

00:08:38.230  -->  00:08:41.900
Classless toggle.

110

00:08:42.210  -->  00:08:46.390
And then the name of the class we just made was called a purple.

111

00:08:46.470  -->  00:08:53.000
So remember what this will do is if the body doesn't have the class named purple it will add it.

112

00:08:53.400  -->  00:08:56.510
But it checks if it does have the class name purple already.

113

00:08:56.580  -->  00:08:57.660
It will remove it.

114

00:08:57.660  -->  00:09:00.630
So we don't have to keep track of if it's purple or white.

115

00:09:00.630  -->  00:09:05.850
Currently if the class is applied or if it isn't we don't need this is purple Boullion anymore.

116

00:09:06.270  -->  00:09:09.660
That's basically all wrapped up instead of classless toggle.

117

00:09:09.930  -->  00:09:11.390
So I refresh.

118

00:09:12.000  -->  00:09:15.980
I click and you can see it looks the same.

119

00:09:16.110  -->  00:09:19.890
But if we inspect and we look at the body.

120

00:09:19.890  -->  00:09:20.670
Here we go.

121

00:09:20.790  -->  00:09:22.930
Notice class equals purple.

122

00:09:22.980  -->  00:09:26.310
And then I click and now we don't have classical purple anymore.

123

00:09:26.310  -->  00:09:27.570
It goes away.

124

00:09:27.990  -->  00:09:29.830
That's document up body.

125

00:09:29.910  -->  00:09:32.760
Class list toggle which is really really useful.

126

00:09:32.760  -->  00:09:35.490
It's a lot shorter than this logic here.

127

00:09:35.490  -->  00:09:37.030
All right so that's my solution.
