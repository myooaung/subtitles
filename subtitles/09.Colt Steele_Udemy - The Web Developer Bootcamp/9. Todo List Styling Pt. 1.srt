1

00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:01,530
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01,530  -->  00:00:07,350
Now that we have the basic functionality of our To Do list app done it's time for us to focus on making

3

00:00:07,350  -->  00:00:08,580
it look like this.

4

00:00:08,880  -->  00:00:11,430
So we definitely have quite a ways to go.

5

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:14,220
And we're just going to attack this one piece at a time.

6

00:00:14,280  -->  00:00:17,080
I'll try and do this in the most logical possible order.

7

00:00:17,220  -->  00:00:22,800
We'll start with some of the bigger pieces like the background colors and fonts making sure that we

8

00:00:22,800  -->  00:00:27,210
have the right margin and padding on this big container here and then we'll focus on some of the more

9

00:00:27,210  -->  00:00:28,740
nuance things.

10

00:00:28,760  -->  00:00:30,460
OK let's get started here.

11

00:00:30,480  -->  00:00:33,200
The first thing we'll do I'll do a full screen.

12

00:00:33,720  -->  00:00:35,670
Let's start by just pushing this down.

13

00:00:35,670  -->  00:00:37,120
This is our container div.

14

00:00:37,440  -->  00:00:41,630
We'll add a margin to the top so that we have more space up here.

15

00:00:41,910  -->  00:00:47,180
So we'll go back to our C S S and can close down or javascript for now.

16

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:52,520
Our div has an idea of container and then we'll go and select that here which you've already done.

17

00:00:52,860  -->  00:00:59,550
And rather than a margin of zero OTTO Well give it a hundred pixels on the top and bottom.

18

00:00:59,820  -->  00:01:05,690
And remember we need the x if we have zero we don't need X but if we have a number we do.

19

00:01:05,880  -->  00:01:07,230
Let's take a look now.

20

00:01:07,650  -->  00:01:10,100
OK so now they are starting at the same place.

21

00:01:10,200  -->  00:01:12,400
They have the same margin there.

22

00:01:12,420  -->  00:01:18,090
The next thing we'll do is add a background color to this container which this one has.

23

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:22,830
It's a little bit difficult to see but when I delete something it shows through in the back.

24

00:01:22,950  -->  00:01:24,570
It's this color right here.

25

00:01:24,630  -->  00:01:25,700
So that again.

26

00:01:26,080  -->  00:01:28,190
So we'll go ahead and add that.

27

00:01:28,830  -->  00:01:34,680
So instead of container well say background and the color.

28

00:01:34,680  -->  00:01:39,680
I'll just read it out is F 7 7 after 7.

29

00:01:39,960  -->  00:01:41,210
Just like that.

30

00:01:41,850  -->  00:01:43,570
And let's check how that looks.

31

00:01:44,000  -->  00:01:44,400
OK.

32

00:01:44,490  -->  00:01:50,430
So we have the same gray color that we have right here.

33

00:01:50,430  -->  00:01:52,790
It's the same light gray.

34

00:01:52,830  -->  00:01:54,990
The next thing we'll do is work on the border.

35

00:01:55,230  -->  00:01:57,460
And this actually doesn't have a border.

36

00:01:57,540  -->  00:02:00,840
What it does have is a very slight box shadow.

37

00:02:00,840  -->  00:02:02,870
So we haven't seen box shadow yet.

38

00:02:02,940  -->  00:02:09,820
I'll demonstrate that here and go into MT-NW and it's just a way of adding a shadow effect.

39

00:02:09,870  -->  00:02:15,240
So if I scroll down you can see here are some different box shadows and we're going to have a very light

40

00:02:15,240  -->  00:02:19,750
one but if you notice around this there's a really slight shadow.

41

00:02:20,220  -->  00:02:28,380
So the syntax and the shadow that we're going to use will get rid of our border is box dash shadow 0

42

00:02:28,500  -->  00:02:39,020
0 3 pixels and then a color and our color it's going to be just basically black but it's R.G..

43

00:02:39,180  -->  00:02:43,260
And then we're going to make it really really transparent.

44

00:02:43,560  -->  00:02:45,380
So just barely noticeable.

45

00:02:45,400  -->  00:02:46,890
And if I refresh.

46

00:02:46,890  -->  00:02:52,090
We have no border now but there's a slight shadow around this element.

47

00:02:52,710  -->  00:02:53,170
OK.

48

00:02:53,250  -->  00:02:55,460
That's all we'll do to the container for now.

49

00:02:55,770  -->  00:02:57,480
Let's attack the H-1.

50

00:02:57,480  -->  00:02:59,490
So this heading up here.

51

00:02:59,580  -->  00:03:04,320
So that is in our age him l just considered an H1.

52

00:03:04,320  -->  00:03:06,710
It doesn't have an ID or anything and that's fine.

53

00:03:06,960  -->  00:03:12,120
Let's go to the CSSA file and start by adding in a background color.

54

00:03:12,390  -->  00:03:25,950
So we'll select each one and the background is a color that is 2 9 8 0 be 9 and they'll save and refresh

55

00:03:27,270  -->  00:03:30,010
and we now have the correct shade of blue.

56

00:03:31,210  -->  00:03:33,930
So we'll also change the font color to white

57

00:03:36,660  -->  00:03:38,890
and quickly show you that.

58

00:03:38,970  -->  00:03:39,450
All right.

59

00:03:39,510  -->  00:03:42,890
Slowly inching closer here.

60

00:03:43,050  -->  00:03:50,790
The next thing we'll do is give it no margin and now we'll just get rid of this space that we had here

61

00:03:50,810  -->  00:03:51,160
.

62

00:03:51,420  -->  00:03:53,220
As you can see here there is no margin.

63

00:03:53,220  -->  00:03:54,440
This is our H-1.

64

00:03:54,510  -->  00:03:55,970
There is padding here.

65

00:03:56,340  -->  00:03:59,550
So the text doesn't go right up against the edge like it does here.

66

00:03:59,700  -->  00:04:03,330
But there's no margin on the outside of the blue box.

67

00:04:03,360  -->  00:04:09,360
This is our text input and that also has increased padding but there's no margin around that either

68

00:04:09,360  -->  00:04:10,130
.

69

00:04:10,200  -->  00:04:13,360
So we'll begin by adding some padding around our To Do list.

70

00:04:13,370  -->  00:04:22,740
H-1 So here we're going to add 10 pixels to the top and bottom and 20 pixels to the left and right and

71

00:04:22,740  -->  00:04:24,240
save.

72

00:04:25,260  -->  00:04:27,150
You can see we're getting closer.

73

00:04:27,480  -->  00:04:29,000
We need to change the font size.

74

00:04:29,070  -->  00:04:30,350
Need to change the font.

75

00:04:30,420  -->  00:04:34,900
We also will uppercase all of that and we can do that by now.

76

00:04:34,980  -->  00:04:40,010
You should know one of my favorites is text transform uppercase.

77

00:04:40,320  -->  00:04:42,480
I just think it's pretty cool.

78

00:04:42,480  -->  00:04:53,910
There we go we get all uppercase the font size needs to be 24 pixels so font size 24 x and save OK the

79

00:04:53,900  -->  00:04:56,840
last thing we'll do is make sure that it's a normal font weight.

80

00:04:57,020  -->  00:05:00,970
So an H1 by default is actually bolded and we don't want that.

81

00:05:01,290  -->  00:05:09,310
So we'll do Funt way normal or we could also write font weight 400.

82

00:05:09,320  -->  00:05:10,290
There we go.

83

00:05:10,350  -->  00:05:14,960
Now it's just a matter of changing the font which will come back to the next thing you want to tackle

84

00:05:15,380  -->  00:05:17,510
is getting rid of these bullet points.

85

00:05:17,510  -->  00:05:20,240
You can see if we don't have any bullet points here.

86

00:05:20,250  -->  00:05:23,430
Those bullet points are considered the default browser style.

87

00:05:23,510  -->  00:05:25,360
So we'll override that.

88

00:05:25,400  -->  00:05:32,270
We're going to select the UL that they're inside of and say list style none.

89

00:05:32,370  -->  00:05:37,790
And if we go back and refresh we now don't have any bullet points.

90

00:05:37,800  -->  00:05:44,270
Another thing I'm going to do is honor you well set the margin to be zero and the padding to be zero

91

00:05:45,240  -->  00:05:51,350
and it will refresh here and not just get rid of the space on the sides of the well we do have space

92

00:05:51,360  -->  00:05:56,240
here that we need to work with but that's the lie not the UL itself.

93

00:05:56,250  -->  00:05:58,440
So we'll come back to that.

94

00:05:58,440  -->  00:06:04,400
Now let's add in the correct font and the name of this font is rubato and it's part of Google fonts

95

00:06:04,400  -->  00:06:04,760
.

96

00:06:04,880  -->  00:06:09,400
So I have that open here and I'll just do a search for it rubato.

97

00:06:09,620  -->  00:06:10,720
And here we go.

98

00:06:10,770  -->  00:06:14,230
Add to collection then use.

99

00:06:14,510  -->  00:06:16,490
And we're going to want normal way.

100

00:06:16,800  -->  00:06:20,660
We'll add in bold and also medium.

101

00:06:20,660  -->  00:06:25,620
Now let's go ahead and copy this link to our HMO and we can close this window.

102

00:06:25,980  -->  00:06:33,650
Go back to where each team out here and just up top paste that in and save then we'll go to our to see

103

00:06:33,650  -->  00:06:37,520
assess and we'll add some styles to the body.

104

00:06:37,740  -->  00:06:44,780
Everything uses this font so we'll just add in font family robotically.

105

00:06:45,530  -->  00:06:46,680
Just like that.

106

00:06:47,390  -->  00:06:53,650
And if we go back now and refresh our H-1 is pretty much there.

107

00:06:53,660  -->  00:06:58,810
Aside from this button which we haven't touched at all the fonts the same the color the spacing all

108

00:06:58,860  -->  00:06:59,960
that's good.

109

00:06:59,970  -->  00:07:01,970
And our allies are getting there.

110

00:07:01,980  -->  00:07:03,060
They have the right font.

111

00:07:03,140  -->  00:07:06,680
We need to work on some of the spacing and padding issues.

112

00:07:06,690  -->  00:07:10,660
The next thing we'll tackle are the background colors on the lies.

113

00:07:11,250  -->  00:07:12,750
So every other lie.

114

00:07:12,930  -->  00:07:19,280
It goes from a white color pure white to this gray color that we have as a background of the the.

115

00:07:19,470  -->  00:07:24,340
So we can use the SS to add styles to every other ally.

116

00:07:24,380  -->  00:07:25,450
So let's do that now.

117

00:07:25,500  -->  00:07:32,610
The first thing we'll do is select all allies and give them a background of white so we can do that

118

00:07:32,610  -->  00:07:43,520
with F F F or white or R-GA 255 255 to 55 and then we'll do every other lie.

119

00:07:43,740  -->  00:07:50,080
And the syntax for that is a lie and child to end.

120

00:07:50,360  -->  00:07:53,970
And that too and well defined a pattern of every other.

121

00:07:54,140  -->  00:07:58,670
And if we did three and it would say every third but we just want every other.

122

00:07:59,000  -->  00:08:08,310
And we'll make the background color the same f7 f7 f7 that we used for the container background and

123

00:08:08,390  -->  00:08:08,880
refresh.

124

00:08:08,880  -->  00:08:16,500
Now it's hard to see because they're a little small but every other lie is now this gray color.

125

00:08:16,700  -->  00:08:21,030
So add in a few more and you can see they alternate perfect.

126

00:08:21,020  -->  00:08:25,370
Now let's address the issue of the height of the lies and also the padding.

127

00:08:25,760  -->  00:08:35,240
The first thing to do is give them a height of 40 pixels so all allies height 40 x and we'll go back

128

00:08:35,660  -->  00:08:36,540
refresh.

129

00:08:36,950  -->  00:08:39,000
OK so they take up the right amount of space.

130

00:08:39,000  -->  00:08:42,620
Now if we compared them the font has some issues.

131

00:08:42,620  -->  00:08:44,600
And also we need to add some padding.

132

00:08:44,970  -->  00:08:51,050
Next are going to change the line height property on the lies so that our text is centered vertically

133

00:08:51,060  -->  00:08:51,570
.

134

00:08:51,570  -->  00:08:55,050
Right now the line is basically this tall.

135

00:08:55,080  -->  00:09:05,550
We're going to make it take up the entire 40 pixels show you line height 40 x and that won't change

136

00:09:05,540  -->  00:09:09,510
the size of the font it just changes the size of the line.

137

00:09:09,540  -->  00:09:10,880
It's now 40 pixels.

138

00:09:10,880  -->  00:09:13,850
So the line takes up this entire area.

139

00:09:14,150  -->  00:09:21,020
The next minor thing is the color we have pure black and the color I used isn't exactly black.

140

00:09:21,060  -->  00:09:22,820
It's slightly lighter.

141

00:09:23,070  -->  00:09:33,530
So we'll set color and it is six six six refresh and then we go next let's address the input.

142

00:09:33,540  -->  00:09:35,260
So we have a few things you need to do.

143

00:09:35,490  -->  00:09:39,660
The first of which is make sure that it takes up the right amount of space.

144

00:09:39,770  -->  00:09:45,740
So this input is much larger and it's not just padding or margin the font size is larger.

145

00:09:45,750  -->  00:09:47,420
We have a new background color as well.

146

00:09:47,750  -->  00:09:49,700
And there's a border when we click.

147

00:09:49,740  -->  00:09:54,610
So let's work on all of those and we'll start by just adding in a bigger font size.

148

00:09:54,840  -->  00:09:59,370
So we'll select input font size

149

00:10:02,270  -->  00:10:05,420
and we'll set font size to be 18 pixels.

150

00:10:05,960  -->  00:10:11,570
And while we're here we'll do the background color as well as the background color and it's the same

151

00:10:11,610  -->  00:10:14,570
f 7 7 1/2 7.

152

00:10:14,730  -->  00:10:16,350
Just like that.

153

00:10:16,760  -->  00:10:18,040
And let's refresh.

154

00:10:18,770  -->  00:10:19,510
OK.

155

00:10:19,700  -->  00:10:21,180
We're getting closer.

156

00:10:21,170  -->  00:10:29,880
The next thing we'll do is add a width and the width that we're going to give it is 100 percent.

157

00:10:29,880  -->  00:10:33,590
So right now it's only going part of the way across the container.

158

00:10:33,600  -->  00:10:36,820
If we refresh it now goes all the way across.

159

00:10:37,050  -->  00:10:39,200
But we have a few small issues.

160

00:10:39,210  -->  00:10:42,970
First thing that we want to take care of is some padding in there.

161

00:10:43,400  -->  00:10:50,320
So we're going to add padding 13 pixels on top 13 pixels on the side on the right.

162

00:10:50,370  -->  00:10:54,960
13 pixels on the bottom and 20 pixels on the left.

163

00:10:54,950  -->  00:10:56,250
So you can see on this one.

164

00:10:56,550  -->  00:10:58,770
We have top and bottom are 13.

165

00:10:59,000  -->  00:11:01,550
And on the left there there's 20 pixels.

166

00:11:01,590  -->  00:11:07,430
So if I were fresh We now have a bigger input that takes up the right amount of space.

167

00:11:07,590  -->  00:11:11,670
We do have a problem which is that the input is now too long.

168

00:11:11,790  -->  00:11:18,540
When we said that with should be 100 percent that with was actually just the content and it didn't include

169

00:11:18,540  -->  00:11:24,460
the padding and it didn't include the margin which means that our input goes to long past the end of

170

00:11:24,450  -->  00:11:27,710
the div and rather than messing with the padding.

171

00:11:27,770  -->  00:11:33,820
I mean to show another way of changing it which is a property called Box sizing.

172

00:11:33,840  -->  00:11:39,420
So with block sizing you have a few different options but it basically controls how the box is sized

173

00:11:39,760  -->  00:11:41,400
of the box model.

174

00:11:41,390  -->  00:11:44,100
And we're going to change it to border Dasch box.

175

00:11:44,270  -->  00:11:50,570
And what this does I'll just read it says the width and height properties include the padding and border

176

00:11:50,750  -->  00:11:52,740
but not the margin.

177

00:11:52,800  -->  00:12:02,760
So if we change it to border box which I'll do now we go into here just add box sizing order box and

178

00:12:02,750  -->  00:12:05,170
save it before I move on.

179

00:12:05,310  -->  00:12:10,250
I will point out this is one of those properties that we do want to have the prefixes.

180

00:12:10,250  -->  00:12:15,170
So the Web Kit and Mozy are Moz and the mess from Microsoft.

181

00:12:15,540  -->  00:12:16,850
I'm not going to do that now.

182

00:12:16,910  -->  00:12:18,250
It will be in the solution code.

183

00:12:18,410  -->  00:12:20,330
But it just takes a long time to type up.

184

00:12:20,660  -->  00:12:25,940
So it will work just how it is in Chrome at least I refresh it now.

185

00:12:26,040  -->  00:12:32,180
Our box is including the padding in the border but it doesn't include the margin.

186

00:12:32,180  -->  00:12:34,820
So we end up with a perfect fit.

187

00:12:34,880  -->  00:12:39,220
Next I'm going to give the font a color when I type in there.

188

00:12:39,620  -->  00:12:41,130
So all we need to do.

189

00:12:41,330  -->  00:12:48,740
I'm going to just take the same color from the H-1 and go down to our input and just say color it's

190

00:12:48,750  -->  00:12:49,920
that color.

191

00:12:49,910  -->  00:12:54,400
And if we refresh now and we start typing There we go.

192

00:12:54,410  -->  00:12:56,290
Now let's focus on the effect.

193

00:12:56,580  -->  00:13:03,860
When we click which is called focusing in the input you can see here we get a border around it.

194

00:13:03,920  -->  00:13:05,060
So we need to work on that.

195

00:13:05,120  -->  00:13:08,050
Right now we have the default focus effect.

196

00:13:08,120  -->  00:13:17,590
So there's a selector for that input colon focus just like the hover pseudo selector.

197

00:13:17,650  -->  00:13:21,510
These cells will only run when we have focused on an input.

198

00:13:21,920  -->  00:13:27,310
So I'm going to make the background white when we focus on it.

199

00:13:27,570  -->  00:13:35,960
I'm also going to give it a border of three pixels solid The blue color we've been working with and

200

00:13:36,570  -->  00:13:45,830
we'll give it an outline of not an outline refers to this annoying highlight that we get from the browser

201

00:13:45,840  -->  00:13:47,180
itself.

202

00:13:47,180  -->  00:13:53,670
Now if we focus on the input we get this new blue border and we also change the background color so

203

00:13:53,660  -->  00:13:56,610
it's gray now it's white.

204

00:13:57,570  -->  00:14:01,850
So that's all we need to do for the input although we should go and add the placeholder text that we

205

00:14:01,860  -->  00:14:02,850
have here.

206

00:14:03,030  -->  00:14:10,410
So I'll go to the index HTL and next to the input or in the input will add the placeholder attribute

207

00:14:10,420  -->  00:14:10,620
.

208

00:14:10,910  -->  00:14:12,270
And this can be whatever you want.

209

00:14:12,470  -->  00:14:13,460
I'll just make it match.

210

00:14:13,490  -->  00:14:18,800
So it's add new to do and refresh.

211

00:14:18,840  -->  00:14:19,490
There we go.
