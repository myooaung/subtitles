00:00:00.840  -->  00:00:03.220
So it's time again for another exercise.

2

00:00:03.570  -->  00:00:08.250
So this project here is going to cover everything that we talked about in the last few videos.

3

00:00:08.280  -->  00:00:14.820
So that includes things like the form to egg different types of inputs including dropdown menus radio

4

00:00:14.820  -->  00:00:15.750
buttons.

5

00:00:15.750  -->  00:00:18.280
It also includes validations and labels.

6

00:00:18.660  -->  00:00:23.850
So pretty much everything we've talked about and what you're going to do is combine them to make a registration

7

00:00:23.850  -->  00:00:26.480
form for some fake Web site.

8

00:00:26.940  -->  00:00:33.330
So it's going to look like this a form where a user can go sign up with a Name First Name Last Name

9

00:00:33.840  -->  00:00:35.310
pick gender.

10

00:00:35.370  -->  00:00:37.170
E-mail password.

11

00:00:37.290  -->  00:00:44.210
A birthday with three dropped menus and a checkbox to agree to the terms and conditions.

12

00:00:44.430  -->  00:00:46.750
So again a few hints here.

13

00:00:47.060  -->  00:00:48.860
These should be text inputs.

14

00:00:49.560  -->  00:00:50.950
This should be a password and.

15

00:00:51.000  -->  00:00:52.490
This should be an e-mail input.

16

00:00:52.500  -->  00:00:53.850
These are radio buttons.

17

00:00:54.000  -->  00:00:56.790
These are three select tags.

18

00:00:56.880  -->  00:01:02.930
This is a checkbox input and this is submit input.

19

00:01:03.360  -->  00:01:06.020
So there are validations that are required.

20

00:01:06.540  -->  00:01:10.140
So first name last name and email cannot be blank.

21

00:01:10.140  -->  00:01:11.120
They are required

22

00:01:13.950  -->  00:01:16.660
e-mail must be a valid email address.

23

00:01:17.190  -->  00:01:21.600
So that has to follow the correct e-mail format.

24

00:01:21.600  -->  00:01:26.720
And there is a bonus here and this is one that I encourage everyone to try and find.

25

00:01:26.760  -->  00:01:32.730
So the point of this this is one of our first instances of me asking you to do something that I haven't

26

00:01:32.730  -->  00:01:34.340
directly shown you how to do.

27

00:01:34.560  -->  00:01:39.690
And as I've said before this is really what it's like to be a developer you're tasked with something

28

00:01:39.780  -->  00:01:41.350
you have some idea you want to try.

29

00:01:41.430  -->  00:01:42.730
You have no idea how to do it.

30

00:01:42.900  -->  00:01:45.440
So you go online and he did some researching.

31

00:01:45.750  -->  00:01:49.380
So the exercise here is to add a nother validation.

32

00:01:49.410  -->  00:01:55.320
A new type that we haven't talked about yet which is to validate the length of something and the way

33

00:01:55.320  -->  00:01:56.010
it should work.

34

00:01:56.190  -->  00:02:00.720
The password that the user types in must be between five and 10 characters.

35

00:02:00.780  -->  00:02:03.300
Otherwise we get this error here.

36

00:02:03.990  -->  00:02:06.380
So it's another one of these validations.

37

00:02:06.390  -->  00:02:07.990
It's just one that we haven't seen yet.

38

00:02:08.070  -->  00:02:12.500
So I recommend just pulling up Google and searching away.

39

00:02:12.570  -->  00:02:13.300
One quick note.

40

00:02:13.320  -->  00:02:14.800
This needs to be an HMO.

41

00:02:14.820  -->  00:02:20.370
So if you know javascript no javascript allowed that's considered cheating for this exercise and then

42

00:02:20.370  -->  00:02:25.010
one last thing the three just on menus those need to be select tags.

43

00:02:25.020  -->  00:02:30.240
One note though you do not need to have all the years all the months all the days in a month that's

44

00:02:30.240  -->  00:02:31.140
just busywork.

45

00:02:31.170  -->  00:02:35.390
I would just get two or three items in there just so you can see have the three selects.

46

00:02:35.420  -->  00:02:38.290
There's the slight drop down menus there.

47

00:02:38.400  -->  00:02:40.530
You don't need to worry about filling them though.

48

00:02:41.280  -->  00:02:41.560
OK.

49

00:02:41.580  -->  00:02:46.140
So go ahead and get started if you want to stick around for another moment.

50

00:02:46.140  -->  00:02:48.790
I'm just going to give a demo of the actual site now.

51

00:02:49.110  -->  00:02:54.020
So again I leave everything blank I need to fill this out.

52

00:02:54.530  -->  00:03:00.390
I need to fill in last name radio button here.

53

00:03:01.780  -->  00:03:02.520
E-mail.

54

00:03:02.520  -->  00:03:04.950
Leave it blank tells me to fill it in.

55

00:03:05.190  -->  00:03:07.290
If I don't put a proper e-mail It gets mad at me

56

00:03:11.310  -->  00:03:14.760
and then password has to be filled out.

57

00:03:14.990  -->  00:03:18.880
One character is not enough for characters not enough.

58

00:03:18.900  -->  00:03:24.520
Now if I go to five or six or whatever this is I now have enough characters.

59

00:03:25.060  -->  00:03:27.520
A dropdown menu.

60

00:03:27.600  -->  00:03:28.320
Birthday.

61

00:03:28.500  -->  00:03:30.450
I can agree or not agree.

62

00:03:30.510  -->  00:03:31.890
And now the form of it.

63

00:03:32.280  -->  00:03:33.730
OK so that's it there.

64

00:03:33.810  -->  00:03:35.400
Go ahead and attempt this on your own.

65

00:03:35.640  -->  00:03:39.390
And then as always I'll break it down step by step in the next video.
