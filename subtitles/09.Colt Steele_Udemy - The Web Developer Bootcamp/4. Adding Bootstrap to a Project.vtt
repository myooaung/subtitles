00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:04.680
Welcome back in this lesson I'll show you how to install bootstrap into your own applications.

2

00:00:04.740  -->  00:00:08.370
And then once you've done that I'll show you some of the important basics of using pitch.

3

00:00:08.850  -->  00:00:14.180
So I'm on get bootstrapped dot com just on the homepage and there's a link here download bootstrap.

4

00:00:14.850  -->  00:00:19.580
And it's not actually a direct download link because we have two main choices for how to use bootstrap

5

00:00:19.580  -->  00:00:20.100
.

6

00:00:20.430  -->  00:00:24.340
We can either download the files and I'll do that to start.

7

00:00:24.530  -->  00:00:29.360
Then we can take those files and add them into our application before we go any further.

8

00:00:29.430  -->  00:00:35.230
I do have a simple search team I'll file that I'm calling basic stuff h DML m l.

9

00:00:35.790  -->  00:00:40.770
And I'll just add a title and we'll just add in a few different elements of bootstrap.

10

00:00:40.800  -->  00:00:45.510
Once we have it installed so we won't make anything comprehensive we'll just use it as a playground

11

00:00:45.510  -->  00:00:47.960
for some of the basic bootstrap components.

12

00:00:48.510  -->  00:00:54.840
OK so let's start by adding just a simple H-1 bootstrap basics

13

00:00:57.720  -->  00:00:58.460
and save.

14

00:00:58.700  -->  00:01:01.790
And then let's open this up in the browser.

15

00:01:03.240  -->  00:01:05.280
Just keep that there for now.

16

00:01:05.280  -->  00:01:06.690
Now to install bootstrap.

17

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:08.190
I did download it.

18

00:01:08.250  -->  00:01:13.720
So if I open up that file you could see inside of here there's a few different components.

19

00:01:13.830  -->  00:01:19.650
There's a C S S directory and inside the CCS directory there are quite a few files but there's really

20

00:01:19.650  -->  00:01:23.890
only one important file which is bootstrapped up CSSA.

21

00:01:24.630  -->  00:01:27.710
And this is actually the same file here bootstrapped up minutes.

22

00:01:27.740  -->  00:01:32.290
SS except it's been minute fight been shrunken down to take up less space.

23

00:01:32.460  -->  00:01:36.280
So these two are the important files to actually use bootstrap.

24

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:41.850
And this is a bootstrap theme all three of these are used to help add a custom theme to bootstrap so

25

00:01:41.850  -->  00:01:43.370
that doesn't matter as much.

26

00:01:43.380  -->  00:01:45.680
All we need is bootstrap Dotsie assess.

27

00:01:45.780  -->  00:01:49.430
And we start by just opening it up so you can see what we're working with.

28

00:01:49.470  -->  00:01:52.200
This is the main bootstraps re-assessed file.

29

00:01:52.770  -->  00:01:54.280
It's just a lot of classes.

30

00:01:54.300  -->  00:02:00.510
If you look at every single line of CSSA almost is a class declaration dot simply.

31

00:02:00.690  -->  00:02:05.340
And then what we can do is use those classes instead of our applications.

32

00:02:05.340  -->  00:02:12.060
So if we want to have a button with white text and a red background we're going to apply dot button

33

00:02:12.060  -->  00:02:12.720
danger.

34

00:02:12.900  -->  00:02:14.510
And that's what this is doing here.

35

00:02:14.730  -->  00:02:19.590
But danger has white text a red background and a reddish border.

36

00:02:19.650  -->  00:02:24.410
So let's go ahead and include this in our application just like any other CSSA file.

37

00:02:24.750  -->  00:02:31.880
So what I'll do is just drag it over here into the same directory where I have my basic study team out

38

00:02:32.540  -->  00:02:37.020
and I could also do bootstrapped up minutes reassess in place of this one.

39

00:02:37.020  -->  00:02:38.520
It doesn't really matter.

40

00:02:38.550  -->  00:02:45.420
Technically this one loads a little faster because if I open it up you can see it's as one giant line

41

00:02:45.690  -->  00:02:47.570
all the whitespace has been removed.

42

00:02:47.850  -->  00:02:53.640
So it's easier to load but I'm going to use this longer version just so that you can see exactly what

43

00:02:53.640  -->  00:02:55.450
we're working with.

44

00:02:55.470  -->  00:03:02.130
Now we're going to go into our actual file here I'll close this down and we're going to include bootstrapped

45

00:03:02.130  -->  00:03:03.120
up CSX.

46

00:03:03.220  -->  00:03:11.370
So just like any other style sheet we need a linked tag and the Tref is bootstrap dot C Ss and if we

47

00:03:11.370  -->  00:03:16.310
save and we are fresh our page here you'll notice a slight difference.

48

00:03:16.320  -->  00:03:18.140
Watch the font on this H-1.

49

00:03:18.420  -->  00:03:19.590
It changes.

50

00:03:19.620  -->  00:03:24.720
We now have bootstrap installed or at least the C Ss that goes along with bootstrap and that's all we

51

00:03:24.720  -->  00:03:25.500
need for now.

52

00:03:25.650  -->  00:03:30.060
We won't be working with the javascript just yet there isn't another option for installing bootstrap

53

00:03:30.510  -->  00:03:35.310
that they actually give to you on the Get bootstrap Web site right here.

54

00:03:35.400  -->  00:03:40.750
Bootstrap CDN we can take this link right here and add that to our code.

55

00:03:41.010  -->  00:03:44.870
And it's a link to a hosted version of that same files.

56

00:03:45.120  -->  00:03:49.920
So if we open that in the browser and paste that in you can see it has the contents of the minimized

57

00:03:49.920  -->  00:03:56.670
file and it's hosted at this u r l so we can just have a link to that you r l so I can replace that

58

00:03:56.670  -->  00:03:56.900
.

59

00:03:56.970  -->  00:03:57.540
Another link.

60

00:03:57.540  -->  00:04:01.530
Tag and paste that you are Ellen and I'll comment this one out.

61

00:04:01.530  -->  00:04:04.230
For now and go back and refresh.

62

00:04:04.380  -->  00:04:06.020
And nothing changes.

63

00:04:06.030  -->  00:04:10.950
The only difference is that in the first case we had the file downloaded on our computer that were linking

64

00:04:10.950  -->  00:04:16.650
to and in the second case we're linking to an external file that's hosted on line.

65

00:04:16.650  -->  00:04:20.750
Now let's go to the bootstrap docs and start playing around or some of these components.

66

00:04:21.240  -->  00:04:27.330
So go back to get bootstrap and let's click on C Ss and I'm just going to point out some of the more

67

00:04:27.330  -->  00:04:29.150
important pieces that we'll be using.

68

00:04:29.400  -->  00:04:31.940
So let's start simple with buttons.

69

00:04:32.460  -->  00:04:40.650
If we want to use a button all that we have to do is use a beaten class followed by a type of button

70

00:04:40.990  -->  00:04:48.510
that is between default which will give us a white button but that's also VTAM primary BATNA access

71

00:04:48.740  -->  00:04:49.220
info.

72

00:04:49.260  -->  00:04:54.080
Warning danger and link and they all are styled slightly differently.

73

00:04:54.240  -->  00:04:58.860
And of course we can change these colors on our own but we're going to just use the built in once to

74

00:04:58.860  -->  00:05:02.500
start and s he can also see up here.

75

00:05:02.700  -->  00:05:08.600
We don't have to only use a button element we can use an anchor tag a button or an input.

76

00:05:08.820  -->  00:05:10.720
So let's try that out.

77

00:05:11.730  -->  00:05:13.030
Hello this H-1.

78

00:05:13.230  -->  00:05:22.740
Let's just add in a button tag and this button tags just say click me and just refresh the page right

79

00:05:22.740  -->  00:05:25.860
now and take a look at that.

80

00:05:25.950  -->  00:05:27.310
That's pretty ugly button.

81

00:05:27.690  -->  00:05:37.740
But if we go and add that class PTEN and then between let's do success and save we now get this awesome

82

00:05:37.740  -->  00:05:39.200
green button.

83

00:05:39.330  -->  00:05:41.870
So pretty easy to get some basic styles going.

84

00:05:42.190  -->  00:05:47.670
And let's go back and I'll show you a few other things about buttons that are different sizes that we

85

00:05:47.670  -->  00:05:50.110
can use as well and it's really easy.

86

00:05:50.130  -->  00:05:58.410
We just need to add in either button large and small or button extra small so it's tried out after button

87

00:05:58.410  -->  00:06:00.500
success and it doesn't have to go after it.

88

00:06:00.510  -->  00:06:08.600
Doesn't matter the order of the classes but I'll do it after here DTN and let's do extra small and refresh

89

00:06:08.600  -->  00:06:09.740
your page.

90

00:06:09.750  -->  00:06:11.170
There we go.

91

00:06:11.170  -->  00:06:16.710
I'll move this over now and let's add in a few more buttons but this one will be an anchor tag and this

92

00:06:16.710  -->  00:06:24.640
will be in a tag or we have H.F. equals to DP colon slash slash that read every day get bootstrap dot

93

00:06:24.660  -->  00:06:30.480
com and then the text will just say bootstrap docs.

94

00:06:30.550  -->  00:06:38.550
So make this a little bit bigger and then will add in class in class needs to equal PTEN and let's do

95

00:06:38.550  -->  00:06:47.330
between Desch info and will make it large PTEN dash Elgie and refresh.

96

00:06:47.340  -->  00:06:48.690
We now have two buttons.

97

00:06:48.750  -->  00:06:50.620
One is an actual button element.

98

00:06:50.620  -->  00:06:55.210
Another one has an anchor tag and if I click this you can see it as an anchor tag.

99

00:06:56.340  -->  00:07:01.200
So already in the first minute of using bootstrap we've been able to get decent looking buttons.

100

00:07:01.370  -->  00:07:05.330
It would have taken 10 to 15 lines of CSSA on our own to replicate.

101

00:07:05.760  -->  00:07:06.960
Let's go back now.

102

00:07:06.990  -->  00:07:10.980
Make this fullscreen again and I'll show you a few other things about buttons.

103

00:07:11.220  -->  00:07:12.720
So we have sizes.

104

00:07:12.750  -->  00:07:18.560
We also have different states where we can make a button appear as if it's active and to do that we

105

00:07:18.570  -->  00:07:21.080
just add the active class.

106

00:07:21.390  -->  00:07:27.060
So if we try that now let's add an A few button so I'm going to duplicate our little miniature Click

107

00:07:27.060  -->  00:07:37.140
Me button three times and on the last one on the middle one of the class active and refresh and you

108

00:07:37.140  -->  00:07:43.590
can see hopefully that shows up well enough on the screen cast that this one appears active.

109

00:07:43.620  -->  00:07:49.290
Let's go back and we can also disable a button by adding in this attribute.

110

00:07:49.290  -->  00:07:51.850
Disabled equals disabled.

111

00:07:52.440  -->  00:07:57.950
Let's go back and let's disable the last one refresh.

112

00:07:58.180  -->  00:08:00.020
And now this button is disabled.

113

00:08:00.120  -->  00:08:01.940
We get that nice little icon.

114

00:08:02.070  -->  00:08:05.110
It doesn't have a hover effect where it changes color any more.

115

00:08:05.220  -->  00:08:07.460
It's clearly a disabled button.

116

00:08:07.560  -->  00:08:14.610
Great last thing I'll show you so we can change the colors again so button danger night gives us that

117

00:08:14.610  -->  00:08:18.630
reddish orange and you can see all the colors here.

118

00:08:18.870  -->  00:08:24.300
And of course you could change those by overwriting the styles so you could do something like this rather

119

00:08:24.300  -->  00:08:25.850
than make another style sheet.

120

00:08:25.860  -->  00:08:27.270
I'll just do it here for now.

121

00:08:27.330  -->  00:08:32.330
So we're just going to do one line and also like beauty and danger.

122

00:08:32.460  -->  00:08:40.050
We can change the color to be orange and now might be to endanger the Texas orange and if I wanted to

123

00:08:40.050  -->  00:08:46.440
actually change the background I could do background is orange and that's how you can go in and override

124

00:08:46.440  -->  00:08:51.550
the styles so you don't have to use what bootstrap gives you out of the box.

125

00:08:52.200  -->  00:08:53.580
And most places don't.

126

00:08:54.030  -->  00:08:56.940
OK so that's buttons and that's all I'm going to do in this video.

127

00:08:56.940  -->  00:09:00.300
I just wanted to give you a really quick taste of how bootstrap works.

128

00:09:00.300  -->  00:09:06.450
This pattern of adding classes to existing elements and those classes are defined in that bootstrap

129

00:09:06.460  -->  00:09:11.010
that CSSA file in the next video I'm going to highlight some of the other important pieces that come

130

00:09:11.010  -->  00:09:13.540
with bootstrap including forms and inputs.
