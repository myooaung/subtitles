1

00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:05,430
So in this video we're going to do a code along and it's going to illustrate one other way to use a

2

00:00:05,430  -->  00:00:06,350
while loop.

3

00:00:06,360  -->  00:00:10,260
So so far we've been using a while loop where we use numbers and we have a range.

4

00:00:10,380  -->  00:00:14,520
So we print numbers from 10 to 50 and that is a set range.

5

00:00:14,520  -->  00:00:19,380
So there's another way to use a while loop where we don't actually know exactly how many times it will

6

00:00:19,380  -->  00:00:20,890
run it's not pre-determined.

7

00:00:21,120  -->  00:00:24,010
So this annoy o matic that we're going to make it.

8

00:00:24,130  -->  00:00:29,360
It's a fancy term for an annoying Web site that constantly asks you Are We There Yet.

9

00:00:29,430  -->  00:00:31,280
Until you enter the word yes or yeah.

10

00:00:31,500  -->  00:00:34,250
Anything else to ask you Are we there yet again.

11

00:00:34,290  -->  00:00:36,690
So let me show you I'll refresh the page.

12

00:00:36,810  -->  00:00:37,830
Are we there yet.

13

00:00:38,010  -->  00:00:40,350
Let's say no.

14

00:00:40,410  -->  00:00:41,800
Are we there yet.

15

00:00:41,850  -->  00:00:42,860
Not yet.

16

00:00:43,050  -->  00:00:43,830
Are we there yet.

17

00:00:43,830  -->  00:00:45,950
And now let's say Yes.

18

00:00:46,050  -->  00:00:47,930
And it tells us yes we finally made it.

19

00:00:48,240  -->  00:00:50,070
So that's what we're going to make to start.

20

00:00:50,130  -->  00:00:51,230
So to get going.

21

00:00:51,450  -->  00:00:56,260
We need to have a file with our HMO.

22

00:00:57,060  -->  00:01:02,730
And I just called mine and noid HMO and then we're going to add in our scripts tag

23

00:01:06,480  -->  00:01:07,860
and then we'll need to make the file.

24

00:01:07,860  -->  00:01:09,200
So let's call this annoyed.

25

00:01:09,320  -->  00:01:14,390
Yes let's make our new file a noise.

26

00:01:14,470  -->  00:01:24,160
J.S. in the same directory and I always like to add my alert connected just to make sure.

27

00:01:24,250  -->  00:01:31,760
Now let's open up our version and we won't see anything on the page but it should say connected.

28

00:01:31,800  -->  00:01:32,580
All right.

29

00:01:32,580  -->  00:01:37,180
So the first thing that we want to do is just ask a user are we there yet.

30

00:01:37,320  -->  00:01:44,550
So we'll make it a variable called the answer equal to prompt.

31

00:01:44,550  -->  00:01:47,320
Are we there yet.

32

00:01:47,990  -->  00:01:50,390
Save that.

33

00:01:50,520  -->  00:01:54,760
So then the next step is to check did the user say yes.

34

00:01:55,140  -->  00:02:05,170
So we could use an if statement like this if answer equals equals yes then we'll do an alert.

35

00:02:05,580  -->  00:02:16,410
Yay we made it and that's great and we could have an else where we then ask again and you don't have

36

00:02:16,410  -->  00:02:17,390
to do this part.

37

00:02:17,580  -->  00:02:22,860
But I'm just illustrating to you without a while loop we could do this but it will only run one time

38

00:02:23,340  -->  00:02:25,290
so it will ask are we there yet.

39

00:02:25,350  -->  00:02:29,150
And if I enter no then it will run the else.

40

00:02:29,160  -->  00:02:31,780
Var answer equals are we there yet again.

41

00:02:32,040  -->  00:02:33,390
And then nothing else happens.

42

00:02:33,480  -->  00:02:37,950
So I'll show you that refresh are we there yet.

43

00:02:37,980  -->  00:02:39,630
No.

44

00:02:39,630  -->  00:02:40,480
Are we there yet.

45

00:02:40,590  -->  00:02:43,440
No and that's it.

46

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:48,900
So rather than using just a simple conditional we're going to use a while loop but it's going to use

47

00:02:48,900  -->  00:02:51,020
a lot of the same code that we have here.

48

00:02:51,420  -->  00:02:57,540
So we just write while answer is not equal to yes.

49

00:02:57,540  -->  00:03:03,420
So while the user has not said yes we're going to prompt them again.

50

00:03:04,940  -->  00:03:06,540
And that's all there is to it.

51

00:03:06,540  -->  00:03:10,550
So while the answer is not equal to the word yes let's ask them again.

52

00:03:10,710  -->  00:03:11,850
Are we there yet.

53

00:03:12,270  -->  00:03:21,150
And then finally at the very end we can just have an alert that says hey we made it and this won't run

54

00:03:21,390  -->  00:03:23,150
Intel this loop is over.

55

00:03:23,180  -->  00:03:28,450
And so that means that the user has to have typed in yes in order to get this far.

56

00:03:28,530  -->  00:03:33,440
So let's try it out go back to the browser are we there yet.

57

00:03:33,450  -->  00:03:34,370
No.

58

00:03:35,050  -->  00:03:35,610
Nope.

59

00:03:35,760  -->  00:03:36,460
No.

60

00:03:36,480  -->  00:03:37,420
No.

61

00:03:37,440  -->  00:03:38,450
Anything we want.

62

00:03:38,520  -->  00:03:42,640
And then as soon as we type the word yes it tells us yea we made.

63

00:03:43,230  -->  00:03:47,130
So I wanted to do this to show you that you can use a while loop in another way.

64

00:03:47,340  -->  00:03:51,580
So this is not a pre-determined loop that runs 10 times or five times.

65

00:03:51,600  -->  00:03:54,760
It can vary and it's all up to user input.

66

00:03:54,810  -->  00:03:59,580
So there was one more requirement which is that we could also type the word Yeah.

67

00:03:59,820  -->  00:04:02,040
Why E.H. instead of yes.

68

00:04:02,060  -->  00:04:04,510
And either one would work.

69

00:04:04,560  -->  00:04:06,200
So that's pretty easy to implement.

70

00:04:06,420  -->  00:04:13,290
All we need to do is add in a another part of this conditional where we want to add an and well answer

71

00:04:13,290  -->  00:04:14,510
is not equal to yes.

72

00:04:14,550  -->  00:04:17,790
And answer is not equal to.

73

00:04:18,180  -->  00:04:18,980
Yeah.

74

00:04:19,200  -->  00:04:20,410
Then we'll ask again.

75

00:04:20,520  -->  00:04:22,050
And that's it.

76

00:04:22,050  -->  00:04:28,870
So refresh types of thing it keeps asking then I could enter.

77

00:04:28,920  -->  00:04:29,810
Yeah.

78

00:04:30,120  -->  00:04:34,830
And it says We made it and I can also do that entering Yes.

79

00:04:35,520  -->  00:04:40,500
So there's a version 2 here that's just a little bit more advanced where you don't have to enter the

80

00:04:40,500  -->  00:04:41,360
exact word.

81

00:04:41,400  -->  00:04:46,530
Yes or yeah only you could enter any phrase as long as has.

82

00:04:46,550  -->  00:04:48,330
Yes or yeah in it.

83

00:04:48,330  -->  00:04:50,040
So I'll show you.

84

00:04:50,250  -->  00:04:51,670
It could be something like.

85

00:04:52,020  -->  00:04:59,040
Yes we are which currently doesn't work in our other version because it's checking to see if the entire

86

00:04:59,040  -->  00:05:00,780
string is yes or yeah.

87

00:05:00,840  -->  00:05:07,620
So what we want to do is check if the string contains Yes if part of it matches yes but not all of it

88

00:05:07,620  -->  00:05:08,500
necessarily.

89

00:05:08,700  -->  00:05:13,120
So to do that there's a method we can use called index of.

90

00:05:13,860  -->  00:05:15,990
So I'll show you an example in the con..

91

00:05:15,990  -->  00:05:23,490
If I make a string called Hello world and I use index of.

92

00:05:23,760  -->  00:05:30,690
So as Tiare index of in in parentheses I give it a string like w.

93

00:05:31,050  -->  00:05:39,460
It's going to give me the number where w occurs which is 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6.

94

00:05:39,900  -->  00:05:47,700
But I can also use it on a full word like world and it tells me that world occurs starting at index

95

00:05:47,700  -->  00:05:51,410
6 and if I try and do something that doesn't exist.

96

00:05:51,420  -->  00:05:55,740
So in our case let's try Yes that's not in Hello world.

97

00:05:55,740  -->  00:05:59,900
It gives me negative 1 so I can use that to my advantage.

98

00:06:00,000  -->  00:06:05,070
So I want to check is yes anywhere in the input string anywhere an answer.

99

00:06:05,340  -->  00:06:12,840
So to do that and it go back down here and for our version to I'm just going to keep our initial code

100

00:06:12,860  -->  00:06:17,350
and commented out and then all right version 2.

101

00:06:17,930  -->  00:06:19,260
And put this down here.

102

00:06:19,620  -->  00:06:21,550
So this is going to stay the same.

103

00:06:21,600  -->  00:06:23,400
This is going to be different.

104

00:06:23,490  -->  00:06:28,910
So we're going to want something like answer that index of.

105

00:06:30,060  -->  00:06:31,150
Yes.

106

00:06:31,590  -->  00:06:36,780
And we want to see is it equal to negative 1.

107

00:06:36,780  -->  00:06:41,020
So that means that the word yes does not exist inside of our answer.

108

00:06:41,280  -->  00:06:44,610
So let's try that out.

109

00:06:45,010  -->  00:06:47,100
Refresh are we there yet.

110

00:06:47,100  -->  00:06:48,110
No.

111

00:06:48,120  -->  00:06:48,630
Are we there yet.

112

00:06:48,630  -->  00:06:49,560
No.

113

00:06:49,560  -->  00:06:50,450
Are we there yet.

114

00:06:50,490  -->  00:06:52,690
Yes I think so.

115

00:06:53,370  -->  00:06:55,630
And it says yeah we made it.

116

00:06:55,910  -->  00:06:58,500
Try it again and let's try.

117

00:06:58,500  -->  00:06:59,780
We are there.

118

00:07:00,090  -->  00:07:01,440
Yes.

119

00:07:01,620  -->  00:07:03,050
And it tells us we made it.

120

00:07:03,360  -->  00:07:03,600
OK.

121

00:07:03,600  -->  00:07:07,430
So that's version 2 and that's all we needed to do there.

122

00:07:07,500  -->  00:07:08,940
So that's all there is to version 2.

123

00:07:08,940  -->  00:07:14,220
I just want to show that you can use index of to make your input checking a little bit more flexible
