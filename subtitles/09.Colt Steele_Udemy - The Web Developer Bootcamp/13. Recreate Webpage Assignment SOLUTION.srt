1

00:00:01,290  -->  00:00:05,820
All right so this will be a solution video like always you can just find the code in that description

2

00:00:06,000  -->  00:00:07,000
and download that.

3

00:00:07,140  -->  00:00:11,900
But I'll give you a chance to follow along if you want to code along while I create this solution.

4

00:00:12,750  -->  00:00:13,080
OK.

5

00:00:13,110  -->  00:00:15,560
So first thing as always we need a file.

6

00:00:15,870  -->  00:00:21,400
I created one called Rusty h t m l create a file save it dot each team up.

7

00:00:21,600  -->  00:00:24,380
We need our skeleton our boiler plate.

8

00:00:24,570  -->  00:00:27,700
Let's give it a title of rusty steel.

9

00:00:28,320  -->  00:00:35,700
And then the first thing that stands out is the largest heading which should be an H1 and that just

10

00:00:35,700  -->  00:00:38,430
is rusty Still

11

00:00:42,480  -->  00:00:46,800
the next thing is some text that I think should probably be a paragraph.

12

00:00:46,890  -->  00:00:57,930
So hi I'm a dog wolf so let's see what we have going on so far looks good.

13

00:00:58,980  -->  00:01:01,590
So next up we can tackle the image.

14

00:01:02,880  -->  00:01:06,970
So I have a few images of resti here.

15

00:01:07,050  -->  00:01:08,010
They're all pretty adorable.

16

00:01:08,010  -->  00:01:09,240
I'm going to go with this one.

17

00:01:09,690  -->  00:01:14,840
So I'm going to copy the image you Arel in case you didn't know about that right quick copy image or

18

00:01:14,840  -->  00:01:16,440
else you'll be doing that a lot.

19

00:01:16,430  -->  00:01:19,480
Any time you want to use an image in your aged him L..

20

00:01:20,100  -->  00:01:23,070
So we need an image tag.

21

00:01:24,270  -->  00:01:27,150
We set the source equal to that you are all.

22

00:01:27,360  -->  00:01:33,350
Remember there's no closing image tag just self-closing image source equals something.

23

00:01:33,750  -->  00:01:34,740
Let's take a look.

24

00:01:35,040  -->  00:01:36,800
OK so far so good.

25

00:01:37,170  -->  00:01:41,020
Let's go ahead and add in some of my favorite places.

26

00:01:41,340  -->  00:01:47,570
So let's go with an H for to start.

27

00:01:49,520  -->  00:01:53,220
And let's see how that looks.

28

00:01:53,310  -->  00:01:55,440
That looks a little bit small.

29

00:01:55,440  -->  00:01:58,240
So that might be an age three.

30

00:01:59,010  -->  00:02:03,000
And this really isn't the point of the exercise so you don't have to spend too much time.

31

00:02:03,000  -->  00:02:03,350
OK.

32

00:02:03,360  -->  00:02:05,530
There you go to page three.

33

00:02:06,330  -->  00:02:11,750
It's really more just identifying that something is a heading not so much matching exactly the size

34

00:02:11,760  -->  00:02:17,250
because we can use the Assessed later on to specify you know it sounds like there is only six sizes

35

00:02:17,250  -->  00:02:18,440
of headings.

36

00:02:18,540  -->  00:02:25,980
There are six different headings but we can style any of them to be 50 pixel font size 51 52 at 100

37

00:02:26,130  -->  00:02:27,680
200 370.

38

00:02:27,720  -->  00:02:28,950
We can do whatever we want.

39

00:02:28,950  -->  00:02:31,360
Style wise but there are just six elements.

40

00:02:31,500  -->  00:02:34,200
So again we're not really working with any style yet.

41

00:02:34,260  -->  00:02:35,800
So if we want it to be exact.

42

00:02:35,850  -->  00:02:37,440
This is an H3.

43

00:02:38,100  -->  00:02:51,690
So next up we have a nice little list an unordered list with three allies the beach the dog park and

44

00:02:52,770  -->  00:02:54,340
the fire hydrant.

45

00:02:55,120  -->  00:02:57,900
These actually are his favorite places in order.

46

00:02:57,900  -->  00:03:02,120
So maybe this should have been an ordered place rather than an unordered list.

47

00:03:02,170  -->  00:03:04,160
That's for another day.

48

00:03:05,190  -->  00:03:06,960
Let's double check.

49

00:03:06,960  -->  00:03:08,820
Looks good.

50

00:03:09,090  -->  00:03:13,130
The only other thing that we need now is our final paragraph at the bottom.

51

00:03:13,140  -->  00:03:16,640
Make sure to follow me on.

52

00:03:17,040  -->  00:03:18,330
And then a tag

53

00:03:21,120  -->  00:03:25,840
inside that HIV one Instagram.

54

00:03:25,950  -->  00:03:29,480
And then I have just dogs of Instagram open.

55

00:03:29,550  -->  00:03:31,620
Feel free to use any link whatsoever.

56

00:03:31,650  -->  00:03:34,180
It really doesn't matter.

57

00:03:34,200  -->  00:03:35,870
Let's check it out.

58

00:03:35,940  -->  00:03:38,050
Make sure to follow me on Instagram.

59

00:03:38,100  -->  00:03:42,630
It is purple because I've been to this link before.

60

00:03:42,960  -->  00:03:47,680
So like I said you've not visited our blue links or you have art by default purple.

61

00:03:47,730  -->  00:03:49,820
We can change that with the SS later.

62

00:03:50,190  -->  00:03:54,390
All right so let's just compare again.

63

00:03:55,290  -->  00:03:56,350
Looks good to me.
