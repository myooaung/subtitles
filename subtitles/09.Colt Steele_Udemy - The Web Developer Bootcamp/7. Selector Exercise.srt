1

00:00:00,460  -->  00:00:00,950
All right.

2

00:00:00,960  -->  00:00:02,990
So it's time for a quick exercise.

3

00:00:03,000  -->  00:00:06,300
This one is going to cover the different DOM selectors that we just discussed.

4

00:00:06,600  -->  00:00:14,340
So the way that works giving you some H M L simple shemale and H-1 three four paragraphs.

5

00:00:14,340  -->  00:00:16,920
Some have ideas some have classes some have nothing.

6

00:00:17,040  -->  00:00:22,350
And what I want you to do is come up with four different ways to select the first paragraph.

7

00:00:22,440  -->  00:00:27,270
So at least for there's more than that using the different methods that we talked about Document get

8

00:00:27,300  -->  00:00:33,750
element by ID by class name by tag name Corey selector queries like are all mix and match those and

9

00:00:33,750  -->  00:00:36,340
come up with four different ways to select this.

10

00:00:36,660  -->  00:00:38,940
If you'd like you can download the code attached to it.

11

00:00:39,060  -->  00:00:43,980
Otherwise go ahead and just type this up yourself come up with for examples puzzle video and I'll be

12

00:00:43,980  -->  00:00:46,440
back in just a few seconds.

13

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:50,300
OK so let's talk about how we could solve this.

14

00:00:50,310  -->  00:00:52,760
I have the H Tim L file here.

15

00:00:53,130  -->  00:00:57,990
We've got an H1 and here's the paragraph that we're after the first paragraph.

16

00:00:57,990  -->  00:01:01,230
It has ID equal to first class is special.

17

00:01:01,230  -->  00:01:03,650
And then there's some other paragraphs that we don't really care about.

18

00:01:03,990  -->  00:01:06,760
So to select it we have a few different options.

19

00:01:06,930  -->  00:01:09,500
Let's start with get element by ID.

20

00:01:09,500  -->  00:01:16,030
So just to document type get element by ID first.

21

00:01:16,980  -->  00:01:22,710
We could also select based off of the ID first using queries selector to document that query selector

22

00:01:22,710  -->  00:01:23,730
.

23

00:01:23,730  -->  00:01:30,840
And we can't just say first we also need to see a selector syntax which means adding that Octa Thorp

24

00:01:30,930  -->  00:01:36,020
which tells Querrey selector that this is an id called first and we get the same thing.

25

00:01:36,420  -->  00:01:40,600
So we can also select based off of the class which is special.

26

00:01:40,800  -->  00:01:50,010
So we could do document that get elements by class name and the class name is special and that's going

27

00:01:50,010  -->  00:01:52,700
to give us two elements that have that class name.

28

00:01:52,710  -->  00:02:00,310
So to narrow it down to just the first one we would add on zero afterwards square brackets zero.

29

00:02:00,390  -->  00:02:02,710
And that gives us the first paragraph.

30

00:02:02,880  -->  00:02:10,500
We could also use query selector and we use the dot syntax because it's a class.

31

00:02:10,500  -->  00:02:15,780
This time we don't need the square bracket zero because regular old query selector only gives us the

32

00:02:15,780  -->  00:02:16,850
first result.

33

00:02:17,070  -->  00:02:23,490
If we used query selector all we could add zero afterwards and it would work the same way.

34

00:02:23,490  -->  00:02:25,920
We get the same first paragraph.

35

00:02:26,010  -->  00:02:31,260
The other option we have is to select based off of the tag name which is paragraph or P so we can do

36

00:02:31,260  -->  00:02:40,180
document Get elements by tag name pass in P and that gives us all paragraphs.

37

00:02:40,500  -->  00:02:44,290
So we would do bracket zero.

38

00:02:44,340  -->  00:02:45,980
We could also use query selector.

39

00:02:46,020  -->  00:02:52,840
So document that query selector and we don't need to change what's inside the print CS because India

40

00:02:52,880  -->  00:02:55,410
says this is how you select a paragraph tag.

41

00:02:55,620  -->  00:02:57,780
So query selector will give us the first one.

42

00:02:57,850  -->  00:03:07,320
So you can see here or we could also do queries like are all and add in zero.

43

00:03:07,530  -->  00:03:12,140
We can also make life harder on ourselves and use some more creative CSSA selectors.

44

00:03:12,240  -->  00:03:20,250
For instance I know that this paragraph the first one is the first paragraph directly after an H-1 they're

45

00:03:20,250  -->  00:03:28,260
adjacent so I could write a CSSA selector that says Select the paragraphs after an H1 or adjacent to

46

00:03:28,320  -->  00:03:29,840
each one with the plus sign.

47

00:03:29,970  -->  00:03:31,320
So that would look like this.

48

00:03:31,320  -->  00:03:32,880
If I really wanted to do it.

49

00:03:33,120  -->  00:03:39,150
Cory selector and that would be H-1 plus paragraph.

50

00:03:39,720  -->  00:03:42,920
And that also gives me the first paragraph.

51

00:03:42,960  -->  00:03:45,630
There are plenty of other ways that we could do it as well.

52

00:03:45,630  -->  00:03:48,090
We could do first of type paragraph.

53

00:03:48,210  -->  00:03:53,250
We can get pretty creative but there's no reason to do that if we can just get it with an ID or a class

54

00:03:53,250  -->  00:03:54,690
name or tag name.

55

00:03:54,990  -->  00:03:55,220
OK.

56

00:03:55,230  -->  00:04:00,000
So hopefully you are able to come up with at least four of those as you can see there's a lot of options

57

00:04:00,120  -->  00:04:03,760
just like in C S S we can target something in so many different ways.

58

00:04:03,780  -->  00:04:08,630
There's not really one right answer in this case because it has an ID.

59

00:04:08,730  -->  00:04:14,520
I would probably just use queries selector with the ID which is what we did up here.

60

00:04:14,520  -->  00:04:15,800
Or get element by ID
