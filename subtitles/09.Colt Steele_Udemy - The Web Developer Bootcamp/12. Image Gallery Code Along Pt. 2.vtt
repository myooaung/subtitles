00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:06.790
So the next thing that we want to do is add in the text at the top so needs to look like this.

2

00:00:06.960  -->  00:00:11.020
And fortunately this is relatively simple compared to making this image grid.

3

00:00:11.370  -->  00:00:13.550
So the first thing we need to do is get the font.

4

00:00:13.770  -->  00:00:15.360
This font is called Railway.

5

00:00:15.360  -->  00:00:18.130
It's one of the Google fonts that we've seen so far.

6

00:00:18.390  -->  00:00:22.950
So I'm going to go to Google fonts and look for real.

7

00:00:22.980  -->  00:00:23.590
Here we go.

8

00:00:23.620  -->  00:00:32.430
It's the top one here use and then I'm going to go ahead and grab normal.

9

00:00:32.520  -->  00:00:37.090
And also let's do 800.

10

00:00:38.220  -->  00:00:40.410
And then we'll include this

11

00:00:44.370  -->  00:00:46.170
into our HMO.

12

00:00:46.560  -->  00:00:52.710
So we now have access to that font and then all we need to do is add in the text.

13

00:00:52.710  -->  00:00:59.760
First of all so up top I'm going to make it a paragraph and I'm just going to put my name which is what

14

00:00:59.760  -->  00:01:01.820
I had here separated by a slash.

15

00:01:02.160  -->  00:01:04.390
We can put you know put whatever you want here.

16

00:01:04.410  -->  00:01:10.650
This could be Texas could be photography blog or walk into my blog but just some text I'm keeping it

17

00:01:10.650  -->  00:01:17.100
simple and then save that and then we'll go over here.

18

00:01:17.410  -->  00:01:26.760
Select paragraph and we'll just say font family real way and let's just see what we end up with.

19

00:01:27.470  -->  00:01:27.950
OK.

20

00:01:28.260  -->  00:01:30.490
So not the most exciting.

21

00:01:30.630  -->  00:01:31.960
Not quite there yet.

22

00:01:31.980  -->  00:01:36.160
It's too small and it's not spaced correctly.

23

00:01:36.210  -->  00:01:38.900
We need it to move over 1.6 percent as well.

24

00:01:39.000  -->  00:01:43.030
Just like this image so to move it in line we can start there.

25

00:01:43.260  -->  00:01:52.620
All we need to do is go over to a paragraph and add in our margin left and that's just one point six

26

00:01:52.650  -->  00:01:55.190
six percent.

27

00:01:55.520  -->  00:01:59.750
We are fresh OK now it spaced correctly.

28

00:01:59.880  -->  00:02:03.340
So one more thing that we want to do is definitely increase the font size.

29

00:02:03.780  -->  00:02:10.020
So I know that the font size that I used here is 23 pixels and not only that but I used font weight

30

00:02:10.020  -->  00:02:12.980
of 800 which is why I had to select that.

31

00:02:12.990  -->  00:02:17.240
So in here will say font size 23 pixels.

32

00:02:17.460  -->  00:02:20.030
I'll show you what that looks like.

33

00:02:20.190  -->  00:02:23.500
So it's bigger but it's still not as bold.

34

00:02:23.520  -->  00:02:27.660
So then we go back and add in font weight.

35

00:02:28.080  -->  00:02:30.750
Eight hundred and save.

36

00:02:31.260  -->  00:02:33.610
Now we were fresh in the fall.

37

00:02:33.610  -->  00:02:39.810
It's looking close but we're still missing one thing which is the fact that I didn't use upper case

38

00:02:39.810  -->  00:02:47.800
text so I can do that using text transform or I could alter the HDMI.

39

00:02:48.230  -->  00:02:52.470
So I'm just going to do that here text transform uppercase.

40

00:02:52.590  -->  00:02:54.880
Now we get all uppercase.

41

00:02:54.970  -->  00:02:55.960
There we go.

42

00:02:56.370  -->  00:03:02.790
So you can see just with a quick example why you would potentially use text transform because it's much

43

00:03:02.790  -->  00:03:08.400
faster and easier just to add one to assess property rather than having to retype every single letter

44

00:03:08.400  -->  00:03:12.380
yourself especially if you have a longer string of characters.

45

00:03:12.990  -->  00:03:16.690
OK so now the last missing piece is this little line here.

46

00:03:16.820  -->  00:03:22.980
I know it's pretty faint but there's a line right here and it goes in line with this first image so

47

00:03:22.980  -->  00:03:24.940
it doesn't go all the way across.

48

00:03:25.230  -->  00:03:28.160
It goes 30 percent of the way across.

49

00:03:28.170  -->  00:03:34.390
So the way that we're going to do that is it's actually just a border on the bottom of it's inspected

50

00:03:34.770  -->  00:03:36.560
on the bottom of this paragraph.

51

00:03:36.960  -->  00:03:43.500
So you can see that the paragraph itself goes 30 percent the way across it ends here and then it just

52

00:03:43.500  -->  00:03:46.000
border bottom that we turned on.

53

00:03:46.500  -->  00:03:51.360
So let's go back to our C SS and under our paragraph.

54

00:03:51.480  -->  00:03:58.380
Let's start by giving it border bottom and let's make it obvious to start so let's do like three pixels

55

00:03:58.830  -->  00:03:59.830
solid red.

56

00:03:59.880  -->  00:04:06.370
So we'll save and refresh and just see that the border goes all the way across.

57

00:04:06.490  -->  00:04:08.420
And I guess it doesn't look too bad.

58

00:04:08.430  -->  00:04:10.460
We definitely want to fix this here.

59

00:04:10.800  -->  00:04:16.260
But rather than do that I'm going to change the width so that it only goes 30 percent of the way across

60

00:04:16.260  -->  00:04:16.790
.

61

00:04:16.830  -->  00:04:18.170
So we'll start with that.

62

00:04:18.390  -->  00:04:24.220
So that's just a matter of setting the width to the paragraph 30 percent.

63

00:04:25.250  -->  00:04:32.730
OK so now it ends there then the next thing is making the color match so the color that I use is very

64

00:04:32.730  -->  00:04:33.810
very faint.

65

00:04:34.080  -->  00:04:36.090
Just going to change this here.

66

00:04:36.150  -->  00:04:38.950
It's a hexadecimal color.

67

00:04:39.000  -->  00:04:44.780
EF 1 EF 1 EF 1 looks like that.

68

00:04:45.630  -->  00:04:51.140
You can see it's very faint and I think I had it at two pixels rather than three.

69

00:04:51.450  -->  00:04:53.030
So very minor change.

70

00:04:53.070  -->  00:04:59.520
Change that to be two pixels and the very last thing is the spacing.

71

00:04:59.520  -->  00:05:04.540
So here you can see we have some space between the text and the border.

72

00:05:04.590  -->  00:05:12.200
And here we don't so remember space between an element and its border is padding.

73

00:05:12.450  -->  00:05:18.720
So if we inspect you can verify that I can see that green padding there.

74

00:05:19.320  -->  00:05:22.190
So we just need to get padding going here as well.

75

00:05:22.200  -->  00:05:25.470
So in RC SS We're just going to do padding bottom

76

00:05:28.370  -->  00:05:33.500
20 pixels and we'll go back refresh.

77

00:05:33.570  -->  00:05:35.740
And now we have a little bit of space there.

78

00:05:35.760  -->  00:05:40.350
Now of course feel free to play with this however you like if you preferred that line going all the

79

00:05:40.350  -->  00:05:42.360
way across or no line at all.

80

00:05:42.400  -->  00:05:47.610
You want to make the text bigger if you want it to make it get rid of the padding or add more padding

81

00:05:47.910  -->  00:05:51.350
if you want more images going across the screen rather than just three.

82

00:05:51.360  -->  00:05:53.430
There's all sorts of things you can do.

83

00:05:53.430  -->  00:05:56.770
All right so I hope you enjoyed making something that looks somewhat OK.
