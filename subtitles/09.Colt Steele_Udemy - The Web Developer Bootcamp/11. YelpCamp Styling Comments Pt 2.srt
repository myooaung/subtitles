00:00:00,420  -->  00:00:05,520
Welcome back in this lesson we're going to finish off the styling of the campground show page at the

2

00:00:05,520  -->  00:00:06,550
end of the last video.

3

00:00:06,630  -->  00:00:08,540
I mentioned some of the changes that we need to make.

4

00:00:08,640  -->  00:00:10,970
That can't be addressed with pure bootstrap.

5

00:00:10,980  -->  00:00:13,050
We need to add in some custom styles.

6

00:00:13,050  -->  00:00:18,570
So we need to change the width of this image here so that it takes up 100 percent of the thumbnail.

7

00:00:18,750  -->  00:00:21,050
We wanted to add some padding in here.

8

00:00:21,120  -->  00:00:25,050
This is what it should look like where we have padding and you can see the image takes up the entire

9

00:00:25,050  -->  00:00:25,880
container.

10

00:00:26,280  -->  00:00:31,810
And to accomplish that we could go into the showed at each Yes and add a style tag up here.

11

00:00:32,280  -->  00:00:34,050
But that's not really a great idea.

12

00:00:34,050  -->  00:00:39,840
So instead we're going to add in our first custom style sheet and to make that work we're going to make

13

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:42,960
a public directory just like we did in an earlier lesson.

14

00:00:43,110  -->  00:00:48,790
So I'm going to make directory public and then I'll make another directory inside of public.

15

00:00:48,870  -->  00:00:55,350
This one will be called style sheets so public slash style sheets and we'll have another one eventually

16

00:00:55,350  -->  00:01:00,810
for our javascript's the front and Javascript and we'll hit enter and then we're going to make a single

17

00:01:00,810  -->  00:01:09,210
file inside of stylesheets public sosh style sheets slash and we'll call this mean Dotsie SS Just like

18

00:01:09,210  -->  00:01:10,000
that.

19

00:01:10,470  -->  00:01:11,260
OK.

20

00:01:11,520  -->  00:01:13,040
Now we want to open that up.

21

00:01:13,380  -->  00:01:19,830
So we'll open that file up stylesheets main gutsiest us and let's start by adding something really obvious

22

00:01:19,830  -->  00:01:26,790
in here like setting the background color for the body to be purple and save and then we have to go

23

00:01:26,790  -->  00:01:28,140
ahead and get this connected.

24

00:01:28,140  -->  00:01:36,790
So in the app case we have to add a line in here where we do an app dot use Express that's static.

25

00:01:37,380  -->  00:01:41,790
And then what we did last time was just add in public but there's actually a slightly better way of

26

00:01:41,790  -->  00:01:44,380
doing it that I didn't want to show right away.

27

00:01:44,400  -->  00:01:50,370
But I mean to show it now all we have to do is add an underscore underscore dear name directory name

28

00:01:50,880  -->  00:01:57,050
plus slash public dir name refers to the directory that this script was running.

29

00:01:57,180  -->  00:01:58,630
So let me show you what that looks like.

30

00:01:58,800  -->  00:02:07,920
If I just do a console but log underscore underscore to your name just like that and save and restart

31

00:02:07,920  -->  00:02:10,190
the server.

32

00:02:12,000  -->  00:02:13,440
Notice what I get right here.

33

00:02:13,530  -->  00:02:19,560
This is the directory name the whole path workspace lushly of camp slash v 5.

34

00:02:19,710  -->  00:02:26,940
So by adding dir name plus slash public we're just being safer because if potentially somehow this changed

35

00:02:26,940  -->  00:02:30,390
the current directory got weird something happened that we weren't expecting.

36

00:02:30,450  -->  00:02:36,210
Which hopefully never does but if it did do your name will always be the directory that the script lives

37

00:02:36,210  -->  00:02:36,650
in.

38

00:02:36,900  -->  00:02:41,240
So we're just being safer and adding slash public and it's just the more conventional way of doing it

39

00:02:41,250  -->  00:02:41,860
in.

40

00:02:42,060  -->  00:02:43,820
We won't see a difference at all.

41

00:02:43,860  -->  00:02:44,920
So we'll save.

42

00:02:44,930  -->  00:02:50,140
We can get rid of this and what we've done is added in our simple mind.

43

00:02:50,190  -->  00:02:52,390
SS But we haven't linked to it yet.

44

00:02:52,530  -->  00:02:54,500
So we've served the public directory.

45

00:02:54,600  -->  00:02:59,460
We're now serving everything in that directory which is really just a single folder stylesheets and

46

00:02:59,460  -->  00:03:01,540
a single file may end up us.

47

00:03:01,620  -->  00:03:05,510
But now let's go link to that file and let's do it on the header file.

48

00:03:05,580  -->  00:03:14,920
So I'm going to C9 views slash Parshall's slash hetter and then up top in the head after bootstrap.

49

00:03:14,980  -->  00:03:22,200
I'm going to add another link tag and this one is going to be H ref equals slash stylesheets

50

00:03:24,660  -->  00:03:31,330
slash main C Ss and then we'll also add in row here to be style sheet.

51

00:03:31,950  -->  00:03:32,500
OK.

52

00:03:32,850  -->  00:03:38,340
So we've now linked to hopefully our style sheet that we're now serving from the public directory.

53

00:03:38,340  -->  00:03:40,680
And let's test it out if it worked.

54

00:03:40,740  -->  00:03:45,350
It will be on every single page because every page that has the header partial included.

55

00:03:45,630  -->  00:03:46,380
Let's test that out.

56

00:03:46,380  -->  00:03:48,450
We're just going to our landing page.

57

00:03:48,450  -->  00:03:48,980
There we go.

58

00:03:48,990  -->  00:03:55,230
It's all purple and if we go to view our campground There's also a purple background totally up to you

59

00:03:55,230  -->  00:03:56,510
if you want to keep it as purple.

60

00:03:56,610  -->  00:03:57,620
I'm going to change it back.

61

00:03:57,750  -->  00:04:03,210
But I am going to add in the style that we won and those styles are going to affect thumbnails.

62

00:04:03,210  -->  00:04:07,050
So these are the thumbnails as well as this thumbnail.

63

00:04:07,080  -->  00:04:13,170
We're going to make the image take up 100 percent of the width so on both the show page and the index

64

00:04:13,170  -->  00:04:18,000
page we want that to happen so we can go back and change and upsy assess.

65

00:04:18,180  -->  00:04:21,750
So we'll start by selecting all images inside of thumbnails.

66

00:04:21,900  -->  00:04:25,300
So we need thumbnail because it's a bootstrap class.

67

00:04:25,550  -->  00:04:31,290
And then image tag with the space between them that's all image tags inside of thumbnails.

68

00:04:31,290  -->  00:04:36,180
And then we just want to set the width to be 100 percent just like that.

69

00:04:36,300  -->  00:04:42,420
And if we save and refresh and let's go to a show page you can see our image now takes up 100 percent

70

00:04:42,420  -->  00:04:43,510
of this thumbnail.

71

00:04:43,860  -->  00:04:48,210
Then we need to solve this padding issue which is really easy to fix as well where we want to get rid

72

00:04:48,210  -->  00:04:51,820
of that spacing to do that we need to select the thumbnail itself.

73

00:04:51,870  -->  00:04:56,350
The thumbnail div and get rid of the padding and just set it to be zero.

74

00:04:56,490  -->  00:05:01,580
So Dot thumbnail padding 0.

75

00:05:01,890  -->  00:05:02,930
Let's save.

76

00:05:03,120  -->  00:05:05,260
Keep your eye on this padding there.

77

00:05:05,280  -->  00:05:06,130
Now it's gone.

78

00:05:06,510  -->  00:05:11,230
And if we go back to our index page you can see these are also now flush.

79

00:05:11,280  -->  00:05:12,980
We don't have any padding there either.

80

00:05:13,320  -->  00:05:17,100
I personally prefer it without the padding here with no space in between.

81

00:05:17,250  -->  00:05:22,290
But it is a matter of personal preference and if you do want that space back in there what you can do

82

00:05:22,320  -->  00:05:27,910
is not apply these styles this style in particular to every single thumbnail.

83

00:05:27,990  -->  00:05:34,290
Instead you could give on our show page you could give this thumbnail right here an ID or a special

84

00:05:34,290  -->  00:05:39,280
class and then you would only apply this paddings zero to that class or two that ID.

85

00:05:39,480  -->  00:05:44,970
But I'm going to do it to all of them and then the other issue we need to solve is the padding here

86

00:05:44,980  -->  00:05:45,380
.

87

00:05:45,780  -->  00:05:53,970
So inside of this caption ful if we inspect it that's the div that we created can see right here it's

88

00:05:53,970  -->  00:05:55,560
a div class caption full.

89

00:05:55,770  -->  00:06:00,870
We want to add some padding there and the number we decided on in the last video was 9 pixels.

90

00:06:00,930  -->  00:06:02,830
So let me close the con..

91

00:06:03,030  -->  00:06:08,850
Go back here and I'm just going to select rather than all caption foal's I'm only going to select the

92

00:06:08,850  -->  00:06:11,100
caption folds inside of a thumbnail.

93

00:06:11,220  -->  00:06:21,690
So Dot thumbnail space caption full and we'll give them padding of nine pixels just like this save let's

94

00:06:21,690  -->  00:06:23,130
refresh the page.

95

00:06:23,130  -->  00:06:23,750
There we go.

96

00:06:23,760  -->  00:06:26,130
We get that spacing that we're looking for.

97

00:06:26,130  -->  00:06:26,390
All right.

98

00:06:26,400  -->  00:06:27,610
So that's all I wanted to do.

99

00:06:27,780  -->  00:06:29,910
Let's quickly recap what we accomplished.

100

00:06:29,910  -->  00:06:36,470
We made a new file main Nazi SS and we put that inside of the public directory inside of stylesheets

101

00:06:36,840  -->  00:06:41,490
and eventually they will have more style sheets one for the landing page in particular and we'll also

102

00:06:41,490  -->  00:06:43,560
have javascript's that go in here as well.

103

00:06:43,680  -->  00:06:49,740
And then to actually use the public directory we have to interact Yes tell express to serve the public

104

00:06:49,740  -->  00:06:50,410
directory.

105

00:06:50,520  -->  00:06:55,230
And I showed you this underscore underscore your name and the very last thing is that we included it

106

00:06:55,230  -->  00:06:56,660
on the header file.

107

00:06:56,680  -->  00:07:01,300
It's just right here and we link to it with Slash stylesheets slash maned see SS
