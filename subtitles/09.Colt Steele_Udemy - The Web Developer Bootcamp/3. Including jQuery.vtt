00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:05.250
So now that you've heard my introduction to Jay Cory as well as my own opinion on teaching Jay query

2

00:00:05.430  -->  00:00:11.250
and the approach that we're taking here which to summarize briefly is we started with vanilla javascript

3

00:00:11.760  -->  00:00:15.130
and now that we're confident doing things that way we're moving on to Jay Querrey.

4

00:00:15.510  -->  00:00:20.770
So the first thing we need to talk about is how do we include a query into an application.

5

00:00:20.880  -->  00:00:26.430
So I'm going to start with a very simple application here just adding in my age to mouth and give it

6

00:00:26.430  -->  00:00:27.250
a title.

7

00:00:27.370  -->  00:00:28.310
Jay queery demo

8

00:00:30.840  -->  00:00:33.390
Jay on Jay queery is always lower case.

9

00:00:33.450  -->  00:00:37.990
Don't ask me why Q Is uppercase all that in just a few elements.

10

00:00:38.030  -->  00:00:38.310
J.

11

00:00:38.310  -->  00:00:39.380
Corey demo.

12

00:00:39.870  -->  00:00:46.710
Just like that and maybe an ally or two and these will just be random text.

13

00:00:47.100  -->  00:00:49.980
OK so three allies etc. you.

14

00:00:50.040  -->  00:00:52.440
And H-1 and will save.

15

00:00:52.710  -->  00:00:55.920
And of course we'll go ahead and open that in the browser.

16

00:00:56.580  -->  00:00:58.960
And here's our demo page.

17

00:00:59.190  -->  00:01:04.220
There are a few ways to add a query to our own application and to our own age html files.

18

00:01:04.440  -->  00:01:07.140
Remember that J query is just a javascript file.

19

00:01:07.230  -->  00:01:10.080
It's no different than the files that we've written so far.

20

00:01:10.080  -->  00:01:13.320
Like our color game dodge A-S or our To Do list.

21

00:01:13.410  -->  00:01:18.570
Yes or whatever javascript files we've created and linked using a script tag.

22

00:01:18.570  -->  00:01:21.990
So in both methods here we're using a script tag.

23

00:01:21.990  -->  00:01:24.900
The only difference is the source attribute.

24

00:01:25.080  -->  00:01:30.600
And in this case we're linking to the file locally and what that means is that I downloaded the code

25

00:01:30.600  -->  00:01:36.020
for a query and they put it in the same directory as my project and then I linked to it.

26

00:01:36.120  -->  00:01:43.530
So I'll show you how we do that if we go to the J Crew documentation and we click on download and then

27

00:01:43.530  -->  00:01:49.740
we need to pick a version and I'm going to go with the latest which is 2.1 point 4 and we have a few

28

00:01:49.740  -->  00:01:50.460
options.

29

00:01:50.550  -->  00:01:56.700
We can download the compressed production Jey query 2.0 point 1.4 and the uncompressed development version

30

00:01:56.700  -->  00:01:57.130
.

31

00:01:57.180  -->  00:01:58.500
I'm going to do both.

32

00:01:58.500  -->  00:02:03.330
Usually I would just do this one because it's compressed the whole point is that it's faster to load

33

00:02:03.340  -->  00:02:03.530
.

34

00:02:03.630  -->  00:02:05.380
But I do want to show you what it looks like.

35

00:02:05.550  -->  00:02:09.960
So I'm going to get the uncompress one and the compressed one and you can see if we get two different

36

00:02:09.960  -->  00:02:10.860
files.

37

00:02:10.860  -->  00:02:17.820
We have Jay queery to point one point for Dot J.S. and we have J queried 2.1 percent for men.

38

00:02:18.030  -->  00:02:19.080
Yes.

39

00:02:19.080  -->  00:02:22.310
So I'm going to open both of those up in sublime here.

40

00:02:22.530  -->  00:02:26.880
Just drag them in and let's take a look at them.

41

00:02:26.970  -->  00:02:29.720
So this file here is the uncompressed version.

42

00:02:29.970  -->  00:02:31.810
And as I scroll through.

43

00:02:32.310  -->  00:02:35.730
Notice that it's just one really long javascript file.

44

00:02:36.000  -->  00:02:44.730
It's over 9000 lines so we can include this file or we can include the minimized version which is the

45

00:02:44.730  -->  00:02:50.160
same code behind the scenes but when something is minimized or compressed all the whitespace is taken

46

00:02:50.160  -->  00:02:50.730
out.

47

00:02:50.730  -->  00:02:56.940
So all these returns all the comments are gone and all the names of variables and properties are shortened

48

00:02:56.940  -->  00:03:06.150
to single characters so you can see that we have things like em or we have things like A B C which are

49

00:03:06.150  -->  00:03:12.630
definitely not the names of properties and arguments inside if the uncompressed file so we can include

50

00:03:12.630  -->  00:03:13.320
either one.

51

00:03:13.500  -->  00:03:17.580
And to do that we just need to make sure that we add the files to the correct directory.

52

00:03:17.940  -->  00:03:22.540
So I'm going to make a new folder instead of my project and I'm going to call it lib.

53

00:03:22.710  -->  00:03:24.650
And we don't have to do this.

54

00:03:24.690  -->  00:03:30.780
We could just drag our two files to be in the same directory as our h team.

55

00:03:30.780  -->  00:03:33.100
I'll file and I'll start with it that way to show you.

56

00:03:33.330  -->  00:03:41.730
So I'm going to open up my H Tim L file and add a script here script tag and I need source equals and

57

00:03:41.760  -->  00:03:50.130
I need to write this name right here which is J query to point one point for Dot J us and we need that

58

00:03:50.130  -->  00:03:50.740
dash.

59

00:03:50.760  -->  00:03:55.750
So I'm going to copy it and just set the source to a query dash 2. 1.4.

60

00:03:55.780  -->  00:03:56.050
J.

61

00:03:56.060  -->  00:04:04.560
Yes and as long as this file J Curry demo aged him out is in the same place as Jay Querrey 2.1 14:4

62

00:04:04.890  -->  00:04:05.760
we should be good.

63

00:04:06.030  -->  00:04:11.670
So I'll save and open it back in the browser and refresh.

64

00:04:11.790  -->  00:04:17.150
If we open up the console we can actually type the word J Query and hit enter.

65

00:04:17.250  -->  00:04:22.050
And if we don't get an error that tells us that the query is correctly added to our application.

66

00:04:22.560  -->  00:04:29.370
So a better way to structure this is to actually put these in a separate directory called the lib just

67

00:04:29.370  -->  00:04:35.640
so that we can separate our own javascript files from library javascript files so that we don't confuse

68

00:04:35.640  -->  00:04:40.350
them and we don't clutter up our directory structure so it's not mandatory at all.

69

00:04:40.350  -->  00:04:42.220
As you saw we had Jay query working.

70

00:04:42.540  -->  00:04:46.320
But a better way to do it is to make a directory and we can call this anything.

71

00:04:46.440  -->  00:04:48.320
You could call it J-curve if you wanted to.

72

00:04:48.480  -->  00:04:51.820
I'm going to go with lib and then I need to change my link here.

73

00:04:51.840  -->  00:04:59.330
My source to be lib slash Jay query dashed to point one point four and I'll do mine.

74

00:04:59.550  -->  00:05:01.140
Yes and you don't have to do that.

75

00:05:01.140  -->  00:05:03.660
There's no difference in functionality.

76

00:05:03.660  -->  00:05:07.980
The only difference is that this is faster to load but I need to have that one here.

77

00:05:08.220  -->  00:05:10.350
So to reiterate we do not need both of them.

78

00:05:10.380  -->  00:05:13.810
We just need one and we need to link to that one correctly.

79

00:05:14.250  -->  00:05:15.670
So let's verify that it worked.

80

00:05:15.710  -->  00:05:18.660
If I refresh rate that works well.

81

00:05:18.720  -->  00:05:24.390
You can type J query and we can also type dollar sign and if those work we know that sheet query is

82

00:05:24.390  -->  00:05:25.680
correctly installed.

83

00:05:26.070  -->  00:05:31.640
So that's the first way we can download a query locally and then link to it with the script tag.

84

00:05:31.840  -->  00:05:38.310
There is another option though which is to use a CD in CD and stands for content distributed network

85

00:05:38.760  -->  00:05:44.640
and think of it as just a way of grabbing a file from online without actually having to download it

86

00:05:44.640  -->  00:05:45.750
to your machine.

87

00:05:45.810  -->  00:05:52.410
So I'll show you if we just copy this you Arel right here which happens to be AJ queery CDN for version

88

00:05:52.410  -->  00:05:53.680
2.0 1.4.

89

00:05:53.770  -->  00:05:58.660
And if I just go to that you URL you'll see that it's just the J Corey file here.

90

00:05:58.920  -->  00:06:04.380
What we can do is link to this you Arel or any other J queery CD and you know there's a lot of them

91

00:06:04.380  -->  00:06:09.850
on line and that will work the same way as linking to the file here locally.

92

00:06:09.870  -->  00:06:14.850
The only difference is that this will actually load a little bit faster because it's local on our computer

93

00:06:15.360  -->  00:06:20.410
and if we replace it with the CD then it won't be noticeable to us.

94

00:06:20.530  -->  00:06:25.800
But under the hood it does take a little longer but of course it is a lot easier and simpler to use

95

00:06:25.920  -->  00:06:30.430
because we don't have to download a copy of Jay query for every application that we make.

96

00:06:30.780  -->  00:06:33.010
So I'll refresh.

97

00:06:33.750  -->  00:06:37.350
And if we type J query here it should still work and it does.

98

00:06:37.770  -->  00:06:40.190
Lastly I'll show you how I found that CDN.

99

00:06:40.230  -->  00:06:47.580
Just open up a new tab and look for Cdn Jay queery and if we just do a search for Cdn and then any other

100

00:06:47.580  -->  00:06:50.770
library which will see some some other ones later on.

101

00:06:50.810  -->  00:06:52.110
Mike J query.

102

00:06:52.110  -->  00:06:53.650
You'll see that we get a bunch of links.

103

00:06:53.850  -->  00:06:55.850
So Jay query has an official one.

104

00:06:55.860  -->  00:07:02.100
There's the Cdn dodge city NJ s dot com and we have a bunch of you or else here that we can just copy

105

00:07:02.100  -->  00:07:02.880
.

106

00:07:02.910  -->  00:07:07.040
We would have to pay attention to the version so this is for 3.00.

107

00:07:07.200  -->  00:07:14.210
If we go to 2.20 point 4 it gives us a uncompress the normal version and a modified version.

108

00:07:14.470  -->  00:07:17.090
And just to show you if I go to that you are well.

109

00:07:17.310  -->  00:07:18.720
I see them in a file file.

110

00:07:19.110  -->  00:07:20.490
So to wrap up.

111

00:07:20.700  -->  00:07:22.130
Either way works.

112

00:07:22.230  -->  00:07:28.440
We need a script tag in both cases but the source is either going to be a local file or a file that's

113

00:07:28.440  -->  00:07:32.000
hosted somewhere that we're linking to using a CDN.

114

00:07:32.100  -->  00:07:36.870
The last thing you want to do is give you a quick 30 second preview of what she court looks like.

115

00:07:37.110  -->  00:07:39.930
So here's a little bit of what J query looks like.

116

00:07:39.930  -->  00:07:45.300
First thing you might notice is there's a dollar sign being used in four different places.

117

00:07:45.300  -->  00:07:51.480
We have a bunch of methods like Dom click that see SS dot fade out dot remove.

118

00:07:51.690  -->  00:07:57.900
So what this code will actually do is select a button with ID trigger and when it is clicked it runs

119

00:07:57.900  -->  00:08:04.350
all this code and when it's clicked we're going to change the background color of the body to be yellow

120

00:08:04.350  -->  00:08:04.940
.

121

00:08:04.980  -->  00:08:08.290
We're going to fade out all images on the page.

122

00:08:08.370  -->  00:08:13.470
It's going to take 3 seconds to fade them out and then when the fade out is done we're going to remove

123

00:08:13.470  -->  00:08:15.340
those three images from the page.

124

00:08:15.750  -->  00:08:18.380
So click on the button with IDF trigger.

125

00:08:18.390  -->  00:08:23.580
Change the body color fade out images over three seconds and then remove images when they're done.

126

00:08:23.970  -->  00:08:26.640
All right so that was the speed preview of a query.

127

00:08:26.730  -->  00:08:29.100
Now let's actually start writing some in the next video.
