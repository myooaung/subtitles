00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:01.280
Hi welcome back.

2

00:00:01.620  -->  00:00:06.900
So the next two videos we're focusing on editing it now updating comments rather than campgrounds which

3

00:00:06.900  -->  00:00:08.250
we just finished.

4

00:00:08.250  -->  00:00:09.570
So we have a few videos.

5

00:00:09.570  -->  00:00:13.900
The first one is around getting the edit and update routes to work.

6

00:00:14.280  -->  00:00:19.770
The next one is on getting that destroy route and then the last one will be adding in our authorization

7

00:00:19.770  -->  00:00:20.850
to comments.

8

00:00:20.850  -->  00:00:25.800
So to start these two videos anyone can edit a comment or anyone can delete a comment.

9

00:00:25.800  -->  00:00:27.800
It doesn't matter if they own it or not.

10

00:00:28.080  -->  00:00:32.270
So in this video we're starting with editing and we have three main things to add.

11

00:00:32.280  -->  00:00:35.340
The first one is our edit route for a comment.

12

00:00:35.340  -->  00:00:40.650
The next one is adding a button so that we can click on a button to go to that edit route next to every

13

00:00:40.650  -->  00:00:41.340
comment.

14

00:00:41.610  -->  00:00:47.280
And then lastly we want to add in the correct update route that actually updated database so that everything

15

00:00:47.280  -->  00:00:48.440
works just fine.

16

00:00:48.840  -->  00:00:53.220
So if I take a look right now what we have I'll go back to campgrounds

17

00:00:56.550  -->  00:01:01.810
and I did add in a few new campgrounds because we deleted all of them in the last video.

18

00:01:02.700  -->  00:01:05.250
Once I add a comment which I already have here.

19

00:01:05.310  -->  00:01:06.740
Wonderful comment.

20

00:01:06.810  -->  00:01:11.540
I want to see an edit and a delete button and to start again.

21

00:01:11.580  -->  00:01:12.840
They'll just show up for everyone.

22

00:01:12.840  -->  00:01:17.130
So by the end of this video every comment should have at and delete and anyone can delete to come in

23

00:01:17.130  -->  00:01:17.160
.

24

00:01:17.160  -->  00:01:18.710
Anyone can edit a comment.

25

00:01:19.140  -->  00:01:23.330
So let's go back and let's start by adding in our route.

26

00:01:23.520  -->  00:01:31.500
So remember for restful routing I'll pull up our little table here and I'll preview it.

27

00:01:31.500  -->  00:01:32.400
Here we go.

28

00:01:32.760  -->  00:01:34.120
Let's take a look at it.

29

00:01:34.170  -->  00:01:40.780
Slash dogs slash slash added as it get request and it's just going to show the form for one dog.

30

00:01:40.790  -->  00:01:48.010
In our case for one comment and then we have update which is slash comments slash ideas put.

31

00:01:48.360  -->  00:01:54.100
But for us it's not just slash comments slash comment slash ID such edit.

32

00:01:54.150  -->  00:01:56.310
Remember it's a nested route.

33

00:01:56.340  -->  00:02:04.950
So if we look at the routes that we have let me close this down and if we go back to our read me here

34

00:02:04.950  -->  00:02:12.160
I'll just Adam down here our campground at it looks like a campground slash ID slash at it.

35

00:02:12.830  -->  00:02:16.350
But remember that our comments routes are nested after campgrounds.

36

00:02:16.470  -->  00:02:24.550
So we have something like campgrounds slash ID slash comments slash ID slash at it.

37

00:02:24.900  -->  00:02:27.210
But this can also be called ID.

38

00:02:27.330  -->  00:02:33.360
So we need to change this because this one is ID and if we tried to get both of them out we would actually

39

00:02:33.360  -->  00:02:39.180
only get one basically this one would be added First to our prams under the name ID then this one would

40

00:02:39.180  -->  00:02:40.270
override it.

41

00:02:40.410  -->  00:02:42.930
So we'll call this comment ID.

42

00:02:42.930  -->  00:02:46.220
It can be anything but this is the route that we're going to define.

43

00:02:46.920  -->  00:02:51.440
So campground such ID such comments such common ID slash at it.

44

00:02:51.440  -->  00:02:58.830
It's a lot all that we have to write though is this because remember in our app J.S. where we require

45

00:02:58.830  -->  00:03:05.230
the routes we scroll down we already add this in to all comment routes.

46

00:03:05.670  -->  00:03:08.860
So lets do that now comment is out for now.

47

00:03:09.240  -->  00:03:15.070
We'll start by focusing on this last bit of the edit route.

48

00:03:15.390  -->  00:03:16.860
So have the comments.

49

00:03:17.020  -->  00:03:30.290
J.S. routes file we have new uncreate afterwards we'll do a router get slash comment Id slash at it

50

00:03:32.970  -->  00:03:35.300
function request and response.

51

00:03:35.910  -->  00:03:44.340
And what we'll do eventually is render a form start with the rest us and edit route for comments and

52

00:03:44.340  -->  00:03:46.170
lets make sure that we can get to that route.

53

00:03:46.260  -->  00:03:57.270
So we restart the server refresh here and then we need to add on slash comments slash any idea you just

54

00:03:57.270  -->  00:04:02.940
do that slash at it and there we go we get at route for comment.

55

00:04:02.940  -->  00:04:08.370
The next thing we should do is add in the correct link of the button that will take us to that edit

56

00:04:08.400  -->  00:04:10.160
form.

57

00:04:10.350  -->  00:04:15.520
So thats going to be our campground show page right here.

58

00:04:15.810  -->  00:04:21.960
And then if we find the part where we are looping through and adding in each comment and before we go

59

00:04:21.960  -->  00:04:24.950
any further I should point out I'm still in 10.

60

00:04:25.200  -->  00:04:27.930
So all these changes are in V 10 if you're following along.

61

00:04:28.410  -->  00:04:35.550
So campground our common stop for each for each one putting out the author a user name 10 days ago and

62

00:04:35.560  -->  00:04:36.860
comment text.

63

00:04:37.140  -->  00:04:47.130
So below that we'll just add in Bootstrap do an anchor tag with a bootstrap class PTEN and we'll do

64

00:04:47.850  -->  00:04:49.860
PTEN dash extra small.

65

00:04:49.860  -->  00:04:53.660
So it's smaller and the color can be warning.

66

00:04:53.790  -->  00:05:03.060
In our case and then here will just add at it and ref it's going to be pretty long.

67

00:05:03.100  -->  00:05:10.730
You need to do slash campgrounds slash or campground ID which we're just doing a camp ground.

68

00:05:10.810  -->  00:05:15.840
So we need to add in art E.J. Yes variable camp ground.

69

00:05:16.150  -->  00:05:17.830
It's going to be a bit of a mess.

70

00:05:17.950  -->  00:05:28.240
Underscore ID and then when you slash after that comments and then our comment ID and each individual

71

00:05:28.240  -->  00:05:37.750
comment in our For each is going to be just a comment in Ejay as tags dot underscore or ID slash after

72

00:05:37.750  -->  00:05:41.030
that edit very long.

73

00:05:41.350  -->  00:05:46.420
But we can do something like this to clean it up just a little bit.

74

00:05:46.480  -->  00:05:51.280
It is gigantic just like that if we wanted to

75

00:05:54.250  -->  00:05:58.190
we'll save restart the server.

76

00:05:58.780  -->  00:06:00.910
Although technically we don't have to do it right there.

77

00:06:01.210  -->  00:06:02.510
And we refresh.

78

00:06:02.680  -->  00:06:04.450
We now have our edit button.

79

00:06:04.450  -->  00:06:09.690
If we inspect it and take a look at the Tref it's going to be long.

80

00:06:09.760  -->  00:06:16.300
You can see it's campgrounds slash a huge ID slash comments slash a huge ID slash at it and that should

81

00:06:16.300  -->  00:06:23.410
now take us to the added route which we now want to render a form for that comment.

82

00:06:23.590  -->  00:06:29.030
So let's stop our server let's make that template which need to be called at it.

83

00:06:29.050  -->  00:06:30.110
E.J. Yes.

84

00:06:30.280  -->  00:06:31.990
So that needs to be inside of use.

85

00:06:32.050  -->  00:06:37.640
So touch views slash comments slash at it.

86

00:06:37.750  -->  00:06:39.090
E.J. Yes.

87

00:06:39.580  -->  00:06:40.690
And then open that up

88

00:06:45.790  -->  00:06:48.750
as we go.

89

00:06:49.180  -->  00:06:58.840
And then let's just take the new comments or nuda E.J. as form and duplicate that to start because it's

90

00:06:58.840  -->  00:07:01.120
going to be very similar to the new forum.

91

00:07:01.180  -->  00:07:06.310
The only difference is that rather than having an empty form to add a comment it will actually have

92

00:07:06.580  -->  00:07:09.430
the previously existing data.

93

00:07:09.430  -->  00:07:12.390
So it's close that out just paste that in here.

94

00:07:12.640  -->  00:07:14.440
And we do need to change a few things.

95

00:07:14.710  -->  00:07:17.140
Most notably you can start by just changing

96

00:07:19.900  -->  00:07:25.930
this H-1 to say edit and then in the form we need to change the action.

97

00:07:25.930  -->  00:07:32.690
We still need campground sashed campground IDs such comments but we also want slash the campground or

98

00:07:32.740  -->  00:07:41.800
excuse me slash the comment Id which comment is not defined yet so we will need to provide this.

99

00:07:41.880  -->  00:07:42.910
We're doing that urge.

100

00:07:42.970  -->  00:07:47.250
Error driven development where we're writing the code that we want to work.

101

00:07:47.320  -->  00:07:53.020
So remember instead of edit we need to find the correct comment and then pass that to this template

102

00:07:53.030  -->  00:07:53.170
.

103

00:07:53.290  -->  00:07:58.420
So inside the route added We need to find that data passed into this template so that we can then add

104

00:07:58.420  -->  00:08:02.260
the corrected into the form so that we see what we're editing.

105

00:08:02.260  -->  00:08:08.890
We see that data and method will be a post because reading method overwrite again but it's supposed

106

00:08:08.890  -->  00:08:09.850
to be a put.

107

00:08:09.880  -->  00:08:19.990
So we need this underscore method equals put and that should get us to update and the next change that

108

00:08:19.990  -->  00:08:23.120
will make its will go to our input.

109

00:08:23.890  -->  00:08:26.590
And we want to give it instead of placeholder.

110

00:08:27.250  -->  00:08:36.370
We want value and then we need our Ejay as tags and we're going to add in comment Tex which again comment

111

00:08:36.370  -->  00:08:38.040
is not defined yet.

112

00:08:38.740  -->  00:08:48.600
So if we run this now we'll get an error and they click on edit and we never rendered the form.

113

00:08:48.730  -->  00:08:54.440
So we actually don't get an error if we go to our route though and we actually render the form so Rezko

114

00:08:54.610  -->  00:08:55.210
render

115

00:08:58.030  -->  00:09:02.290
comments slash at it.

116

00:09:02.290  -->  00:09:04.540
We should now restart.

117

00:09:04.690  -->  00:09:09.820
I would try to go to this page again the same edit we get an error now telling us that campground is

118

00:09:09.820  -->  00:09:10.840
not defined.

119

00:09:10.960  -->  00:09:16.870
And then if we fix that we'll also get another error that says comment is not defined not we're not

120

00:09:16.870  -->  00:09:24.880
actually using campground in our template except for this one part right here with the action because

121

00:09:24.880  -->  00:09:31.930
we need that campground ID to actually set up the correct route so that we go to that edit route which

122

00:09:31.930  -->  00:09:37.810
remember it's at long nasty nested route campground slash WIPs campground ID sosh comments such common

123

00:09:37.810  -->  00:09:45.220
ID we need that to work but we don't need the entire campground with all the associated data all that

124

00:09:45.220  -->  00:09:52.620
we need is the ID so we can actually simplify this and just call something campground idea doesn't exist

125

00:09:52.810  -->  00:09:59.020
but we'll pass it through in our template and we have access to the ID in our comments routes.

126

00:09:59.050  -->  00:10:06.880
So you might be thinking we'd need to do something like campground but find by id and then pass it in

127

00:10:06.970  -->  00:10:08.780
the ID from the route.

128

00:10:08.890  -->  00:10:14.110
We don't have to do that because we actually already have the campground ID instead of request up her

129

00:10:14.110  -->  00:10:22.560
Amscot ID and in my opinion this is pretty confusing because the way I read your set up although it

130

00:10:22.560  -->  00:10:33.300
looks like we have as camp or a comment Id But ID is what we defined in the address is back here right

131

00:10:33.300  -->  00:10:33.930
here.

132

00:10:34.380  -->  00:10:41.170
So Id refers to the campground ID and then comment Id is the idea of the comment.

133

00:10:42.120  -->  00:10:51.420
So if we just pass in campgrounds underscore ID is equal to request up her Amscot ID.

134

00:10:51.420  -->  00:10:53.310
We shouldnt get that same error anymore.

135

00:10:53.530  -->  00:10:59.370
Well I have a different one which is now telling us that oh its still telling its campground is not

136

00:10:59.370  -->  00:11:03.540
defined because were using that back over here.

137

00:11:04.050  -->  00:11:06.330
Would you want to change our template here.

138

00:11:06.840  -->  00:11:10.090
Let's just say etic comment for now.

139

00:11:10.140  -->  00:11:14.350
Now for fresh We get comments is not defined.

140

00:11:14.490  -->  00:11:20.190
So we need to fix that and this time we actually have to look up the comment because we need the text

141

00:11:20.190  -->  00:11:21.100
inside of it.

142

00:11:21.510  -->  00:11:32.840
So thats a comment dot find by ID in the ID is request harams dot comments ID.

143

00:11:32.850  -->  00:11:42.890
The second thing then we'll have our callback was an error and found comments if error.

144

00:11:43.770  -->  00:11:47.820
For now we're getting very close to what we're going to implement those nice messages that keep talking

145

00:11:47.820  -->  00:11:48.390
about.

146

00:11:48.390  -->  00:11:51.630
For now let's just do a rest.

147

00:11:52.650  -->  00:11:58.250
Redirect loops back.

148

00:11:58.500  -->  00:12:02.380
Else you just want to do this right here.

149

00:12:02.970  -->  00:12:14.160
And we also need to pass in comment of course which is just another one of these comments is found comments

150

00:12:14.490  -->  00:12:17.910
just like that restart.

151

00:12:19.140  -->  00:12:20.690
So remember we're taking this idea.

152

00:12:20.690  -->  00:12:24.980
The first one we're just calling ID and we're passing that directly through.

153

00:12:25.170  -->  00:12:30.060
Then we're taking the second ID and looking at the corresponding comment using that ID.

154

00:12:30.060  -->  00:12:33.320
Now if I refresh the page now we get our form.

155

00:12:33.330  -->  00:12:36.170
It's already styled because we just copied that one over.

156

00:12:36.720  -->  00:12:43.740
And then of course think about what error you expect to see when I hit submit.

157

00:12:44.310  -->  00:12:46.380
Cannot put campgrounds.

158

00:12:46.470  -->  00:12:48.810
And that's because we don't have that route defined.

159

00:12:49.110  -->  00:12:50.900
So let's do that now.

160

00:12:51.000  -->  00:12:56.220
So we've done the first two actually of the task we wanted to do edit route edit button.

161

00:12:56.220  -->  00:12:58.190
Now we just need to update.

162

00:12:58.260  -->  00:13:09.870
So back to comments let me add another comment here Stube comments that it wrote then we want comments

163

00:13:10.000  -->  00:13:11.130
update.

164

00:13:11.700  -->  00:13:20.130
Just to refresh your memory and needs to be a put request to slash campgrounds slash some campground

165

00:13:20.130  -->  00:13:26.220
ID slash comments slash comments Id just like that.

166

00:13:26.940  -->  00:13:36.980
And that is going to be our update route as a put request so router put members using router here which

167

00:13:36.980  -->  00:13:41.940
are just defining right here and then returning that whole thing while not returning it but sending

168

00:13:41.940  -->  00:13:51.900
it out with modular exports rather than after I get so routed up put and all we need is slash call and

169

00:13:52.380  -->  00:13:53.320
comments.

170

00:13:53.460  -->  00:13:55.710
Id just like that

171

00:13:58.380  -->  00:14:00.580
request response.

172

00:14:01.170  -->  00:14:10.890
And as always I like to start with those simple red dots and you hit the update route for comments lets

173

00:14:11.100  -->  00:14:12.690
try hitting it now with our form

174

00:14:15.540  -->  00:14:17.730
refresh submit.

175

00:14:17.730  -->  00:14:18.420
Great.

176

00:14:18.450  -->  00:14:19.890
So our forms go in the right place.

177

00:14:19.890  -->  00:14:27.050
Our router set up now we need the logic and our logic is very similar to how we did it for a campground

178

00:14:27.070  -->  00:14:27.160
.

179

00:14:27.230  -->  00:14:34.430
If we look at Update campground up find by id and update we want to do the exact same thing here but

180

00:14:34.470  -->  00:14:39.600
comment does find by id and update and remember that fund by id and update takes three different things

181

00:14:39.600  -->  00:14:39.790
.

182

00:14:39.900  -->  00:14:47.260
The ID defined by the data to update it with and then the callback to run afterwards.

183

00:14:47.280  -->  00:14:58.320
So we want a comment up find by id and update the ID is request up harams dot comments ID.

184

00:14:58.710  -->  00:15:04.900
This one here the data that we want if we go to or for.

185

00:15:05.310  -->  00:15:09.300
You'll see that recalling it comments text.

186

00:15:09.360  -->  00:15:15.240
So accessit by comment dot text or just comment actually is all we need.

187

00:15:15.750  -->  00:15:24.660
So we can go back requests dot body dot comments and that's just the entire comment object which only

188

00:15:24.660  -->  00:15:27.640
has one thing text error.

189

00:15:27.780  -->  00:15:30.090
And then we'll call this updated comment

190

00:15:33.090  -->  00:15:42.210
and then we'll check if there's an error we'll send the user back just with the rest up redirect back

191

00:15:42.490  -->  00:15:44.520
.

192

00:15:44.520  -->  00:15:50.910
Otherwise we want to send them back to the show page for the comments and all that we need to do there

193

00:15:50.910  -->  00:15:52.440
is redstart redirect.

194

00:15:52.440  -->  00:16:00.780
Remember the show page is slash campgrounds slash an ID and that Id we have.

195

00:16:00.780  -->  00:16:04.920
Again it doesn't look like we have it here it looks like our route and just comment Id.

196

00:16:05.250  -->  00:16:07.620
I really think that's confusing to beginners.

197

00:16:07.830  -->  00:16:14.670
But if we go back keep doing this but if we go to J.S. remember all of our common routes are nested

198

00:16:14.670  -->  00:16:15.540
after this.

199

00:16:15.540  -->  00:16:23.610
So there's always an ID for a campground so we can use that request up harams dot ID and that should

200

00:16:23.610  -->  00:16:24.750
be all we need.

201

00:16:24.750  -->  00:16:26.050
So let's try it.

202

00:16:26.640  -->  00:16:28.160
Hopefully it works out for us.

203

00:16:28.350  -->  00:16:34.860
Let's edit this comment to be anything that's hit submit.

204

00:16:34.860  -->  00:16:41.270
And if we scroll down perfect we see anything let's try editing again.

205

00:16:41.820  -->  00:16:42.260
Perfect.

206

00:16:42.270  -->  00:16:43.430
It's working just fine.

207

00:16:43.980  -->  00:16:44.600
Great.

208

00:16:44.610  -->  00:16:51.690
So that was edit and update remember we added in the edit route first which is the form and the reason

209

00:16:51.690  -->  00:16:57.600
that I did comments after campground is that it's a little bit Nassir it's a little extra syntax and

210

00:16:57.600  -->  00:16:59.500
you have to worry about those nested routes.

211

00:16:59.790  -->  00:17:05.250
But other than the routes and some of the ID names everything is pretty much the same.

212

00:17:05.260  -->  00:17:11.470
I mean a find by id and update we have an edit route and then we have an update route.

213

00:17:11.550  -->  00:17:13.550
So we did that we started with the edit route.

214

00:17:13.590  -->  00:17:18.500
We added the button in to actually a link just with bootstrap styling to look like a button.

215

00:17:18.660  -->  00:17:21.750
And then we added in at the very end the update route.

216

00:17:22.350  -->  00:17:26.510
Next will do the exact same thing but for destroying or deleting a comment
