1

00:00:00,260  -->  00:00:01,440
OK we'll come back.

2

00:00:01,440  -->  00:00:06,330
So far we've talked about how we can select the elements with J Querrey and also how we can manipulate

3

00:00:06,330  -->  00:00:06,810
them.

4

00:00:06,990  -->  00:00:11,790
Now we're going to introduce the final big missing piece which is events in J query.

5

00:00:11,850  -->  00:00:13,700
So think back to vanilla J.S..

6

00:00:13,740  -->  00:00:17,780
When we added event listeners we used a method called an event listener.

7

00:00:18,150  -->  00:00:22,230
Well it turns out that Jay where he has a ton of methods that have to do with events.

8

00:00:22,350  -->  00:00:28,190
So I have the event section open on Jake where he can get there by just clicking on events here.

9

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:32,720
So as I scroll through here you can see just how many.

10

00:00:32,810  -->  00:00:37,210
Coria event methods there are chikor it comes with a ton of them.

11

00:00:37,230  -->  00:00:41,820
So what I'm going to do is highlight the three most important ones the three that you can use.

12

00:00:41,830  -->  00:00:49,190
Ninety nine percent of the time those three methods are quick key press and on.

13

00:00:49,650  -->  00:00:53,010
And I said that these three you could use 99 percent of the time.

14

00:00:53,160  -->  00:00:55,950
It's actually more like this one right here.

15

00:00:55,950  -->  00:00:58,050
You can use 99 percent of the time.

16

00:00:58,110  -->  00:01:03,000
So I'm going to show you click and key press first but my main objective is to show you how awesome

17

00:01:03,030  -->  00:01:04,600
the method is.

18

00:01:05,130  -->  00:01:06,450
So let's get started.

19

00:01:06,450  -->  00:01:12,030
So Jay equerries quick method is how we can very quickly and easily add a click listener to a single

20

00:01:12,030  -->  00:01:14,620
element or a collection of elements.

21

00:01:14,730  -->  00:01:18,210
So you can see I have two examples in this case.

22

00:01:18,210  -->  00:01:22,070
I'm selecting something and then adding a click listener with a click.

23

00:01:22,290  -->  00:01:26,070
So we select something with the idea of submit we run.

24

00:01:26,100  -->  00:01:32,490
Click on it and then we pass in a callback function and this callback function will be run when something

25

00:01:32,490  -->  00:01:34,470
with the idea of submit is clicked.

26

00:01:34,680  -->  00:01:37,400
And because it's an ID there's only one on the page.

27

00:01:37,530  -->  00:01:40,920
So when that one item is clicked this code is run.

28

00:01:41,340  -->  00:01:46,290
If you take a look down here you can see that I'm selecting all buttons on the page which it could be

29

00:01:46,290  -->  00:01:46,650
one.

30

00:01:46,650  -->  00:01:51,080
It could be 10 buttons and I'm adding a click listener to all of them.

31

00:01:51,120  -->  00:01:55,800
So any time a button is quick it will alert someone click the button.

32

00:01:55,830  -->  00:01:56,760
So let me demonstrate that.

33

00:01:56,750  -->  00:02:03,480
Now I have a simple HTL page with Jay queery included as a CDN.

34

00:02:03,750  -->  00:02:10,730
And I'm going to add in let's do Jay query events and I will add in a few buttons.

35

00:02:11,370  -->  00:02:15,240
So the first one I say don't correct me.

36

00:02:16,020  -->  00:02:21,230
And then the next one will say seriously ok me.

37

00:02:21,390  -->  00:02:27,690
And the last one will say this is your last warning.

38

00:02:28,080  -->  00:02:36,300
So we'll save and open this in the browser and always just check that J loaded.

39

00:02:38,320  -->  00:02:38,780
OK.

40

00:02:38,850  -->  00:02:40,040
Looks good.

41

00:02:40,650  -->  00:02:46,110
So we'll start easy here by adding a quick listener to this H-1 and there's only one on the page.

42

00:02:46,110  -->  00:02:50,170
So we just need to select first with dollar sign.

43

00:02:50,680  -->  00:02:55,610
So one that gives us the right H-1 which only one and then we run.

44

00:02:55,640  -->  00:03:02,220
Don't click on that and then we need to pass in a callback function which will be run whenever we click

45

00:03:02,220  -->  00:03:03,670
on that H-1.

46

00:03:03,690  -->  00:03:11,010
So behind the scenes click is using an event listener and it's adding a click listener on this H-1 and

47

00:03:11,010  -->  00:03:18,540
we can either do an anonymous function which is way more common to see but somewhat more intimidating

48

00:03:18,600  -->  00:03:24,120
for newer students or we could write a named function separately and then pass the name of that function

49

00:03:24,120  -->  00:03:24,940
in here.

50

00:03:25,260  -->  00:03:27,900
But like I said anonymous functions are way more common.

51

00:03:28,200  -->  00:03:37,080
So what we want to do is just alert each one correct and I'll hit enter here and now if I click on this

52

00:03:37,130  -->  00:03:42,380
H-1 you'll see I get H-1 quit and that doesn't happen on any other element.

53

00:03:42,630  -->  00:03:48,990
It does happen over here remember because my H-1 goes all the way across the screen so that CSSA issue

54

00:03:48,990  -->  00:03:54,990
if I want to change the size of the one but it only happens when I do click on the one element.

55

00:03:54,990  -->  00:04:00,020
Now what I want to do is show how we can add a quick listener to a collection of elements.

56

00:04:00,150  -->  00:04:02,530
So I'm going to select all buttons here.

57

00:04:02,640  -->  00:04:12,630
So a dollar sign button and then we add our click just like that and we can pass in an anonymous function

58

00:04:12,630  -->  00:04:14,050
again as our callback.

59

00:04:14,580  -->  00:04:24,420
And this will be run whenever any button is clicked and we'll just do an alert button click just like

60

00:04:24,420  -->  00:04:27,130
that and hit enter.

61

00:04:27,630  -->  00:04:35,470
And now if I click on any of those buttons there we go button clicked button click button quit.

62

00:04:35,490  -->  00:04:41,150
So think back to vanilla javascript to add an event listener to a collection of buttons.

63

00:04:41,190  -->  00:04:46,380
I would have to select them all with query selector all or get elements by tag name and then I would

64

00:04:46,380  -->  00:04:51,240
have to use a for loop to loop through all of them and then I would have to individually add an event

65

00:04:51,240  -->  00:04:54,780
listener which to be clear is happening behind the scenes.

66

00:04:54,870  -->  00:04:59,700
But all I have to do is write this line and that will loop for me that will add the event listeners

67

00:04:59,730  -->  00:05:05,660
individually which makes her life really easy rather than just a learning button clicked.

68

00:05:05,820  -->  00:05:10,940
What if I wanted to change the style change the background color of the button that was clicked.

69

00:05:11,430  -->  00:05:13,970
So I would need to add a click listener again.

70

00:05:13,970  -->  00:05:16,780
I'm just at the up arrow and rather than alerting.

71

00:05:17,040  -->  00:05:26,730
What we'll do is change the background color so that's going to be something that C-s s background and

72

00:05:26,730  -->  00:05:30,290
we'll change it to be pink.

73

00:05:30,450  -->  00:05:36,090
So the issue is what are we calling Dotsie CSSA on and back with vanilla javascript.

74

00:05:36,090  -->  00:05:37,360
We would use this.

75

00:05:37,380  -->  00:05:43,530
The key word this and that refers to the element that was clicked on however NJ query that won't quite

76

00:05:43,530  -->  00:05:49,720
work what we need to do is use the J Querrey version of this.

77

00:05:49,950  -->  00:05:53,010
This is always a little bit of a confusing idea.

78

00:05:53,010  -->  00:05:58,830
I think it helps to remember that what Shakeri does is it takes plain vanilla Yes and it wraps it in

79

00:05:58,830  -->  00:06:03,830
Jay query and it's big J.A.G. hug and it gives it some special properties and methods.

80

00:06:03,840  -->  00:06:10,680
So if we want to use dot CSSA which is a J query method we have to make sure that we're running it on

81

00:06:10,950  -->  00:06:12,660
a J query object.

82

00:06:12,660  -->  00:06:17,560
So just plain old this is the regular vanilla javascript this.

83

00:06:17,670  -->  00:06:21,440
So we need to wrap it and tell it this is the J query version.

84

00:06:21,660  -->  00:06:23,190
So let's test that out.

85

00:06:23,370  -->  00:06:30,630
Hit enter here and now let's click on the button first we have that alert because we never got rid of

86

00:06:30,630  -->  00:06:32,460
this first click listener.

87

00:06:32,880  -->  00:06:40,280
And then the background changes to pink and you can see that will happen to each one that I click.

88

00:06:40,440  -->  00:06:42,010
We could also do something like this.

89

00:06:42,030  -->  00:06:47,610
So I hit the up arrow and I refresh the page rather than just changing them to be pink.

90

00:06:47,670  -->  00:06:55,540
We could also do a cancel that log and Walcott's adult log the text of the button that was clicked.

91

00:06:55,650  -->  00:07:03,870
So it would be something like you clicked plus and then I'll make a variable to store this so variable

92

00:07:04,560  -->  00:07:14,040
text equals dollar sign this dot and to get that text out of there we just need to use the text method

93

00:07:14,460  -->  00:07:22,430
just like that kaso that log you clicked us text which is our variable name and enter.

94

00:07:22,920  -->  00:07:27,510
And now if I click one you clicked don't click me you clicked.

95

00:07:27,540  -->  00:07:28,890
This is your last warning.

96

00:07:29,460  -->  00:07:30,360
And you clicked.

97

00:07:30,420  -->  00:07:31,830
Seriously don't click me.

98

00:07:32,190  -->  00:07:32,640
OK.

99

00:07:32,670  -->  00:07:33,930
So that's all I'll demonstrate about.

100

00:07:33,930  -->  00:07:34,650
Click.

101

00:07:34,650  -->  00:07:39,520
To summarize we can add a listener to one element at a time like we did for the H-1.

102

00:07:39,780  -->  00:07:43,870
Or we can do it to a collection which is where it really becomes useful.

103

00:07:43,890  -->  00:07:49,320
And then lastly if we want to refer to the element that was clicked we need to use dollar sign this

104

00:07:49,680  -->  00:07:53,670
which is the J queery wrapper the J.A.G. version of the Vanilla.

105

00:07:53,690  -->  00:07:54,480
Yes this
