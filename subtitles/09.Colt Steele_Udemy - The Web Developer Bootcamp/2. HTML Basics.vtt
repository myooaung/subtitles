00:00:00.140  -->  00:00:01.700
OK we'll come back.

2

00:00:01.710  -->  00:00:06.630
So now is the time where we finally get to start actually writing some code and we're going to start

3

00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:09.320
by talking about HCM out in the next unit.

4

00:00:09.450  -->  00:00:13.530
We're going to cover a lot of different parts of it to him how we're going to learn by the end how to

5

00:00:13.530  -->  00:00:18.600
write simple age to him old documents when understand the difference between closing and self-closing

6

00:00:18.600  -->  00:00:24.360
tags tagged with the attributes you want to definitely use M.D and a lot which you've already seen.

7

00:00:24.360  -->  00:00:29.580
And at the very end I'll give you an image of a Web site and you should be able to write the corresponding

8

00:00:29.580  -->  00:00:30.500
H.T. amount.

9

00:00:30.810  -->  00:00:33.650
So translate an image to actual code.

10

00:00:34.080  -->  00:00:38.170
So we're going to start by talking a little bit about the history of HDMI.

11

00:00:38.550  -->  00:00:41.700
So again it stands for hypertext markup language.

12

00:00:41.700  -->  00:00:48.720
Think back to that first introduction to front end video HDMI out is the structure and content of a

13

00:00:48.720  -->  00:00:52.690
page not the styling not the interactivity just the structure and content.

14

00:00:52.830  -->  00:00:59.730
Back in the academic community in the year 1989 early 1990 there's not exactly a hard start date to

15

00:00:59.730  -->  00:01:04.010
age Timo but in that time basically people were exchanging papers.

16

00:01:04.050  -->  00:01:09.930
Giant thesis papers and scientific documents technical documents and they all have very specific formatting

17

00:01:09.950  -->  00:01:10.220
.

18

00:01:10.560  -->  00:01:16.920
But when they're being exchanged there was no way to actually send that formatting across the Internet

19

00:01:16.920  -->  00:01:17.370
.

20

00:01:17.370  -->  00:01:21.670
So what I mean is let's say you wanted to have a paper that looked like this.

21

00:01:21.690  -->  00:01:25.560
And this is a style guide that I found on writing scientific papers.

22

00:01:25.560  -->  00:01:27.680
So let's just take the abstract section.

23

00:01:27.900  -->  00:01:31.100
So your abstract looks like there's a heading here.

24

00:01:31.260  -->  00:01:33.390
It's a little bolded and bigger text.

25

00:01:33.600  -->  00:01:39.900
We've got this sort of introduction to one part of the abstract and then a bunch of bullet points.

26

00:01:40.260  -->  00:01:43.010
We've got italicised and bolded text.

27

00:01:43.140  -->  00:01:47.130
And then it looks like a link to another part of the paper.

28

00:01:47.550  -->  00:01:50.310
And then lastly we've got some nested bullet points.

29

00:01:50.460  -->  00:01:53.830
So this information if I wanted to send this to somebody.

30

00:01:54.090  -->  00:01:56.040
But all that I could send is text.

31

00:01:56.160  -->  00:02:00.420
So I can't send an image of this I can't send like the actual structure of it.

32

00:02:00.430  -->  00:02:07.600
All I can send is some text so that might look something like this.

33

00:02:07.620  -->  00:02:14.520
The problem is how do I take this text here which is the same text as over here in Hadaway in code the

34

00:02:14.520  -->  00:02:15.960
structure.

35

00:02:16.350  -->  00:02:20.420
How do I say this abstract which actually don't have here.

36

00:02:20.550  -->  00:02:26.890
But if I added that in how would I say this is bold and bigger text and so is function.

37

00:02:27.090  -->  00:02:33.090
And there's a bullet point right here and another bullet point right here.

38

00:02:33.090  -->  00:02:35.590
So that is what each team lets us do.

39

00:02:35.640  -->  00:02:40.650
It lets us take text in content and just by writing some other text on top of it.

40

00:02:40.650  -->  00:02:42.930
It lets us specify exactly.

41

00:02:42.930  -->  00:02:44.730
This is a heading this is bold.

42

00:02:44.730  -->  00:02:46.140
This is a italicized.

43

00:02:46.230  -->  00:02:48.900
This is a link and that last part.

44

00:02:48.900  -->  00:02:51.360
Link is actually really important.

45

00:02:51.870  -->  00:02:57.570
Thats where the name comes from Hypertext Markup Language because each T.M. allows us to create hyperlinks

46

00:02:57.720  -->  00:03:01.200
and linking documents together is really important.

47

00:03:01.200  -->  00:03:06.600
Many scientific papers are going to be referencing other scientific papers footnotes and all sorts of

48

00:03:06.600  -->  00:03:07.520
citations.

49

00:03:07.640  -->  00:03:13.110
H tim l facilitated that and made a really big impact and then basically caught on.

50

00:03:13.110  -->  00:03:15.210
People realized it's pretty simple.

51

00:03:15.210  -->  00:03:20.700
It's not a very intimidating thing so moved kind of away from purely academic situations to kind of

52

00:03:20.700  -->  00:03:23.850
broader use all the way up to my space.

53

00:03:23.860  -->  00:03:29.070
Few remember my space or if you ever had a myspace you could actually edit your profile just by writing

54

00:03:29.160  -->  00:03:29.780
HDMI.

55

00:03:29.970  -->  00:03:34.830
So there are people who are absolutely not technical and they were still able to write H T M L and C

56

00:03:34.830  -->  00:03:39.450
Ss to add some interesting features to the page to make some customized visuals.

57

00:03:39.720  -->  00:03:40.270
OK.

58

00:03:40.380  -->  00:03:41.760
So let's keep that in mind.

59

00:03:41.760  -->  00:03:46.030
We have this giant thing of text that we want to be able to encode some structure.

60

00:03:46.050  -->  00:03:52.560
And I want to say this is bold or this is a bullet point and so on.

61

00:03:52.840  -->  00:03:57.060
Tim L allows us to do that using H.T. tags.

62

00:03:57.060  -->  00:04:02.250
So what we basically do is we take some content in the middle and we sandwich it between an opening

63

00:04:02.250  -->  00:04:03.870
tag and a closing tag.

64

00:04:03.990  -->  00:04:11.310
This lets me specify specific parts of the page or of the paragraph for the content that I can say right

65

00:04:11.400  -->  00:04:16.970
in between these two tags is a bold right between these two is a link right between these two is italicized

66

00:04:17.010  -->  00:04:18.620
text and so on.

67

00:04:18.630  -->  00:04:22.830
So I'll show you that we could go through here and decide OK.

68

00:04:22.860  -->  00:04:29.580
This is going to be a heading on our page and we'll wrap it in an H1 tag which we haven't introduced

69

00:04:29.580  -->  00:04:30.360
yet.

70

00:04:30.360  -->  00:04:31.430
We will get there.

71

00:04:31.530  -->  00:04:36.560
But for now let's just specify that this is the largest heading on our page.

72

00:04:36.930  -->  00:04:40.440
The next thing we might want to do is go ahead and make this bolded here.

73

00:04:40.710  -->  00:04:46.140
So the way that we make things bold there's a few the simplest one is to wrap it in something called

74

00:04:46.200  -->  00:04:48.420
a B.Tech to say that it's bold.

75

00:04:48.450  -->  00:04:52.160
For those of you who know him l the tag is actually on its way out.

76

00:04:52.320  -->  00:04:56.920
It's being deprecated which means that you're basically you're not supposed to use it anymore.

77

00:04:56.940  -->  00:04:58.260
It works just fine.

78

00:04:58.260  -->  00:04:59.070
There is an alternative.

79

00:04:59.080  -->  00:05:01.120
We'll discuss in a little bit.

80

00:05:01.210  -->  00:05:04.910
Likewise I might want to make something let's say a separate paragraph.

81

00:05:04.920  -->  00:05:09.940
So I wanted to add some spacing between this line and the next line.

82

00:05:10.020  -->  00:05:15.090
So I add a paragraph and what that will do is whatever's between these two tags goes on its own line

83

00:05:15.120  -->  00:05:18.170
and has basically returned on either side.

84

00:05:18.660  -->  00:05:25.440
So as you can see the general rule applies to all the tags that we've seen or we had an H1 or bold tag

85

00:05:25.440  -->  00:05:26.660
or a paragraph tag.

86

00:05:26.910  -->  00:05:29.130
Don't focus on the tags himself just yet.

87

00:05:29.130  -->  00:05:33.610
We're going to have plenty of videos discussing individual ins and outs of all the tags.

88

00:05:33.720  -->  00:05:40.960
But again remember this pattern we have tag name starting tag name closing some content in between.

89

00:05:41.370  -->  00:05:47.100
OK so the next video we're now going to actually make a new real Tim efile not just a scientific document

90

00:05:47.190  -->  00:05:49.060
some text but a real file.

91

00:05:49.170  -->  00:05:51.770
And we're going to open it in the browser and actually see the age T.M.
