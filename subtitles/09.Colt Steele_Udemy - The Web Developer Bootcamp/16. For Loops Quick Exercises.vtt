00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:03.780
So it's time for two very quick for loop exercises.

2

00:00:03.840  -->  00:00:08.100
And just like the ones before with the wild loops you don't actually have to write any code just yet

3

00:00:08.120  -->  00:00:08.390
.

4

00:00:08.670  -->  00:00:13.590
So I'm going to give you two code fragments and I'd like for you to try and evaluate it mentally without

5

00:00:13.590  -->  00:00:14.620
using the cons..

6

00:00:14.850  -->  00:00:16.140
So here's the first one.

7

00:00:16.140  -->  00:00:21.410
Take a moment pause the video if you need to and then we'll go over the solution.

8

00:00:21.660  -->  00:00:27.160
So at the beginning of this loop a variable is set to zero and the loop is going to run.

9

00:00:27.210  -->  00:00:33.950
While it is less than 16 and every time through we're going to add eight to.

10

00:00:34.260  -->  00:00:37.780
So the first time it's going to be zero and we'll print out 0.

11

00:00:37.950  -->  00:00:39.140
Then we add eight.

12

00:00:39.450  -->  00:00:42.670
So the next time it's eight which is still less than 16.

13

00:00:42.750  -->  00:00:45.940
So we get counted out log 8.

14

00:00:46.080  -->  00:00:49.290
So it prints 0 and 8 and then it adds eight more.

15

00:00:49.290  -->  00:00:54.840
So we end up with I equal to 16 which is no longer less than 16 and we're done.

16

00:00:55.260  -->  00:01:04.850
So let's verify pass that and we get zero and 8.

17

00:01:04.980  -->  00:01:06.420
So here's the second one.

18

00:01:06.420  -->  00:01:08.660
Go ahead take a moment positive he needs to.

19

00:01:08.790  -->  00:01:11.840
And then we'll go over this in just a second.

20

00:01:13.200  -->  00:01:13.690
OK.

21

00:01:13.710  -->  00:01:17.080
So this one you're just a string rather than just numbers.

22

00:01:17.220  -->  00:01:20.190
So we have a string with a bunch of random characters.

23

00:01:20.340  -->  00:01:22.590
Or maybe they're not too random we'll see.

24

00:01:22.590  -->  00:01:30.300
So then we have a for loop with a variable that starts as 1 not 0 and then we're going to keep running

25

00:01:30.300  -->  00:01:36.930
this Loop While itis less like a string and we're going to add two every time not just one.

26

00:01:37.380  -->  00:01:42.600
So the first time through we take I can reprint the character at I from the string.

27

00:01:42.840  -->  00:01:43.810
So I one.

28

00:01:43.920  -->  00:01:48.570
So we're going to print H which is the second character but it has index of 1.

29

00:01:48.690  -->  00:01:53.820
So then we're going to add two to I which gives us three which is still less than the length of the

30

00:01:53.820  -->  00:01:54.880
string.

31

00:01:54.960  -->  00:01:58.880
So we're going to print out a string of three which is E.

32

00:01:59.340  -->  00:02:04.410
And then we're going to keep repeating this add too which means we're going to printout L and then another

33

00:02:04.410  -->  00:02:05.960
L and then o.

34

00:02:06.360  -->  00:02:13.580
So the end result is that we print every other character and that happens to spell out Hello.

35

00:02:14.040  -->  00:02:17.320
So in the next set of exercises I'm going to have you start writing some four loops
