00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:04.500
At the end of the last video I mentioned that we're going to introduce a new folder structure so we're

2

00:00:04.500  -->  00:00:09.300
going to start there by creating the correct folders and files first.

3

00:00:09.330  -->  00:00:14.350
So I'm going to go to sublime and I'm going to make my new file for each team.

4

00:00:14.580  -->  00:00:18.700
Just going to be our main HTML file and I'm going to call it indexed.

5

00:00:18.720  -->  00:00:23.690
H Tim L and I have a folder for it I'm just calling to do list project.

6

00:00:23.790  -->  00:00:32.130
So index that HD M-L and then we'll add in our basic H-2 mail boilerplate and I'll call this to do list

7

00:00:32.850  -->  00:00:33.790
and save.

8

00:00:34.380  -->  00:00:37.200
And then we're going to go and make a few new directories.

9

00:00:37.680  -->  00:00:44.130
And I'm just going to do that from finder so you can right click and do new folder.

10

00:00:44.130  -->  00:00:50.270
You can do command shift and you can also do that from inside of sublime.

11

00:00:50.400  -->  00:00:58.680
If you go into a file new file and you save it you can click new folder here however you go about creating

12

00:00:58.680  -->  00:01:06.120
the new folder we're going to make a folder called assets and then inside of assets we're going to make

13

00:01:06.180  -->  00:01:12.720
two folders one for J.S. and another one for us.

14

00:01:13.740  -->  00:01:19.360
And then lastly instead of J.S. we're going to make another folder called lib.

15

00:01:19.830  -->  00:01:28.950
So if I open this entire structure up inside of sublime by just dragging the whole project over like

16

00:01:28.950  -->  00:01:37.620
this you can see that our structure is now to do this project and we have an index that h t m l and

17

00:01:37.620  -->  00:01:41.120
then we have an assets directory instead of assets.

18

00:01:41.220  -->  00:01:46.700
We have C Ss and we have javascript and instead of javascript we have a lib directory.

19

00:01:46.860  -->  00:01:52.770
So we'll be putting our style sheet instead of the C S S directory and instead of J.S. we'll be putting

20

00:01:52.770  -->  00:01:58.520
our own custom javascript where we write the jey query and inside of lib is where we're going to add

21

00:01:58.560  -->  00:01:58.670
.

22

00:01:58.790  -->  00:02:01.520
Query itself the actual J query file.

23

00:02:01.800  -->  00:02:02.980
So we'll start there.

24

00:02:03.120  -->  00:02:05.310
Let's go and make sure we have a query.

25

00:02:05.580  -->  00:02:11.550
So I'm going to just go to Jay Querrey dot com and rather than doing a CDN because this is more of a

26

00:02:11.550  -->  00:02:17.540
serious project we're going to download the most recent compressed version.

27

00:02:17.640  -->  00:02:22.850
So that's right here compressed production 2.0 1.4.

28

00:02:23.430  -->  00:02:28.950
And then I'm going to find that file and just add it into my assets.

29

00:02:29.010  -->  00:02:36.870
J.S. lib just add that in like that and now I'm going to go link to that correct.

30

00:02:36.880  -->  00:02:39.520
The inside of my supplier.

31

00:02:39.870  -->  00:02:43.350
So in my HMO I need to add a script tag.

32

00:02:44.250  -->  00:02:53.190
And the path to get there is assets slash J.S. slash lib slash Jay dashed to point one point for dolmen

33

00:02:53.330  -->  00:02:53.540
.

34

00:02:53.650  -->  00:02:54.500
Yes.

35

00:02:54.570  -->  00:03:06.130
So let's do that now script type because javascript source equals assets slash J.S. slash lib slash

36

00:03:06.130  -->  00:03:06.390
.

37

00:03:06.480  -->  00:03:10.370
Jay query dash 2.1 point one point four men.

38

00:03:10.620  -->  00:03:15.300
That's a yes long file name to get there but save this.

39

00:03:15.510  -->  00:03:18.300
And let's just open it up in a browser to start.

40

00:03:18.300  -->  00:03:23.130
So go find our index study each time I'll open it up.

41

00:03:23.160  -->  00:03:24.620
We don't have anything to see.

42

00:03:24.870  -->  00:03:27.780
But if I go here I type a query.

43

00:03:27.780  -->  00:03:29.180
Things are working just fine.

44

00:03:29.400  -->  00:03:34.550
I could also tested out by doing this selecting the body and that works as well.

45

00:03:34.560  -->  00:03:36.620
So that means we're good to go.

46

00:03:36.690  -->  00:03:42.360
Next up let's focus on getting our style sheet and our own custom javascript file included.

47

00:03:42.360  -->  00:03:44.660
So we're going to make the style sheet first.

48

00:03:44.760  -->  00:03:53.490
So let's make a new file and save that and I'll just call it styles that C-s us and I'm going to go

49

00:03:53.490  -->  00:03:59.890
into my assets see SS and actually to be consistent let's do to Dewes does the SS.

50

00:04:00.090  -->  00:04:09.810
So to do stuff C Ss inside of our assets C Ss directory and save and let's add something like body background

51

00:04:10.140  -->  00:04:12.820
purple which we will absolutely get rid of.

52

00:04:13.020  -->  00:04:20.100
But just to make sure that it's working and then we'll go over here and add in the linked tag and then

53

00:04:20.130  -->  00:04:29.910
add the correct path which is assets slash C. SS slash to Dewes dot C Ss and we'll save and refresh

54

00:04:30.750  -->  00:04:35.100
and you can see our style sheet is now connected properly.

55

00:04:35.100  -->  00:04:39.310
The last thing we're going to do is get our own custom javascript file going.

56

00:04:39.420  -->  00:04:45.150
So I'm going to make a new file and save it and we'll call this one to do Scott J.S. and that's where

57

00:04:45.150  -->  00:04:49.290
we're going to write the actual code that will make our To Do List work.

58

00:04:49.320  -->  00:04:53.250
So that should go inside of assets.

59

00:04:53.280  -->  00:04:54.780
J.S. and that's it.

60

00:04:54.780  -->  00:04:59.960
So we don't put it in lib because lib is where we're going to put external code and libraries like Jay

61

00:05:00.080  -->  00:05:05.870
Querrey So we're just going to put it in J S and save our structure looks like this.

62

00:05:05.930  -->  00:05:10.310
Assets CSSA we have to use instead of J.S..

63

00:05:10.560  -->  00:05:14.830
We have a lib directory that has J query in it and we have our own to do.

64

00:05:14.860  -->  00:05:23.820
J.S. instead of the G-S folder and votes go add a simple alert connected and save.

65

00:05:23.850  -->  00:05:31.110
Now go back to our HQ mail and add in another script tag and this time we're going to add source equal

66

00:05:31.110  -->  00:05:39.170
to assets slash J.S. slash to do yes and save.

67

00:05:39.540  -->  00:05:45.130
And now let's see what happens when we refresh we get our connected alert.

68

00:05:46.260  -->  00:05:51.420
OK so we have the folder structure set up correctly so we will be introducing another file that we need

69

00:05:51.420  -->  00:05:53.470
to place once we talk about Funt.

70

00:05:53.480  -->  00:05:56.180
Awesome which is a CSSA library.

71

00:05:56.190  -->  00:05:58.770
It's basically a bunch of icons that we can include.

72

00:05:58.770  -->  00:06:02.980
So we will be returning to this folder structure and adding to it in the future video.

73

00:06:03.000  -->  00:06:05.240
For now that's all we need to do in the next video.

74

00:06:05.250  -->  00:06:06.620
We'll focus on writing some code
