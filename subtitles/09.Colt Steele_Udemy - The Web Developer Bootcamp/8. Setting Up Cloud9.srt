00:00:00,450  -->  00:00:01,780
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01,830  -->  00:00:07,320
So we're going to go ahead and get signed up for cloud nine and set up our initial environment so I'll

3

00:00:07,320  -->  00:00:12,930
click on sign up on the cloud 9 home page and then I'll fill out the information here.

4

00:00:13,230  -->  00:00:23,370
So I'll do learn with Colts and my e-mail here learned with Colts at gmail dot com and then I'll put

5

00:00:23,370  -->  00:00:27,370
in my password here and then we'll click on I'm not a robot.

6

00:00:28,530  -->  00:00:35,390
And then we need to select all images with pizza.

7

00:00:35,390  -->  00:00:37,120
I think that's it.

8

00:00:37,140  -->  00:00:38,240
There we go.

9

00:00:38,310  -->  00:00:39,260
Not a robot.

10

00:00:39,570  -->  00:00:43,480
And now we'll create our free account.

11

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:48,510
The next thing you'll need to do is check your email and click on the verification email that they send

12

00:00:48,510  -->  00:00:49,840
you.

13

00:00:50,070  -->  00:00:53,780
And then once you've done that we can go to our dashboard.

14

00:00:53,940  -->  00:00:55,590
This is our dashboard here.

15

00:00:55,590  -->  00:01:01,790
We can upload a profile picture and we can also look at a demo project that they've given us.

16

00:01:01,920  -->  00:01:04,230
So I'm going to just look at that for now.

17

00:01:04,260  -->  00:01:06,920
We're not going to touch anything or we're not going to make anything new here.

18

00:01:06,950  -->  00:01:10,790
So now that it's floated Let's take a quick tour of some of the features.

19

00:01:11,220  -->  00:01:16,350
So they have a little read me file that explains a few things but the first thing I'll show is that

20

00:01:16,380  -->  00:01:19,750
on the left side we have a file tree.

21

00:01:19,770  -->  00:01:24,920
These are all the files and directories that we currently have on this demo project workspace.

22

00:01:25,260  -->  00:01:31,800
So if we wanted to you could click on Ruby and here's a ruby file and I can double click and that will

23

00:01:31,800  -->  00:01:36,390
open up the file here just like if I had dragged the file to Sublime Text.

24

00:01:36,540  -->  00:01:38,570
So this is one way to open a file.

25

00:01:38,730  -->  00:01:41,180
We'll also be learning how to do it from the command line.

26

00:01:41,250  -->  00:01:46,670
Later in the course which brings me to the next point which is the command line down here or the terminal

27

00:01:46,670  -->  00:01:54,530
is here so we can resize this window and this is our terminal where we'll type terminal commands.

28

00:01:54,810  -->  00:01:56,610
So one of them is clutter.

29

00:01:56,730  -->  00:01:59,600
And what that does is it just clears everything away.

30

00:01:59,730  -->  00:02:04,510
Just like clear does in the javascript console although this is not Javascript.

31

00:02:04,710  -->  00:02:06,700
So I can type commands in here.

32

00:02:07,050  -->  00:02:10,980
We'll be talking about some of the more important commands in the next few videos.

33

00:02:10,980  -->  00:02:17,160
But for now just know this is our terminal we can type terminal code in here start our server run our

34

00:02:17,160  -->  00:02:17,820
apps.

35

00:02:18,150  -->  00:02:20,480
And this is our file tree over here.

36

00:02:20,610  -->  00:02:22,330
And this is our text editor.

37

00:02:22,470  -->  00:02:27,230
So this is sublime basically that's all we're going to do with the demo project.

38

00:02:27,300  -->  00:02:29,610
So let's close out of that.

39

00:02:29,700  -->  00:02:38,510
Now let's click on Create a new workspace and then we'll give our workspace a name so I'll do web dev

40

00:02:38,520  -->  00:02:38,910
.

41

00:02:39,540  -->  00:02:46,590
Boot camp just like that and we can give it a description if we want and we'll keep it public and then

42

00:02:46,590  -->  00:02:49,650
all that we'll do down here is select node.

43

00:02:49,950  -->  00:02:54,810
So this is a template which will give us all of the tools or almost all of the tools that we're going

44

00:02:54,810  -->  00:02:56,600
to use preinstalled.

45

00:02:56,790  -->  00:03:02,970
So when we click Create workspace it's going to take some space on a machine somewhere else a computer

46

00:03:03,030  -->  00:03:05,900
and the server and it's going to install node.

47

00:03:05,970  -->  00:03:11,430
It's going to install some other tools something called NPM that comes with node and we'll have it all

48

00:03:11,430  -->  00:03:13,870
ready for us in just a matter of seconds.

49

00:03:14,280  -->  00:03:16,020
So I'll click on Create workspace

50

00:03:20,580  -->  00:03:21,450
and there we go.

51

00:03:21,450  -->  00:03:25,440
We now have our own web development environment set up and that's it.

52

00:03:25,590  -->  00:03:28,600
And if we wanted to check that it works correctly.

53

00:03:28,740  -->  00:03:35,760
Let's open up the terminal and make it a little bit bigger and what we'll do is in here let's type a

54

00:03:35,760  -->  00:03:44,250
simple command node dash V and all that this will do is ask node which is one of the things that it

55

00:03:44,250  -->  00:03:45,840
should have installed for us.

56

00:03:45,870  -->  00:03:49,280
It will ask node what version it's currently on.

57

00:03:49,980  -->  00:03:56,940
We can do the same thing with another tool called NPM dash VI which is again asking for the version

58

00:03:56,940  -->  00:03:57,150
.

59

00:03:57,360  -->  00:04:02,600
And as long as we see something here then we're good if we saw something like.

60

00:04:02,610  -->  00:04:05,730
Command not found node or command not found.

61

00:04:05,730  -->  00:04:08,650
NPM then that would mean that they're not installed.

62

00:04:08,970  -->  00:04:14,370
But this shows that they are installed for us and that was you know a matter of one click two clicks

63

00:04:14,370  -->  00:04:15,060
maybe.

64

00:04:15,150  -->  00:04:20,030
And we waited a second or two for our environment to get set up and we're good to go now.

65

00:04:20,190  -->  00:04:22,470
So this is all we need to do actually.

66

00:04:22,500  -->  00:04:28,020
One more thing that will have us do so that we are all consistent in our folder structure is I'm going

67

00:04:28,020  -->  00:04:38,820
to go ahead and delete these folders here so we can right click click on delete and click on yes and

68

00:04:38,820  -->  00:04:42,290
we'll just delete all of them inside of webdav boot camp.

69

00:04:42,930  -->  00:04:49,350
So we'll delete again yes we'll delete this file package that Jason

70

00:04:53,220  -->  00:05:00,920
do that for the read me file just like that and then will also delete the server file.

71

00:05:00,960  -->  00:05:05,900
Don't worry we'll be creating a bunch of new files and folders for every lesson that we do.

72

00:05:06,300  -->  00:05:07,700
So that's all we needed to do.

73

00:05:07,710  -->  00:05:13,470
We now have everything set up that we need or almost everything will have to install a tool here or

74

00:05:13,470  -->  00:05:14,730
there as we progress.

75

00:05:14,790  -->  00:05:17,090
But we have everything we need to get started.
