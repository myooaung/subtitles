00:00:00.380  -->  00:00:04.250
In this video we're going back to camp to make a quick refactor.

2

00:00:04.290  -->  00:00:09.090
So as I mentioned in the last video about module that exports we're going to take some of the model

3

00:00:09.090  -->  00:00:14.850
code this campground schema the campground model and we're going to push this out into a separate models

4

00:00:14.850  -->  00:00:19.950
directory in a campground file and that will pave the way for us to do it with our other models like

5

00:00:20.040  -->  00:00:21.460
user and comment.

6

00:00:21.630  -->  00:00:22.640
So we'll get there in time.

7

00:00:22.710  -->  00:00:27.720
But for now we have three main steps we need to create the models directory and the campground file

8

00:00:27.720  -->  00:00:28.380
.

9

00:00:28.590  -->  00:00:33.540
Then we need to use module but exports inside that campground file and then we need to require everything

10

00:00:33.540  -->  00:00:38.710
correctly including requiring mongoose and requiring the newly created campground file.

11

00:00:39.150  -->  00:00:44.730
So before I get started I do have a v3 that I'm working in now because we're making some larger changes

12

00:00:44.730  -->  00:00:44.900
.

13

00:00:45.000  -->  00:00:46.320
We're moving files around.

14

00:00:46.470  -->  00:00:50.020
So if you want to follow along the new changes will be in version 3.

15

00:00:50.460  -->  00:00:52.230
Ok let's begin.

16

00:00:52.230  -->  00:00:58.710
The first thing I want to do is make a directory called models and instead of models we'll have all

17

00:00:58.710  -->  00:00:59.700
the model files.

18

00:00:59.910  -->  00:01:01.680
So I'm going to make my first one now.

19

00:01:01.830  -->  00:01:04.710
Touch models slash campground.

20

00:01:05.010  -->  00:01:07.120
Yes just like that.

21

00:01:07.500  -->  00:01:09.000
And then I'm going to open that file up

22

00:01:12.690  -->  00:01:18.060
and I'm going to put all of the campground logic which is just this right now and it doesn't seem like

23

00:01:18.470  -->  00:01:19.930
it's a huge benefit.

24

00:01:19.930  -->  00:01:22.650
It's what five six seven lines that we're cleaning up.

25

00:01:22.830  -->  00:01:28.260
But when we have multiple models which is coming soon it will be 30 or 40 different lines of models

26

00:01:28.290  -->  00:01:30.520
and we don't want our apt to be cluttered.

27

00:01:30.630  -->  00:01:34.320
And we're actually going to even clean things up further in a future video.

28

00:01:34.320  -->  00:01:39.000
We're going to move all of these routes out into a separate file multiple separate files to make the

29

00:01:39.020  -->  00:01:42.060
app really clean and as minimal as possible.

30

00:01:42.540  -->  00:01:47.760
Let's go to a camp ground J.S. and paste this code in and we're getting an error right away.

31

00:01:47.760  -->  00:01:50.330
It's telling us Mongoose is not defined.

32

00:01:50.370  -->  00:01:51.960
That's one thing we need to take care of.

33

00:01:52.140  -->  00:02:00.860
And that's nice and easy for mongoose equals require mongoose just like that save.

34

00:02:01.290  -->  00:02:08.310
And we have our schema and then we're just going to do a module that exports equals mongoose top model

35

00:02:08.840  -->  00:02:10.610
campground campground schema.

36

00:02:10.890  -->  00:02:15.050
So when we require this file on read you require campground J.S..

37

00:02:15.300  -->  00:02:17.490
We'll be getting the model.

38

00:02:17.550  -->  00:02:22.650
So now we need to go to actually yes and just add a nice required statement up here and we can just

39

00:02:22.650  -->  00:02:34.200
do that right here campground equals require and we have to do dot slash models slash campground.

40

00:02:34.200  -->  00:02:35.080
We don't need the data.

41

00:02:35.130  -->  00:02:41.100
Yes that's implicit and we don't have to name it campground but I'm going to keep it campground because

42

00:02:41.100  -->  00:02:42.980
that's what we're using down here.

43

00:02:43.010  -->  00:02:47.660
We're doing campground find and campgrounds create.

44

00:02:47.730  -->  00:02:48.800
All right.

45

00:02:49.230  -->  00:02:51.560
So we can test this out and see if it works.

46

00:02:51.570  -->  00:02:56.910
All we have to do is start the server and if we see our campground today having the database that means

47

00:02:56.910  -->  00:02:58.440
that our model is set up correctly.

48

00:02:58.560  -->  00:03:02.130
Otherwise you don't have a way of getting the campgrounds out of the database.

49

00:03:02.130  -->  00:03:02.750
All right.

50

00:03:02.850  -->  00:03:04.090
So let's try that now.

51

00:03:04.560  -->  00:03:06.260
Let's run our app.

52

00:03:06.380  -->  00:03:09.920
J.S. looks good so far.

53

00:03:10.230  -->  00:03:15.270
Let's refresh the campgrounds page and here are the four campgrounds that I added.

54

00:03:15.270  -->  00:03:17.590
These are some new ones that you haven't seen yet.

55

00:03:17.640  -->  00:03:20.130
I just went in and added some new campgrounds.

56

00:03:20.130  -->  00:03:25.540
So we have this beautiful glacier camp Lakey Laiki or lake leaky.

57

00:03:25.980  -->  00:03:31.740
All right let's go back now and we're done with everything we need to do the next iteration of this

58

00:03:31.930  -->  00:03:41.210
will look like comment equals require and we'll do the same exact thing dot slash models slash comment

59

00:03:41.700  -->  00:03:46.940
and we'll do the exact same thing again for user when we have user log in.

60

00:03:47.640  -->  00:03:53.070
So now we have this nice pattern where we don't have to have all the code cluttering up G-S we can require

61

00:03:53.070  -->  00:03:54.270
different files in.

62

00:03:54.390  -->  00:03:56.960
And the key to that is module exports.

63

00:03:57.150  -->  00:04:02.820
If I leave this off just show you that now if I have the right code in here but I don't export anything

64

00:04:02.820  -->  00:04:06.420
and don't add it to module but exports when I require it.

65

00:04:06.750  -->  00:04:09.540
This line right here require model slash campground.

66

00:04:09.690  -->  00:04:14.760
I'm actually going to get an empty object like that and I'll get an error because when I try and do

67

00:04:14.760  -->  00:04:21.740
something like empty object I find that I'm not going to work for us and I'll show you that restart

68

00:04:21.740  -->  00:04:24.180
the server started up again.

69

00:04:24.180  -->  00:04:28.600
Refresh the page object object has no method find.

70

00:04:29.160  -->  00:04:30.580
As you can see here.

71

00:04:31.380  -->  00:04:33.440
Object object has no method fine.

72

00:04:33.600  -->  00:04:37.350
That's because we're not sending this mongoose model out of the file.

73

00:04:37.350  -->  00:04:38.520
We're not exporting it.

74

00:04:38.610  -->  00:04:44.510
Now we are refresh again restart server and things go back to normal.

75

00:04:44.640  -->  00:04:46.500
So that one line is really important.

76

00:04:46.650  -->  00:04:51.180
It's not enough just to put things into files but we have to make sure that we're using mossel But experts

77

00:04:51.180  -->  00:04:51.630
correctly
