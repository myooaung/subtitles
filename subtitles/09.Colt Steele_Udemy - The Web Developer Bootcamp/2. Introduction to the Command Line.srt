00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:01,230
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01,410  -->  00:00:04,500
In this video we're going to start by talking about the command mind.

3

00:00:04,560  -->  00:00:11,310
So this portion of our development environment and what we actually do here and what it's used for and

4

00:00:11,310  -->  00:00:16,170
then we're going to introduce some of the early and most important command line commands.

5

00:00:16,530  -->  00:00:20,930
Let's start by talking about what the command line is what the whole point of it is.

6

00:00:21,120  -->  00:00:27,300
So far you've seen me type one instruction into the command line one command I typed node app.

7

00:00:27,380  -->  00:00:28,770
Yes it looks like this.

8

00:00:28,770  -->  00:00:34,440
And it won't work here because I don't have an access file but that's how I started my server when I

9

00:00:34,440  -->  00:00:38,270
did the demonstration of the dog demo app.

10

00:00:38,370  -->  00:00:40,640
That's just one of the important commands.

11

00:00:40,680  -->  00:00:45,210
But there are quite a few more that we're going to learn about that we'll use through the rest of this

12

00:00:45,210  -->  00:00:46,030
class.

13

00:00:46,170  -->  00:00:50,690
Before we talk about them I want to read the introduction to this book.

14

00:00:50,700  -->  00:00:56,220
This e-book called Getting to know the command line written by David Baum gold and it's a great resource

15

00:00:56,220  -->  00:00:56,610
.

16

00:00:56,610  -->  00:01:04,500
And if you have the time I definitely recommend that you read this entire ebook as well as this basic

17

00:01:04,500  -->  00:01:07,740
command line tutorial that he links to right here.

18

00:01:07,740  -->  00:01:13,800
But what I want to read is this paragraph here the command line is the ultimate seat of power on your

19

00:01:13,800  -->  00:01:19,770
computer using the command line you can perform amazing feats of wizardry and speed taming your computer

20

00:01:19,770  -->  00:01:22,460
and getting it to do precisely what you want.

21

00:01:22,470  -->  00:01:25,590
Unfortunately the price of this power is complexity.

22

00:01:25,590  -->  00:01:28,910
Nobody ever said that ruling your computer would be easy.

23

00:01:28,920  -->  00:01:30,760
The command line is at its heart.

24

00:01:30,900  -->  00:01:36,390
Simply a place where you type commands to the computer the computer is your obedient servant and will

25

00:01:36,390  -->  00:01:39,330
attempt to carry out any commands that it understands.

26

00:01:39,330  -->  00:01:44,340
Unfortunately the computer does not speak English or any other language spoken by humans although it

27

00:01:44,340  -->  00:01:47,420
has recognizable elements in order to give it commands.

28

00:01:47,430  -->  00:01:50,470
We must first start learning the language of the computer.

29

00:01:51,000  -->  00:01:53,370
I like to think of the command line as this.

30

00:01:53,460  -->  00:01:58,460
No frills direct interface to the core of our computer.

31

00:01:58,530  -->  00:02:03,930
It used to be that the only interface that existed to work with the computer and interact with it was

32

00:02:03,930  -->  00:02:05,470
through a command line.

33

00:02:05,670  -->  00:02:11,010
In the early computers you would fire it up and it's a black screen with green text and there was no

34

00:02:11,010  -->  00:02:17,760
visual interface and then some of the early Xerox and Mac computers came out which had visual interfaces

35

00:02:17,770  -->  00:02:17,910
.

36

00:02:18,030  -->  00:02:24,330
So that's where we get the mouse and the desktop and icons and things that we click on and basically

37

00:02:24,330  -->  00:02:25,850
everything that we do with our computers.

38

00:02:25,860  -->  00:02:33,510
Now as humans as non-developers we do through a visual interface but it's not just that the command

39

00:02:33,510  -->  00:02:36,380
line is another way of interacting with a computer.

40

00:02:36,390  -->  00:02:41,440
It's not that it's just an uglier simpler way where we just use the keyboard and text.

41

00:02:41,520  -->  00:02:47,190
You could argue that it is uglier and simpler but more importantly it lets you do a lot more than you

42

00:02:47,190  -->  00:02:53,160
can do with just your mouse so you can do everything that you would do with your mouse with visual menus

43

00:02:53,160  -->  00:02:58,490
like making a new file or saving a file or running a file or opening an application.

44

00:02:58,620  -->  00:03:04,320
You can do all of that through the command line but you can also do a lot more that you can't do without

45

00:03:04,320  -->  00:03:05,260
the command line.

46

00:03:05,310  -->  00:03:10,140
That includes things like starting a node server which is one of the important things that we have to

47

00:03:10,140  -->  00:03:15,450
do in this class is start our javascript server and you can't do that by just clicking on things with

48

00:03:15,450  -->  00:03:16,280
your mouse.

49

00:03:16,560  -->  00:03:19,680
So that's one of the big reasons we're learning the command line.

50

00:03:19,680  -->  00:03:23,550
The other reason that developers use it is that it's much faster.

51

00:03:23,550  -->  00:03:29,220
Once you master it and once you know the important commands you can create files and run files and delete

52

00:03:29,220  -->  00:03:32,860
files so much faster than if you're using your mouse.

53

00:03:32,970  -->  00:03:37,710
Of course there is a learning curve and when you start out it feels like things take a lot more effort

54

00:03:37,710  -->  00:03:43,060
to do with the command line and they do until you learn them and you feel comfortable with them.

55

00:03:43,380  -->  00:03:48,660
I strongly recommend that you do the exercises that I'm going to give you but that you also practice

56

00:03:48,900  -->  00:03:52,370
and use your command line in Cloud Nine as much as possible.
