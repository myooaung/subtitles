Hi, guys, in this listen, we will talk about the Supreme Court request by the Supreme provides a



2

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.970

request by the annotation for rest API, the request by the annotation maps, the HTTP request body



3

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:28.130

to a transfer or domain object enabling what the authorization of the inbound HDTV request.



4

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.620

But they aren't her Zhuo object if a matters parameter is annotated with request buddy Springfield by



5

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.340

the incoming HTTP request, but it took that parameter while doing that.



6

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:50.750

Simply will use HTP message convertors to convert HTP request by the inter domain object.



7

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:59.960

Suppling provides many default HTP message convertors which will be used for conversion depending on



8

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.150

the presence of a certain library in projec class.



9

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:12.440

But of course we can use different content types in like JSON, examine, etc..



10

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.830

For example, if the content type in request header is application JSON, that means the post by the



11

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:31.070

contains JASSA and if Jackson Library is found in your class, that sibling will delegate the conversion



12

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.930

to Jackson HDTV message convertor for Jasa.



13

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.420

We will see the details of it on our project.



14

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.590

That's all for the beginning.



15

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.460

Thank you.
