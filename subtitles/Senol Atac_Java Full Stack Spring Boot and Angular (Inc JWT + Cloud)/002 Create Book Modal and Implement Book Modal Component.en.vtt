00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.650

Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will implement the book creation and book additions to handle these



2

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.360

actions.



3

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.250

We will create a book model and we will provide the communication with the admin page.



4

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.740

With this model.



5

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.720

We will get the details of the book and we will save it.



6

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:35.060

We will use this model for both to add books and to edit the existing book, because both of them will



7

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.430

have the same fields.



8

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.110

OK, now we can create our components and we can implement it.



9

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.250

We can create a component with the energy generate comment.



10

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:55.790

Our comments will be engie generate components and components, need our component name will be book,



11

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.420

but I'll create it under the admin folders.



12

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:07.040

So I specify it like admin slash book and it will create our component classes.



13

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.880

Now, I open the book components under the admin folders, first of all, I don't need the on init method



14

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.100

so I can remove it, OK, now we can implement it.



15

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.030

First of all, we will create a form for the book object.



16

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.070

So we should put the book object as a variable and type of PLB book.



17

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.610

Second variable will be error message, and the type of it will be strange.



18

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.970

We will use it to show error messages if it occurs, for example, we will send the same request.



19

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.100

If there is an error, we will show it with error message.



20

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.050

Then we can inject our services on the constructor.



21

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.110

We need a single service.



22

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.060

We will use book service to call the save book and print.



23

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.430

Now we can create our save book method in this method, we will call the book service Save Book Matters



24

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.690

and we will handle the response we will send the book Object is a parameter, of course.



25

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.930

First of all, we will describe the book object we are looking for.



26

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.850

We will handle it on the HTML, but then we will subscribe to the same book function because the same



27

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.150

book function is an observable item.



28

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.530

If the same book operation is completed successfully, we will get a response as data and I'll hook



29

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.000

up this data later.



30

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.340

Then I will implement the editable, OK, if there is an error, we should set the error message, we



31

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.570

can set it like unexpected error occured to Dybbuk, yet we can also write the error on the console.



32

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.380

OK, now our book component template is ready, this can be enough for this lesson.
