00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:08,760
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will install Posman and we will talk about the functionalities of it.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,830
First of all, let's dowland it.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,810
We can find that the won't link from Google searching easily.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:26,710
We can search it like no Lond Postma, or we can search it according to our operating system, for example,

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,040
Dowland Postman for Mac or Windows.

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,860
Then from the postman page, we can easily Dowland and install it.

7
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:46,810
Actually, no extra configuration on installation steps, so we will install it with default settings.

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:58,460
Then it will be accessible from our computer postman is an API application programming interface development

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,820
tool which helps to build, test and modify APIs.

10
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:12,590
Almost any functionality that could be needed by any developer is encapsulated in this tool.

11
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:22,510
It is used by over five million developers every month to make their API development easy and simple.

12
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:32,750
It has the ability to make various types of HTTP requests, such as get requests, post requests, put

13
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:41,090
request, page request, option request, delete requests, etc. But they will we need about the HTTP

14
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,820
request and HTTP response.

15
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,670
Postman provides it.

16
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:57,560
Also, Postman provides saving APIs and converting the API to court for various languages like JavaScript,

17
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,160
Python, JOA, etc..

18
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:10,390
Let's use it with example API calls, we can use the JSON placeholder to illustrate it.

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:20,840
For example, we can choose our HTP method type from the left menu just to the left of it, it's a drop

20
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,970
down button which has all the various HTP methods as options.

21
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:34,240
If we want to post to the Europe that we have specified, we will select post.

22
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,210
For example, let's call the Jason Placeholder Posts API.

23
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:51,170
Our HDTV methods will be passed and our year end will be Jason Placeholder that composts.

24
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,490
Now click on the send button.

25
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:08,010
That's all, for example, if you want to send the post request with a form data, we can send it from

26
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,180
the body tap.

27
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:20,260
Here, Postman provides multiple options, we can send it as key value pairs or we can send it as rawData

28
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:31,860
or we can send it as greyscale format, etc. In most cases, we send it in JSON format to handle it.

29
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,530
We will choose rather tab than from a drop down menu.

30
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,010
We will select JSON format.

31
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,130
Then we can send our body in JSON format.

32
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,300
To illustrate it, we can write some random things.

33
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:02,430
Also, we can send request headers easily in postmen from the headers tap, we can describe our header

34
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,530
with a key value page.

35
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:14,740
For example, we can describe a user agent, authorization, host connection, content type cetera.

36
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:26,480
Also, Postman provides many authorization types, for example, brutalisation, basic authorization,

37
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:36,470
Apte authorization, etc. For example, if we choose basic authorization, we need a username and password

38
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,690
and postman reps.

39
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:47,300
These credentials with base64 encryption then sends them as authorization.

40
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,660
Hej.

41
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:59,350
The other cool feature of Posman is we can convert our API calls to other languages to do it from the

42
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,560
right code section.

43
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,820
We can choose our desired language.

44
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:14,340
At this point, Postman serves tons of options like Joa C, Sharp JavaScript, not JS, etc..

45
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:25,410
Like you see Posman, is it really cool so we can talk about it deeply, but this will be enough for

46
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:25,960
the beginning.

47
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,430
That's all.

48
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,410
Thank you.
