00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:14.380

Hi, guys, in this listen, we will create our Angler project with not just in Angola blindsight,



2

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.110

we will consume our server side.



3

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.410

Simply put, rest API data.



4

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.340

We have created Corot and points on the backend.



5

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:31.620

We will use these and points on the client side and we will create a full stack project.



6

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:41.860

By the way, if you haven't Dowland and installed not Jass yet, please, first of all, install it.



7

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:50.980

After installing the not Jass, we should install the angular command line interface with AMPM comment.



8

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:59.650

We can install it like ampm install global angular slash Kellye.



9

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.510

Then we are ready to create an angular project to create an angular project.



10

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:16.930

The best way is using angular command line interface, angular command line presence, predefined tasks



11

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.530

for us.



12

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.070

For example, to create a project.



13

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.690

It provides a engy new command to build a project.



14

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:37.600

It provides MGB build comment to test the components, it provides a engie test command, etc. so we



15

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.880

can do lots of things from the command line thanks to the angular command line interface.



16

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.690

Let's start with checking the version of English.



17

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.430

We can check our angular version from the terminal with the Engy version command.



18

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.910

Then we call it, we will see the version of angular and angular command line in this course, we will



19

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.190

go on with Angular 12.



20

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:19.670

OK, now we can create our project, first of all, we will describe our project name, our project



21

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.240

name will be English book set to create a project in England.



22

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.750

We will use Engy plus Nieve plus project name.



23

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.880

So our comment will be Engie Neeve Anglerfish bookseller Wendy Long.



24

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.280

This comment angler will create an initial project for us.



25

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.220

This initial project will include required peckerwoods and classis.



26

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.270

Would you like to add Angella Ratfink?



27

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.360

Yes, because we will go in with different pates and we can pass between hights with rotters.



28

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.360

This option will edit rorter module to our application.



29

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.410

We will see the details one by one in the next lessons.



30

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.820

Which stylesheet format would you like to use?



31

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.930

Like you see, there are several stylesheet formats here.



32

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.770

We can go on with one of them here.



33

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.900

We will go on with success because most of us are familiar with it.



34

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.530

But if you are familiar with others, I suggest you go along with it.



35

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.460

For example, if you use less stylesheet, you can use nested components.



36

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:47.690

Of course you can create add some variables in this and these will be so effective on coding.



37

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:57.080

If you use preprocessor you can create variables or conditions, etc., it will be beneficial for you



38

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.620

also.



39

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:06.380

Anyway, here we will go on with success because most of us are familiar with it and it is the most



40

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.780

common.



41

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.350

OK, this comment will create our initial project.



42

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.160

This will take a couple of seconds because it will create initial classes and initial packets.



43

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.250

When I say peckerwoods, Angular has some core dependencies such as angular, angular, core, angular,



44

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.130

delicate, angular builder, bable, bable, G.S., etc..



45

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:43.370

These kind of packets can be in small sizes, but Angular has so many dependencies like that, so it



46

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.710

will take some time.



47

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.130

OK, now our project is ready.



48

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.800

We can run our project from the project folder to run it.



49

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.830

Our command is engy serve.



50

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:05.120

These commands will compile our project and open it on the browser.



51

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:14.030

Angular by default, service the application from port for thousands to hundreds.



52

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.410

Of course we can change it to our needs with the port parameter in default.



53

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.710

Angular provides an example page for us.



54

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.790

If we created we are angular command line interface.



55

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.870

OK, everything looks great.



56

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:42.560

Finally, we will import our project to intelligent all use in for English because I use the intelligent



57

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.180

ultimate version.



58

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:53.960

But if you don't have intelligent ultimate version, you can go in with visual studio code or intelligible



59

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.610

storm or other alternative ideas.



60

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.040

OK, now we are ready for codding, that's all for the beginning.



61

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.110

Thank you.
