Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will talk about why they chose the gradle as project dependency type.



2

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:22.940

I know that most of you can say that no one is the most common tool, but why did you go on with Gradle?



3

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.240

Because Credle has eesa configuration and better performance than Melen.



4

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.200

We also had that in our previous listen.



5

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.860

Let's see the performance difference when I give show this year shows the performance differences between



6

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.590

Gradle and someone for the same project, for the same mission.



7

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:59.350

We can see the gridlock is a really cool to all remember, because Credle avoids work by trading input



8

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:09.610

and output of tasks and only running what is necessary and only processing feis that changed when possible,



9

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.810

gradle and never allow for multi module builds to run in parallel.



10

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:26.190

However, Gradle allows for incremental builds because it checks which tasks are updated or not.



11

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.950

It is then the task is not executed, giving you a much shorter build time.



12

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:42.310

We can give you more reason to choose Gradle or watermelon, but I think that these reasons are enough



13

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.860

for us to choose it.



14

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.020

That's all for the weekend.



15

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.840

Thank you.
