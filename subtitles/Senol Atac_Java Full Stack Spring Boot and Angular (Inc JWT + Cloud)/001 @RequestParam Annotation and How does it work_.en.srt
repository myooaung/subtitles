Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will talk about Cypriote request porra simply provides a request invitation

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,980
for rest Abia.

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:26,150
We can use recurse para to extract created parameters, form parameters and even Hye's from the requests.

4
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,230
Let's check it for an example.

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:37,070
For example, if we have an example and XPoint like API example that takes a query parameter called

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,540
Idy, we can send a request like API example.

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,020
IDG equals Idemitsu.

8
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:50,920
These requests invoke our example methods with the extract that I'd really like one, two or three,

9
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,270
four.

10
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:59,870
In spring we can also specify the query variable name query default value and declared a state of good

11
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,640
in default.

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:08,720
The query variable uses the same name with the parameter name, but we can customize it with the request

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,800
per name.

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:19,070
Property in spring methods, parameters annotated with request param are required by default, but request

15
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,410
permission optional.

16
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,780
Also, we can set the required property of request parameter to force to make it optional.

17
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,840
Finally, we can give a default value for a request.

18
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,020
If we don't send it as per the default value, it will be used by method.

19
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,210
We will see the details of it on our project.

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,700
That's all for the beginning.

21
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,480
Thank you.
