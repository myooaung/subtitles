Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will create our reporter class for book to do it under the repository

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,040
package, we will carry the book repository interface.

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:27,850
Berkeley, he will extend GPA, riposted, GPA replacer is an obstacle course implemented by spring

4
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:36,190
GPA repository with GPA repository, Cypriote will handle basic database operations automatically like

5
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,060
say, update, find by the delete, bidi, etc..

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,050
J-P repository has two genetic parameters.

7
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,290
First parameter is for the model class.

8
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,670
The second parameter is for the idea class of the middle class.

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,590
So our middle class will be book and our idea class will be long here.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:07,930
We can write the example method queries like fine by title or find by price greater then etc. or we

11
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:14,800
can write some queries with query, annotation, etc. but the basic operations that are provided by

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:23,920
the AP reports are in default will be enough for us because we need typical save update for the lead

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,060
book or find book methods.

14
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,380
OK, that's all about book repository implementation.

15
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,060
Thank you.
