00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:14.000

OK, now we will complete the registration page we need then editor blog to display error message.



2

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.590

You know that we described the error message variable on the component.



3

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.480

We can use it to display errors if there is ocurred.



4

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.670

Error on the server, connection to show it, we will use it.



5

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.930

DivisiÃ³n element.



6

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.630

This element will have two classes.



7

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:42.680

One is alert and the other one is either Denge, which puts the message in a red box and we will display



8

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.980

it only if there is an error message so we can handle it with the NGF directive.



9

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.830

Finally, we will display the error message, by the way, to display content in ANGULAR, we use double



10

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.340

Brace's.



11

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.220

Now, let's see the result on the browser, actually, now we can test our register and point if the



12

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.650

backend is not running, we can start it from the main class to start.



13

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.680

It might take some time.



14

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.230

Now, from the browser, we can create our test user, we can type something on name, username and



15

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:37.360

password fields, then when we submit the form it will be created successfully and the login page will



16

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.990

be displayed.



17

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.690

Now, let's test an error case.



18

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.640

For example, when we try to create a user with the same user name that was created previously, we



19

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.830

will expect an error like user name already exists because user names should be unique.



20

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:08.290

OK, error message also looks like we finally I edit logging link, if the user already has an account,



21

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.040

the user can return back to the login page to do it.



22

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.550

I'll carry the link and this link will have two classes.



23

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.800

One is DTN and the other one is BTE and Link.



24

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.410

And I'll replace the ref attribute with Prata Link.



25

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.040

This is a built in directive in this area.



26

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.210

Each element stands for one segment in your pad and the other.



27

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.300

Our part will be a single pad and it will be looking at the linked tasks can be like I have an account



28

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.360

and I can change the colour of it to dark gray.



29

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.840

Now, let's see the result on the browser.



30

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:12.660

OK, it looks perfect, there is one last thing I want to show how we can change the components tied



31

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.320

on English, for example, I want to change the background color of the register, which, of course,



32

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:27.570

we should put with Cyesis, but we cannot do it by changing the color of Heidman or by the element to



33

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.350

change the style of a whole component angle provides a special style function.



34

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.670

We can do it with host or host context.



35

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.620

These works based on components.



36

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.710

So if we change the background of the Register page, it will only affect the register page.



37

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.560

The other page won't be affected.



38

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.010

Now, let's see the results on the browser.



39

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.440

Then we take the register page, the background color of the register page looks like orange, but when



40

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.240

I checked the log in, it looks like the default white color.



41

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.090

OK, everything looks perfect, that's all.



42

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.890

Thank you.
