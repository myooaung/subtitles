00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.060

Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will implement not font and unauthorized components.



2

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.790

These two components will be used as editor pates and both of them will be Statik Pates.



3

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.710

I mean, they will have all the e-mail content.



4

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.710

We will use them not found page for unknown pates or unknown pets.



5

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.520

And we will use the unauthorized page for the unauthorized access restrictions because we have different



6

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.870

rules like admin and user.



7

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.110

And we will give different access for BORTAC that we will create a simple page that contains an error



8

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.930

message and back button.



9

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.990

Both of them will be similar to each other.



10

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.480

Now let's start to implement the not font page.



11

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.080

I want to go to the not font component HDMI side and work on that here.



12

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.410

I'll quickly remove everything here and other containers.



13

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.070

By the way, I'll use the Emmet's plugin here.



14

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.630

I can use it in intelligent easily here.



15

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.680

I type the last name, then hit the tab and Emmet's plugin will that.



16

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.080

It is a side note.



17

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.920

Nothing too specific, just a feature of my idea.



18

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.780

So this is a normal container class here.



19

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.400

Using the bootstrap framework in the container.



20

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.400

I want to create a row with a nested bootstrap column class.



21

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.940

Let's say this to make it equal to all screen sizes.



22

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.160

Of course I want to create it in center mode.



23

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.060

Then I want to display error message cards with a big font size.



24

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.240

Then I'll show a lead message and give some margin bottom for it.



25

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.890

Our description might be offs, we can't seem to find the page you are looking for.



26

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:44.680

Finally, I carry the button for back to how this will be a link instead of Reath, we will use Racz



27

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.620

or Link, if you remember it from the previous listen rather to a link is a directive for redirection.



28

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.870

OK, now let's reload the page and see it not found Page.



29

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:13.430

OK, that looks so clear and effective, not font page will be a static page, so we will use the only



30

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:21.440

content of it so we don't need the component details so we can remove the redundant hooks from the component.



31

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.720

OK, now are not found, Page is ready now we will implement unauthorised component estimate.



32

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.170

Actually, it will be similar to the not found page.



33

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:42.400

We need to change just the message of it and the message of it so we can copy and paste the content



34

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.080

of the not font page.



35

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.240

Then we can edit it.



36

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:56.380

Message code will be four hundred one and the description might be unauthorized.



37

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.350

Access to this resource is the denied.



38

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.860

OK, now let's reload the page and see the unauthorized page.



39

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.230

OK, it looks perfect.



40

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:22.820

Finally, we will authorize our reporters from the EP routing module, if our writers are not described



41

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.930

previously, we will redirect to the not font page.



42

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.980

We should describe default unknown had behavior.



43

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:41.270

I mean, if we tried to join the application with an unknown path like hello, in this case, we should



44

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:50.260

say that this part is an unknown part and we should redirect it to the for hundreds for Pat to do it,



45

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.240

there are to provide an air handler.



46

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:01.350

If there is an error occurring on the router, we can catch it and we can navigate it to the forehands



47

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.550

for Pat in the approaching module constructor, we will check it.



48

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:15.050

If there is an error about rotters, then we will redirect to do not font for hundreds for page.



49

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.430

OK, now let's see it on the browser, we can test it with an unknown.



50

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.660

That's when we try to access an unknown that we will see the 404 page.



51

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.240

OK, that's all, thank you.
