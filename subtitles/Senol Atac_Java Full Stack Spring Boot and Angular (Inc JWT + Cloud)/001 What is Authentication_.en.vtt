Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will talk about authentication, module of skippering security, authentication



2

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.160

means confirming your own identity, so it is related to it.



3

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.330

Who are you?



4

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.400

There are a lot of login types in spring security, but we will talk about foreign login.



5

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:33.280

Start points of spring security is http filters, HDTV filters, catch the HTTP request and filter them.



6

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.790

Suppling security works with filters.



7

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:45.010

When you send a request from Clydeside, cyber security will attach it with ID filters.



8

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:56.020

This filter is basic authentication filter as default in Cypriot security in this class will do filter



9

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.130

internal methods.



10

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.100

The request is processed, but we should notice something here.



11

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.600

The request should be sent with basic authorization token to server side to do it.



12

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.490

Credentials should be sent with basic base64 token.



13

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:24.940

These tokens should be constructor's from username and password that Endou filter internal method.



14

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:34.960

The authorization header will be taken, then it will be decoded with base64 algorithm, then username



15

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.570

password authentication token will be created from username and password.



16

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.920

Later authentication request will be provided.



17

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.760

Authentication will be implemented with provider manager provider manager.



18

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:01.630

Iterate through all the providers, configure authentication providers and the ligate the actual authentication



19

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.730

job to authentication providers.



20

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.560

There are many implementations for authentication provider.



21

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:17.590

One of the implementation is the authentication provider, which extends from the abstract user details



22

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.940

authentication provider.



23

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:30.230

In authentication provider, we can inject password encoder or user user details service to authenticate



24

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.250

from database in next lessons.



25

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.320

We will see the implementation of it.



26

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:46.140

In the authentication provider class, first of all, we will call retrieve user method in this matter,



27

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:54.730

we will look at user from a database with user name after finding user with username, we will check



28

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.270

password with additional authentication checks method.



29

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:09.070

After authentication, we will return successful response or failure response as an exception, but



30

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:17.590

we should store it on security context to access it from everywhere in application as final think.



31

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.730

Let's understand the content of what constitutes an object.



32

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.620

Although integration is a principle object and contains credentials, authorities and principal.



33

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.110

OK, that's all about cybering security authentication.



34

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.240

Thank you.
