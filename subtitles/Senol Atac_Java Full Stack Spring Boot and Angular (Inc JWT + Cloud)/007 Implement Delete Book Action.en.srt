Hi, guys, in this lesson, I'll implement the lead operation in the booklist, I'll open the admin

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:12,950
compartment.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,940
First of all, I'll Creedon error message, we're able to show the errors, it will be a sitrick.

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:32,760
Then on Crete, the bullet function as a parameter, I expect the selected book Object and index of

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,740
the selected book object.

6
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:46,810
Then I call the delete book method from the book service, I will send the book object as a parameter

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:54,640
to the book service, then I will subscribe to the delete book function because the delete book function

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,200
is an observable item.

9
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:04,450
If the delete book operation is completed successfully, I remove the selected index from the book list.

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,390
Then I will implement the Ed block if there is an error.

11
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,580
We should set the error message.

12
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,860
We can set it like unexpected error occured to the bucket.

13
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,850
We can also write the error on the console.

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,260
Finally, I'll sign it to the delete button on the admin HDMI.

15
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:44,610
I opened the admin HDMI and I'll carry that click events on the delete button and I'll call the delete

16
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,830
function with the parameters.

17
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,810
OK, now we can test it from the browser.

18
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:25,420
When I click to the delete button on the booklist, we can see the selected item as removed, that's

19
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:25,810
all.

20
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,560
Thank you.
