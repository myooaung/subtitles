1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:12,050
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will create the connection between the book components and Edman component

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,720
and we will share the data between two of them.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,380
Let's implement it.

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,130
First of all, we need to call the book component from the admin component.

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,540
This is so easy.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,870
We can directly call it with the book component selector.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:34,040
The selector for the book component is EBP book, so to call it.

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,880
We will use this text in the admin HDMI.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,930
OK, let's check the results from the browser.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,300
Yes, now we can see the content of the book component in the Edvin Page.

11
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,020
So our first mission is completed.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,790
Our second mission is to call the child function from the parent.

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,810
So I create a crit button on the admin component.

14
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:06,760
Then when I click this button, I want to open the module in the book component.

15
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,590
How can we implement it?

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,940
First of all, I need a crede button in the admin HDMI.

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,850
Secondly, I need a module in the book component.

18
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,360
Thirdly, I need the function in the book component to open the model dialog.

19
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:30,780
Finally, I need a function in the admin component which cost book component function.

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,020
Let's start with the first one.

21
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:39,740
I could either create button on the admin estimate, let's open the admin estimate.

22
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:47,630
I'd add a column next to the header off the table on the division that has two classes.

23
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:54,200
One is column which takes the other half of the row and other class is the text and.

24
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:02,150
It will show the bottom at the end of the row inside it, I'll carry the button that has two classes.

25
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,220
One is N and the other one is B10 primary.

26
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,740
Then I hit the top text of the bottom can Creed book.

27
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,250
Now, I can check the results from the browser.

28
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,800
OK, it looks good.

29
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:32,290
Secondly, I could see the model in the book Estima to do it, I'd open the book HDMI and I'll carry

30
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,220
that book model.

31
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,910
First of all, I'll clear the content of the page.

32
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,910
Then I'll create a component template with the Emmet's plugin.

33
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,410
So I will start with the Golos model and fate.

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,050
They are basically step model container Steiglitz.

35
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,160
Then this model will have two basic attributes.

36
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,960
One is idy.

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,530
The value of it can be book model.

38
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,750
The other one is TEPP Index.

39
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:08,170
The TEPP index attribute explicitly defines the navigation order for flexible elements.

40
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,170
So here we are setting it for minus one.

41
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,710
We remove the element from the default navigation flow so a user cannot tap to it.

42
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,780
Inside it.

43
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,200
I create an element that has a model dialog class.

44
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,220
Inside it, I'll create an element that has a model content class inside it.

45
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,660
I create that form element that separate it from here.

46
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,790
I'll hit the tab and Emmott's plugin will complete that HDMI content for me.

47
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:49,720
Here, I don't need form action so I can remove it inside the form, I need three module parts.

48
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,890
First one is the Model Haddish.

49
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:01,130
I carry the model head of glass inside it, I'll carry the Heather element that has a model title class

50
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:11,450
next to the title, that close button, this button will have a button, close glass and I'll and then

51
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,670
attribute for display to the attributes will be data.

52
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,870
Yes, this means it will be used to close the model.

53
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,390
I hit the top and the EMTs plug in will complete the HDMI contents for me.

54
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,350
I can set the model title as book details.

55
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:41,310
Then I'll add model buddy, I hit the tab, I'll handle the content of my money later.

56
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:49,050
Finally, I'll create the model for that part inside it, I'll carry that close button.

57
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,180
These button will have beaten and beat and secondary classes.

58
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,900
I'll add an attribute for this pattern, the attribute will be data.

59
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,900
Yes, this means it will be used to close the model.

60
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:21,280
Next to these close button, I'll add a submit button, this button will have beaten and beat and primary

61
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:30,050
classes and I'll add an attribute for this button attribute of it will be type and value of attribute

62
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,180
will be submit.

63
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,530
Then I'll hit the tab and the math plugin will complete the HDMI content for me.

64
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,410
Here is our markup.

65
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,460
First button text will be close.

66
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,800
And the second button text will be, say, Chanes.

67
00:05:52,050 --> 00:06:01,800
OK, now our model template is ready now in the book components, I create the function to open the

68
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,320
model dialog.

69
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:11,430
I'll open the book component, I can access the model from the angle of component by model.

70
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,170
But to show or highlight the model, I need to query declaration.

71
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,340
So first of all, I'll add the query declaration in the book component.

72
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:31,380
Then I create the method to show the book model J creating element.

73
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:39,480
That model will be used to show or highlight the model we can send to show parameters to show it, or

74
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,510
we can send the height parameter to hide it.

75
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,050
Finally, we will call the book component function from the head component.

76
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:59,800
Now, I open the admin component to access the child component in English, we can use the the child

77
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,760
declaration.

78
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:10,740
The U.S. declaration gets a component as a parameter, so our parameter will be muk components when

79
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:18,990
we set it with the VHI declaration, we can access all the functions of book component from the admin

80
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,560
component.

81
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,800
Now I'll create a function to call the child function here.

82
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,950
We want to create a method to create a book.

83
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,340
Then I'll call the show book model function from the book component.

84
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,100
OK, our function is ready.

85
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,610
Now I'll assign it to the button in the admin HDMI page.

86
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,320
The click event of the create button will be three book requests.

87
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,060
OK, now we have completed our mission.

88
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,470
Now we can see the results from the browser.

89
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,730
When me collected the book, we will see the book model that comes from the book component.

90
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,010
OK, that's all for this lesson.

91
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,710
Thank you.
