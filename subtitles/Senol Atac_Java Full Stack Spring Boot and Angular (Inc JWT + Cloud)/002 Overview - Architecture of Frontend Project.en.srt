Hi, guys, in this lesson, I'll talk about what we do on the client side and how we will go.

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,800
First of all, on the client side, we will create an angular project to create it.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,980
We will use angular CLI command line interface.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:30,300
Of course, this angular CLI will work over nodeJS so our application will be basically and

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:38,340
nodejs project with this application, we will create a user interface for a bookselling system,

6
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,740
bookstore system.

7
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:48,010
So we will present books in the application and users can purchase them.

8
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,090
Of course it will.

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,540
have many details.

10
00:00:52,380 --> 00:01:00,570
First of all, we will have an admin dashboard and from the admin dashboard we can create books or we

11
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:08,070
can edit books or we can delete books so we can manage books from the admin dashboard.

12
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,130
Secondly, users can purchase books from the home page.

13
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:24,600
Thirdly, we will have different roles like user and admin, so we will see an example application for

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,100
a role based system fourthly.

15
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,390
We will implement authorization and authentication.

16
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:42,760
For example, some page will be displayed by only admins if the default users try to access these admin

17
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,390
pages.

18
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,920
We will restrict these pages with authorization mechanisms for authentication.

19
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,270
We will have a login and register pages.

20
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,260
Then we will see the model will control the implementation on angular.

21
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,020
So we will implement the best practices on the angular. To illustrate it,

22
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:17,070
We will create different models, services and components and we will see the dependency relationship

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,150
among them.

24
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,410
Last but not least, we will use JWT as authorization.

25
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:34,140
So we will see example cases with JWT implementation like we see from the beginning.

26
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:42,390
At the end of the course, we will learn lots of features of angular and we will see them in example

27
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,840
cases one by one and step by step.

28
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,760
That's all for the beginning.

29
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,600
Thank you.
