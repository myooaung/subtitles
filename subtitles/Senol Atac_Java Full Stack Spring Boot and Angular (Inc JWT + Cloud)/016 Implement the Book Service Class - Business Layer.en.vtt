Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will create the book service in this lesson, we will also continue



2

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.720

to implement model service control structures.



3

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.540

In this previous listen, we describe our book repository in this lesson.



4

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.060

We will call it from service.



5

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.360

And this service class will be our business logic.



6

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.450

Our service class will include basic Karad methods about book like Seiberg, the lead book, find book,



7

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.050

etc..



8

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.700

Let's implement it.



9

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.680

First of all, under the service package, we will create a book service interface.



10

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.390

And under the service package, we will create a book service implementation class.



11

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:05.190

And this book service implementation class will implement book service interface to define book service



12

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.150

as a service class, we will add service incitation to it.



13

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.030

The mark begins with service addition to indicate that it's all linked to business logic or service



14

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.480

layer.



15

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.740

So book service build business logic operations for the book.



16

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.320

Later we will call Book Repository for dependency injection.



17

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.030

We can use white insipient.



18

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.730

We can use auto wiring on properties setas or constructor's so we can test it to construct it also.



19

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.550

OK, now we can create our methods, our first method will be saved book to save work.



20

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.170

We can call Book Repository that same method.



21

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.910

But here, first of all, let's describe the default properties of the book.



22

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.460

Then we can save the book.



23

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:22.970

OK, that's all about the same book, our second smattered will be the latest book by Idy.



24

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.150

We can directly call it from Book Repository because G.P.A. Repository has a method like the lead by



25

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.960

idea on default.



26

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:57.750

Our third method will be find all books they can directly call it from Book Repository because gatepost



27

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.350

already has a method like find all on default.



28

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.060

OK, that's all about work service implementation.



29

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.870

Thank you.
