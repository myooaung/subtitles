00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:12,530
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will start to implement the admin page component and VIF on this page.

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,000
First of all, we will list all books with tables.

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,760
Secondly, we can add new books.

4
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:25,710
Thirdly, we can edit these books and finally we can delete these books.

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,650
So we will implement the current page.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,250
Let's start with listing all books.

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,790
First of all, I'll open the admin component.

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:44,940
We will display the books in the table so we should create a book list at a as a eight able and type

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,730
of it will be an array of books.

10
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,960
Then we can inject our services on the constructor's.

11
00:00:53,530 --> 00:01:01,060
We need a single service, we will use Booke service to call the get all books and point.

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:10,000
Then we can implement the engie on in its methods, engy on any method is a callback method that is

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,240
invoked immediately after the default change detector has checked the directive's data Bond's properties

14
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:24,100
for the first time and before any of the verb or content children having checked it is invoked only

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,190
once when the directive is instantiated.

16
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,700
In this matter, we will set the booklist I will call the book service method, then I will set the

17
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,770
results to vocalist's.

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,010
OK, now our admin component is ready, now we will implement our admin.

19
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,040
Let's open the admin estimate.

20
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,950
First of all, let's clear the contents.

21
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:02,370
Then I start to write HTML content using it and met plugin.

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,200
We generally use the container to wrap the whole content and I want to add some heading to the top of

23
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,850
the contents.

24
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:19,040
Then I'll carry the card to present to the table because our context looks like a card.

25
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,880
So it has a title on the header and body of it will be table.

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:33,670
So I will start with a class card inside it, I'll create an element that has a card headed class next

27
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:42,130
to these card headers on the card, buddy, that is in other class and inside these card, buddy on

28
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,910
that table.

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,300
And this table will have two classes that are table and tables throughout.

30
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,720
So it will be stripe format.

31
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,580
Then I hit the tap and the inmates bill again, we'll complete the demo contents for me.

32
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,570
OK, here is our Marco.

33
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:10,960
Inside the court, Heather, I showed the table heads to show it, I can edit growth.

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:20,880
So I will start with a glass glassblower inside it, I'll create an element that has a whole six glass.

35
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,920
This whole six or call to Earth comes from great pieces.

36
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,350
Whole pieces are 12.

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:37,760
So you can think it like you separate the 16 to equal pieces and you choose the six pieces of it.

38
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,270
Then on the head there are three elements inside the cup.

39
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,730
Then I hit the top.

40
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,940
Our title can be all books.

41
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,900
Now we can implement the content of the table.

42
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,260
We will have a header and body in the table to do it.

43
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,740
I create each team and elements.

44
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,150
So I will start with the hat.

45
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,820
Inside it, all across the table, raw elements.

46
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:25,230
Inside it, I create p h elements and these t h schult have an attribute called Skop Call.

47
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:32,010
I multiply with six because we will need six different cells.

48
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:42,230
Next to the table had oil at the table, but in amounts inside it, I could see that table, raw element

49
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,150
inside it on the key h element.

50
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:57,710
And these t h should have an attribute called skop roll because I use it to show index values next to

51
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,090
the edge.

52
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:07,700
I'll add it to the element I multiply with five, then I'll hit the top.

53
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,890
OK, now let's steal the headers one by one, first one will be used for indexing.

54
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,760
Second one will be used to show the title of the book.

55
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:31,710
31 will be used to show the price of the book of them will be used to show the author of The Book Thief

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,340
will be used to show the date of the book.

57
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:44,710
And the last one will be used for actions like delete or edit buttons and hook up later.

58
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,260
Then we will use the energy for DirecTV.

59
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,590
It is a structural directive that renders a template for each time in a collection.

60
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,450
So our collection is Booklist.

61
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,170
We will render each book item in the book list with the energy for detective.

62
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,050
They can also get the index value from list with energy for DirecTV.

63
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:18,610
OK, now let's fill the headers one by one, first one will be used for indexing here to start from

64
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,490
one we can add plus one to the index.

65
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,120
Second one will be the title of the book item.

66
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,810
One will be the price of the book item here we can use Courant's Pipe to transform the price of the

67
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,140
book.

68
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:46,820
They can use pipes to transform strings, currency elements, dates and other data for display types

69
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:54,560
are simple functions we can use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed

70
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:54,950
value.

71
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:02,210
Pipes are useful because we can use them throughout our application while only declaration each pipe

72
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,670
wants.

73
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:12,470
For example, we would use a pipe to show a price as ten dollars rather than the real price format.

74
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,290
Or we can sell it for that also.

75
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:24,120
So in our example, we want price with a dollar symbol to do it, we will add a pipe that pipe.

76
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,660
So I feel the currency and property of currency, it will be USD.

77
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,890
Ford Field will be the author of the book Eitam.

78
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,360
Chief Dunn will be the lead time of the book item.

79
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:54,600
Here we can use that pipe to form up the creek time of the book, that pipe provides many predefined

80
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,110
formats or we can create a custom format here.

81
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,940
We can use one of them to transform the date.

82
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,260
For example, we can use media formats or short format.

83
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:18,740
And the last cell will be used for election buttons like delete or edit buttons, for now, let's create

84
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,740
the templates of the buttons in the next.

85
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,870
Listen, I hook up so I will create a button.

86
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:34,030
This button has classes like DTN and B10 primary and margin ads for space with the next button.

87
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,410
Then I hit the tap.

88
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,990
First button text will be added.

89
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,970
Next to it, I'll add another button.

90
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,450
This button has Colossus like DTN, b10 danger.

91
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:01,310
This button will be used for delete, then I hit the top second button text will be delete, we will

92
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,910
implement the contents of them in the next lesson.

93
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,780
OK, now our HTML page is ready.

94
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,560
Let's check the result on the browser.

95
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,870
OK, it looks perfect.

96
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,280
That's all for this lesson.

97
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,170
See you and the next lesson.

98
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,000
Thank you.
