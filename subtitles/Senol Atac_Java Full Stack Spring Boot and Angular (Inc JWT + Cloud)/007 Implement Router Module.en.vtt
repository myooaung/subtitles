00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:15.670

Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will create our rotters in English, and it has its own Raqa, so setting



2

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.260

up the rotor is really easy.



3

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.230

We don't need to pull extra packets or anything like that.



4

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:31.780

We already have some component templates like login, registered home, etc. and these components will



5

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.210

serve as pates using derogative.



6

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.840

So we need to add these pates to the roster and we need to navigate between that.



7

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:49.240

First of all, we'll create the navigation bar and then we will specify the two parts, one by one,



8

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.160

to create the navigation.



9

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.810

But we can create a new component or we can directly edit the app component here we can directly at



10

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.620

the navigation to the app component because this navigation bar will be used on the whole application



11

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.480

by each component on the navigation roll.



12

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.310

Then I'll add some navigation bar items here.



13

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.070

I'll use some bootstrap classes.



14

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:26.590

We can understand the functionalities of them from the names of them and these navigation bar will be



15

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.510

in horizontal mode.



16

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.260

We can use it in document background will be in Dartmouth.



17

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.430

These are some bootstrap codes to create a nice navigation.



18

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.010

We will see the actions of them on the browser one by one.



19

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.010

Then let's create an aviation brand as an angular icon, then mcelligott.



20

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.820

It will redirect to ANGULAR that IO also we can add some text for it.



21

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.460

OK, now let's check it from the browser.



22

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.440

Nice, we have a navigation template and angular print icon is ready.



23

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.650

Now let's create other navigation items.



24

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.170

We can divide the navigation bar to two sites on the left side.



25

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.700

We can show admin and home links.



26

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.260

And on the other side, we can show the register and login links.



27

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.110

Navigation Barsh Nieve.



28

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:52.880

Never, never carets Fleck's column in the navigation bar me auto means margin ends auto, so it will



29

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.040

stay on the left side and the right side will be automatically arranged.



30

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.030

Then I'll carry the navigation list item and then I'll create a navigation link.



31

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.090

Our first link will be Edman done in the same way we will create the home link.



32

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.050

Finally, let's get the sign in and sign up links to the navigation bar.



33

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.980

These links will be on the right side of the navigation bar.



34

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:38.810

So they will be navigation bar items, but at this time, margins taht will be automatically arranged.



35

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.340

Then I'll carry the navigation list item and then I create a navigation link.



36

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.990

Then I create an immigration list item and.



37

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.160

Then I'll create an irrigation link, our first link will be sign up.



38

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.920

Then in the same way, I carry this high EnLink.



39

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:16.470

OK, for now, our navigation bar is ready as tight later, I'm going to hook up these links.



40

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.910

Let's check it from the browser.



41

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:35.180

OK, it looks perfect to make these links work, I first neither answer with some rocks to which I can



42

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.750

actually navigate actually to provide it.



43

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.750

We already have a class for it.



44

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.870

It's an app ratfink module under the app folder here.



45

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:55.790

We will describe each road in the rocks area rocks in an area of JavaScript objects.



46

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.370

Each object has a pad property and the parts means the pad in the URL.



47

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.990

So what comes after the number?



48

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.350

For example, home will be a pad here, etc..



49

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:21.870

We don't need to add four parts, the first part will be the home part in this case, I want to look



50

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.290

at my home continent, make sure to also add confluent import.



51

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:36.050

This will later on tell the Roter whenever we visit our tomine slash home lot.



52

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:44.490

These home components are obligated because I also want to have the Logan drought slash log-in.



53

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.640

In this case, I want to Lord Logan component.



54

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.090

Similarly, I also have the register at.



55

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.810

Registered in this case, I want a lord register component.



56

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.170

Similarly, I also have the profile profiler's.



57

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.730

Solatia profile in this case, I want a low profile component.



58

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.920

Similarly, I also have the admiral's slash admin.



59

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.150

In this case, I want a lot admin component.



60

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.510

Finally, I will need to create Araz for Arab states.



61

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.560

I need to not fund road.



62

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:40.920

I can describe it with 404 in this case, I want to Lord, not Farnes Compound, I need the unauthorized



63

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.260

rot, I can describe it with four hundredths one.



64

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.790

In this case, I want to lord unauthorized compound.



65

00:06:52.270 --> 00:07:02.380

OK, now we have described our roots, but there is one missing root, we need the default rot, so



66

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.610

we need the rod for an end, Pat.



67

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:15.910

We also need to cover these praat iwk the first draft and remove the pat and keep it as empty.



68

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:32.340

So now the pet is just an empty string, which means this rod where we are at the beginning in the default



69

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.840

pet in this case, I don't want to Lawder separate component.



70

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:45.590

Instead, I want to navigate the home pet so I can set it as a redirect pet here.



71

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:53.840

I therefore add the redirect to the property known by Angler and then I want to navigate the home pet.



72

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.510

I need to add one other property.



73

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.960

Pet match equals four.



74

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:12.720

It means it has angular only to execute this rod, only to redirect itself in this case if the complete



75

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.400

pot is empty.



76

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:21.270

If I did not have Pat match, this rod would always be fired.



77

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:29.250

Even if we have slash other parts, because you can think of there is always an empty string between



78

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.950

the pet and slash.



79

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.360

So to avoid it we should set petmeds equals four.



80

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:48.270

Now, we have configured our hats here, we have a line like robot module that for what this means,



81

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:57.140

registered these rods as root routers in the application that is known to the whole application here.



82

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:06.150

The difference between imports and exports is the import error is how you register dependencies with



83

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.810

a module.



84

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:18.060

And the exports array is how you declared those dependencies as public, making their services, directives,



85

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.320

components, etc. available for use in other modules.



86

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.770

OK, now our Raechel configuration is ready.



87

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.650

Now let's see how Engelhard uses these rioters.



88

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.480

First of all, English should be aware of the Rorter module.



89

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:46.050

So for this awareness rather module is imported by the Engler's Saili by default rorter module should



90

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:52.610

be added to the module because it will be used by the whole application.



91

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.750

Last important piece of Roter is the virata outlet.



92

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:06.990

We need to tell the angular arter where to render these components or these components be tailored to



93

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.400

render the home component.



94

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:14.310

If we visit the home page or render the login component if we visit the low-impact.



95

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.380

But where should it render them?



96

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.980

Thankfully, it is not by default.



97

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.780

Overriding our complete e-mail code is Dete.



98

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:33.350

We have to give it a hook there to render this to do it, we need a ride to an outlet directive.



99

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.620

This will take care of our Rutter's.



100

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.190

Now let's assign the results to our navigation links.



101

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:46.830

To handle it, we need to replace the ref attribute which rather link.



102

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.530

This is a built in directive.



103

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:58.260

The Scarboro cats indicate propertied binding then on past data with this directive, the data I want



104

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.150

to pass is an error.



105

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.820

This is how you set up navigation in this area.



106

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:09.690

Each element stands for one segment, in your part in the other.



107

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:18.090

So if you have a longer pad, let's say slash product, some idea than slash detailed, then you should



108

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:25.140

specify three segments, user I.D. and DETI here.



109

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:33.750

The deal have only one segment and it filby oh here we should use slash.



110

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:45.330

Otherwise it will be related that this one always redirects to domain plus home in the same way we will



111

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.110

add another.



112

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:51.900

Arato links also our second rate or Lynnfield slash admin for admin part.



113

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:08.240

Are the rods or length will be as Sledge will be slash registered for sign up at.



114

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:24.120

Final hour to arrange for the sign in Pat PLB Slash Sloggett.



115

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:38.180

With this setup, let's load our application and see if this works.



116

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:52.180

Of course, it would be nice to see which navigation item current is active, so to do it, let's add



117

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.410

this functionality.



118

00:12:54.010 --> 00:13:01.510

To add such a style with normal success, we could add a class to at least item SASE class of active,



119

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:11.730

which is a class provided by most and adding it to the list item once these lots would step will highlight.



120

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.190

This is active.



121

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:21.010

Of course these will stay active even if I navigate away because hardcoded it into the navigation,



122

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:28.030

it would be nice if we could conditionally attach this CSS class to the list item.



123

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:34.470

Only if the nested link is active, we can do it angular easily.



124

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:42.040

All we have to do is we have to add the role to link active detective.



125

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:48.370

And here, between the quotation marks, we will test octave class.



126

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.700

Octave is the name of the class that we want to attach, the cool thing is angular after automatically



127

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:04.790

finds octave router link and it hits this list item with this set up.



128

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.290

Let's load our application and see if this works.



129

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:17.570

Great, everything works fine, that's all about anger, the writing.



130

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:18.550

Thank you.
