Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will create our model class for book class, actually, world class

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:21,440
will be a basic class that has the title Altor Prize Description and eight fields.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,340
Actually, it will be similar to the backend model class.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,740
Now I'll read the book model class under the models folder.

5
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,140
So it will be a TypeScript Phi.

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:44,960
I'll export it as a book class, and here I simply want to define how it should look like I do this

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:53,960
by adding book fields first field is idy and type of it should be no, it can be undefined also if it

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,950
is not descript, the second one is the title and the type of it should be Citilink.

9
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:08,330
I can initialize it like the third one is the alter and the type of it should be Citilink.

10
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,150
I can initialize it blank.

11
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:16,990
The other one is the price and the type of it should be and no I can initialize it.

12
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,470
Zero.

13
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:23,210
The other one is the description and the type of it should be sitrick.

14
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:31,730
I can initialize it blank lost fields will be crit time and the type of it should be date.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,220
I can initialize it as a new date.

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,790
Then I'll add a constructor where I am able to initialize them collectively.

17
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,770
Here, I'll get my idea as a parameter, which is of type no.

18
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,310
Of course, it can be undefined also.

19
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,130
So the meaning of the question mark is that it can be undefined.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,510
Secondly, I can get the title as a parameter, which is of TIV string.

21
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,950
Its initial value will be blank and lost.

22
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,210
Parameter is price, which is of type no.

23
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,570
Its initial value will be zero.

24
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,100
And here in the constructor, the assembly hook my properties with these parameters.

25
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,980
Like, you see, I have created that construct that includes some fields, so it is not necessary to

26
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:34,950
describe all properties in the constructor because I have already initialized other fields in field

27
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,610
description.

28
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:43,430
So what I did here is basically create a typescript clause with six properties and a constructor where

29
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,320
I initialize these properties.

30
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,440
OK, that's all about the book.

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,160
Middle class.

32
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,060
Thank you.
