Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will examine our model and diagram in our project, we will implement

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:18,230
an online book shopping based on users and books to implement the system.

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,040
We will use three main classes.

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,900
These are users, book and purchase.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:39,680
Our user table will be a typical user table, so it will store user name, password, name and roll

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,340
here.

7
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:50,270
We will store the roll field as in on video and in our application, we will have different roles.

8
00:00:51,430 --> 00:01:01,370
These are users, admin and system manager users role will be our default role.

9
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:08,670
So when someone comes to our application and signing the roll of it will be user.

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:19,520
Admin minerals will be used to create books, update books and delete books, so for admin, operation,

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:29,030
admin, dashboard operations system manager role will be used for internal operations, for example,

12
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,970
to change the role of the user, etc..

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,840
Our second table will be book in the stable.

14
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:51,470
We will store the book metadata like title after price description, etc. We will store the some basic

15
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,360
properties of book.

16
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,540
Our last table will be purchase or purchase history.

17
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:09,740
This table will be a transaction table, or we can say that it will be a long table, it will store

18
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,720
the purchase locks.

19
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,100
It will store information like this.

20
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,960
User purchased that book with X price on that date.

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:33,560
So we will start this information in the stable hour and these will be these items and we will create

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,450
them one by one and we will see the details about them on the next lessons.

23
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,970
OK, that's all about class and diagram.

24
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,130
Thank you.
