00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:12,050
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will create our backhands project and we will import it to Intelligent

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:19,270
to create a spring project, the best way is using Cypriote initializes.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,700
First of all, we shall choose our project type.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:32,190
Our project type will be greater, but if you want to go on with one, you can choose it.

5
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:42,530
Also, we will use Garito because Gradle has eesa configuration and better performance than most.

6
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:53,660
Gradle awards work by taking input and output of tasks and only running what is necessary and only processing

7
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,750
fires that changed when possible.

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,360
Secondly, our language will be Zhuo.

9
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,510
Our Springwood version will be the latest stable version.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,120
Our group name will be.

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,530
Com that shot.

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,380
Our artifact name will be Cyprien.

13
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:26,780
Would bookseller's lasting about project metadata is to choose the Zhuo version.

14
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,210
We will go on with Jawa 11.

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,200
OK, that's all about metadata.

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,470
Let us choose our dependencies.

17
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:44,150
First one is that because we will use model, we have control or structure on our service.

18
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:55,580
Second one is security, because we will implement secure endpoints, the other one is Zhawar Persistance

19
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,500
API, because we will use object relational mapping.

20
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,890
The other one is PostgreSQL, because we will use it for database operations.

21
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,920
Last one is Lombok, because we will use it for clean cut.

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,420
OK, that's all about dependencies.

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,270
Now we can generate it.

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,230
We are almost ready to start programming now.

25
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,190
We will import it to intelligence in the schools.

26
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,750
We will go on with intelligence.

27
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,030
But if you want, you can go on with Eclipse or other framework's.

28
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:08,480
After importing a third the intelligence to enable Lumberg operations on intelligence, we should enable

29
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,680
incitation processing from setting Sprong preferences.

30
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,900
OK, now we are ready to start coding.

31
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:36,780
By the way, if we run our project on this step, we will get errors about database configuration.

32
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,380
This is so normal because we don't consider it yet.

33
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,710
We will handle it in the next lessons.

34
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,270
That's all for the beginning.

35
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,200
Thank you.
