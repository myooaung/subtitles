Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will learn basic things about book library, we will use a book library

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,670
for clean code.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,020
Normally we should create getter and setter methods in Java for encapsulation principle.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,290
But all time to create these methods are not effective for coders.

5
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:29,200
For escape it, we can use more, get it or certain methods.

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,990
These methods can be used on class level or field level.

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:42,010
If they use it on class level, all fields will have getset and settle methods.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,040
The other annotation of Lundbeck is data with this.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:54,820
In addition, we can handle Gitter Setar equals and Hedgcock methods automatically.

10
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,280
The other important annotation of Bloomberg is venue with this innovation.

11
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,720
We can create final imitable classes.

12
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,440
Venue is similar to the data innovation, but it creates imitable classes.

13
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:21,610
The other thing about Bloomberg is creating default, empty constructors and full argument constructed

14
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,720
to create empty constructors, we can use no ARC's constructed annotation to create full argument constructed.

15
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,290
We can use all concepts annotation.

16
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,720
OK, that's OK.

17
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,420
Thank you.
