00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:13,170
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will implement application properties for our server side, you know

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,410
that spring has default configurations.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,920
So in this lesson we will customize these configurations.

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,900
We will use PostgreSQL DJed in our projec.

5
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:36,120
You know, that Postgres kid works with Database's, so Supreme Court shoot, no database name and credentials

6
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,270
so we can easily set it with using Sprink, that datasource Datura.

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:54,230
Your own format will be JDBC, PostgreSQL Hostname Port name, plus Deveny.

8
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:05,150
Also, we should describe octaves schema Omura because the default schema of PostgreSQL is public,

9
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,610
so we don't specify the schema.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,870
PostgreSQL try to use these public schema.

11
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,810
Our active schema will be schema product like we described in the previous list.

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,380
In the data source, you're dead.

13
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,630
We can customize all the properties of PostgreSQL connection, for example.

14
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:39,690
We can permit to connect with them, as I said, connection, or we can enable Bache operations, etc..

15
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,230
Our other property is Ciprian.

16
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,430
That datasource.

17
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,010
That username will be admin and Sprink that datasource.

18
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,860
That password will be one, two, three, four.

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,670
You know that we described in the previous lesson on the database user roll part.

20
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:11,670
Then we will describe the driver, class, name and dialect for PostgreSQL, because Supreme Court should

21
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,450
know which database drivers will be processed.

22
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:38,410
In our project, we won't use a database migration tool or we won't implement database changes manually,

23
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:48,590
so we will use hibernate the AL set auto configuration to set it simply that JPA that hibernate, that

24
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:58,060
the dell'orto properties will be used, the dell'orto property can be created, update, validate or

25
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:05,740
not create means delete and create a database from beginning for each day.

26
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:14,560
Update means just implement changes coming from hibernate entities.

27
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:23,020
Validate means just to validate data base according to the hibernate entities.

28
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,210
So we can use update mode here.

29
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:36,040
Then, especially in the development mode, we want to see the logs of asking to set it.

30
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,290
We can use sibling that JPA dot show Escala will be true.

31
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,040
OK, this configuration will be enough for us for the beginning.

32
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,110
Thank you.
