Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will improve the navigation bar and complement.

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:18,210
Currently we have an aviation bar, but it doesn't support role based templates and it doesn't support

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,300
the logout event.

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,120
I mean, that it displays sign in and sign up links everything.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,690
But I want to show a laggard and profile page links after the successful logging operation.

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,600
Now let's implement them one by one.

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,320
First of all, we need a current user object because I want to show the user name on the navigation

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,750
after the logging operation, and I need to know the role of the user.

9
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,400
If it is admin, I need to display different links on the navigation bar.

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:59,810
Then we can inject our services on the constructor, first of all, we will use authentication service

11
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,590
to call the logout method and to get the current user.

12
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:13,610
Secondly, we need rotor service because after the logout operation, the login page should be displayed.

13
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:24,100
In this construct, we will set the current user from the authentication service and we should get current

14
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:31,800
user from the authentication service as an observable because we know it's really chains on the app

15
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,580
component.

16
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,370
We want to touch it.

17
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,000
It is observable.

18
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:45,100
So to get it, we should listen to it with the subscribe function and to subscribe function will be

19
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,760
triggered when there is a change on the current user inside it.

20
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,340
We will set the common data to our current user with able.

21
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,170
Then we need a function to understand the role of the user.

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,630
Actually, we need a method to get whether the user is admin or not because we want to display the admin

23
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,290
page link.

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,150
If the user has admin, we can find out easily from user or.

25
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,040
Finally, we need to create a logout function, it will call the logout method from the authentication

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,340
service and it will never get to the login page.

27
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,530
Now we can edit the navigation bar on the app component estimate.

28
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:01,350
First of all, I'll show the admin link if the user has admin role so I can handle it with the NGF directive

29
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,170
and my condition is, is admin.

30
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:20,010
Secondly, I shoulda registered and login links if the current user is not available so I can handle

31
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:29,050
it with the NGF directive and my condition is current user or current user I.D. is undefined.

32
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,900
I use the question mark to check on object rates.

33
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:41,490
Then I'll copy and paste this block and I'll edit it for if current user is available.

34
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:50,990
If current user is available, I'll replace the register link with the profile link and is a text I

35
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,160
ensure the current user username.

36
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:09,780
Then I replace the Logan linked with the logout function and as text, I shall sign out.

37
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,110
By the way, logout will be a function so I cannot use to link.

38
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,600
Instead of it, I should use Callick event.

39
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,000
OK, that's all.

40
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:44,720
Now we can check the result from the browser to test all cases, I shall test it for guest default user

41
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,730
and admin for guests.

42
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,260
I'll see the register and login links for session users.

43
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:02,720
So if I sign in user is available, I should see the profile and log to links for admins.

44
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,080
I should also see the admin link on the navigation bar for admin users.

45
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,600
I can use the user that I created on the server side or I can create it from the beginning.

46
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,550
OK, everything looks perfect, that's all.

47
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,200
Thank you.
