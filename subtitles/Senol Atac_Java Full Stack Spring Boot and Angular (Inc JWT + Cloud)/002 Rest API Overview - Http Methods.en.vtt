00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:08.530

Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will talk about rest controller in Supreme Court in Sydney, but we



2

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:17.170

can create rest services with rest controller, rest controller works with HDTV, Saras HDTV.



3

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.830

Soulet has two main components.



4

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:30.520

These are HTTP request and EPA response requests comes from Colline site to server side.



5

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.160

Response is given by server to the client side.



6

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.820

From client side, we can send request with different mapping types.



7

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:52.240

These mapping types are yet mapping post, mapping the lead mapping, put mapping and patch mapping



8

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.190

default mapping.



9

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.020

Tiber's gets mapping.



10

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.090

So then we try to call some API from browser.



11

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.620

This request we'll get mapping, get mapping is used for select operations.



12

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.740

For example, we can write a code like get all users, we get mapping.



13

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.540

Post mapping is used for crede operations.



14

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:28.510

For example, we can write a code like, say, the user with post mapping the leads mapping is used



15

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.190

for the lead operations.



16

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:40.570

For example, we can write a code like the neat user with the lead mapping put mapping is used for update



17

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.410

operations.



18

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.920

For example, we can write a code like update users.



19

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.400

We'd put mapping.



20

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.590

And finally, page mapping is used for partial update operations.



21

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.530

For example, we can write a code like update user name with page mapping.



22

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.670

Other think about RECURSE is to describe patterns in red comptrollers.



23

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.360

We can describe Patriot RECURSE mapping values.



24

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.280

For example, for these get all users methods.



25

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:25.090

Our API endpoint Valby localhost plus partney plus request mapping patterns.



26

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.450

Other think about recast is the sense parameters to do it.



27

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.030

First of all, we can send parameters with request body in here.



28

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.760

Payload data is used.



29

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.010

Secondly, we can send Parramatta's with Paramaribo.



30

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.710

Thirdly, we can set parameters we request thorough.



31

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.450

OK, these will be enough for us about HDTV request.



32

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.960

Now let's talk about HDTV responses in rent control or we can define every method with response.



33

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:22.980

And the Population Response Entity is a constellation that contains HDTV beheaders, HDTV studies and



34

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.450

response body with response entity.



35

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.650

We can control HDTV responses easily.



36

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.770

For example, we can return user object after a great operation like that with its response entity.



37

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.150

So in here we can control return object and response HDTV sets.



38

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.990

Of course, there are other many things in wrest control.



39

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.200

But for beginning, for our cause, this will be enough.



40

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.340

That's all.



41

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.050

Thank you.
