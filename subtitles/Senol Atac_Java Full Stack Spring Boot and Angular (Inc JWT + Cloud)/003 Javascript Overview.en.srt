00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:09,190
Hi, guys, in this listen, we will talk about basic things, about your secret, in your secret,

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,400
there is no specific type like in Zhihua.

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:21,310
If you want to go with specific types, you can use type secret in your script that are generic types.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,520
These types are much less and cost.

5
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:35,590
All of them can be used for very evil, but the differences among them are scoping.

6
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,030
And I.

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:51,940
Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use via declarations are global escort

8
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:59,140
or functional Scott, if they use it outside of function, we can reach it globally.

9
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,990
If they use it inside of function, we can reach it functionality.

10
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,430
And we can override it after this initialization.

11
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:35,640
Our second genetic type is let's let declarations are globally scoffed or blocked, Scott, actually

12
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:44,400
this is the main difference between VA and let, for example, when we write a for each blog reads what

13
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,240
then?

14
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,360
We can reach what incremental value in function.

15
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:58,490
But when we ride into it, let me reveal we could not reach the incremental value in function because

16
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,740
let can be used in this crime block only.

17
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:11,810
The other difference between two of them is we can declare the war tide, but we could not politically

18
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:12,950
let very.

19
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:24,460
Our last type is cost CONSED maintains constant values.

20
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:36,610
Consecrations shares some similarities with land declarations, cost cannot be updated or declared,

21
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,060
so if these setted one time.

22
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,660
Then we cannot change the video of it.

23
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:55,370
Other thing about Egypt is we can create constructor in JavaScript and we can reach it with creating

24
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:02,000
neat instances, but to reach it, we don't need to describe all parameters.

25
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:09,370
One by one, we should describe constructor parameters according to order of parameters.

26
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:15,980
But if we don't define parameters, JavaScript will set them to null.

27
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,450
Will you automatically?

28
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:31,910
Other thing about JavaScript is the structure in JavaScript, instead of accessing elements in an array

29
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:40,220
with their index numbers or instead of accessing elements in an object with their key video, we can

30
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,840
use the structuring in JavaScript.

31
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:50,570
For example, we can reach the first element of array with normal weight or with the structure like

32
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:50,870
that.

33
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:08,310
Or we can reach the field of an object with normal way or with the structure way like that.

34
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:22,360
Last thing about your secret is it co-operators enjoy a secret, we can compare various with double

35
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,870
equal size or triple equal sounds.

36
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:35,020
When we compare with double equals signs, we can just compare the in all fields when we compare with

37
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,920
triple equal size.

38
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,320
We can also compare the types of fields.

39
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:54,050
Of course, there are other many things in your script, but for beginning for our course, this will

40
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,500
be enough.

41
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,680
That's all.

42
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,450
Thank you.
