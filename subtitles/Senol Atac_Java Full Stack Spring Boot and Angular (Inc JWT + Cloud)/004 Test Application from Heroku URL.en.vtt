Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will test our whole application step by step and we will complete our



2

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.380

course.



3

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.520

First of all, we can sign up to the application from the register page here.



4

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.330

We have three different inputs and these all fields are required.



5

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.980

We can fill our inputs with some content.



6

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.940

Then we can create the user.



7

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.520

Now I can sign into the application with this user.



8

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.660

When I sign into the application, I can see my purchase items in the profile page.



9

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.560

I can also buy new books from the home page.



10

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.730

When I click the buy button on the home page, purchase will be achieved.



11

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.190

Now let's look at and let's see the admin operations.



12

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.200

Then we sign up.



13

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.200

Our role will be user by default.



14

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.440

Of course we have different roles like admin.



15

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.370

Admin role is a specific role and it is handled by only internal APIs.



16

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.290

So to change the role of the user, we should specify it.



17

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.640

The API.



18

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.560

Just why did we do it like that?



19

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.330

Because of security.



20

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:33.780

Actually, we created admin role on the backend test so we can use those users easily on the frontend



21

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.920

then me log in with those users to the application.



22

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.440

We will see the admin dashboard and from the admin dashboard we can create products, we can edit products



23

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.260

and we can delete products and test them one by one.



24

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.080

OK, everything looks perfect.



25

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.400

That's all.



26

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.060

Thank you.
