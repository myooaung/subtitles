Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will deploy our guitar project to the Crocombe on HINAKO.

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,480
We can create three deployments.

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,250
We are heat up easily.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,220
Our HILCO process will go on like that.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,040
First of all, we will create a template.

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,960
Then we will set an environment.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,750
Variables, if you remember it, we describe them on the environment.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,140
That's fine.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,120
Then we will assign our guitar project to Heroku and we will deploy it.

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,350
Finally, we will reach our application with the Euro.

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,440
Now let's implement it.

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,280
First of all, from the dashboard, we will collect the new app.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:59,530
He expects a unique app name, our app name will be Shah Bookseller's UI application is important for

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:06,040
performance, so you should consider it according to your customer locations and your other services

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,590
locations.

16
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,760
For now, we can go on with the United States.

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,640
OK, now we can create our application.

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,580
Now our app template is ready.

19
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,690
Then we will set the placeholders for our environment.

20
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,550
That's for production.

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,740
Actually, we have only a single placeholder and that is basically where these videos should be the

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,350
order of the server.

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:40,540
We can find it from Hiroku applications because we also created our project in the previous lessons.

24
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:14,040
Now, our app is ready, now we will import our code from it up to do it.

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,310
We will integrate our GitHub account.

26
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:23,030
We can access to the GitHub account easily, and then we will search our repository via name.

27
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,530
Then we will choose it.

28
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,430
OK, our deployment is ready now.

29
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,930
Now we can deploy it from the master branch, of course, here if we have different brands.

30
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,490
These all brands will be listed.

31
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,990
We can see the details from the deployment part or from the right top of the page.

32
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,330
OK, this will take a couple of minutes.

33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:01,800
OK, now our deployment is ready after deployment, we can see the current processes from the resources

34
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,220
tap.

35
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,470
If we don't find them, we can refresh their social stuff, then we can see them.

36
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,340
To reach our application, we can't find the application varied from those settings to.

37
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:37,170
OK, now our application is ready, we can test it with different scenarios, but let's test it on the

38
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,770
next lesson, OK, that's all for this lesson.

39
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,400
Thank you.
