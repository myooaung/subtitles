00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.500

Hi, guys, in this listen, we will talk about Hiroku, actually, we will talk about what we can do



2

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:22.340

on, you know, Kodesh board when we sign into Hiroku, we will see our empty spot in here.



3

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.280

We can see the short summary about EPS.



4

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.130

Then we can see the details of EBR with clicking to.



5

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.350

An overview page, we can see the summary of our EP.



6

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:49.290

These are Eldon's resource formations, collaborator's and latest activities.



7

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.520

We can see the details of them on other tips on resources tap.



8

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.520

We can see that our profile Betis then we can change the dyno type.



9

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.340

For now we use three Dynel, but we can change it easily.



10

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:23.280

There are four basic public dyna types on here on these are three Hoby Standard and Pearlman's.



11

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:32.840

We can find the details of them from the Hiroku documentation page easily and detailing Fedi.



12

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.570

Dynel works in Slipknot, so if we don't use it it will be shut down.



13

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:51.690

Hobbie Diner includes all three features, but it never sleeps and performance metrics are available.



14

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:02.850

Standard Dynel includes all Hobbie features Stanadyne or provides a roll back option up to the seven



15

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:12.690

days actually roll back option is also available on Free and Hoby Diner, but day option is less.



16

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:24.780

Standard Diner has horizontal scalability so we can run up to a hundred machines in parallel performance.



17

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.260

Diner is dedicated machine, so there is a specific resource for your app.



18

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.430

It is not sharing resource and it has all the scaling features.



19

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:47.520

There are also private diner types on Hiroku actually that are related with your needs so we don't give



20

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.260

details about them.



21

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.170

On Hiroku, we can use add ons also, for example, to analyze LOKKE details.



22

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:08.550

We can add log entries, by the way, to add and add on, we should enter our credit card details on



23

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.000

Hiroku.



24

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.720

There are lots of Heddon on Hiroku.



25

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.740

You can find it from Hiroku documentation.



26

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.250

Then we can examine the deployed app on deployed app.



27

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.820

We can create pipeline with pipeline, we can create Raviv apps.



28

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:40.360

When I say review app, for example, we can assume that we use GitHub deployment and we want to test



29

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:49.350

that branch before production so we can handle it via Lilibeth or we develop the pipeline.



30

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.940

We can carry the stage app before production deploy.



31

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.150

First of all, we can validate deployment on stage app on Hiroku.



32

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.790

We can use different deployment types.



33

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.370

We can use Hiroku, get option or integration in here.



34

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.420

We will use GitHub as deployment type.



35

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.440

Then we can set the deployment branch and auto deployment settings.



36

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:34.130

Then we can examine the metrics, step on metrics that we can see the details of performance metrics.



37

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:45.220

Credit card information is necessary to see here, and it is not available on free time, then we can



38

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:54.700

examine activity, tap on activity that we can see that all previous activities and in here, the nice



39

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:03.400

feature of Eurocup on Hiroku, we can roll back to our previous version from excess tab.



40

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:13.750

We can update the corroborators, then we can examine settings, step on settings that we can change



41

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.830

the app name.



42

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.510

We can delete the app, we can close the app with maintaining smolt.



43

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.290

We can transfer to app to other Hiroku account.



44

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.300

Or we can update the says advocate for our Heroku and Point.



45

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.630

Or we can create environment variables.



46

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.770

OK, that's all about Hiroku Dashboard.



47

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.790

Thank you.
