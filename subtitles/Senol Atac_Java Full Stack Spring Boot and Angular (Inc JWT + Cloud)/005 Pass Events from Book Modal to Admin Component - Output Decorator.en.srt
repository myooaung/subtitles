Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will notify the admin component after book creation, so we need the

2
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:23,440
same data or events from child to parent or parent component is admin component and our child component

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,090
is book component.

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,490
Angler provides it with the output decorator's output decorator.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:39,490
Mark's property in each component is a doorway through which data control from the child to the parent

6
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:46,330
output decorator events manually from child to parent thanks to event Amatus.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:54,130
Actually the important thing is here event amateurishly so let's check the event amateurishly and event

8
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:00,120
Å¡emeta is an object that listens for something to happen and then publish an event when triggered.

9
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,030
This is the other form of observers.

10
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:10,840
For example, when we create an event ammeter on our child component like notify, in this case our

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:19,000
child component's has become a publisher and our child component will send the data up to its parent.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:27,970
Using the Emmet's matters, the parent component will subscribe to this notify event at the end of it.

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,180
Then we send the data from child to parent.

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,090
Parents will catch it with these subscription.

15
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,230
OK, let's see an example of it.

16
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,380
In our case, I'll open the book component.

17
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:49,280
After the book Creation Successfully, I sent an event to parents with event imitation.

18
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:59,400
First of all, I carry the same events with the output decorators output, is it the creative function?

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,440
Marking the property is a way for data to go from the child to the parent.

20
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,270
And output has a type of event amosite, which means it's an event.

21
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:17,970
Now, I sent the data in the same book function with Emet methods and the data will be the response

22
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,440
of Save book.

23
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,950
Now, we'll catch this event from the parents.

24
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,640
So our parent is Edman component.

25
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:42,780
I'll catch this event from that coming from child component in the Stearman.

26
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:52,530
First of all, I need to add an event watcher in the parent compound event named Shilpi, same did the

27
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,360
child event.

28
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,100
So our event name is saved.

29
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,570
Then I'll catch this event in the parents and send it to a parent function.

30
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,480
For example, we can create a method like Save Book Watch.

31
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,000
And to get the parameters that come from the child component, we can use events parameter.

32
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:21,270
OK, now I should describe this function on the admin compartment, my function name will be saved,

33
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:29,940
Khwaja and as parameter, I'll expect the book item from the child component because I am the response

34
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,450
of Sambrook method from the child component, and it is the book object in this method.

35
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,480
I let the book object to Booklist.

36
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,240
OK, now we shared the data from child to parent.

37
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,020
Let's check it on the browser.

38
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:11,100
When I clicked the concrete book button, I see the book model, then I'll type something on the title

39
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:18,750
Alter Price and Description Fields and I'll carry the dummy data at the end of it.

40
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,940
When I click the save button, I'll see the book item in the table immediately.

41
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:33,570
OK, everything looks good and the next lesson we will implement, edit and delete actions, that's

42
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:33,900
all.

43
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,590
Thank you.
