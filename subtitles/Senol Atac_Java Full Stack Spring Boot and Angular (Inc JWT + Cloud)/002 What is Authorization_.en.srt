Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will talk about authorization, architecture in spring, security authorization

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:16,810
is the process which makes sure that the authenticated user has the necessary approvals and access rights

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,240
to access our secured resource.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:29,570
To implement it, cybering security uses, interceptors, interceptors, work with configured UARS,

5
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:36,330
these Urias, these Eurorail configuration can be in different types.

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,750
First one is we can define them as perimeter permit.

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,010
All means these yards can be reached by everybody without authentication.

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,450
Secondly, we can define them as deny or deny all means.

9
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,440
These Urus cannot be reached by anybody.

10
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,180
Third one is we can define them according to their rule or multiple rules.

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:15,170
So in that case, these bets can be reached by just users that have provided Roeg are the ones we can

12
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,340
define them as authenticators.

13
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,930
So in that case, these bets can be reached by authenticated.

14
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:30,320
So not anonymous users are the ones we can define them as fully authenticated.

15
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,080
So in that case, these bets can be reached by authenticated.

16
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,600
So not anonymous or not.

17
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:52,130
Remember me user after Eurail definition skippering security maps to us as pets and permission, then

18
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:59,030
ciprian security users access the seasoned managers to check these config attributes.

19
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,730
How access rights or not?

20
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:10,790
The Access Decision manager is called by the Abstract Security Interceptor, and it is responsible for

21
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:16,820
making final access control decisions to decide end access.

22
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,320
Decision managers can use access decision waters.

23
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:29,630
These borders are all water that checks it according to roll permission.

24
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:39,290
The other one is authenticated water that checks it according to fully automatic users, alternate Ketut

25
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,340
or remember me authenticated, etc..

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,450
The other one is G.S. and Water.

27
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:53,870
That checks it according to deny all or permit all, etc..

28
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:03,410
All waters can give Warth as access granted, access denied or access steam.

29
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:17,230
So there is no information about what they can decide as access abstain as a result of voters access

30
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,600
decision manager makes a decision to do it.

31
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,240
Access decision manager can use three different strategies.

32
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,900
First one is default.

33
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:39,940
One affirmative base in affirmative based access decision manager if at least one or to what Grant is

34
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,250
access to the secured resource.

35
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:54,100
Second one is consensus basis in consensus based if a consensus of voters votes.

36
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:03,250
So granted, what are more then denied grant is access to the secured resource.

37
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:12,340
The last one is anonymous, based in anonymised based access decision measures if all the configured

38
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:19,810
waters, wards and granted access is granted to the secure resource.

39
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,540
OK, that's all about authorization, thank you.
