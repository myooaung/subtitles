Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will talk about spring, but starting matters, we can run spring,



2

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.030

put applications in many ways.



3

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.800

First of all, we can run it from the mean glass.



4

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.180

This is so basic, we can click the wrong button on the main glass and it starts automatically.



5

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:36.360

Of course, here, if we have some custom environmental variables, we should describe them from arguments



6

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.560

as Parramatta's.



7

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.020

Secondly, we can create configuration and we can run this configuration.



8

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:54.650

This is my favorite actually in this option, we can describe environmental variables easily because



9

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.010

intelligence or other frameworks provide a special UI for it.



10

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:12.410

For example, if we want to change the server part, we can set it as the server part equals or NIPOST.



11

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:24.000

Also, we can set a spring profile in configuration in Sprint, we can work with different profiles



12

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:35.100

like development testing or production, for example, we have default and production profiles and we



13

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:45.450

have created different application properties for them and we set to customize the application according



14

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.680

to our profile from the main class.



15

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:59.920

So now if they set the profile from configuration, the application will work according to our custom



16

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.480

profile.



17

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.670

Let's set it as default.



18

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.310

Then let's run it.



19

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:19.340

We can run it from the top, but here simply it will be built, then will be served from the custom



20

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.620

part with the custom profile.



21

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:33.100

Thirdly, we can run the Sprink application with Gradle comment, the Reddell has a specific task for



22

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.760

it to run it.



23

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.990

We can use Gradle Run Boot and we can set our custom environment variables like server, port, etc.



24

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.710

Then we can hit it and run it.



25

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.060

This will also start our education easily.



26

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.900

We can prefer this option on the glass because we have only court and no intelligence or other frameworks,



27

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.070

so we can easily run it from the command line.



28

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.660

That's all.



29

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.260

Thank you.
