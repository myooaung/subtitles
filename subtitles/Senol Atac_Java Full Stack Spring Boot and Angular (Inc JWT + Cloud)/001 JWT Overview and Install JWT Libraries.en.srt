Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will install JWT and configure it, first of all, let's talk about

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,760
a little bit of JWT, JWT.

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:25,140
So, Jason, the token is used for authorization, not authentication.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,100
JWT starts after authentication.

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:37,860
When I say authentication, you have a username and password and you are logging in with these credentials.

6
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:44,730
But authorization is actually making sure that the user that sent the request to your server is the

7
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,230
same user that actually logged in during the authentication process.

8
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:59,310
We use JWT instead of, say, ID in default sipping security user session ID for authorization.

9
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:07,490
After login authentication, the client uses a some that token to reach and to access the servers.

10
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,210
Then the server identifies and validates it with a token menu, then operations on like that.

11
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,730
Now we will start to implement it to implement it.

12
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,410
First of all, we will add the dependency of JWT to build cradle.

13
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:33,300
We can find dependencies from the Melbourne one repository prior to the J.

14
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,000
W.T. version tab.

15
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,770
Both the API and the implementation were packaged as a single Artec, but version nine will be enough

16
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,630
for us so we can go on with it.

17
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,560
And we refreshed, ready to receive dependencies.

18
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:18,470
OK, now our JWT dependencies are ready, now we will configure JWT properties first property of it,

19
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,500
Beilby, Jason, their token Segretti.

20
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,510
This property is arbitrary field.

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,060
This will be used token encryption.

22
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:40,910
We can describe it like app JWT, that sekret, and for now we can give a random things for it.

23
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:53,360
Our other property will be expiration time, this time means expiration time of the JWT token, our

24
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,420
token will be valid for Monday.

25
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,940
After that, we should refresh it.

26
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,410
Of course, here we can give the value as milliseconds.

27
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,730
OK, that's all about Jason Tokens installation.

28
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:13,750
Thank you.
