00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:13,000
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will deploy our guitar project to Hiroku on Hiroku.

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,610
We can create three deployments.

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,740
We are yet up easily.

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,910
All Hiroku process will go on like that.

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,410
First of all, we will carry that Hiroku up template.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:36,070
Then we will create our PostgreSQL database with Hiroku Posterous, Hiroku Postgres, is it Plugin or

7
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:36,580
Eddo.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,590
So we will just assign it to the Oracle.

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,990
Then we will set environment variables.

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,220
If you remember it, we describe them on application properties.

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:56,450
Then we will assign our GitHub project to Heroku and we will deploy it.

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,030
Finally, we will reach our local resources.

13
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,840
Now let's implement it.

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,950
First of all, from this we will click to the new app.

15
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:24,730
He expects a unique Apne, our name will be Shah bookseller's if location is important for performance.

16
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:32,670
So you should consider it according to your customer locations and your other services locations.

17
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,950
For now, we can go on with the United States.

18
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,830
OK, now we can create our app.

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,040
Now our app template is ready.

20
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,300
Now we can assign our database.

21
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:53,510
Also, we will use PostgreSQL and Hiroku also provides Boskell as good as Edem.

22
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,180
We can edit for free.

23
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:12,790
After adding it, Hiroku provides database Eurail for us on settings we can also find username and password

24
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:20,860
from Hiroko PostgreSQL page, then we should set them one by one.

25
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,050
Then we will set the placeholders on our application properties for production.

26
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:06,380
Then we will set the placeholders on our application properties for production.

27
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,560
These placeholders are JWT secret key and internal APHC.

28
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:43,250
Now, our app and database are ready, now we will import our quote from GitHub to do it, we will integrate

29
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,840
our GitHub account.

30
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,280
We can give you access to the GitHub account easily.

31
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,380
Then we will search our repository via name.

32
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,840
Then we will choose it, OK?

33
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,390
Our deployment is ready now.

34
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,910
Now we can deploy it from the master branch, of course, here.

35
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,770
If we have different brands, these all brands will be.

36
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:22,210
We can see the details from the deployment part or from the right top of the page.

37
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:37,970
OK, now our deployment is ready after the deployment, we don't see the current processes from the

38
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,170
resources that if we don't see it, we can refresh the page.

39
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,470
To reach our education, we can find the application referral from the setting step.

40
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,250
OK, now our application is ready.

41
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:01,500
We can test it with different scenarios, but let's test it on the next lesson.

42
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,910
OK, that's all for this lesson.

43
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:05,910
Thank you.
