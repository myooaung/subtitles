Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will talk about sibling variable.



2

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.010

In addition, sibling provides a pet variable.



3

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:21.570

In addition, for rest API, the pet variable nutrition is used to handle template variables in the



4

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.680

request you are mapping and use them as method parameters.



5

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.380

Let's check it for an example.



6

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.140

For example, if they use variable, in addition to extract the templated part of the URAI represented



7

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.660

by the variable Idy, we can send the request like API example idy this request.



8

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.900

But in our example method with the extracted Eyedea value like one, two, three, four in spring,



9

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.200

we can also specify the variable name in default.



10

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.890

The third variable uses the same name with the parameter name, but we can customize it with the variable



11

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.160

name.



12

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:14.940

Property in matters parameters annotated with variable are required by default, but this variable can



13

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.650

be optional.



14

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.850

Also, we can set the record property of that variable to force to make it optional.



15

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.700

We will see the details of it on our project.



16

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.390

That's all for the beginning.



17

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.140

Thank you.
