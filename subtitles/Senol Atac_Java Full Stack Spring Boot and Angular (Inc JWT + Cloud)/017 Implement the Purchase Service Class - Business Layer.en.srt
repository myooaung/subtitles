00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,570
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will create the purchase history serves in this lesson, we will also

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,500
continue to implement model service control structure.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:24,240
In the previous lesson, we described our purchase history poster in this lesson, we will call it from

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,960
service.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,470
And these service class will be our business logic.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,580
Our service class will include basic krod methods about purchase history, like save purchase history,

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,590
Fynes purchase history, etc..

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,610
Let's implement it.

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,480
First of all, under the service package, we will carry their purchase history service interface.

10
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:59,710
And under the service package, we will carry their purchase history service, implementation class,

11
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:08,860
and these purchases, straight service implementation will implement purchase history service interface

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,470
to define purchase history service as a service class.

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,240
We will add service.

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,470
In addition to it, we mark beings with service in addition to indicate that it's sold the business

15
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:29,200
logic or seriously or purchases or service will key business logic operations for the purchase.

16
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,650
Sorry.

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,220
Later we will call purchase history repository for dependency injection.

18
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,410
We can use Ottowa in spring.

19
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,000
We can use auto wiring on property satyrs or constructor's.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,230
We can in here.

21
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,660
We can use constructor's also of course.

22
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,050
OK, now we can create our methods.

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,480
Our first method will be save purchase history.

24
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:09,220
To save purchase history, we can call purchases the repository that same made here.

25
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,770
First of all, let's describe the default properties of the purchase history.

26
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,560
Then we can save their purchase history.

27
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:38,980
OK, that's all about the same method, our second method will be to find purchase items of the user.

28
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:47,550
We can directly call it from purchases the repository because we describe it before in repository class.

29
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,380
OK, that's all about purchase history, service implementation.

30
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,310
Thank you.
