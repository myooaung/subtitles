00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:12,320
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will start to implement a profile page component and we're on this page,

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:20,300
we will list all books that were purchased by the user and we will show it with a table so it will look

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,370
like this.

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,660
Let's start to implement it.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,200
First of all, I'll open the profile component.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:34,700
We will display the purchased items in the table so we should create a purchase item list.

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,860
Array is a variable and type of it will be an array of purchase item.

8
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,880
Then we can inject our services on the constructor.

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:00,320
We need a single service, we will use purchased service to call the get all purchased items and then

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,080
we can implement the energy on in.

11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,840
It mattered in this method.

12
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,450
We will set the purchase item list.

13
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:16,010
I will call the purchase service method, then I will set the results to purchase item list.

14
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,330
OK, now our profile component is ready.

15
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:27,190
Now we will implement our profile of let's open the profile that HDMI.

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,830
First of all, let's clear the content.

17
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,190
Then I start to write HDMI content using the Emet plugin.

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:45,440
We generally use the container to read the whole content and I want to add some heading to the top of

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,080
the content.

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:53,960
Then I'll carry the card to present to the table because our context looks like a card.

21
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,250
So it has a title on the header and part of it will be a table.

22
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,770
So I will start with a class card inside it.

23
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:09,980
I'll create an element that has a card header class next to this card header.

24
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,520
I'll add a card by the that is another bootstrap class.

25
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:23,060
And inside this card buddy, I'll edit table and this table will have two classes that are table and

26
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,440
table striped.

27
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,440
So it will be striped format.

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,430
Then I'll hit the top and the mat plugin will complete the HDMI content for me.

29
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,070
OK, here is our markup inside the card header.

30
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,800
I'll show the table header to show it in their head.

31
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,180
There are three element inside the column.

32
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,540
Then I'll hit the tab.

33
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,250
Our title can be all purchased items.

34
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,460
OK, now our title is ready.

35
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,140
Let's check the result on the browser to see it.

36
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,880
We should sign in.

37
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,900
Let me check their profile page.

38
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,420
It looks good now we can implement the content of the table.

39
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,630
We will have a header and body in the table to do it.

40
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,680
I'll create excitement, different elements.

41
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,690
So I will start with the hat inside it.

42
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,010
I'll create a table row element inside it.

43
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,490
I'll create p h element.

44
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:45,160
And these t h should have an attribute called skop call.

45
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:54,130
I multiply with four because we will need four different cells next to the table.

46
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,350
Had I'll add a table by the element inside it.

47
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,790
I create a table row element inside it.

48
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:15,610
I'll carry the p h element and these t h schult have an attribute called Scarbro because I use it to

49
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,520
show index values next to the t h.

50
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:28,210
I'll add it to the element I multiply with three, then I'll hit the top.

51
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:38,180
OK, now let's fill the headers one by one, first one will be used for indexing.

52
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,910
Second one will be used to show the title of the book.

53
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,650
Third one will be used to show the price of the book.

54
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,720
41 will be used to show the date of the purchase.

55
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,150
Then we will use the energy for DirecTV.

56
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:05,570
It is a structural DirecTV that renders a template for each item in a collection.

57
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,680
So our collection is purchase item list.

58
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,250
We will render each purchase item in the purchase item list with the energy for DirecTV.

59
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,890
We can also get the indexed video from the list with energy for DirecTV.

60
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,920
OK, now let's fill the headers one by one.

61
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:34,660
First one will be used for indexing here to start from one we can add plus one to the index.

62
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,950
Second one will be the title of the book item.

63
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,010
Third one will be the price of the book item.

64
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:05,200
Here we can use currency pipe to transform the price of the book, so in our case, we want to price

65
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,890
with the dollar symbol.

66
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,150
To do it, we will add a pipe.

67
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,960
That pipe type will be currency and a property of currency, a field.

68
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,050
The US, the last one will be the purchase time of the item.

69
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:27,970
Here we can use that pipe to format the purchase time of the book.

70
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:35,410
That pipe provides many predefined formats or we can create custom format here.

71
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,980
We can use one of them to transform the date.

72
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,260
OK, now our e-mail page is ready.

73
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,090
Let's check the result on the browser then be look at the table.

74
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,010
We can see the books that were purchased by the U.S..

75
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,730
OK, everything looks perfect, that's all.

76
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,390
Thank you.
