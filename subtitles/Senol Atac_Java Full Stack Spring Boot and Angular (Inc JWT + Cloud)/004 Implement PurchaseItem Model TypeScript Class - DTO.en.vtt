Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will create our model class for purchase item, it will be our last



2

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.860

model class.



3

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.430

Actually, it is not a model class on the backhands.



4

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.090

We have described it as a projection class based on the client side.



5

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:31.250

We can consider it as a model class because we will get it as a HTP response so we can use it as a structured



6

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.250

model class.



7

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.330

Now I could either purchase it model class under the models folder, so it will be a TypeScript Phi.



8

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.770

Oil exported as it purchased item class.



9

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:59.120

And here I simply want to define how it should look like I do this by adding purchased item Fields First



10

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.360

Field is the title and type of it should be sitting initial value.



11

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.150

It can be blank.



12

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.810

The second one is the price and the type of it should be.



13

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.450

And no initial value can be zero.



14

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:24.550

Last field will be a purchased time and the type of it should be a date, I can initialize it as a new



15

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.940

date.



16

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.170

We don't need to describe a constructor for it because we will use it only to display the data.



17

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:40.750

So what I did here is basically create the types of class with three properties and I initialize them



18

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.280

with some initial values.



19

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.580

OK, that's all about the purchase item, model class.



20

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.440

Thank you.
