Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will create our database on PostgreSQL, we will go along with Postgres.



2

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.020

Good.



3

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:23.530

But of course if you want or if you need any other database, you can easily go along with it here.



4

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:33.310

You can ask me why we go on with PostgreSQL, because PostgreSQL is one of the best opensource relational



5

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.990

database management systems.



6

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:44.630

Also, at the end of this course, we will deploy this project to Heroku and Hiroku provides PostgreSQL



7

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.430

for 50.



8

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.030

PostgreSQL is another relational database management system.



9

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.750

Query language is Eskil, so it is similar to Miescher.



10

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.670

Actually, it will have the same implementation on the spring.



11

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:13.450

But like with my education or other relational database management systems except configuration, we



12

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.170

will see the configuration in the next lesson anyway.



13

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.070

Let's create our database on PJI admin.



14

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.480

By the way, PJI admin is a management console for PostgreSQL.



15

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:36.550

Here we can manage databases users, we can create queries, we can execute queries, etc.



16

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.870

First of all, we will create a login role on PostgreSQL server.



17

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:52.810

First of all, Flight Kalitta Logan, good applause, then I'll click create login group roll option



18

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.790

in here.



19

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.210

We should describe the user name for the role.



20

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.130

Our user name can be admin.



21

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:11.130

I'll go to the next tab and I'll specify the password for the role we can specify.



22

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.490

It's like one, two, three, four.



23

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.290

It can be easy password to remember it.



24

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.370

Admin user will have all privileges, especially it's very user.



25

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:35.600

Of course, we can restrict it according to our needs, but for now it is not necessary, then I'll



26

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.560

say it.



27

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.030

OK, now our user role is red.



28

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:52.750

Now we can create our database from database a section, I'll create a database right click then create



29

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.720

database.



30

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.890

Then from the database model.



31

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:10.550

We can specify the database name, our database name can be DBI book, then we can specify the role



32

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.230

for these database, we can choose it as admin.



33

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.400

Then I'll say it.



34

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:29.110

OK, our database is also ready in particular, good, there is another level, this is the schema.



35

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:40.230

Normally, if you are using my kit, you will encounter databases and these databases contain tables



36

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.690

and you can create connections between these databases.



37

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.040

But if you are using PostgreSQL, you will encounter databases.



38

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:01.940

And these databases are accused from stimulus and stimulus counting tables.



39

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:10.980

You can create connections between scammers, but you cannot create connections between databases.



40

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:20.840

In PostgreSQL, we can use the default schema as public or we can create a new schema.



41

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.010

Let's create that new schema.



42

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:32.850

Right, click the schemas, then create schema asking my name can be Sikkema book.



43

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.550

Then we can choose the role for it.



44

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.140

OK, and we can save it, OK?



45

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:49.700

Our schema is also ready now, our database template is ready in the next.



46

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.180

Listen, we will configure it from the Supreme Court side.



47

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.270

Then we can use it, that's all.



48

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.010

Thank you.
