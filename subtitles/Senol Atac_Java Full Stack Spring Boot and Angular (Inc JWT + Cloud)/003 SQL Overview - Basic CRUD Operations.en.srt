Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will talk about basic escort queries, Asgeir is structured clear language

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,980
for relational database with using Eskil.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,360
We can do every database operations to use Asgeir.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,380
First of all, we need a database to create a database with Eskild.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,910
We can use Chiri database if not exists.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,220
Database name.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:37,260
This query means if the database is not created before, the database will be created as the name.

8
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:50,090
Relational databases are constructed from tables to create table with Esguerra, we can use kiddie table,

9
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,410
table name and columns with data types.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:06,130
In relational database tables, primary is used for unique identifier for table Ross.

11
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:21,120
We can also delete tables, which is get to do it, we can use the round table table name.

12
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:35,050
After table is created, we can insert any rules to table with insert query in Ezekial, insert query

13
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:42,220
works like that, insert into table name columns and various.

14
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:53,440
Like insertion, we can also delete laws in here to do it.

15
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,600
We can use the lead from table name and work on.

16
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:15,960
Or to delete all rules of table we can use to navigate table plus table NE.

17
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:31,010
After insertion, we can write silly queries in asking to do it, we can use SELEK plus columnists or

18
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,110
staff from table name and work on this.

19
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,390
Of course, there are other many things in Eskild, but for beginning this will be enough.

20
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,590
That's all.

21
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,360
Thank you.
