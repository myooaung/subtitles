1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:14,080
Hi, guys, in this lesson, I'll complete the book's model for I'll open the book HDMI, first of all,

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:21,670
for the fourth element, I can export DirecTV into a local template variable using engy form as the

3
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,970
key.

4
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,280
For example, here I can export it with the F key.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,280
Now I can access the form controls and form validations with using these F key.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,820
Then I submit this form with the energy submit property before we submit it, we can validate the form

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,370
after validation.

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,450
We can call the save book method from that component.

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:56,070
By the way, the submit button at the bottom of the form does nothing on its own, but it does trigger

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,000
a form submit event because of its type.

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,510
So we should describe the submit method on the form element.

12
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,200
Secondly, in the model body, I need an editor blog to display error message.

13
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,210
You know that they describe the error message variable on the component.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,820
We can use it to display errors if there is error on the server connection.

15
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:28,110
To show it, we will use a division element, this element will have two classes.

16
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:37,310
One is alert and the other is alert danger, which puts the message in a red box and evenly split only

17
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,050
if there is an error message so we can handle it with the end.

18
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,160
If, Detective.

19
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:55,290
Finally, we will display the error message, by the way, to display content in England, we use double

20
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:55,740
Brace's.

21
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:09,950
Then I create the form items I have for different for items, these are title price after and description.

22
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,920
We already know how we can create form items.

23
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,250
We saw it on the register and in indeed.

24
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,860
Now we will create them with the same.

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,880
First of all, I create a form item for the title, so I will start with a class form group.

26
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,900
Inside it I create a label and this label should have an attribute called for title.

27
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,590
Next to this label, I'll add an input with an idea, a tribute set the title.

28
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:01,550
And these inputs should also have a class called Form Control next to this input.

29
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,490
I'll add the validation error division to show this validation block.

30
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:13,060
I should also have a class called Alert Danger, which puts the content in a red box.

31
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,710
Then I'll hit the top and the Emmott's plugin will complete the HDMI content for me.

32
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,920
OK, it is Armonica.

33
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,740
I have created this form group element for title, so the label name should be title.

34
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:36,340
And I want to describe it as required, so input should have the required attribute if the input is

35
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,900
not valid, I show an error message like title is required.

36
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,560
Now we will buy the input fields with the form control.

37
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,740
Like I said before, we will use template driven approach.

38
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,650
We apply a directive to our input field and Engler will create a control object associated with that

39
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,250
input field under the foot.

40
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,990
This directive is engy model.

41
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:17,040
We use it for Toovey data binding so we can read the value from the object or we can edit it.

42
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,610
Our first input is the title input.

43
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,760
I'm going to apply the Engie Model Directive.

44
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,250
We can use it like Engy Model Directive and bombed a property or a field in our component.

45
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,450
We will binded the title field of the book object.

46
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,660
They already describe it on the component.

47
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:46,020
If we use the engine model directer, we should set the name, attribute or input field.

48
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,630
So I should set the name attribute.

49
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,520
I'm going to use the same venue with Idy final.

50
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,170
Think about this input.

51
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,460
I should give reference to these engine model directive because I want to validate this input field

52
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:09,300
and I can handle it with this reference for that, we are going to create a template variable.

53
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,860
So the hash tag, let's call it template variable is title and is the video.

54
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm going to use Engie Model.

55
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,460
So when Engler's sees this, it is going to set these templates.

56
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,960
We're able to the engine model directive that is applied on this input field.

57
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,650
OK, now we can use this variable on the editing block to validate this input field.

58
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,520
We don't want to display error and block at all times.

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,720
We want to display this only if the input field is not valid and form is submitted.

60
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,470
So we use the NGF directive, which is used for condition check on English.

61
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,160
OK, our first form item is ready now.

62
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,910
I'll create the order filled with the same so I can copy and paste the title field, then I can edit

63
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,090
it.

64
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,970
First of all, I'd apply the engine model directive on the after input.

65
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:17,220
Then I'll add a reference for engine model and I'll change the error message.

66
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:37,140
Now I'll create the price filled with the same way so I can copy and paste the title field, then I

67
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,860
can edit it.

68
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:52,870
I'll apply the NJ model detective on the price input, then I'll add a reference for Engie Model, Crisfield

69
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,740
will be the number, so I should change the type of input

70
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,360
and I'll change the error message.

71
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,590
Error message also should include the value of the price.

72
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,670
So it should be a price is required and should be greater than zero.

73
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,690
Now, I'll create the description filled with the same me so I can copy and paste the title field,

74
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,100
then I can edit it.

75
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,700
I'll change the label and label idea of it, by the way.

76
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,660
It will be a tax area because it can be taxed.

77
00:07:52,390 --> 00:08:01,900
Then I'll change the energy model assignment and I finally I'll change the error message as description

78
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,010
is required.

79
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,160
OK, now our form is ready.

80
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,850
Finally, I'll check the saved book function in the book component.

81
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:41,110
I remember that I should add something that in the save book function, if the save operation is successfully

82
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,970
completed, I close the book model.

83
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,390
I can do it with elements that model.

84
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,880
It will get height as a parameter.

85
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,380
OK, now let's check the book component from the browser.

86
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,120
When I click the book button, I should see the book model.

87
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,340
Book model should include book form.

88
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,300
We have a problem with Save Button.

89
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,600
Most probably.

90
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,840
We forgot a CSI style about it.

91
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,230
Let's fix it from the book HDMI.

92
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:30,070
OK, we should at the BTM class to show it properly, then we can check it again from the browser.

93
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:41,350
OK, now it looks nice, then I can test it with example later, I can type something for title after

94
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,300
price and description feels.

95
00:09:52,790 --> 00:10:00,890
Then when I click the same change button, the book should be created and the model should be closed.

96
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,540
OK, everything looks good except the last update after the book creation.

97
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:16,120
When I refresh the page, of course, I can see the great book, but it is not enough.

98
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,670
We will handle it in the next lesson.

99
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,890
That's all for this lesson.

100
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,810
Thank you.
