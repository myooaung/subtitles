Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will complete the internal field, we have described our internal filter,

2
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,840
but we should also consider two more things for it.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,450
First one is ordering and the second one is filtering.

4
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,550
That's when I say ordering sweeping security has a filter in.

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:38,760
So we should include our internal filter in this filter chain and we should specify the order for it.

6
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,570
Let's think about it.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,570
We have a username password authentication filter that comes from spring security default filters.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,860
Also, we have described JWT authorization filter.

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,430
Now we have an internal filters here.

10
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,840
Our filters should be handled before our username and password authentication filter because skippering

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,510
security expects username and password or authentication on this filter.

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,970
If they use the username and password authentication filter before our filter, our filter won't trigger.

13
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:30,870
So we should maintain our ordering in this order and our internal filter should be handled before JWT

14
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,910
authorization filter because we don't have a JWT token.

15
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:46,170
So our security filter or the link will be firstly internal filter, then JWT authorization filters

16
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,470
and finally username and password authentication filter.

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,100
Let us implement it.

18
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,720
HDTV security already has a method for filter ordering and filter addition.

19
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,700
We can directly use the filter be formatted here.

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:13,920
We will add internal filters before JWT filters than username and password authentication filters.

21
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,480
Okay, now filter change ordering is done.

22
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,640
Now we should specify the filter pads for filters.

23
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,430
We have two custom filters.

24
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,380
They are JWT authorization filters and internal filters.

25
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:39,360
If in this case we send the request to our application, these boards filters will catch the request

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,540
and they will try to authenticate the request.

27
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,450
But this is not the right way.

28
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:55,290
The right way is internal filter should work for only internal API parts and JWT authorization filter

29
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,890
should work for other parts to do it.

30
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,970
We will specify the filtering parts of filters.

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,710
Let's implement it.

32
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,370
First of all, our internal API parts.

33
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,340
We'll start with API internal.

34
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,830
We can describe it from now.

35
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:23,730
Then we will specify it on HTP security and these PETS' can only be accessible by sys managers.

36
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,110
No, we will specify this part from fielders

37
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,120
once per request, filter provides a method like should not filter method.

38
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:48,540
With this method, we can restrict filter pads on our filter classes for our internal filter.

39
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:57,730
We will only work with internal API pads, so it shouldn't filter if the request pads start with API

40
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,240
internal.

41
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:25,210
For our gwg authorisation filter, we will work with except internal API parts, so it should not filter

42
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,690
if the request pads start with API internal.

43
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,650
OK, that's all about filters.

44
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,690
Thank you.
