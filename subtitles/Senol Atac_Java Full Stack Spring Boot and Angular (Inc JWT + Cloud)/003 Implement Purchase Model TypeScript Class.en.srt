Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will create our model class for purchase history.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,690
Actually, the purchase historic class will be a basic class that has the user I.D., boogity and create

3
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,760
time fields.

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,490
Actually, it will be similar to the back and mother class.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,590
Now I'll carry the purchase model class under the models folder, so it will be a typescript file.

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,890
I'll export it as a purchase class.

7
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:46,020
And here I simply want to define how it should look like I did this by adding purchase field's first

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,250
field is idy and type of it should be.

9
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,110
No, it can be undefined also if it is not described.

10
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,920
The second one is the user ID and the type of it should be a no.

11
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,270
It can be undefined also if it is not described.

12
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,460
The third one is the book idea and the type of it should be a number.

13
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,920
It can be undefined also.

14
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,750
It is not described.

15
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:25,600
The other one is the price and the type of it should be a no, it can be undefined also, if it is not

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,650
described last, feel it will be purchased time.

17
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,790
And the type of it should be date.

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,280
I can initialize it as a new date.

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:51,890
Then I'll add a constructive where I am able to initialize them collectively here, I'll get my user

20
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,810
ID as a parameter, which is of type no.

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,820
Of course, it can be undefined also.

22
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,370
So the meaning of the question mark is that it can be undefined.

23
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,160
Secondly, I can get the book idea as a parameter, which is of type no.

24
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:17,270
Its initial willy will be undefined and last parameter is price, which is of type no, its initial

25
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:24,170
where you will be undefined and here in the constructor by the assembly hall.

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,930
My properties are the parameters.

27
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,310
So what I did hear is basically create a type of class with five properties and a constructor where

28
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,780
I initialize some of these properties.

29
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,940
OK, that's all about the purchase model class.

30
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,780
Thank you.
