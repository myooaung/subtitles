Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will implement HD Melkert of the Register page, we will use bootstrap

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,790
frameworks type classes and we will create a register for these registered fonville, have three input

3
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:27,530
fields for username, password and full name, and we will have a submit button with click on the submit

4
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:27,950
button.

5
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,480
The registered function will be called and the user registration operation will be completed.

6
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,210
Let's implement it.

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:43,610
I'll open the HDMI form, then I'll start to write HDMI content using the Emett plugin.

8
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,710
First of all, let's clear the content and create the content.

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:56,690
We generally use the container to wrap the whole content and I want to add some margin to the top of

10
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,420
the content.

11
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,960
By the way, we don't need to know all bootstrap functions or the meaning of that.

12
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:10,660
We can easily understand them from the name of them, for example, and T means margin top.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:20,360
Then I'll carry the cart to present the form because our form looks like a cart and this cart will be

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,360
in the center of the page so we can set it with margin horizontal auto.

15
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:35,570
I can handle it with setting of margins start and margin and then I can add some padding for it, then

16
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,640
I can add some shadow for it.

17
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,340
Now let's check it.

18
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,700
Let's reload the register page and check it.

19
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:56,220
OK, it looks big now, let's make it a little bit smaller, we can create custom siestas glasses on

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:05,370
Craster component that cyesis, for example, we need a smaller register box so we can specify it with

21
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:13,050
the Veith property, like we can set it like three hundred and fifty pixels.

22
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:24,390
Then we can set the max rate for responsive style because for small screens, 350 pixels might be big.

23
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:32,310
So we can restrict it using Max with property, then we can set the background of the register box like

24
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,740
we can set it as light gray.

25
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,890
OK, now we can call our siss function from FEMA.

26
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,940
Now, let's check it, let's reload the register page and check it.

27
00:02:51,750 --> 00:03:00,930
OK, it looks nice now then we will have a user icon to describe it, we will use the font awesome eye

28
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:09,590
contact font awesome provides the FAA eye contact to describe icons in angular HDMI form.

29
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,210
Then we can describe the icon with icon DirecTV in this tech.

30
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,480
For example, here we describe the user icon so we can use it like this.

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,100
After describing it, we need some style on it.

32
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:34,410
For example, we need to centralize it so we use margin orta for the left and right side.

33
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:45,090
Then we need to shrink it with with font size and we need to colorize it so we can do them with a custom

34
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,060
style function.

35
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,950
Let's create a custom style on register.com component that suggests, for example, we can create it

36
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,720
as user icon.

37
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:03,870
Then the font size of it can be a hundred pixels and the color of it might be a little green.

38
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,260
Then we can customize the color a little bit.

39
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,130
OK, now we can call our Cyesis function from HDMI for.

40
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,680
Now, let's check it.

41
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,040
Let's reload the registered page and check it.

42
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,670
OK, it looks nice, no.
