Hi, guys, in this lesson, we will implement edit book action, I clicked the edit button from the

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,960
book list and I'll see the book model with the selected item.

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:23,190
Then I can make some changes on the farm and I can save it here.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:31,810
We can do it in many ways, but I want to do it by passing the selected book item to book model.

5
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,490
To do it, we need to share data from parent to child.

6
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,940
We can provide it with input decorator's in English.

7
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:47,830
The input decorator in a child component or directive signifies that the property can receive its value

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,550
from its parent component.

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,550
Now we can implement it.

10
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,700
First of all, let's open the book component.

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:04,390
Here we have a book object, if they get it from the parent, we can provide the crate and update operations

12
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,510
together because when we sent it as a new object, it will be a discrete operation.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,320
If they sent it as an existing item, it will be the update operation.

14
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,550
So we need to add only an input decorator to the book object.

15
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,790
OK, now we will sent the book object from the admin compartment.

16
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,380
Let's open the admin compartment.

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,600
First of all, I need then object to describe that book object we can initialize as a neat book object.

18
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,900
On the credit request, I said it is a new book object.

19
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:59,450
And for the edit operation, I need the need function, I can create a function like edit book request

20
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,560
in this function, I'll expect the book object as a parameter.

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,820
In this function, I set the selected book object as the select item, but I can use the Neeve copy

22
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:19,400
of that because if I changed some fields of book object and if I don't save it, the item on the book

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,870
list will be dirty.

24
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:28,760
So to prevent it I can use object assign in JavaScript, then I can show the book model.

25
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:43,890
OK, now I'll call it from the admin estimate by edit button, I'll open the administration and I'll

26
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,180
assign it to the edit button with the click event.

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,870
Then I'll pass the selected book object from the admin component to book component.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,260
And I'll assign it to the edit button with the click event.

29
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:16,090
When I make some changes on the farm and then I save it, I showed the the book item because I should

30
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,010
update the Sambrook Wotcher method also for the edit operation.

31
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,500
I open the admin contract and I'll edit the same book.

32
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,790
What's your method inside this code?

33
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,240
First of all, I checked the edited book item.

34
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,190
I can check it from the ID field.

35
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:46,480
Because the field is unique for the book, if the book item exists, then it is edited operation.

36
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:52,980
In this case, I should update the lists, otherwise it is a crude operation.

37
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,490
I should add the new item to Booklist.

38
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:16,220
OK, now we can test it on the browser when I click to the edit button, I see the book model with the

39
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:25,900
selected book item when I make some changes on the form and then I say it I the edited item properly.

40
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,160
OK, that's all.

41
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,700
Thank you.
