1
00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:02,652
With programmatic transaction management,

2
00:00:02,652 --> 00:00:05,984
the Spring Framework provides two means of programmatic

3
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:09,165
transaction management using the transaction template,

4
00:00:09,165 --> 00:00:14,547
which is similar to Spring templates, and using a platform transaction manager,

5
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:18,506
which handles transactions across Hibernate,

6
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:21,547
JDBC, JPA, JMS, etc.

7
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:25,345
Now transaction template is recommended over using a

8
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:28,700
platform transaction manager because it handles more of

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:35,000
the transaction details for you. So let's look more closely at transaction template.
