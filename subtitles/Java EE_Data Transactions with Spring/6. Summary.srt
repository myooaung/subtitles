1
00:00:00,298 --> 00:00:02,551
We learned about implementing programmatic transaction

2
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:05,946
management using the transaction template.

3
00:00:05,946 --> 00:00:09,529
We talked about the advantages of the transaction template over the platform

4
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:13,805
transaction manager for programmatic transaction management.

5
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,957
We also enhanced the TrackZilla system to implement programmatic

6
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:20,431
transaction management using the transaction template.

7
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:30,000
Now let's discuss when to use programmatic transaction management over declarative transaction management and vice versa.
