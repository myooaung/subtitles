00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.995
In this lesson I'm going to talk about Modular Scales,

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:14.310
and I'm going to talk about specifically modular scales for web, mobiles, and tablets.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.530
One of my students, her name is Sandra,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.610
and I think she's having a problem understanding how she can use

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.780
a modular scale different for a mobile and for tablet,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.370
because on tablets and mobiles,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.930
you cannot use a very big size like desktops.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.720
I am going to show you using modular scale dot com,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.245
how we can choose different scales,

00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:45.350
or maybe we can have multiple scales,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.480
so we can use them in any device; maybe smaller devices,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.110
different scale and then tablets, different scale,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.260
and for desktops we are going to use a different scale.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.940
Let's get started. Now, as you can see on this modular scale dot com,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.845
my base is set to 16 pixels and ratio is 1.5,

00:01:08.845 --> 00:01:10.390
so this is the default.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.920
Now, I recommend that don't choose to much bigger ratio because you can see over here,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.180
you have this 81 pixels,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.490
so maybe we can use it's very big size.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.069
Then we have this 54, then 36,

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.620
24, 16 is our base size.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.595
Now if we go to this small sizes,

00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:36.265
they are almost unusable,

00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:42.595
so we cannot use this 11 pixels or 10 pixel,

00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:45.205
because it is really small.

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.900
Now, how to solve this problem?

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.090
Now, if you go to this ratio,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.170
we are going to use or add another ratio over here,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.210
so what we are going to do is,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.584
we are going to use,

00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:02.385
just remove this; and we are going to use,

00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:06.540
write down these sizes over here,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.190
81, 54, 36, 24 and 16.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.700
Now, what we're going to do,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.800
is we're going to divide this five by half,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.705
so we are going to use half of it,

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:20.280
which is going to be 0.25.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.900
Now, we have separate set of sizes,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.045
which is 61 and 49,

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:32.580
39 pixels, 31 pixels, 25,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.305
20, 16, and there we have another size which is 13 pixels or 13 points.

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:42.650
This is a bit nice size,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.030
now we have a very big scale,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.740
we had four sizes from the previous scale,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.965
where we were using 1.5 ratio,

00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:55.815
so one, two three, four, five,

00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:57.525
so 16 is common,

00:02:57.525 --> 00:02:59.870
so I am going to use these three,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.305
54, 36, and 24.

00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:10.090
Then we can also use 0.25 and we can also use this, 49, 39.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.295
For example, if you are using some mobile,

00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:17.690
you want mobile size for your heading one,

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.275
so biggest heading, you can use this one.

00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:24.980
Because if you use this one or maybe 54 pixels,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.650
it will be too big, so here we go.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.585
We have a lot of different sizes options all here like that,

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:32.780
and if you want more,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.450
you can also go to 1.75 and you will have different sizes like 49, 28.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.145
You can see this is a new size,

00:03:41.145 --> 00:03:45.795
28, also, you can see this 85 or 86.

00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:53.910
These are the methods which I use to get scale with a lot of different size.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.480
If I go to this add,

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.500
now you can see I have added two screens over here,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.165
I have used this plus,

00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:07.175
so I have two different scales,

00:04:07.175 --> 00:04:09.860
1.5 with this one,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.450
and if I go to this one,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.730
I can use 1.25.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.920
Now, they are side-by-side,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.360
now you can see over here,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.890
if I go to this table,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.165
you can see we have a lot of sizes that are really usable,

00:04:23.165 --> 00:04:25.785
and you can see this 61,

00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:27.240
48, one, two, three,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.080
four, five, six, and seven;

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.045
Seven sizes over here, one,

00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:38.040
two, three, sizes over here,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.490
so seven and three,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.489
we have a lot of flexibility from 16 pixels,

00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:44.855
then we have 20,

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:48.915
24 or 25, then you can use 31,

00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:55.275
36, 54, 40 pixels and 49 pixels,

00:04:55.275 --> 00:04:57.380
then we can use 61,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.495
and then we can use 81.

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:02.010
You can see here we have another scale,

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.820
then you can also add one more,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.075
which is going to be 1.25,

00:05:07.075 --> 00:05:08.790
and you can see over here,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.040
we have few more sizes,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.459
so 1.75, now you can see we have 28,

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:18.725
which is a new size, 49.

00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:22.220
We already have 49, you can see over here.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.035
If you increment or decrease your values in this range,

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:33.510
like steps of you can say equal amounts like if we have,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.315
for example, 1.8 as a ratio.

00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:39.750
For example, this one, this is 1.8,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.645
so I'm going to shift this one to 1.6,

00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:45.400
and this one to 1.4.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.430
You can see how I'm using all this,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.745
so it is 22 then we have 26,

00:05:53.745 --> 00:05:56.240
then we had 29, three different sizes.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.975
32, 41 and 52.

00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:05.495
In this way you can have multiple modular scales,

00:06:05.495 --> 00:06:11.940
a wide range of different sizes and you can use them any way you like,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.670
you can use them on mobiles.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.064
You can select for three or four sizes for mobiles,

00:06:18.064 --> 00:06:22.460
and you can select just two or three for desktop,

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:30.665
so this is how you can apply this modular scale and expand it for any application.

00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:34.430
This is all about modular scales and how you can

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.050
expand it for mobiles, tablets and smartphones.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.260
I think that's it,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:49.220
and if it still doesn't make your confusion or take your confusions away,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.445
you can ask me questions anytime.

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.665
See you soon in another lesson.

00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:56.880
Take care and goodbye.
