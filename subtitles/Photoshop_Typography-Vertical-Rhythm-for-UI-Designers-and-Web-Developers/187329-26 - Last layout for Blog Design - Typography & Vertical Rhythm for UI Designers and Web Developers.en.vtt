00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Now, in this third lesson,

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.395
we are going to create this one and also this one.

00:00:06.395 --> 00:00:09.375
These are not different from the second part,

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.480
you can see this is a bit different,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.290
this top bookmark style.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.700
Also, I have used only two blocks for this image,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.875
not the whole area over here,

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:25.710
everything else is almost the same.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.680
I changed the colors from red to blue over

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.760
here and then also we are going to create this layout.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.940
Here, we have different things over here,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.680
I will explain them,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.410
like we have this yellowish color and this purple color over here.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.510
Let's get started and create these two layouts in

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.735
this design part C. This is where we left,

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:53.935
so we are going to keep everything same.

00:00:53.935 --> 00:00:56.080
Here, we have the image,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.985
and I'm going to grab some other image,

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:00.245
may be this one.

00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:02.120
I think we had this one,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.775
drag it over here and we are going to use it over here like that.

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:12.410
Also, you can use this whole area like this for image,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.050
this is also another layout.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.535
Right now, I'm going to use this image and clip it inside that block.

00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:28.360
Now, what we are going to do is we are going to highlight our modules.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.280
Here, we have our modules and I'm going to use

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.930
and size it to this area and we're going to leave all this area over here.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:46.675
Just to make sure that we are going to size this girl so we can

00:01:46.675 --> 00:01:56.620
see her hair and few other things like her clothes, maybe like this.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.855
It is looking better now.

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:05.415
We can hide a few other things,

00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:09.330
I think this looks odd to me.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.840
Maybe I'm going to use some blue color from her shirt,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.180
this purple blue color and make it a bit more saturated like this.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:29.880
For the links, and I'm going to use the same gray.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.100
What is the color of this text?

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.755
It is 7a7d80.

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:40.820
Now, we have set of our colors over here,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.305
we can also sample colors from her shirt.

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:49.540
Maybe again, use this color,

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.660
147 likes, maybe we can use this color over here,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.020
maybe her hair color or this purple color.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.550
I think it is very dark,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.680
so maybe very sharp,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.555
so leave it like that.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.090
We're going to hide our modules.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.990
This is how I just changed this design.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.640
Maybe we need to change this one too.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.880
I can use a very dark color over here

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.300
to bring the attention on this sharp color over here,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.065
to bring attention to the title.

00:03:29.065 --> 00:03:35.765
I'm going to use my pen tool to add some anchor point over here.

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:40.220
"Press A" and shift this anchor point.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.665
What is happening?

00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:46.200
You stretch selection tool.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.455
This is strange.

00:03:51.455 --> 00:04:02.860
I think I should use A and then Pen tool to add some anchor point over here.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:12.795
Like this. Let's zoom in and click

00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:20.220
on it with this convert point tool once to make it sharp edge,

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.260
not the rounded one.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.630
This is our main shape,

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.280
so I have changed this shape and everything else.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.195
It is looking good.

00:04:31.195 --> 00:04:34.965
Maybe I need to use Lato over here.

00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:42.270
Lato Bold. Let's see how it look. It's looking good.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.205
This is how I have changed everything over here.

00:04:47.205 --> 00:04:51.490
This is another design.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.020
Let's copy and save it as design 3.1.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.505
Now, we're going to go ahead and we are going to create design 3.2.

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:08.480
Let's first save it with the other name, 3.2.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:17.705
Now, what we did over here is we are going to expand this area.

00:05:17.705 --> 00:05:20.330
Let's delete this girl over here.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.385
Expand this rectangle to the full size like that.

00:05:25.385 --> 00:05:28.250
Okay, so get some color over here,

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.265
maybe this one, any color you like.

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:34.010
It must be a bit sharper color.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.945
Where is our date?

00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:37.190
Date, here it is,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.815
bring it at the top of this layer,

00:05:39.815 --> 00:05:49.455
change the color to white and we have done almost all the work over here.

00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:51.510
Do we add anything over here?

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.330
No. So let's remove it.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.355
It is just creating more nuance.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:59.600
We want more open and empty feeling.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.745
This is our date and

00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:12.090
let's highlight our grid.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.560
Let's create another rectangle over here using

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.765
this area and move it below this 147 likes,

00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:23.180
let's change the color to this one,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.570
or maybe this one,

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.244
and change its color

00:06:29.244 --> 00:06:37.680
from this to maybe this black or maybe white.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:44.840
Let's hide this and you can see our design is almost perfect,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.060
so let's change the colors to this.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.970
Our new color, highlight color.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.420
Maybe we can use this grayish color.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.565
This looks great and if you want to use purple over here,

00:07:03.565 --> 00:07:05.605
you can use purple,

00:07:05.605 --> 00:07:10.100
blue, or purple or this purple.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.850
This is looking great,

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.520
purple and this creamish color,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.630
they are looking great.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.750
If you really want,

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.825
you can use this heading and move it over here.

00:07:22.825 --> 00:07:27.430
It will also create another layout heading over here in this area,

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.675
and dates and likes over here and maybe move the text above.

00:07:32.675 --> 00:07:38.585
There are a lot of variations you can do with these designs.

00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:42.140
We have this grid and modules setups.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:49.485
We just need to change the legal parts and balance the design.

00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:55.025
You can use them with the bold text and maybe colors.

00:07:55.025 --> 00:07:59.105
This is how we use colors and

00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:05.705
bold text and layout and modular grid to create different layouts.

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:08.745
This sums up my last exercise,

00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:12.015
I'm going to save it, it's already saved.

00:08:12.015 --> 00:08:17.750
I gave you challenge that creates some layout like this one.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.390
This is the last one.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:25.740
Use some images from this picjumbo.com,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.870
use a text from Real Ipsum,

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.440
Google Fonts, select any two Google Fonts you like.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.315
Use some modular scale,

00:08:33.315 --> 00:08:35.285
use your own scale factor,

00:08:35.285 --> 00:08:43.100
but keep it consistent in your designs and create something awesome and show it to me.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.110
You can post it in the question answers.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.755
Give me the link and I will share with you my ideas

00:08:48.755 --> 00:08:53.605
on how to improve it or how to change it or something like this.

00:08:53.605 --> 00:08:57.820
I see there is something like this a lot, so don't mind.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.120
I will be creating more exercises.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.390
But this sums up this modular design exercise.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.075
This is the last one.

00:09:07.075 --> 00:09:15.440
I think you might have got a lot of good skills on spacing out elements and how to use

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.135
this topography effectively with this baseline height and

00:09:20.135 --> 00:09:26.825
vertical harmony and how to use rows and columns and modular grids.

00:09:26.825 --> 00:09:31.320
Let's move on to the next lesson.
