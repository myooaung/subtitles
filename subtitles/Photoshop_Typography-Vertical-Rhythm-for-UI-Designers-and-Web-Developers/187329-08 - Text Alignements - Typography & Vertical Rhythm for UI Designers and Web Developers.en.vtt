00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.795
Let's discuss about text-alignment.

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:06.555
Now, a lot of designers say,

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:08.250
"Okay, I know text-alignment,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.510
what is text alignment,

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.590
I know," but there are specific uses for each of them.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.810
If you can use them properly,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.175
you can really enhance your design and readability.

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:25.875
Let's see different examples and different uses of text-alignment.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:31.040
Now, first one is the very common most left alignment and left alignment

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.035
is not used for right to left languages.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:40.610
We are talking about English and other languages that are from left, right.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.650
Now, left alignment is basically used for articles,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.625
paragraphs, books, headings, and a lot of other stuff.

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:53.920
So mostly, it is the most common used alignment.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.590
Make sure it is not for right to left languages.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.790
Right to left are basically opposite to this.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.995
For the left alignment,

00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:06.925
it will be the right alignment.

00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:13.060
Next is right align and right align text is used for normally small amount of text.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.050
If you are using it on a paragraph,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.865
then you are really ruining your user and your reader.

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:27.265
So make sure you are using right align for very small lines or very few words.

00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:32.070
Now, here we have the factor is basically right to left languages.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.495
For right to left languages,

00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:35.610
right align is the best option.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.830
Now, coming to the center align.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.270
Center align should be only used for important lines and not be applied to paragraphs.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.670
I have seen some designers using center align to four or five lines.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.770
I think it is not very wise.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.400
So maybe headings and taglines of

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.225
some product can be center aligned or maybe one more line,

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:01.700
but not above three, I guess.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.370
So here we have readability factor.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.775
Our eyes jumped from one to the next line,

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:14.030
and they are normally predicting that they should be jumped to the same spot.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.130
Now, in the center align,

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.295
they jump from one place to another,

00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:23.940
so it is not a straight line.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.710
Justified align is basically when your left and right sides are almost equal.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.385
There are no spaces at the right side.

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:37.910
So justified align is normally used in books,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.400
and magazines, and newspapers.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.285
I don't recommend them using for websites or blogs.

00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:46.625
It is difficult to control them.

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:51.110
You might need to change your text, or body text,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:03:00.255
or editing your copy text to really justify align your paragraphs.

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:03.890
Let me show you some of the examples of left and right align.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.170
You can see on the right side,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.555
I have shown you right align,

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:09.875
proper use of right align.

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:12.145
I'm showing only three lines,

00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:17.880
and you might see this right align on a lot of business cards.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.880
Now you remember why the e-mail,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.620
phone number is almost right aligned on a lot of business cards,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.530
because it is very less text

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.960
and you can see aligning it right doesn't hurt the readability.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.700
Now, on the left is a paragraph,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.150
so they should be aligned on the left.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.310
This is how we use left and right align.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.010
This is the proper use of left and right aligned texts.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.580
Here we have the example of justify align and center align.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.330
You can see on the left side, justify align,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.085
we have different spaces or rivers running inside.

00:04:02.085 --> 00:04:06.540
Some words are more spaced to the next one.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.610
Some have less space between them.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.730
So these are called basically rivers.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.100
This is when you try to justify align your text.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.375
So make sure there are not too wide rivers or very prominent rivers inside your text.

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:28.320
Now, coming to the center align.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.540
Now, center align you use it on very few lines of text or maybe poetry,

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.770
like I have used over here.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.990
I don't know how I wrote this,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.325
but this is how we should use center align,

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:48.980
very few lines, and maybe poetry or something like that.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.635
Maybe some quote of two lines.

00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:55.380
So no more than two or three lines, I guess.
