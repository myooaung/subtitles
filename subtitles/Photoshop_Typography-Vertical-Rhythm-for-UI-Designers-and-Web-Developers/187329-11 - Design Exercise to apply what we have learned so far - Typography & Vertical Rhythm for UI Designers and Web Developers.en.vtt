00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.385
Hello everyone. In this lesson,

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:06.810
we are going to design this awesome looking blog page.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.665
Now we have learned line height,

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:14.250
letter spacing, kerning, tracking, everything.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.935
So let's apply that in this design and let's get started.

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:26.100
I am going to use Google font for this exercise,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.600
which is Source Sans Pro,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.290
this is single Google font and on the right side,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.420
I'm using image from a free site may be Pixabay or something like that.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.380
You can use any image over here.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.965
I will share the links in the resources section

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:48.260
so make sure you use the links to get this font, Source Sans Pro.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.970
Let's get started and I'm going to open up a new file and the width should be

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.540
1400 by 1800 pixels, 72-pixel resolution transparent.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.520
Don't Color Manage this Document.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.260
Click "Okay" and here we have our empty canvas.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.025
I'm going to press "Alt+Delete" to fill it up.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:14.275
We are going to use white color as the background.

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:16.200
Select "White" over here, then again,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.755
press "Alt+Delete" and here we have our option Delete on your Mac.

00:01:22.755 --> 00:01:24.560
Now we have our empty canvas.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.270
Now we can start designing,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.410
but first of all,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.640
we are going to get a grid over here to lay out our things.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.820
About the grid, I'm going to explain it in

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.520
the next section so don't worry about it right now.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.580
Just do what I'm doing right now.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:50.310
Go to View and New Guide Layout and in the columns use Custom preset.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.700
In the columns, you can also use this 8 Column

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.450
and gutter width 20 or if you want more than that,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.645
you can use 30 like that and click "Okay."

00:02:06.645 --> 00:02:09.165
Now our canvas is ready.

00:02:09.165 --> 00:02:18.185
Let's get started and I am using Real Lorem Ipsum website to get the text over here,

00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:21.550
so I'm going to use Chrome to get that.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.149
Here are the two resources I am using for this exercise.

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.990
This is Real Ipsum website and I really

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.010
like how they have real text over here with the headings,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.900
everything else and we are using the Source Sans Pro Google font.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.610
If you want to open it in Google fonts,

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.105
you can click over here and go to this page and select any font over here,

00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:54.335
like bold, semi-bold, or maybe select all of them and download from this button.

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:58.805
Click over here, you can see here it says, Zip file.

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:04.705
Download the zip file and install it in your PC or Mac.

00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:07.159
These are the two resources we are using.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.120
This is the one we're going to use for the heading,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.315
copy this heading text,

00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:17.845
and we're going to paste it in our Photoshop.

00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:21.930
Let's select this one Source Sans Pro regular font, size,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.880
I'm going to select 64 points or 64 pixels and I am going to select over here,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.295
Control V. I have the text over here.

00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:39.900
Let's use this grayish black color over here.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.760
We are going to use Source Sans Pro regular,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.785
but we need a boldface over here.

00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:49.970
This is a very long line.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.200
Let's right-click on it,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.210
convert to paragraph text,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.770
and drag this one over here, like this.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.840
Now we have a problem of line-height so we are going to use this line-height or

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.570
leading 64 and I think 72 will be more than enough as it's heading.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.865
We will be using near 64 or it is 66.

00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:26.030
Let's make the bounding area of paragraph a bit bigger like that.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.460
Our heading is all set.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.290
Next, we are going to copy this Thursday,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.785
July something like this, this date.

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:39.635
If you want this nine minutes ago, you can copy it.

00:04:39.635 --> 00:04:41.900
I just don't like this one,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.940
so I'm going to use this one.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.335
Just paste it over here.

00:04:46.335 --> 00:04:56.295
Now we are going to use 18 points text and it should be regular.

00:04:56.295 --> 00:05:02.770
Right now regular and we need to change its color to some grayish color,

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.140
something like this, brownish gray.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.660
It is 808080.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.785
Because this one is not very important,

00:05:10.785 --> 00:05:13.965
we will do something like this.

00:05:13.965 --> 00:05:17.155
Then we need all this text to be copied,

00:05:17.155 --> 00:05:21.965
three paragraphs, copy and we need to paste it over here.

00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:28.390
Our text tool is already selected so we are going to drag it like that in this area like

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.920
this and Control V.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.025
Now we have an issue of line-height over here so right now we have 18.

00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:47.335
Why not use 18 multiplied by 1.5, 27.

00:05:47.335 --> 00:05:50.240
Maybe we need a bit of bigger text,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.695
so we will be using 21 multiplied by 1.5, 32.

00:05:55.695 --> 00:06:04.695
Thirty-two points in the line height and 21 points for the text size like that.

00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:07.640
It is already looking good.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.470
Select this one, top one,

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.900
we need it to be a bit bigger so we are going to use

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.270
24 points and with regard to 24 points,

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.685
we are using 1.5.

00:06:19.685 --> 00:06:23.880
Its line-height should be 36 points.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.410
This is how I'm going to calculate everything.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.265
I'm using line-height 1.5,

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:37.460
and I'm using this deck size to be 21,

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.840
this one is 24, and this one is 18,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.074
and this one is 64.

00:06:44.074 --> 00:06:47.000
Let's align them all to the left.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.320
Select all these by Control-clicking on them or Shift.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:58.855
Click the last one and the first one and then press "V" and left-align like that.

00:06:58.855 --> 00:07:05.310
They are all left-aligned and they are looking good.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:15.120
Let's make this date a bit more dull like this one, this grayish color.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.890
You can use any color,

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:27.000
maybe you can use something like this over here B6B6B6 and this is the color I got.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.095
Now our text is all set up.

00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:32.090
You can see how I'm laying out it,

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.625
I'm using 1, 2, 3, 4 columns,

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:39.815
this bounding area for this text,

00:07:39.815 --> 00:07:43.840
and we are going to use this area for the image.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.400
Let's draw the orange line over here,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.570
just select the rectangle tool and we are going

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:56.390
to drag an orange line of 15 pixel over here.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:01.580
It's white right now so we are going to double-click it and select the orange color.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:07.470
This is f7a94a.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.245
Now, this is all set.

00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:15.650
Let's make it a bit bigger from this side extended outside.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.025
Now let's hide the grid line,

00:08:19.025 --> 00:08:22.740
Control colon, and our grid is hidden.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.555
Let's select this one.

00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:30.010
It is already looking very nice and cool so let's drag the image over here.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:37.680
I am going to use the same image so I don't need to find it again and again.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.205
Here we have Window, Arrange,

00:08:41.205 --> 00:08:46.565
Tile All Vertically, and this is our original design.

00:08:46.565 --> 00:08:48.320
I'm going to use this one,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.895
drag it over here,

00:08:49.895 --> 00:08:52.860
and close this one.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.090
Now we have a very big image,

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.415
so we need to bound it in a box.

00:08:58.415 --> 00:09:00.400
Let's hide this image first.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.540
Create a rectangle over here,

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.780
enable your guides, Control colon,

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:15.170
and I am going to use this area for the image.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.360
This is my rectangle.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.390
Just move the rectangle below this image and we are going to create a mask.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:37.015
I'll click in between this image and this rectangle and here we have our mask.

00:09:37.015 --> 00:09:41.610
This rectangle is basically acting as a mask.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:52.290
We can also reduce the size of this rectangle if we want to.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:59.985
Maybe we need to move both of them to the right side.

00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:03.735
Just enter 1, 2,

00:10:03.735 --> 00:10:05.750
3 pixels, so 30 pixels.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.895
I have moved a bit more on the right.

00:10:07.895 --> 00:10:11.689
Our design is almost looking great and complete.

00:10:11.689 --> 00:10:17.880
Let's add a variety and we are going to use Italic for

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:25.840
the state and this is how we set up our design.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.700
It's really cool looking already,

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:35.615
very nice and I think not many designers can design like this.

00:10:35.615 --> 00:10:37.190
This is very simple.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.570
I have used all the techniques we have learned in the previous lessons.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:48.360
We will improve this design at the end of the next section.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.290
Stay tuned and wait for more exercises.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.930
Before then, just take care and bye.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.930
Let's move on to the next lesson.
