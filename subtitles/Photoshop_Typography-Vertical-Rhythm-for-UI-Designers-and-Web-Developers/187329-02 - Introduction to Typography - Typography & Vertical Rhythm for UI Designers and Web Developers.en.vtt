00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Whether we are designing for a mobile app

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.235
or any website or web design or even advertisement,

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:14.875
95 percent of every design is basically Type, which is text.

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:18.345
To use that text to your advantage,

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:24.060
you need to be a very good designer and you should be very good at Typography.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.240
All the good designers they possess the skill.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.940
Text is major part of any kind of media,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.550
whether these are ads, TV, websites, blogs,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.500
books, movie titles, apps, everything,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.125
there is always a lot of text you need to see or consume.

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.440
What is typography?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.720
If you can use this text,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.815
or written typed properly,

00:00:55.815 --> 00:01:00.390
it can act as a duel edged samurai sword,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.680
or maybe more than a samurai sword, for every designer.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.110
What is the purpose of typography?

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.390
Whenever you design something or you are designing an ad or app or anything,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.805
you are doing two things with your type.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:22.740
Number 1, you need to effectively arrange it for legibility and readability.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.290
If your user can't read it,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.820
there is no sense in designing such ad or mobile app.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.260
The second is, you need to communicate your mood,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.245
your message to the reader or viewer.

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:42.744
These are the two basic purpose of using typography in your designs.

00:01:42.744 --> 00:01:45.825
Now, typography for Web and Mobile Apps,

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:51.260
we will be covering a lot of things in this course.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.705
So just some basics that people only scan websites and blogs.

00:01:56.705 --> 00:02:00.805
They don't really read it unless it is very important.

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:06.770
The second thing is we will be answering a lot of question regarding website topography,

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.815
like what font we are going to use,

00:02:10.815 --> 00:02:15.955
whether I use this font for business website or blog or a web app.

00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:25.460
For mobile apps, we will be covering how to use typography on small screens because it is

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:34.475
very tricky to use typography on small screens and there are different iOS and Android,

00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:40.945
different specifications of fonts and sizes which Apple and Android have specified.

00:02:40.945 --> 00:02:42.920
Whenever you design something,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.475
you should ask questions to yourself,

00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:49.250
which font will load faster,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.130
or should I use five fonts or three fonts or 10 fonts for my website?

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.530
Sometimes we designers do something like this;

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.055
"Proxima Nova is in trend these days.

00:03:02.055 --> 00:03:04.615
Guys, I should use it everywhere."

00:03:04.615 --> 00:03:07.940
So whatever app or website your design,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.955
you just put your Proxima Nova font in there.

00:03:12.955 --> 00:03:15.125
That's very strange.

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:19.370
Each website have their own specifications,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.080
business type and everything,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.670
so this is not wise.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.135
We will be covering a lot in this course, don't worry.

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:32.065
Let's see what we have next.

00:03:32.065 --> 00:03:35.060
Now, if you are a novice designer or developer,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.870
you might be thinking how to combine different forms,

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.659
which font is suitable for fun websites,

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.735
for business websites or a fashion blog.

00:03:45.735 --> 00:03:50.615
Also a lot of developers I have seen they only use

00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:56.130
Open Sans because it is the only one I can easily combine.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.405
Don't do such decisions or these design decisions.

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:08.780
These can really get you in trouble

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.860
if you keep on designing using same font for like 10 websites.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.655
I will be guiding you through a lot of examples,

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:24.560
even with Bootstrap to show you how we can

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.170
use different typographic techniques for even developers and designers alike.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:40.030
So let's get started in the course and move on to the next lesson.
