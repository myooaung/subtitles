00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
Now, what are the roles of different typefaces?

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.030
Actually, inside of one single family,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.700
you might have seen some fonts with names like display,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.810
caption, subhead, regular, italic, something like that.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.790
Actually, this display, caption,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.605
and subhead are basically the roles of that font or typeface.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:28.020
What basically display type is,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.000
display type is made only for headings or very big text.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.990
Text type is for regular body text paragraphs or

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.430
a lot of text where you need to read it a lot.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.865
Now, there are also few other roles of typefaces like caption.

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:50.030
If we have seen some image on Internet,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.245
you can see there is a grayish caption at the bottom.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:01:01.185
That is basically sometimes some font family have caption typeface in it,

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:07.150
so you need to use that caption because it is basically designed for that purpose.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.770
The display fonts are designed for headings,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.485
so you cannot use them for body fonts or a very large or big paragraph.

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:19.655
Subhead means subheading.

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:23.650
Display means you can normally use it for headings.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.600
This is all about the roles of typefaces.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.820
Always use the role and define them properly.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.550
If you are using one font for display type,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.475
do not use it for text type.

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:40.035
Let's see some of the examples.

00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:42.935
Now, you can see here I have used

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:47.780
basically a display type in a good manner and a bad manner.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.070
On the right side,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.090
you can see I have used a typeface,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.735
which is meant to be for display types in the paragraph.

00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:58.780
You can see it is all caps,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.805
and I think you cannot read it very easily.

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:09.185
It was basically designed for display type or basically headings.

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:13.010
On the left side, you can see I have used it properly,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.855
and I'm using it basically for headings.

00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:22.020
You might know the font Bieber's new and/or Bieber's,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.420
basically it is very tall font,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.965
same like the one I'm using right now.

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:32.430
This is basically designed for display types.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.320
Sometimes if you are purchasing some font or seeing it online,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.550
you might need to read some of the text below it.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.960
If it says that it is for display or it is a display type,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.630
then user for headings.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.680
In all of your design,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.240
use it just for headings,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.005
don't use it for paragraph text. Define it roles.

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:59.585
This typeface is going to be my heading typeface or display typeface,

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:01.715
and use it for display.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:04.850
This is another example of wrong uses of typefaces.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.800
You can see on the left I am using a transitional font,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.090
and it's display type as heading,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.320
and on the right side,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.980
I'm using it as a paragraph, which is wrong.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.630
Don't use a display type of any font as paragraph.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.390
Try to use it just for headings or maybe subheadings,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.075
not for the paragraph text.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:32.915
Here are a few more examples of roles of typefaces.

00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:36.290
I'm using here PT Sans Google font on

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.315
the right side and on the left side it's Chapel pro font.

00:03:40.315 --> 00:03:43.275
I don't know it's free or I have purchased it,

00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:45.630
sometime I don't remember.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.890
On the right side you can see Google's PT Sans come in a lot of flavors like caption,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.640
regular, and bold or something like that.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.130
I'm using all three to style caption.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.295
At the bottom and in the middle I'm using regular and at the top I'm using bold.

00:04:04.295 --> 00:04:06.920
On the left side, it is the same story.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.335
I'm using display type as my heading,

00:04:11.335 --> 00:04:13.989
regular as my paragraph,

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.870
and caption as the caption at the bottom.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.470
This is all about roles of typefaces.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.540
Define the role of your typeface when you are designing

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.800
something and use it in your design.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.585
Keep it consistent and your design will look great and awesome.

00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:38.210
Let's move on to the next lesson.
