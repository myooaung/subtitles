00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
In this lesson, I'm going to talk about line-height and also it was called leading.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.005
In the past old days,

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:14.100
they used to put molten lead blocks in between different two lines to separate them.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.855
That was called leading.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:17.850
What basically is leading?

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.225
Is the distance from one baseline to the next baseline.

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:28.380
Like we have two or three lines of text then the distance

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.400
from one baseline to the next base line is basically the line height.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.115
Now, how much line-height should we have?

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:40.430
It varies from 120 percent to 60 percent for body text.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.430
Body text is basically the paragraphs and text where we have a lot of texts.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.385
We need to read it.

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:58.260
Now, for headings, you should not set it more than 120 percent in headings.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.944
Very big text, normally,

00:00:59.944 --> 00:01:04.620
the line height is almost from 100 percent to,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.490
or sometimes maybe 90 percent to 120 percent.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.650
For body text, it varies from 120 percent to 160 percent,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.840
and for headings, it is a bit less than our normal line-height.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.125
Here are few examples of body text line-height.

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:25.720
Body text is basically paragraph,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.375
so don't worry if you don't know what body text is.

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:34.180
It is a lot of texts which is meant to be read.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.660
On the left side,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.195
we have line-height 133 percent,

00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:43.095
or we also call it 1.33 percent.

00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:47.505
Thirty-eight pixel is the size of our texts.

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:49.530
Basically, what we do here is,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.705
we multiply 38 pixels by 1.33,

00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:58.380
and what we get is, basically our line-height.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.450
It might be 42 pixels,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.535
46 pixels, or whatever it is.

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:07.770
On the right side, we have a bit bigger line-height which is 1.45 percent.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.155
You can see how it affects readability.

00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:13.999
Also if you have very tight line-height,

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:18.880
you can see the bottom of the top tails,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.650
and tails of different characters,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.825
and the bottom of different characters is going to touch the top of the next line.

00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:32.490
This is a very major readability problems.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.040
Try to adjust the line height where you think it is easier to read.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.415
Now, here is some example for heading text.

00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:41.660
You can see on the left,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.335
I have set it to 110 percent,

00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:50.010
and the size of our text is 60 pixel heading.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.140
On the left you can see it is good enough.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.630
But if you see on the right side,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.350
I have increased the text size more.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.185
It is 72 pixel heading,

00:03:03.185 --> 00:03:08.255
and I have set it to 1.05 percent.

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:10.640
How we are going to calculate it?

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.680
Seventy-two multiply by 1.05,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.165
and it is near almost 75-76 pixels.

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:22.460
Also, you can set it to 100 pixel.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.960
If you have 72 pixels,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.300
you can also set the line height,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.075
72 pixels for bigger headings.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:38.185
Let me show you how we can set line-height in Photoshop for headings and paragraph texts.

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:40.605
How we can control it.

00:03:40.605 --> 00:03:44.310
I have this text over here.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.590
This is a heading, and you can see,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.300
I'm going to select this text,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.725
and I am going to get this character panel.

00:03:52.725 --> 00:03:56.005
I already have this A character panel over here.

00:03:56.005 --> 00:04:02.085
You can see here we have 72 point which is our text size,

00:04:02.085 --> 00:04:07.320
and this is the control where we have to control the line-height.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.640
I can also set it to 72 pixels.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.385
You can see it is looking good.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.775
Even I can go below this,

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:17.580
70 points is also looking good.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.965
But if I go to 65,

00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:23.630
it seems a bit problematic,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.190
or maybe too close to.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.485
You can see over here,

00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:32.505
the i of the time is touching the g. I guess

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:39.330
70 pixel as the last we can go and 72 pixel is,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.300
I think, optimal, or maybe 75 as we had it before.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.400
This is always set the line-height.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.485
Let's see some other example I showed you with the paragraph.

00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:58.254
Here we had the paragraph.

00:04:58.254 --> 00:05:01.850
I'm going to select this paragraph and,

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.015
you can see right now it is 38 point text size,

00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:09.155
font-size, and the line-height is 55 points.

00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:12.740
If I try to increase it to 60,

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.050
you can see, it is still looking good but if we go beyond 60,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.820
like 72, you can see our is cannot jump that far,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.230
below it is a bit too much distance.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:37.585
If you keep on increasing this 90 or 100,

00:05:37.585 --> 00:05:43.730
you can see it is not looking like a paragraph but separate lines.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.535
This is a very big issue in readability and legibility,

00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:53.925
you should keep them at the optimal distance.

00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:56.265
I'm going to set it to 50.

00:05:56.265 --> 00:05:58.455
Let's see how it look like.

00:05:58.455 --> 00:06:01.080
It's still a bit close for me,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.855
I guess 55 was better.

00:06:03.855 --> 00:06:11.010
Now here it is. This is all about how we can set line-height in Photoshop

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.960
and what line-height should we be

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.170
using for body text and what line-height should be used for heading next.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:26.675
Even in HTML, you can set it to line-height property with line-height property.

00:06:26.675 --> 00:06:28.430
One is 100 percent,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.430
1.2 is 120 percent,

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.120
and same like this.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.435
This is all about line-height,

00:06:36.435 --> 00:06:39.820
let's move on to the next lesson.
