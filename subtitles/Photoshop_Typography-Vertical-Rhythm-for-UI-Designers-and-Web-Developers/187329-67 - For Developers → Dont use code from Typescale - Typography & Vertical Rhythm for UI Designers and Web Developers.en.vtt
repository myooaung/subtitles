00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.755
Hello everyone. I told you about one tool which is typescale.com.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:10.980
Today I tried out its CSS,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.025
this one and it miserably failed.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:19.540
So don't try to use it's CSS or values from here in your scale.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.390
The best tool is again this gridlover.net.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.555
So use this code from over here.

00:00:26.555 --> 00:00:35.840
Now I use this code and let me show you how my stuff came out.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.555
Let me show you the example in the demo.

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:41.655
Okay, now the line height,

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:43.110
they haven't showed it,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.735
but I calculated it, it's 29 pixels.

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:54.405
You can see that our headings are lining up very nicely in the three baseline height.

00:00:54.405 --> 00:00:57.380
But the problem is with our paragraphs,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.260
they are not lining up.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.700
Now there is one other problem which is with our heading level 2 and 3.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.400
So if you use heading 2 and then heading 3,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.380
there is a lot of gap.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.935
Because this code is using same margin top you can see over here,

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.830
margin top is 1.4144,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.035
heading 1, 2, 3,and 4.

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:25.520
So all these headings have a top margin which is a lot,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.545
so they are going to be too much apart from each other.

00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:32.975
I don't think that you should use this one.

00:01:32.975 --> 00:01:37.250
You can use values from here in your scale.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.345
So if you are using something like 1.44,

00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:47.285
so you can see that the lower value or small text value is 0.694,

00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:53.220
you can use that, but I don't recommend using or grabbing its CSS.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.735
For me it generates some problems.

00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:59.670
It is not lining up accurately.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:08.030
I don't know what the toolmaker or coder used it for or maybe what he had in mind.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.020
But for me it is not lining up.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.070
So this is another tip not to use type scale code and use grid level.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.340
I guess we should move on to the next lesson.
