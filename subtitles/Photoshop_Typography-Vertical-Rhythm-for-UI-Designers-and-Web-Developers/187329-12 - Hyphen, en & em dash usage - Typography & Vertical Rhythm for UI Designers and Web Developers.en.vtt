00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.120
Today, we are going to learn about hyphens and dashes.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.920
There are two dashes,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.780
em and en dashes and hyphens.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.840
Now we are going to learn all about them.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.240
First, we are going to talk about hyphen.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.770
Hyphen is the shortest and it's located on your keyboard on the left of plus sign.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.605
Now, hyphen is used in three ways.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:28.220
Number one, it is used when a word is split at the end of a line of text,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.110
as you can see here in the word unrealistic at the end.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.080
It is also used to combine two words together to create

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.595
compound words like you can see over here, fun-loving.

00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:43.465
There is a hyphen between fun and loving.

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:48.255
Also, it is used with two words numbers like 20-42.

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:52.915
These are all the ways in which we can use hyphens.

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:55.440
Now we are going to talk about en dash.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.850
En dash is the second-longest in length and is used to

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.139
show space of time or numerical range.

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:06.395
You can see the examples like 9:00 AM-5:00 PM,

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:11.315
July-September, vacation is from June 5-9.

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:14.095
This is how we'll use en dash.

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:15.510
Now, em dash.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.355
Em dash is the longest in length of all the three dashes,

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:22.985
and is used to show a break in thought.

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:29.960
Like you can see over here in the examples down the road and along winding road, it was.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.880
There is a pause in thought and that is how they separated it.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.400
Also, you can see in the next example,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.310
we gathered our supplies.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.955
There is a pause, all eight truckloads and started slowly.

00:01:44.955 --> 00:01:47.980
This is how we use em dash.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.720
Now I'm going to sum up this lecture about hyphen

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.460
en and em dash just to make sure that you remember.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.965
Keep in mind that em for mega.

00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:03.060
Em dash is the longest one and en dash is the second longest,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.815
and hyphen is the shortest.

00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:11.210
Also, keep in mind that you need to use them where they are properly used and required.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.030
Don't use them anywhere you like.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.220
Even a lot of typographers or even on different websites,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.845
I have seen a lot of people making the same mistakes again and again.

00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:26.815
This is all about dashes and hyphens.

00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:29.780
Let's move on to the next lesson.
