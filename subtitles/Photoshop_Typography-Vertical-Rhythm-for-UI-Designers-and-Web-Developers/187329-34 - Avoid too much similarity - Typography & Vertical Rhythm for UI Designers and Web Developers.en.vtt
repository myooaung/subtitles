00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.915
In this lesson, we are going to talk about too much similarity.

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:09.150
So in the previous lesson,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.940
we talked about trying to find similar features among different fonts to combine them.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.330
But in this lesson we are going to look at,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
if you try to find too much similarity,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.185
it will hurt your contrast and your design,

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:32.530
it can easily ruin your design.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.615
So keep in mind that too much similarity can easily kill

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:42.305
the contrast aspect of our forward matching

00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:46.370
technique and it can really impact your design,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.830
so try to avoid too much similarity.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.040
Here I am showing you two fonts,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.530
Noto Sans and Open Sans.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.810
While I was designing for some web app for doctors,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.210
I guess, I came up with this combination.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.560
I tried to use Noto Sans and Open Sans with

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.469
each other in that application and to my surprise,

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.345
there was no contrast at all.

00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:20.375
I was just confused why it is happening again and again.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.550
I should use some other font,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.260
they are not matching very well.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.655
You can see at the top that x-height is similar,

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:33.675
even the stroke's width is similar,

00:01:33.675 --> 00:01:35.970
they have almost similar stroke.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.269
At the bottom you can see I'm showing different letters, grow foax,

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:48.155
it doesn't mean anything just to show you the curves and angles and counters,

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:49.880
how much big the counters are?

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.530
What is the shape of the counter?

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.425
You can see inside the O letters,

00:01:54.425 --> 00:02:00.120
both fonts have almost 99 percent similarity.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.160
Even if you look at A the curves are same,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.125
even the counters are almost same,

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:10.220
W is same, only difference is this G letter,

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.360
I guess one is Humanist Sans-Serif and there is a bit geometric.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.010
The problem I want to show you here is too much similarity,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.730
so try to avoid too much similarity.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.950
Here is another pair I found which is Euphemia Regular and Open Sans.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.530
I think they are not too much similar,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.800
but still they share a lot of same personality.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.450
If you look at Euphemia Regular,

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.240
I think it has a bit more curvy nature and

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.475
ends and you can see a tail after A letter over here.

00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:51.665
Also, F is a bit different but the basic structure of letter is almost the same.

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:53.465
This is another example,

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.410
try to avoid such combinations.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.080
It is better that you write something like two lines in

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.590
two different fonts and try to see whether they resemble with each other or not.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.815
Now here is another combination I found.

00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:11.040
I searched a lot and tried to mix a lot of

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.815
fonts then I reached these two much similar combinations.

00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:18.860
So if you look at Droid Sans and Source Sans Pro.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.770
There are a lot of similarities between these two fonts.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.395
If you look at the G and the ear of G, the letter R,

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:27.090
it is almost the same,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.620
W is almost the same,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.085
one is wider, one is a bit less wider,

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:36.915
F is almost the same and then the curves at the A,

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:39.570
the counter inside the A letter, close counter,

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.335
this is the same, and the X is almost the same.

00:03:43.335 --> 00:03:47.360
X-height is a bit different between these two fonts,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.450
but still they share a lot of similarities.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.509
So this is all about avoiding too much similarity,

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:58.640
if your gut feel that these fonts have no difference

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.310
because your eyes and brain is more trained to look at differences and similarities.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.310
If you find any similarity or you find that

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.835
there is too much similarity between two fonts,

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:12.650
try to avoid them.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.380
Now, let's move on to the next lesson.
