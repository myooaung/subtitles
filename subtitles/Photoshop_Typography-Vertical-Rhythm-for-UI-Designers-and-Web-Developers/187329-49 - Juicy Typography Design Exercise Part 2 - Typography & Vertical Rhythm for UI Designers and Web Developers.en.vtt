00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
In this lecture, we are going to do some final retouches

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.570
which are really important to get the real shape of your design.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.970
We have almost completed everything,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.860
but it is looking off due to some problems.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.530
I'm going to create the grid,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.580
I don't know why it is not showing my grid.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.905
Where is my grid?

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:30.555
Sorry. I just want my grid lines over here.

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:33.930
Now, you can see the distance at the top,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.190
this is a problem with a lot of new designers,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.575
it is more than the distance at the bottom.

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:44.145
This is what making our design a bit,

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:47.745
you can say, "Not in harmony."

00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:53.520
We are going to use our head in this game.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.515
Now, this arrow, I'm going to move it down by 1,

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:07.800
2, 3, 4, okay, 24 pixels.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.630
We are going to make this button stay here wherever it is.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.910
We are going to move these top two layers at the top a bit up like that.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.255
Maybe like this.

00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:28.270
Now, the next thing you are going to do is keep on hiding and showing

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:37.440
your grid lines guides and see whether that design is looking balanced or not.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.110
If you want to move it down or maybe you need to move it up,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.140
this is how it works.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.675
You are going to move it up and down.

00:01:46.675 --> 00:01:49.975
You can also do something like this.

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:57.825
Just have half the letters on this and the rest of the letters like that.

00:01:57.825 --> 00:02:01.560
You can hide this shadow,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.280
just keep the red shadow.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.315
Also sometimes people color this,

00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:11.020
some other color half,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.785
and the other one is colored into some other color.

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:18.815
Also you can see over here we are having some problem

00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:23.390
like we have some other element coming inside this.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.320
What we're going to do is we are going to duplicate our layer,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.940
this background layer, and we are going to adjust it.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.060
We are going to move it up.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:44.030
We have some problem over here because the original image is now lost.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.950
Let's make it a bit more bigger like that,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.505
more closer and more bigger.

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:57.915
Move it up like this,

00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:03.705
and we have our fresh and juicy oranges back in the frame.

00:03:03.705 --> 00:03:09.015
Now, let's move this healthy meals a bit up over here,

00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:11.035
I think it's looking good.

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:18.150
Maybe I think we can move this button and this arrow a bit up,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.590
maybe 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.240
6, 60 pixels at the bottom.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.830
We should also measure this one too.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:40.155
So 1,2, 1,2,3,4, we have 24 and 60 pixels over here.

00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:44.555
Still, I think it is looking something missing.

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:49.600
So I'm going to move it back a bit like that,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.870
and we are again going to move it more upwards,

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.710
a bit more up.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.005
Yeah, I think it is looking better now.

00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:09.665
If you want to make it more slim because this button is taking more space.

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:12.065
So we are going to make it a bit slim.

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:16.560
Go to this height and make it 85 pixels,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.260
something like this. It is looking better.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:27.115
We need more focus and more energy over here in this area not on this button,

00:04:27.115 --> 00:04:29.570
so make it slim.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.410
Also, I'm going to see if this text is lined up with this button.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.130
Now, I think we have almost completed this exercise.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:48.735
Maybe we need to move this background a bit up like that.

00:04:48.735 --> 00:04:55.300
Make it more bigger like this.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.420
I think we have done this exercise,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.820
we have almost completed the final effect.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.610
Also, if you want to make it more bigger,

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.225
you can make it more bigger like that.

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:14.080
So it has more effect like this.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:22.290
Another thing you can do you can move this healthy meals at the top and you can move

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:28.125
this arrow a bit

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:35.010
up like that.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.905
Maybe we can move the button,

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:44.950
maybe we have 1 and 1, 2 like that.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.985
If you try to increase the size of this block,

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:56.630
it is going to increase in size proportionally,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.795
so don't worry about it.

00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:02.780
Now, I'm going to go back at my previous settings.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.195
I don't want it to look too big.

00:06:05.195 --> 00:06:10.760
I think we should move the size of this one a bit low.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.610
Now, it's looking more balanced.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.610
Healthy meals is a bit smaller,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.589
it is 60 pixels, this is 96,

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:24.555
and this is, I think 42.

00:06:24.555 --> 00:06:26.340
Let's make it 40,

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.480
42 is looking a bit bigger for my taste.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.615
[inaudible] and I'm going to move a bit down.

00:06:36.615 --> 00:06:39.345
Just visually centering it.

00:06:39.345 --> 00:06:42.140
Now, this is our final exercise.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.610
These are really important, these final touches.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.475
Now for the button,

00:06:47.475 --> 00:06:50.500
I'm going to change the button,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.120
and we are going to use the other button over here,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.470
like we did before,

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.260
and that was our Eclipse button,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.280
190 by 190, and I'm going to place it over here.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.660
Now, we are going to use Blenda Script font on this,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.240
so I'm going to select blenda script.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.580
Now, I'm going to centralize it,

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.110
over here like this,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.735
and also I'm going to make the size a bit smaller,

00:07:26.735 --> 00:07:31.495
32 pixels, hiding the button at the bottom.

00:07:31.495 --> 00:07:34.610
Also I think it is looking very small,

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.710
so make it a bit bigger.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:42.835
Let's lock at size and increase its height to 200 pixels like that.

00:07:42.835 --> 00:07:53.810
Also we are going to need this angle-down arrow,

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.710
so I'm going to use this arrow over here,

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.760
and we are going to move it up this eclipse.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.580
This is our arrow.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.720
You can use one arrow,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.060
you can duplicate it, it's up to you.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:20.030
Now coming to this browse script we have a lot of tracking over here,

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.425
so let's keep them close because it's a script font.

00:08:24.425 --> 00:08:26.105
In the script fonts,

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:29.880
always make sure that you don't use too much tracking,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.500
it is going to separate their effect like that.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:39.315
You can see they look good when they are very close like this.

00:08:39.315 --> 00:08:45.210
So always make sure it is set to 0 on script fonts.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.200
If you want to make it more bigger like 36,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.575
okay 36 looks better.

00:08:51.575 --> 00:08:54.675
Let me show you one more trick over here.

00:08:54.675 --> 00:08:57.770
If you go to this S,

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.710
and you can see we have few more features available here.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:07.235
These are called ligatures or more features in open type font.

00:09:07.235 --> 00:09:09.665
If I switch to this alternate style,

00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:14.360
you can see how this swash has happened below

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:20.950
my recipes S. Also you can give this same effect to this E,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.145
if you select this, you can see over here.

00:09:24.145 --> 00:09:26.870
This is how we can use

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:33.120
alternative effects and alternative characters for the same typeface.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.430
This feature is not available in all typefaces or fonts,

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.350
it is available in few of them.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.660
So always look for these options over here.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.770
If one is enabled, then you can use it.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.690
I'm going to revert back right now.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.070
Maybe this looks better for me,

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:55.060
I don't like it in very small size,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.330
so if you have a very big size font you can use these alternative effects.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:05.305
In the small size, I don't recommend using these swashes of floral endings.

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:09.135
So this is our next one.

00:10:09.135 --> 00:10:13.400
We can duplicate this arrow and move it downwards and

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.440
reduce its opacity to 50 percent or maybe 30 percent,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.080
whatever you like and however you like.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.170
I think one arrow is more than enough over here,

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.060
so use that like this.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:32.420
Now, why this color is looking great on this because I have sampled it from here.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.630
So you can sample the color from here.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.940
Maybe this basket over here.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:43.749
So this is how I created the second alternation for this design,

00:10:43.749 --> 00:10:49.445
and I think this is going to finish up my work over here.

00:10:49.445 --> 00:10:53.480
I don't recommend that we are going to add another font over here.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.920
If you really want another font,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.320
I have used this one.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.385
This is my student Saqib Ameen.

00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:04.710
So recipe by Saqib Ameen and font I'm using really.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.190
One geometric font and this one is also geometric,

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.375
so two geometric fonts one script and one a bit roundy and fun font.

00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:16.250
You can add one geometric font over here if you want,

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:21.260
and you are going to add it in the last module over here in this area.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.810
Keep me updated about this design.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.590
I'm going to share this PSD with you.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.070
So I'm going to save it to juicy part 2

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.790
and tell me if you can create something like this.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.420
This is also an exercise,

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.255
try to create something like this.

00:11:38.255 --> 00:11:40.505
You can also change the title over here,

00:11:40.505 --> 00:11:45.570
like maybe juicy blender, or something like this.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.470
I hope you have enjoyed this lesson,

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.480
and if you face any problems,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.815
or don't know the shortcut keys,

00:11:53.815 --> 00:11:59.920
you should contact me or take my other course which is UI design in Photoshop.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.540
Take care, and let's move on to next lesson.
