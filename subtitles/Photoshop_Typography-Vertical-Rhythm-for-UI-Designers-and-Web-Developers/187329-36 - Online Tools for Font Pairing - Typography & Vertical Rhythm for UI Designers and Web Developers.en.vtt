00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
In this lecture, I'm going to share with you guys few of

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.640
the very best websites that will really improve your font pairing techniques,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.500
and font pairing guard,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.080
and your font pairing eyes,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.970
and your font pairing,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.360
I don't know, maybe brain, something like this.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.775
I don't know you have it or not.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:24.870
Now, this first one is type connection.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.095
This is a very great game to type pairing.

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:30.405
You can select different fonts,

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.150
like we have these old fonts,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.910
Garamond Pro, ITC Century fonts,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.465
Univers, very structural, a lot of sans serif style fonts.

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:43.280
Then we have some slab serif style fonts,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.770
and this is a very different font.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.440
If you select any of them like if I select this one,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.010
then it gives you four options.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.040
Seek the similar, you want to use

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.170
the same similarity in two fonts or you want to get the contrast,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.450
explore the past, or you want to go with the historical data of this font

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.050
like which font was in 1800 and which was in 1900 or something like this.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.215
Also, you can rely on the family.

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:24.350
Whether you want to select from the same family like this Adobe Garamond Pro.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.570
These are few options.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.115
If you click on this like "Embrace the Other",

00:01:30.115 --> 00:01:34.030
then it gives you options to select three more.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.910
You can select any of these three.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.920
For example, if I select this one,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.325
let's see how they are going to match up with each other.

00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:51.580
It shows head over heart.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.000
They really match, let's send them on a date.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.480
Maybe not because are too much alike,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.580
they are both old style serif that remain crisps small-sized.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.420
This is how it trains you with type matching.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:16.200
You go back and try to combine them again like over here.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.810
This is a very cool game,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.990
you can play it again and again and train your eye.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.195
For example, if you select this one and I am going to embrace the other,

00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:27.710
it is very rounded,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.235
so we might go with Futura which is very sharp, edgy font.

00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:35.350
Let's send them on a date,

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.580
see how it happen.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.720
Yes. They have made a very successful match.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.405
Let's see how well you can do over here.

00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:45.055
Then we have few more sides.

00:02:45.055 --> 00:02:46.870
This one is very good, Type Genius.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.025
You select one font like this one,

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:51.640
and the view matches,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.500
and it will show you a lot of different matches like Adelle, FF Dagny Pro.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.925
This is one match it found for this font.

00:03:02.925 --> 00:03:05.130
You can select others like

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.325
maybe Bebas Neue and view matches and you will find a lot of like 1,

00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:17.940
2, 3, 4, and 5 different combinations.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.935
This is very good,

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:26.400
another tool to maybe train your eye or quickly find a font pair.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.890
Then we have this website, fontpair.co.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.605
You can search over here or you can select fonts over here.

00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:38.415
You can also go with san serif, san serif combination,

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:40.605
or cursive with san serif,

00:03:40.605 --> 00:03:44.180
or serif and sans serif, something like this.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.785
One is for heading,

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:48.925
the second one is for body of text.

00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:50.955
It is normally showing you,

00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:53.385
most of the time, Google Fonts.

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:54.920
These are all Google Fonts.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.265
It will also show you where to download these fonts.

00:03:58.265 --> 00:04:02.855
Then we have few other websites for type inspiration.

00:04:02.855 --> 00:04:06.775
This one is create typewolf.com,

00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:11.735
and it will show you all that new create designs

00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:17.825
and typography masters and their masterpieces and along with their fonts.

00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:19.220
You can see at the bottom,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.490
they have three fonts used in this website.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.965
If you click on it, you can see the details over here, like this.

00:04:27.965 --> 00:04:31.010
At the bottom, and at the top,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.690
if you click on these fonts,

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.280
you can go to this font details and where it has been used.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.480
Also, you can download this font or maybe you purchase it.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.530
Then there is one more typ.io,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.590
it shows you inspirations of different fonts,

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.965
also the fonts used over here.

00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:56.975
Also the tags which means that which category it belongs to.

00:04:56.975 --> 00:04:58.380
Then the site link,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.750
if you want to go over here,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.820
you can check your self.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.240
These are few tools I might find more and I will include a PDF or maybe

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.615
other file in the resources to download it and see for yourself.

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:19.130
Keep practicing and improving your font pairing skills.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.690
I will give you a lot of challenges in the next few lessons,

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.195
so let's see how you can improve and how much you already have improved.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:32.410
Let's move on to the next lesson.
