00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
When it comes to web font sizing CSS units,

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:06.135
there are actually two categories.

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:12.225
One is absolute units like pixels we used to use them in the past a lot,

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:14.565
maybe four or five years back.

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:18.195
Now, there is another category which is relative.

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:22.110
As soon as this is responsive and adaptive,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.480
Web Design is getting popular and it is right now in these days.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.450
It is really essential to develop websites that have relative pixel major units.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.485
We have; em, rem vw and %.

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:41.870
Pixel is used very less these days.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.715
Maybe in the body or something like this at the base font,

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:48.290
we might need to use this.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.820
Otherwise, there is very less use for pixel values,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.570
Now, first we are going to see that em and % are both relative to parents.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.990
They are actually similar with each other.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.265
If they have parent div and then another parent div,

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:09.440
then it can create some problems.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.480
I will explain it in a coding exercise video,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.845
so don't worry if you don't understand right now.

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:22.520
vw means viewport width so it is relative to the viewport,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.260
which is the browser window our user have open.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:34.144
It is very responsive if you try to squeeze your viewport size or your browser,

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:39.440
your heading or font will be squeezed too.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.770
It will shift it's size so it is relative to viewport.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.655
We will see its example with the code.

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:49.075
I am just going to give you a brief overview.

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.045
Now, last one is rem.

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:54.480
Rem is relative to the base body font size.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.300
If you have set your body font size to 18 pixel,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.805
then one rem will be equal to 18 pixel.

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:06.620
It is not dependent on any parent Div or anything.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.099
So in your whole website,

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.230
your whole WordPress Blog.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.205
If you are using rem as your font size,

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:22.115
it will always look for the body font size and do its calculation according to it.

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:25.455
Two rem will be 36 pixels.

00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:31.565
This is very great feature if you want to keep consistency.

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:34.460
Let's dig out in the coding sections.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.100
Let's move on to the next coding lessons.
