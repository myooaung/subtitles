00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.725
Now, let me show you some of the ways we can create this vertical rhythm in Photoshop.

00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:12.270
I'm going to open a new file and I'm going to size it 1400 by 972 pixels.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.250
Don't color manage this document.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.120
Here we have the empty canvas.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.760
I'm going to press "Alt Delete" to fill it up with a foreground color.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.180
Now, I'm going to use 18 pixel base modular scale.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.750
This one, I'm using this site 18 pixel base and 1.5 is my ratio.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.465
Basically my baseline is 27 pixels.

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:47.090
I am going to show you how to draw

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.675
those 27 pixels lines so you can easily use them in your designs.

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:59.630
What I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how to do it in Photoshop.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.635
First, we are going to use some text over here.

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:07.565
Maybe I'm going to choose this grayish color.

00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:11.920
I'm going to use a paragraph over here.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.310
Size should be 18 pixels.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.950
Our 18 point site note is 18 points.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.100
I'm going to go to type and paste Lorem Ipsum over here.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.265
The line height I'm going to use is 1.5.

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:32.465
So I'm going to say 27 pixels over here.

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:36.685
Keep this in mind, you are going to use the line height same as a baseline.

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:42.680
So 27 pixel is basically your line height for 18 point font.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.210
Now, this is our paragraph text.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.775
Sorry, I should be using a regular font rather than medium.

00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:55.860
This is my base font,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.825
base type, and I'm going to use a heading.

00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:03.650
Let's see what is the size of the heading, 41 pixels.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.265
I'm going to use right now, 41 pixels.

00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:10.940
I'm going to click once over here,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.255
41 points over here.

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:20.190
I'm going to use bold face over here.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.640
I am going to show you this is going to be our heading.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.950
Let's use some subheading over here.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.480
Let's use medium for that.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.530
It's a subheading.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.770
Subheading is here.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.555
This is just a dummy text,

00:02:57.555 --> 00:02:59.240
so don't worry about it.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.755
I'm going to change its color to a bit grayish color right now,

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:07.549
like that, just to get some variety.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.910
Let's see what falls the next size, 27.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.250
I'm going to use 27 for this one, like that.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.520
Right now, I am not using any grid to align all these.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.455
So now we are going to use a grid.

00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:28.399
Let's get started.

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:35.600
We're going to create a new file with the width of 100 pixels and our grid size was 27.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.125
So set the height of that document to 27 pixels, press Okay.

00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:44.090
Then from this Shapes menu,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.815
select this line tool.

00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:47.330
Zoom in a bit,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.600
control plus and drag one pixel.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.640
Make sure that at the top it is one point line.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.605
So I am using this one point line and drag it at the bottom.

00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:06.775
We can also use a bit darker black color.

00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:12.330
Now, control A marching S, select everything.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.725
We are going to use defined patron.

00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:21.780
Here we name it 27 pixel baseline grid. Press Okay.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.285
Move to this document.

00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:31.645
Select this layer, and I am going to press and go to layer styles.

00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:35.790
Then we are going to use this pattern overlay.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.255
We are going to use this last one,

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:45.830
which was our baseline pattern.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.270
Now, this is our baseline pattern.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.120
You can see our text is not aligned.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.490
There are two ways we can align it like that,

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.595
sit at the bottom of the baseline.

00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:04.365
This is how I do it normally, like this.

00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:13.720
The subheading should be over here, like that.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.649
This is how we are going to align everything.

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:22.130
If you want, you can go, for example,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.835
if I want the subheading to be more closer to this one,

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:29.455
how much I can move over here, do you know?

00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:35.000
Do you remember? I can move nine pixels below.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.170
So right now I'm going to move 1,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.260
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.305
It is still in proportion because nine is also the multiple of 27 and 18.

00:05:48.305 --> 00:05:53.080
So this is how our text will look on a baseline,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.110
and using a baseline grid.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.465
One more thing is normally,

00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:04.790
some designers also use it like that on the web,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.865
use it in the middle like this,

00:06:07.865 --> 00:06:12.370
and also align it like that.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.415
Subheading should be over here, like this.

00:06:17.415 --> 00:06:20.145
So this is another arrangement.

00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:22.970
I am aligning everything in the middle.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.790
This is another arrangement which is recommended by a lot of web developers.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.405
So right now we are going to use this one, follow this one.

00:06:32.405 --> 00:06:35.195
It is looking more professional to me.

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:38.300
Now, if we try to hide this pattern overlay,

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.060
you can see our text is laid out perfectly.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.330
Here is the next challenge for you guys.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
Create something like this.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.935
Use a modular scale.

00:06:48.935 --> 00:06:53.420
You create a typographic hierarchy and use

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.950
that and align it with vertical rhythm and show it to me.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.120
Let's move on to the next lesson.
