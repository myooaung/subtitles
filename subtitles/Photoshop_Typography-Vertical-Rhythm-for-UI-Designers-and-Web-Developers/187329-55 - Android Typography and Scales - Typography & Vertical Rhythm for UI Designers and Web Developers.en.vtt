00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
Now you are designing for Android system.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.530
So there are two things you need to understand.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:16.530
What is DPI and what is SP which is the four size scaling unit for Android systems,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.890
which is called the scale

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.735
independent pixels or scalable pixels like this one you can see over here.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:28.890
Now, if you go to this material, Google.com typography styles,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.050
you can see they have laid out everything and not in a fashion like Apple does,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.320
but I think it's better than them because it is showing a lot

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.730
of different choices for display 4,3,2,1.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.470
Here they have some scale types over here.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.800
You can see here is the typographic scale 12,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.550
14 ,16 ,20 and 34.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.265
So you can use all of these,

00:00:56.265 --> 00:01:00.675
I think they have two or sometimes gaps of four.

00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:04.670
Here they have few examples like title headline display 2, 3,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.305
4, subheading, body 2,

00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:09.690
body 1, caption button.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.510
They are using 12sp for this.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.585
They are also mentioning all the sizes over here, 112sp, 56, 45.

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:22.730
This is a very nice scale.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.470
It has a lot of,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.470
you can say unlimited variations.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.520
Here are few screens they are showing you for example,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.795
how we are going to use all the sizes interpreted in

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:44.410
our Photoshop while designing for Android.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.535
Now, there are two things.

00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:50.610
One is, what is DPI?

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.650
DPI is basically the different screens sizes resolutions which are supported by Google.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.310
These are LDPI low, DPI, medium DPI,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.770
high, extra high, extra extra high,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.435
extra extra extra high DPI.

00:02:06.435 --> 00:02:12.320
Unlike Apple, they have a lot of resolutions, 1.5x, 2.0x, 3x,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.500
4x, original size and 0.75x which is very okay.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.560
Now how these are calculated,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.410
if you can go to this little tool,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.470
you can see over here,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.790
it is very simple calculator to calculate different sizes and scales.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.380
Now if you switch to this MDPI and put one inch over here,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.080
it is basically one inch on the screen and it contains 160 pixels,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.710
which is equal to this MDPI which is also 160.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.630
So on medium DPI,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.595
your screen resolution and your pixel sizes they are matched.

00:02:53.595 --> 00:02:57.560
So we will be designing using this screen size MDPI.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.095
Don't worry about this 160 right now.

00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:03.590
Okay, now scale independent pixels are also 160 so

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.580
our all units on this screen size will be equal to the actual values.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.340
Also you can see density independent pixel they are also 160.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.370
Everything else is 160, 160 and 160.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.790
Now, if you go to this HDPI,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.375
you can see now the screen size within this one inch is 240 pixels.

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:30.680
So just try to understand this concept in one inch of

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.060
a screen now we have packed 240 pixels.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.355
So all the other things have changed,

00:03:37.355 --> 00:03:42.080
but the scalable independent pixels is the same and density

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.675
pixels independent pixels are the same because they are independent of the pixel values.

00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:50.239
So to avoid confusion,

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.625
we are going to design for this MDPI and we can extract our resources and everything.

00:03:55.625 --> 00:04:00.275
We can tell our coders that this is the size I have used,

00:04:00.275 --> 00:04:02.615
we don't need to calculate anything.

00:04:02.615 --> 00:04:04.130
Now for four sizes,

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.425
we are using this SP.

00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:10.640
So our coders or Android developers,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.040
they will be needing the four scale or four typographic scale in these sizes.
