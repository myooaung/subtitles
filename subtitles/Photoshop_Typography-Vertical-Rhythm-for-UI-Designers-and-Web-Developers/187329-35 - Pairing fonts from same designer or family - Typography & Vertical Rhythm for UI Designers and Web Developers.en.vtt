00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
First we are going to take off very slow.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.935
So we will look at techniques that are related to easily combining different fonts.

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:14.550
So how we can pair fonts very easily.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.950
Now the first rule is,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.754
if the fonts belong to a very big family or a same designer,

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:26.220
then they will fit together very well.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.230
Now, why is that?

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.985
Because same designer or same family means mostly the similar geometry.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:38.130
So the shapes and angles,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.160
most of them they will share their traits.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.150
Now there are families which are called super-families like we have Roboto over here.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.670
Let me show you on Google Fonts.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.435
If you look at Roboto, where is Roboto?

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:55.340
Here. One is Roboto over here.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.815
It has 10 or 15 different sizes.

00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:00.250
Then Roboto Mono.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.610
This is a very big family,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.045
so it has different variations like Roboto Mono.

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:08.240
There is one more, Roboto Condensed.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.750
So all these can be mixed together very easily

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.075
because they are built and designed by same designer.

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:22.935
Actually it's basically very big Jimbo mega family of fonts.

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:26.870
So same family could be a very large family or it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.250
could be a mix-up of sans-serif or serif of the same type.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.395
Droid Sans, you might know the Droid Sans and Droid Serif.

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:41.075
It is also two couple of families and they are basically the same.

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:45.725
Then Roboto and Lato are single big families.

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:52.055
So keep in mind that if a font have a very big family and it has styles of,

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:54.410
for example, let me show you.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.580
Like this Kanit.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.870
So it has many variations,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.885
many different styles, many thicknesses.

00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:07.485
So stroke thickness; 100, 200, 300 different.

00:02:07.485 --> 00:02:09.420
Also this Exo, Exo 2,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.415
it has a lot of variation.

00:02:11.415 --> 00:02:16.195
With these fonts, we can create a lot of variations.

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:20.930
So the first step is that you find a family which have a lot of styles.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.340
So you can use only single family and use

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.245
different ways and styles to create variation and contrast in your text.

00:02:31.245 --> 00:02:39.460
So this is first. Then the second one is that you select fonts from the same designer.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.520
Let me show you example.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.030
Here I am showing you example of Justin Gravante Site of the Day.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.910
It's from January and it is using fonts FF Mark,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.735
Freight Display, and Freight Text.

00:02:55.735 --> 00:03:00.080
Now Freight Display and Freight texts are basically designed by

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.710
the same font foundry, which is GarageFonts.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.220
You can see over here my fonts over here, Freight Text, GarageFonts.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.160
The designer is basically this Joshua Darden for both fonts.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.705
This is the same designer.

00:03:15.705 --> 00:03:18.440
If you click the "Profile" of this Joshua Darden,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.110
you can see he has a lot of different design fonts like Freight Text Pro,

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.020
Freight Display Pro, Freight Sans.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.990
So all these fonts,

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.360
they can be mixed together easily because I think they

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.169
are almost sharing the same geometry,

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.840
because they are designed by the same designer.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.910
Also their name is same,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.530
Freight Sans, Freight Sans.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.530
So this is how we match different fonts from the same designer.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.950
Then we have few more examples of these Freight Text and Freight Display.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.195
You can see over here,

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:56.720
they have used four different fonts on this design.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.920
You can see over here.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.090
It is very marvelous use of fonts.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.890
I think he might be very expert in typography.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.940
Then we have another side.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.155
This is UrbanStems.

00:04:09.155 --> 00:04:12.290
It is also using just Freight Display and Freight Sans.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.640
They are looking great together.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.760
One is sans serif and one is serif font.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.480
Then here, this is a Viaduct Rail Park website and it is also featured on Typewolf.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.550
Here again, we are using Freight Display and Freight Sans.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.960
Not we, but this designer.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.540
They are looking cool together.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:40.535
It is also one is a bit related to sans serif family and one is for serif.

00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:43.010
So they are designed by the same designer.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.350
This is basically, I want to show you here.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.910
This is how you use fonts from the same big family or the same designer.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.270
Use this site, better Google fonts.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.690
I will share you this resource.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.510
So make sure you keep it and look for different forms that have big families.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.480
So this is all about the first rule,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.660
which is how we are going to easily

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.410
combine fonts from the same family or the same designer.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.050
So let's move on to the next lesson.
