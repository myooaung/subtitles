00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.300
Now let's talk about another technique which is called contrast in font pairing.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.715
Few years ago, I was just a novice and beginner in typography matching.

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:15.645
I still consider myself just a beginner like you guys.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:18.060
What is contrast in font pairing?

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.125
Contrast is basically of many types.

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:26.460
It could be a contrast in the thickness of two fonts,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.340
maybe stroke thickness, one is very slim and the other one is very thick.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.350
It can also be a difference in the style,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:44.330
maybe because one is very roundy and one is very bold and bulgy and solid,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.190
it is not very round.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.550
Don't fix your mind that it is

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.790
just contrast between maybe x-height or something like that,

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.985
it could be contrast in any features of two fonts.

00:00:57.985 --> 00:01:03.510
Now, you can see here I have matched three fonts;

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.165
Gadugi Regular, Colaborate-Regular, Aleo Regular,

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:11.780
and I have shown you the x-heights of all these three.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.575
You can see one is a bit smaller and the other two are almost matching.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:23.450
I have seen few examples on Internet,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.510
I have googled around few examples of where the designers have matched three fonts.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.455
Now, the most common thing and the most common secret I would

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:38.180
say I found is that most of the time,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.105
90 percent of the time, the two typefaces,

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:47.370
like here we have two typefaces which share the same x-height,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.050
so one is different.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.745
Most of the time,

00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:55.260
the other two share the same x-height.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.010
So that is the key to their matching three different fonts together.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.125
So this might also help us in using contrast in our font pairing.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.495
Here we have three fonts,

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:12.180
and two have the similar x-height.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.460
Also, one is a bit slimmer,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.575
the two have more thickness.

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:18.540
If you have more thick font,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.670
you might use it just for headings.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.060
This is common sense.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.240
If you want to go with some more details like this Internet / Market /

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.770
Latest Posts subsection or tagline or something like this,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.455
you can use another one.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:38.030
For the body text, choose the one which has

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.260
good x-height and it is easy to read or something like this.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.660
So this is how we are going to use contrast in font pairing.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.610
Here we have another example.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.545
Here, again, we have three fonts; Garamond, Franklin Gothic,

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:56.000
and basically Franklin Gothic Medium;

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.520
these are two styles from the same font.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.740
That is why I am showing you

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.840
just two x-heights because these Franklin Gothic have the same x-height.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.305
So here, what I did is I am using Garamond as my heading.

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:16.720
Garamond is a bit bolder than other Franklin Gothic fonts,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.190
so I have used it for my heading.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.605
Then in the subtext,

00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:23.465
Internet / Market / Latest Post,

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.335
I am using Franklin Gothic Medium, I guess,

00:03:26.335 --> 00:03:29.130
and for the body text,

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.905
I am using Franklin Gothic.

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:36.065
So this is how I combined all these fonts and they are looking really awesome.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.560
Here is another example where I have matched Garamond,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.180
Halifax Light, and Georgia,

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.840
three different fonts, and it is difficult to match three different fonts.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.640
Now, the secret source I already told you is that

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.740
two fonts with similar x-heights and one is different from these two.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.795
So one have smaller x-height,

00:03:57.795 --> 00:04:00.615
other two share the same x-height.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.999
With regards to contrast,

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.280
they have a lot of similar features,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.245
but their thickness and stroke is different.

00:04:10.245 --> 00:04:18.910
So Halifax Light is used as a tagline and Garamond is used as heading,

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.205
and Georgia is used for body text.

00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:25.435
Here is another example of contrast.

00:04:25.435 --> 00:04:27.130
Here I am using Garamond,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.810
Garamond Italic, and Georgia.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.885
So basically two fonts, Garamond and Georgia.

00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:37.470
You can see they have contrast over here,

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.575
if you look at the X over here at the left.

00:04:40.575 --> 00:04:43.020
They have contrast in x-height.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.265
So a lot of contrast in x-height,

00:04:45.265 --> 00:04:47.380
although their features are very same,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.640
one is Old Style, one is Transitional,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.575
and still they are looking great.

00:04:52.575 --> 00:04:58.555
They make a theme of a poem or maybe a suspense story or something like this.

00:04:58.555 --> 00:05:02.829
So this is a very good example of contrast using

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:10.805
only just our x-height and a bit of contrast between Old Style and Transitional.

00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:14.100
Here is another example matching two fonts.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.835
Again, we have Transitional fonts with each other.

00:05:17.835 --> 00:05:21.380
Just they have difference in stroke and style a bit.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.010
One of them, I think,

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.270
is old font Garamond style.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.975
So they don't have too much contrast,

00:05:29.975 --> 00:05:33.925
but still they can make a good pair.

00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:36.735
Plantagenet Cherokee, one font is,

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.925
and the other is MMTimes.

00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:43.700
From my perspective, my gut feelings is that it is not

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:51.770
a very great match because there is just contrast between the stroke thickness.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.710
Otherwise, their x-height is similar.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.550
So they are not giving us a cue that they are a perfect match.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.140
Here is another example.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.185
Here, we have a good contrast between the x-heights,

00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:08.365
although the features are same.

00:06:08.365 --> 00:06:11.550
They both look like geometric fonts.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.270
One is monospace Inconsolata Medium,

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.600
which is monospace font and other is Montserrat Regular,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.440
and this one really creates very awesome-looking font pair.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.270
So this is another example.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:33.775
Here, I have used x-height as my contrast and also a bit of stroke thickness.

00:06:33.775 --> 00:06:36.785
Here is another example of contrast with using

00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:41.125
two fonts from the same family which is Droid Sans and Serif.

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.200
Although they share the same x-height,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.420
their stroke difference and also

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.495
their slabs and Sans and Serif is basically the contrast.

00:06:50.495 --> 00:06:51.905
A lot of times,

00:06:51.905 --> 00:06:53.750
Serifs and Sans Serifs,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.325
they make a really awesome couple.

00:06:57.325 --> 00:07:00.640
This is the last example I'm going to show you guys.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.360
So don't get bored with my boring voice.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.610
I know you hate my voice a lot.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.790
This one is Ubuntu and Proxima Nova.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:18.460
You can see that Ubuntu is very thick and a bit curve in its legs of X.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.830
You can see also the x-height of both is a bit different,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.640
but they look very good together.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.125
They can make a very good,

00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:33.165
health-related or maybe tech-related team.

00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:35.970
This is the last one in contrast,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.990
in font pairing example.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:44.465
I think you might have gained a good knowledge and maybe good feeling from this session.

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:48.300
So let's move on to the next lesson.
