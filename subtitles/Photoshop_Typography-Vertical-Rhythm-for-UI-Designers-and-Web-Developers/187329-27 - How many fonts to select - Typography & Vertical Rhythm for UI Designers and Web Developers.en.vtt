00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.005
When it comes to selecting fonts,

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.240
the most difficult question,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.095
the first one is how many fonts to select?

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.395
I have seen a lot of novice designers and developers,

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:15.465
they make a lot of mistakes.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:20.505
Even I have seen few websites and made adjustments to them,

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:27.210
where the coders have selected maybe five or six different Google Fonts,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.610
and when it comes to loading,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.930
it can really impact or slow down your website.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.290
So always keep in mind that you should not select too many fonts.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.700
You should only go with maximum two or three,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.765
if you really know how to combine them.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.770
I still insist on just selecting two fonts.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.800
They are almost enough for your whole website.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.165
Also, make sure that you don't select too many styles from single fonts.

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:09.400
Again, it's going to impact your loading time and page size.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.935
Now, keep in check the font size,

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:15.620
how much loading size in kilobytes,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.420
I will show you just in a few moments on Google Fonts.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.480
Now, the second step is,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.750
once you have selected the fonts,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.440
you have selected one or two fonts, assign them roles.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.540
We have already talked about roles.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.400
Choose one font for headings,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.290
and subheadings, and/or taglines,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.115
and everything and one font for body text,

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:39.590
because body text font is going to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.230
be read a lot and it should be easily readable and visible.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.855
So make sure your body font is readable and it's readability level is good.

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:55.190
Here is an example of choosing fonts for display and body.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.960
You can see here I am choosing one font for display.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.020
Now, on the left side,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.740
you can see I have used a very tall font,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.090
an all caps font,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.490
like Bebas Neue Font and you can see

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:19.735
that text or body copy is readable and very simple Sensory Font.

00:02:19.735 --> 00:02:22.655
Now there is one more trick to it.

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:27.630
If you are selecting font for your heading or display text,

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.845
we will call it heading in simpler terms,

00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:33.940
so just keep in heading.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.675
So one for heading, one for body.

00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:41.945
Now, when you are trying to select font for your heading,

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:49.025
you can be a bit creative because heading is going to be a bit larger than the body text.

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:52.490
So even if it's very squiggly font,

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.840
or very tall font,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.920
or something like that,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.760
they can be easily read because of its size,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.590
but about the body font,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.660
it must be readable,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.575
its x-height should be good,

00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:10.290
and it can easily be read in large amount, for example,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.085
a big paragraph, try to see whether it is going to be easily read or not.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:19.985
So these are a few considerations you need to keep in mind.

00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:25.835
Let me show you Google Fonts and how we are going to interpret our loading speed.

00:03:25.835 --> 00:03:30.830
So just keep in mind that when you are selecting, for example,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.635
if I select this font like this one,

00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:36.380
one family selected and the next one,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.560
let's select this Source Sans Pro with this one.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.615
So I am going to select Source Sans Pro and above one.

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:46.805
Two families have been selected,

00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:51.820
so you can see their loading time is fast over here at the top.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.185
Now, if I try to customize it and I try to select few a more,

00:03:57.185 --> 00:04:02.875
where it's like, I want bold,

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.330
you can see the loading time is moderate.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.860
Also, if I go to this Secular Font,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.580
it only have one face,

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.280
so it only have one style,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.795
which is regular 400,

00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:20.960
which is its weight.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.435
Maybe we can get to this regular italic, I think so.

00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:29.340
Loading time is moderate.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.830
Now, you can download it from here like this and install it on

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.630
your PC or Mac to use them in your designs.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.410
You can use this sky fonts.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.325
I haven't used it before.

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:45.485
If you want to try it, you can try it.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:49.490
This is one thing you need to keep in mind while selecting your font.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.740
If you are selecting too many fonts,

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.820
if I go to this like more than three or four, five,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.670
six styles, you can see it is going to be slow,

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.675
so make sure your loading time is fast or moderate.

00:05:02.675 --> 00:05:05.810
Don't go more than three styles.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.085
I think two styles,

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:09.920
like regular and regular Italic are good for

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.385
our body text and this one is good for our headings.

00:05:13.385 --> 00:05:16.115
So this is all about how to select fonts.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:19.440
Let's move on to the next lesson.
