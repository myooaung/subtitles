00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
In the last lesson,

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.430
we looked at the resources of this design exercise. Let's get started.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:13.575
I'm going to open up a new file and the size will be 1,400 width and 900 pixels height.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:18.000
Press ''OK'' and this is our art board.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.735
To convert this layer to background,

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:25.245
just name it background and we are going to go to layer,

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:29.115
new, and background from layer.

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:32.880
We can align things with this because it is locked.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.740
Now, we are going to create inner box on this because we had

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.160
this one and this yellow layer and then we have the text inside.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.140
We have actually one and two rectangles on this background.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.165
We are going to create an another rectangle.

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:59.210
Click on the rectangle tool as you press ''U'' on your keyboard and press once like

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.180
this and the size should be 1,200 by 725.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.360
You can adjust on your on side if you want to,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.785
but I have calculated all these sizes before so we can set up quickly.

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:22.845
Align them in the middle and now we need the third one.

00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:32.190
Third rectangle will be inside this rectangle which will be our main yellow stroke path.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.370
It will be actually 900 by 500 pixels.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.280
This one has been created but you cannot see

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.620
the layers because it is some other color right now.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.575
We are going to align it in the middle of this rectangle.

00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:54.080
Let's name them accordingly.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.760
This is our transparent back.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.440
It will be a bit of transparent,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:09.280
then this one is our main yellow border.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.265
This is how we are going to design this area,

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:23.405
actually what we had is we had this rectangle as our yellow,

00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:25.390
it had a yellow stroke.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.265
Let's set the yellow stroke go to layer, layer effects,

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:32.235
and we are going to go to stroke,

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:38.520
and the color is F-F-E-E-9-9, press ''OK''.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.455
The stroke size is six.

00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:47.560
I'm setting it on the outside and that is all you can click "OK" then you can go to fill,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.975
press zero, and here we have our yellow rectangle.

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:57.880
Now, for the pattern at the background we can create,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.090
what's that, a new layer over here,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.090
fill it with anything you want.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.720
Control + Alt delete to fill it, like this.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.400
I filled it with this color.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.550
Now what we're going to do is we're going to create a pattern from this file.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.275
I'm going to drop it in Photoshop like that,

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:33.780
just ignore the colors and we are going to create a pattern.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.000
Control A, select all this,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.950
and go to edit,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.865
define pattern and this is our pattern, let's close it,

00:03:44.865 --> 00:03:46.980
and on this layer 1,

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.455
which was our background layer, just a layer.

00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:57.310
We're going to use this layer for our pattern, so pattern layer.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.835
Let's color it something else so it doesn't feel very weird.

00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:08.045
Maybe this one, so it feels different from the other one.

00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:13.995
Don't worry about the color because our pattern is going to overlay on this design.

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:17.970
Go to the end and you will see this pattern.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.050
Let's scale it back to 100 percent.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.265
Opacity should be full and it is looking very big.

00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:32.220
Maybe we can snap to a region.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.640
We can reduce its size to 50 percent or 25 percent,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.565
25 percent is looking great.

00:04:41.565 --> 00:04:45.390
Press "OK" and we have our pattern.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.845
Let's change the color of this one to this earth tone.

00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:53.750
This is a bit of earth's tone,

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.855
you can see over here.

00:04:55.855 --> 00:04:59.885
Maybe this color or this one.

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:03.460
It is a mixture of red and grease.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.645
To make up this earth tone,

00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:08.580
you can use this one.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.170
I think this one is more closer.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.375
Now, we are going to make it a bit transparent by changing this opacity to 90 percent.

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:20.419
You can see our background is already completed.

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.520
Let's create a pattern over here.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.910
Pattern size will be 500 by 110 pixels,

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.575
it is also going to be a rectangle over here like that.

00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:36.840
Let's move it above this window,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.355
and we're going to color it with some orange color,

00:05:40.355 --> 00:05:44.770
maybe this one, a sharper orange or this orange.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.515
Whatever colors you like,

00:05:46.515 --> 00:05:50.250
I think it doesn't look very well over here.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.970
Maybe we need a bit more sharper color.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.495
Something over here like that.

00:05:58.495 --> 00:06:02.945
Let's zoom out and see how it is looking right now.

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:08.130
I think this orange color is looking something a bit odd.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.495
This one looks better.

00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:14.570
I'm going to use a bit sharper color over here.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.960
Also this color looks a bit strange to me.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.765
I don't know why but it has something missing.

00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:26.315
Now, it looks great.

00:06:26.315 --> 00:06:29.370
Don't worry about the final details,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.070
we can fine tune it in the end.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:39.210
We can change colors for an hour so I don't want you to waste your time over here.
