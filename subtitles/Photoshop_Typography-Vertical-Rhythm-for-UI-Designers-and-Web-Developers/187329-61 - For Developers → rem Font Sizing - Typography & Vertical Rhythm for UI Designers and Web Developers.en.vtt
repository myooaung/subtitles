00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.685
Let's talk about Rem Unit or CSS font size specification.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:07.785
This is my favorite one,

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:09.945
it is relative to the body.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:12.735
Let's see how it is going to work.

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:17.475
I am setting my base font size on HTML rather than body.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:23.100
Sixty two point five percent means 10 pixels which is 16 pixels multiply by

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.465
0.625 which is equal to 10 pixel that is how it is going to be equal to 10 pixels.

00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:35.860
This is sometimes designer do designers or quarters they use this technique,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.890
it is very old one to make your calculations easier,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.730
but the recommended is four size 100 percent,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.225
so always use this one.

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:49.040
I am using only for this exercise just to explain you few concepts.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.250
Now rem is always going to look for this HTML or inside this body tag,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.745
whichever is the base font.

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:03.015
If we don't have HTML it will look in body tag.

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:06.125
It will look for this size which is 10 pixels,

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:12.665
and all its calculation will be based on this, so 10 pixels.

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:19.745
Our paragraph over here is 1.6 rem which is 10 multiplied by 1.616 pixels.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:26.435
Then our span sizes 2.4 rem which will be equal 24 pixels, why?

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:31.710
It is easier to calculate because we have setting over here.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.600
Then inside the h_2,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.955
it is 36 pixels, this is 24,

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:41.520
2016, 14 pixels so on and so forth.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.895
Now inside the container,

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:50.630
if you try to specify some font size like I am specifying right now, 24 pixels.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.365
Let's see is it going to look for this size

00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:58.910
as our base size or it is going to look for this size.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:08.025
I have right now opened it in Chrome just to give you some taste of the Chrome levels.

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:13.200
Now you can see it is an effective and our font size is,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.665
this one is going to be,

00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:19.620
let's see what is the font size computed.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.915
Let's see.

00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:25.510
Line height is 48 pixels.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.515
Then there is our font size,

00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:35.435
it will be in the f,

00:02:35.435 --> 00:02:40.500
c, d, e, f. Here we have.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.065
Font size 48 pixels.

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:45.860
It was a bit difficult to find this value

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.595
in Chrome because it have a lot of other values like flex, another the hidden.

00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:56.375
This is difficult to find it,

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:59.225
but here we have font size 48 pixels.

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:03.195
We specified 4.8 rem.

00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:07.580
Which means it is calculating according to this value.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.410
It is not looking for this value or not even considering it.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.110
We should always make sure that this is going to work with the base font element.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.405
It will be consistent always.

00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:26.030
If I want to change all the sizes,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.085
I'm going to just change your here.

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:31.950
One change controls everything else.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.940
This is the thing I love, refresh.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.340
This is really magic and I really love this feature that you can

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.490
control all the font sizes relative to one element which is this HTML,

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.245
or if you have body,

00:03:48.245 --> 00:03:54.915
this is how we use this HTML CSS Rem Sizing Unit,

00:03:54.915 --> 00:04:02.045
and we use HTML as our base size and change all the values according to it.

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:07.490
I normally try to use rem in my projects if I have a landing page I try to use

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.485
rem because then I know that all my font sizes are relative to this one.

00:04:14.485 --> 00:04:15.770
If I want to change,

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.310
I can change over here and everything will be changed on all pages or in the whole theme.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.130
Make sure you do this exercises and download the sample files.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.350
I'm going to upload all these files,

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.210
so you can check them out.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.470
Let's move on to the next lesson.
