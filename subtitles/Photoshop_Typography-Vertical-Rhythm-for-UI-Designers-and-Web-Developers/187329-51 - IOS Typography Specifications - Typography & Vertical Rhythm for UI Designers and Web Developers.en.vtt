00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.435
In this lesson, we are going to look at human interface guidelines from Apple,

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:09.580
and these are called iOS Human Interface Guidelines.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.235
We're going to look at typography section.

00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:14.760
You can read all about it here.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.020
If you want to download,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.820
you can go to Resources and download the fonts for the people who are using Mac,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.520
I think they might have already installed this San Francisco fonts,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.680
so there are two fonts basically.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.705
One is the San Francisco UI Text and San Francisco UI Display.

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:42.300
Display is for headings and UI Text is for paragraphs and text with small size.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.740
Their specification is if you have 19 points are

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.550
smaller than you should use San Francisco UI text and if we have

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.535
20 points or larger than we should use

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:57.910
display font because they are made for bigger text sizes.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.700
Here are few more points about iOS Guidelines.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.560
Emphasize important information.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.395
We already know how to use font-weight, size, and color.

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:12.140
Then if possible, use a single font because mixing too many fonts can be a bit sloppy,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.165
it can also slow down your app or something like this,

00:01:16.165 --> 00:01:19.225
so this is the suggestion.

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:21.230
If you can possibly use

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.470
this San Francisco font you should use it because it's System font.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.430
It will be loaded easily in your app.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.535
For Windows users you should download your San Francisco font from here.

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:34.725
This is GIT repository.

00:01:34.725 --> 00:01:41.010
Also you can Google about it then download San Francisco font for Windows.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.720
You will surely find a lot of links just download it and install it on your PC.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.500
Here are a few specification if you are using San Francisco UI display,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.104
which is for headings,

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:58.745
there is one line here which is font size at 2x, 144 P PI.

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:02.235
Basically it is saying that at 2 x,

00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:06.650
at retina screens for iPhone 55 S,

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.520
6, not 6 plus.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.805
These are sizes for add 2x screens I think we discussed all this in the previous lesson.

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:21.350
These are the font sizes in points.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.210
This is tracking.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:31.205
Tracking is basically how much letter spacing we have between in our text or paragraph.

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:35.525
We will adjust this by using photo-shops tracking

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:41.055
and these are a few font sizes for our headings.

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:45.335
Now coming to this San Francisco UI text,

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:48.410
there are a lot of different sizes in points.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.360
Again, we have a lot of tracking.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.125
You can see that when the size is very low,

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:58.340
tracking is very high because very small text is not

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.690
readable if the letters are very close together.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.010
Next, we are going to design something like this for original iPhone size 1 X,

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.752
2 X and 3 X.

00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:16.610
IPhone, old iPhone regional iPhone, iPhone 4,

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.940
I guess, iPhone 5,6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.220
Let's move on to the next lesson.
