X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.245
Now let's get started and create this awesome looking,

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:06.240
fresh & juicy exercise.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.375
We are going to start with a new file.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.995
Size will be 1920 by 1080,

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:18.990
and background content, don't color manage this document, click "OK".

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.090
First of all, we're going to drag our image over here,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.955
so let's drag the image.

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:28.200
We are going to drag the image to the Photoshop and let's drop it.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.525
It will be converted into a smart object and we are going to scale it like that.

00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:36.615
Don't scale it too much,

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:38.520
it's already on the borders.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.890
We are going to press Enter,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.025
and this is our artboard or main background which is ready now.

00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:53.590
Select this layer and we are going to convert it to background layer.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.925
This is a bug with this Photoshop here,

00:00:56.925 --> 00:00:59.235
so it has vanished my background.

00:00:59.235 --> 00:01:02.565
This is basically the artboard.

00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:04.920
I deleted the artboard by selecting it,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.720
and my background is back.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.780
Now we're going to throw some fonts on it,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.000
and first of all,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.485
we are going to select this Dozen font,

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:17.235
which was our main font.

00:01:17.235 --> 00:01:20.315
The size will be 96 points.

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:22.370
I'm using almost this scale,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:30.790
so size will be this, fresh & juicy.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.575
Control A, Control Alt H, to centralize it.

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:38.150
These are my custom shortcuts.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.570
If you don't know how to create them you should look at my other course,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.315
UI design in Photoshop.

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:46.220
This one is created,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.805
now next we are going to create this rounded rectangle or maybe this rectangle.

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:54.155
Create it like that.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:59.615
Just use your head width for the proportions, like this.

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:02.330
We are going to color it white,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.869
and let's move this fresh & juicy upward.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.710
First we are going to change the corner radius.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.280
Go to this properties panel for this rectangle,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.845
and this corner will be 60, and unlock them.

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:24.415
We are going to choose different settings for them,

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:28.580
like that, 60, 60, 0, and 0.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.995
Now let me just color it something else so you know that it is over there.

00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:39.265
Now what we're going to do is we're going to first place

00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:43.315
this inside this rectangle, like that.

00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:45.170
It's looking a bit up,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.215
so use your visual center.

00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:51.560
There are two centers in a redesign.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.345
One is calculated by machine and one is calculated by your eyes.

00:02:56.345 --> 00:03:00.495
I'm right now moving it downwards.

00:03:00.495 --> 00:03:04.070
My eyes think that it is in the center.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.300
Now it is almost in the center.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.820
That's almost perfect.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.010
Now what we're going to do is we're going to Control click on

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.805
this to select this layer selection, this font.

00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:25.190
Then we are going to select this rectangle,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.760
the rectangle below, and invert the selection,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.400
Control Shift I, and then click on this mask.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.665
You can see over here,

00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:39.159
it has created a mask.

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:46.365
This one is this layer which our for selection is almost transparent.

00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:47.810
If you don't understand,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.140
I'm going to repeat this step again.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.290
The first step was we are going to select this layer.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.940
Control click on this to select this selection,

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.090
then invert the selection, Control Shift I.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.340
We have selected everything else,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.845
this area inside this text.

00:04:09.845 --> 00:04:13.600
Inverse selection, then click on this layer,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.130
and click on this.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.135
Now you can hide this font and you can see this layer has been emptied out.

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:25.140
One more thing I forgot,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.985
we are going to use some modular grid over here.

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:34.075
We are going to divide all this background into seven divisions.

00:04:34.075 --> 00:04:42.015
Why seven? Because our design is basically centralized,

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.960
everything is centralized, so we are basically using

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.265
two modules at the top for the space and two at the bottom,

00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:51.410
and three inside this area.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.080
Three modules here toward the top,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.365
let's show you so you can understand it better.

00:04:57.365 --> 00:05:05.750
With Griddify I'm going to divide it like that in this direction with this.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.250
I'm going to Control Colon to show my grade.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.790
If you don't have Griddify you can use this view over here,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.020
and new guide layout.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.180
Let me show you another way.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.799
Let's clear these, clear Canvas guidelines,

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:30.475
and we are going to create new guide layout.

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:35.870
In this example, we don't need columns because everything is centralized.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.200
What we're going to do is we're going to need rows,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.185
seven rows without any gutter. Like that.

00:05:44.185 --> 00:05:48.845
Also if you want to remove the margins, it is better.

00:05:48.845 --> 00:05:53.780
Seven rows, you can create guide layout like that.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.785
Here we have this rectangle almost completed.

00:05:57.785 --> 00:06:03.985
Lets move it downward on these oranges like that.

00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:06.975
I think that it's better.

00:06:06.975 --> 00:06:12.500
Now we are going to select second font which is going to be our Gilroy.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.010
It is basically a geometric font.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:22.260
I'm going to use Gilroy right over here,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:29.580
and we are going to write HEALTHY MEALS in all caps.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.830
If you remember, we used all caps for headings,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.945
so we are going to use it,

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:38.135
color it to white.

00:06:38.135 --> 00:06:43.420
We need to size it a bit down, maybe 60.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.360
Move it around over here in the middle, Control A.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.780
Let's make it in the middle, like that.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:57.460
One more thing, we are going to use some tracking to open it up, like that.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.820
I think 75 will be good, like this.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.610
It's looking a bit small to me,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.415
maybe I think we should use 72.

00:07:08.415 --> 00:07:12.000
Seventy two is good, 72 and 96,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.815
this are two font sizes we are using right now.

00:07:15.815 --> 00:07:20.190
I'm going to move it a bit down, like that.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.685
The next thing is we are going to create a button over here.

00:07:25.685 --> 00:07:29.315
For the button, we are going to use rounded rectangle,

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:31.100
or maybe just the rectangle,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:37.890
regular rectangle, and we are going to create a button like this.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.720
Now, just forget about the color right now we are going to use stroke over here,

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.475
stroke of four pixels.

00:07:49.475 --> 00:07:51.595
It should be white,

00:07:51.595 --> 00:07:55.140
and it should be 100 percent opaque.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.040
We are going to use it at the outside.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:07.480
Now, one thing we are going to use this fill to zero.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.525
I'm going to show you one more trick right now.

00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:14.500
Now we are going to add the third font for this one,

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.660
which was Damion, I guess.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.640
Yes, it is was Damion.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.414
This one, Damion regular,

00:08:26.414 --> 00:08:32.315
and we are going to write over here browse recipe.

00:08:32.315 --> 00:08:37.500
I just added an S over here.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.310
Now, we are going to size it down to 36.

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.500
No, I think 36 is too small.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.245
48, 48 is too big,

00:08:46.245 --> 00:08:52.800
then we are going to find a middle ground, maybe 42.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.510
Don't worry about the scale.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:09:00.090
Right now, we are using our own imagination or whatever you can see.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.725
Now, we almost have our button over here.

00:09:04.725 --> 00:09:08.355
Now add some arrow at the downside.

00:09:08.355 --> 00:09:09.990
One more thing you can see,

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.480
that our text is not visible.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.135
Now, it's a simple trick.

00:09:15.135 --> 00:09:18.165
As our background is filled,

00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:21.075
we have moved the fill to zero percent,

00:09:21.075 --> 00:09:25.020
or we are using some fill over here.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.320
You cannot notice is this fill right now,

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.625
but it is there.

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:33.180
We have darken the background a bit below

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.610
this text and you can see it is looking awesome.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.875
This is the trick I used over here.

00:09:40.875 --> 00:09:42.765
You might not notice it,

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:47.965
but you can see over here, five percent fill.

00:09:47.965 --> 00:09:51.275
Right now, I'm using 12 percent fill.

00:09:51.275 --> 00:09:54.140
You can set it up where you like it,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.135
so I like it over here.

00:09:56.135 --> 00:09:59.725
Now we are going to add some arrow over here.

00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:07.170
For that, we are going to use our awesome font.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.180
PS this extension.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.995
If you don't know how to install it,

00:10:10.995 --> 00:10:13.770
you should go and such for it,

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.505
font awesome PS extension and install it.

00:10:17.505 --> 00:10:23.040
I have talked about all these extensions and secret extensions in my other course,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.470
which is UI design for Photoshop.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.785
So what we're going to do, is arrow,

00:10:28.785 --> 00:10:35.280
so maybe we need to write down.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.390
This one, is what we need.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.540
Let's size it a bit up.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.045
Maybe here, move it down,

00:10:48.045 --> 00:10:50.715
Control A move, it in the center.

00:10:50.715 --> 00:10:54.480
Also we need to pair this up.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.195
This is a button. So name it button.

00:10:58.195 --> 00:11:02.910
We are going to use color overlay for this arrow,

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.310
we are going to use white color.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:13.380
I'm going to align everything in the same middle.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:20.955
Now you can see, we have already created a lot of goodness.

00:11:20.955 --> 00:11:27.015
Now, there are few more extra things I did or you can.

00:11:27.015 --> 00:11:30.420
You cannot see right now, let me show you.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.070
If you look at this healthy meals,

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.930
there is a red shadow around it.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.790
Then in this juicy meals,

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.095
you can see there is some shadow over here in these areas.

00:11:40.095 --> 00:11:50.445
So these little touch or details really impact or create a very great impact on the user.

00:11:50.445 --> 00:11:55.800
You might not feel it very instantly, but it is there.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.990
So for this meals,

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.520
I'm going to use

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:09.735
some drop shadow and the color is going to be this read bf 4,000.

00:12:09.735 --> 00:12:12.660
You can also sample the color from here,

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.295
over here, or maybe over here,

00:12:14.295 --> 00:12:15.960
it is up to you.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.845
Like this. You can sample a color from the image like this.

00:12:19.845 --> 00:12:22.605
I sampled it from here right now.

00:12:22.605 --> 00:12:28.500
Now, this is how you can use 30 percent multiply,

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.060
keep the distance same spread to minimum two and three pixels.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.970
Not too much, but it's up to your liking.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.110
If you want to increase it,

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.640
you can increase it.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.805
So this is how we have used.

00:12:41.805 --> 00:12:43.440
If you want to add another shadow,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.345
let's add another shadow.

00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:47.370
Now what we're going to do,

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:55.660
is we are going to add a dark shadow over here and we are going to spread it like that.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:02.435
Like this. What we are doing is actually,

00:13:02.435 --> 00:13:04.830
let me show you the effect.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.465
If I tried to hide this,

00:13:08.465 --> 00:13:13.450
you can see the effect going and coming back.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:17.085
Actually, we are making it more visible over here.

00:13:17.085 --> 00:13:24.300
So if I add some drop shadow or very widespread drop shadow around it,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.850
you are not going to feel that drop shadow is there,

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:31.990
but it will make your texts appear more crisp and easy to read.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:38.790
You can see if I try to increase the multiplication of this effect,

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.040
you can feel it like this.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:49.300
Also I am going to increase this a bit.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.625
It is looking really great.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:14:02.625
Four. Let's move it to the normal rather than multiply. Press Okay.

00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:09.270
Now it is looking great and I think we have almost completed it,

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.485
we just need one more over here.

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:15.390
So on this layer,

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.000
this is our main fresh and juicy layer,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.850
fresh juicy layer and we are going to add one other shadow over here,

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.325
drop shadow like that.

00:14:26.325 --> 00:14:28.080
It is not going to be this one,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.090
it is going to be this red one.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.145
Now, what we're going to do,

00:14:32.145 --> 00:14:36.135
is we're going to keep it very small like that.

00:14:36.135 --> 00:14:39.270
Distance would be one pixels or two pixels,

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.670
something closer to this.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.070
Make it 35 pixels,

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.535
and make it two and this one three.

00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:50.910
So this is how I use this effect.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.210
Maybe you can more lighten this effect,

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.580
make it more light like that.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.960
15, no, 15 is to light.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.890
25 is good. If you want to try,

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.210
you can try something like this.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.630
You can see how this effect is going out.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.375
So keep this size to minimum.

00:15:12.375 --> 00:15:14.505
Maybe two pixels is good.

00:15:14.505 --> 00:15:21.615
Also this distance, you can see how it is moving the whole area above and down.

00:15:21.615 --> 00:15:24.210
Also keep it too minimum,

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.325
I think two pixels is more than enough,

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:29.730
you cannot go beyond that because it will show

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:34.350
more distorted areas over here at the bottom.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:38.650
So this is good.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.665
I think we have almost finished our exercise.

00:15:43.665 --> 00:15:45.090
In the next exercise,

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.690
we are going to do some variations and

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:55.170
also we are going to reattach it for the fine details.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:59.740
So let's move on to the next lesson.
