00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.005
In this series of exercises,

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.980
we are going to design something similar to this.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.840
Let me hide to details over here so you can see what it is going to be like.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.705
This is one example.

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:25.680
I trade a lot of different layouts and designs for the same content.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.315
This is our content.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:28.840
This is one arrangement,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.255
this is the second one.

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:34.680
You can see how it is affecting our design.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.080
This is the third one.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.975
We will use modules, margins,

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:46.625
baseline, everything in this exercise, even vertical rhythm.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:49.385
This is the last one.

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:53.960
There are a lot of things you need to set up first.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.855
In this exercise, I am going to tell you how to set up this baseline,

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.180
this scatter size, these margins,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.735
and how to create these modules.

00:01:04.735 --> 00:01:07.620
This is our document.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.834
Let's first see what other resources we are going to use for this document.

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:18.425
The first step we are going to take is we are going to choose our Google fonts.

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:24.445
The two fonts I'm trying to select here is Lato and Source Sans Pro.

00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:27.950
If you remember my last exercises,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.220
you already know that one font is going to be for

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.995
headings and one is going to be for body text.

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:42.410
I'm using Source Sans Pro for headings and Lato for my text. These are two fonts.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.670
If you want to download them,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.200
you can download them from here,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.505
this icon over here and install them on your PC or Mac and use them.

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:55.670
Then we are going to use Gridlover or Modular Scale,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.260
whichever you want to use.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.750
We are going to use a scale factor 1.3,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.895
line height 1.5, and base font size is 20 pixels.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:13.590
Solid line height will be equal to 20 multiplied by 1.5, 30 pixels.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.630
Thirty pixels, line height,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.745
font size will be 20 pixels,

00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:20.480
scale factor will be 1.3,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.300
so our heading 1 will be 44 pixels.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.545
You can see over here,

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:27.070
font size 44 pixels.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.120
If you switch to modular scale,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.570
you can get the values more easily because it only has ratios and base size.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.680
We have 44 over here.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.440
You can also use this 57 if you like,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.745
but 44, 34, 20, then 15.

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:49.290
This is our scale if you want to use table over here,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.430
you can switch to this table to view all the sizes.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.940
We have selected our scale,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.295
typographic scale, our fonts,

00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:04.180
and their roles, which font is going to play which role.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.185
These are the steps we have covered.

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:10.205
Then we are going to use the data from this site,

00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:14.250
the content from this site, RealIpsum.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.050
For images, you can download images from this

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.575
picjumbo.com or Pixabay or any other good website.

00:03:23.575 --> 00:03:25.640
I really like this website.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.810
If you go to Categories,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.090
you can switch to People, Nature, Love,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.300
whatever or whichever category you prefer,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.180
you can go to Architecture.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.270
They are very nice images,

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.110
you can see over here.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.355
You can select any of them,

00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:42.570
go to next page.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.430
For images, use this picjumbo.com, category,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.300
people or any category you like, RealIpsum for text.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.990
We have selected our fonts and font rows and our modular scale and our grid size,

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.490
which is baseline grade,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.660
which is 30 pixels,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.705
and base font size 20 pixels.

00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:03.980
Now, our first step will be,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.725
we are going to create something like this.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:10.910
Let's get started and open up a new file.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.540
What we are going to do is we are going to set the width to

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.540
1400 and the height is going to be 810 pixels.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.615
Why? Because 810 is easily divisible by our baseline,

00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:28.340
which is 30 pixels.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.100
If you try to divide 810 divided by 30,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.060
it will be a whole value which is 27.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.945
Eight hundred and ten and press Okay.

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:42.420
This is our documents size.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.410
Now let's set up some grid over here.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.540
First what we are going to do is we are going to create new guide layout.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.640
We are not going to use 12 columns,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.180
we are going to use eight columns.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.330
If you want to create rows,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.380
it's up to you.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.675
You can create rows or you can create eight rows.

00:05:05.675 --> 00:05:08.500
I think here we have eight rows,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.175
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:05:11.175 --> 00:05:14.310
This is basically creating our modules.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.485
Now I'm going to hide it.

00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:18.990
Gutter size is going to be 30 pixels.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.805
Each column has a space in between which is 30 pixels. This is our gutter.

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:31.835
Now for margins, the top margin is 90 which is equal to our three baseline height.

00:05:31.835 --> 00:05:33.890
This is going to be 30,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.500
bottom is going to be 90 again,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.750
and right is going to be 30.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.300
There are no hard and fast rules,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.864
if you want to set more margin,

00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:50.525
like 120 or maybe on the right and left you want to be 45 or 60, it's up to you.

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:55.885
Make sure that it is in sync with your baseline height, which is 30 pixels.

00:05:55.885 --> 00:06:00.440
Now this is how I have created my grid. Press Okay.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.860
This is my grid and gutters and

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.245
margins at the top and the bottom and on the right and the left over here.

00:06:08.245 --> 00:06:10.590
This is just a start of my document.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.385
Now what we are going to do is we are going to create some modules.

00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:20.245
How we are going to create some modules.

00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:23.235
But first step is,

00:06:23.235 --> 00:06:26.760
we need a baseline grid.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.050
Let's create a baseline grid which will be 30 pixels.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.930
So weight 100 pixels, height 30 pixels.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:43.515
Let's zoom in 1,200 percent and use this line tool,

00:06:43.515 --> 00:06:47.160
press "Shift" and create a line over here,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.710
change the color to some gray.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.650
One pixel line, make sure it's one pixel line.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:59.200
See at the top over here where is the height one pixel.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.205
Make sure the height is one pixels

00:07:01.205 --> 00:07:04.805
because it will create problem if you have a two pixel line.

00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:12.270
Control A and define pattern 30 pixel base line.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:18.620
What we are going to do is we're going to create a new layer for our baseline grid.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:25.440
Control A or Alt + delete to fill this layer with gray color.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.250
We are going to Pattern Overlay

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:37.010
this layer which is going to be our 30 pixels like that.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.115
Our grid is a bit off.

00:07:40.115 --> 00:07:42.140
We're going to adjust it.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.684
Don't worry, make sure this is scaled to 100 percent Snap to origin,

00:07:46.684 --> 00:07:49.340
and I think it is already fixed.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:57.285
Press Okay, and Control D. This is our baseline grid, it is setup.

00:07:57.285 --> 00:08:03.165
Now we are going to create some modules in this document.

00:08:03.165 --> 00:08:04.530
What we're going to do is,

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.320
we are going to create 1, 2,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.360
3, which is going to be 90 pixel high.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.780
Make it 90 pixels.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:21.170
This is going to be a bit different color like this,

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.460
or maybe this one.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.440
This is our one module,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.155
or basically a row.

00:08:30.155 --> 00:08:32.780
Basically, rows and columns,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:41.315
they mix together to create this modular grid style.

00:08:41.315 --> 00:08:47.720
I'm going to group this and control G. We are going to

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:54.585
basically align them with each other like that.

00:08:54.585 --> 00:08:56.670
I'm going to quickly do it.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.750
Skip this step so you understand what we are doing over here.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.790
Here we have all the modules.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.810
We can now use something like this.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.020
We can use three like this,

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:26.200
three modules over here on maybe four columns and three rows over here.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.840
This is how we are going to use.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.055
Basically, we have created few legal blocks over here.

00:09:33.055 --> 00:09:36.300
Let's group them altogether.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.535
Control G and make its opacity 50 percent.

00:09:41.535 --> 00:09:44.500
We can see our grid line,

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.215
our modules are rows.

00:09:49.215 --> 00:09:53.740
This is our grid.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.540
Our document is ready.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.245
You already know that the top portion or the left and the right,

00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:02.065
it is basically the margin.

00:10:02.065 --> 00:10:06.740
We have created 30 pixel baseline grid with modules,

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.685
different portions are rows and columns.

00:10:10.685 --> 00:10:14.210
This is basically modular grid and we are going to use

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.825
it to create three different layout in the next lesson.

00:10:18.825 --> 00:10:25.190
This is how I prepared my design and you should also follow these steps when you

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:31.735
are designing and laying out your websites or typography on mobile apps.

00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:35.390
Let's move on to the next lesson where we are going to create

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:40.260
three different layouts out of these modules.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:44.040
Let's move on to the next lesson.
