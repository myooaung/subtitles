00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
Now let's talk about modern fonts.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.970
These are called basically Bodoni,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.560
and their main characteristic is the stroke width.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.500
The stroke difference is too much,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.660
very slim to very thick.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.115
Then the other one is that this serifs are just like slabs,

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:30.600
very thin strips, whatever I call it.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.320
This is the main property of this Bodoni.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.570
Also, the stress, you can see in the o,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.170
it is very straight, 90-degree.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.640
Now the slab serif or it is also called Egyptian slab.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.240
You can guess that they have serifs just like thick slabs,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.075
and that is why they are called slab serifs.

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:03.905
Here is the most common typeface we use, which is sans-serif.

00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:06.350
Sans-serif have no serifs,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.785
or no slabs, or no ending at the end.

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:16.845
They are very clean and very modern.

00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:20.190
This is all about this sans-serif.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.625
They have a lot of other classes of sans-serifs.

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:27.935
Different typeface designers, they mix the qualities of

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:32.275
old-style or sometimes Humanist touch in the sans-serif font.

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:36.910
Now next is script or handwriting.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.700
They are different types of the script or handwriting fonts,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.475
but I am going to combine all of them in one.

00:01:44.475 --> 00:01:47.905
You might have seen this script or handwriting fonts.

00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:53.100
They are not used much on the web because I

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.100
don't think that if you write a paragraph in script or handwritten font,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.475
and it can easily be read.

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:09.320
Now I told you in the previous slide that sans-serif have a few other alterations,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.300
like this one is humanist sans-serif.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.600
Now you would have guessed that it share the features of

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.840
this humanist type we discussed at the beginning of this lecture.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.430
Humanist sans-serif, you can see,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.215
the top one is Gill Sans.

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:29.095
They have this ending at the a,

00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:34.905
and then they have a bit of stroke difference.

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:39.765
Also, if you look at this Open Sans

00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:44.460
and the slants in the counter in the a are not very geometric.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.330
They are a bit slanty.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.900
If you look at the g, it is also a bit like humanist font.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.780
You can see, I am Open Sans-Serif and I am also Humanist Sans-Serif,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.790
and I look great.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.345
If you look at the g, it is the common factor in all the Humanist Sans-Serif.

00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:06.950
They are a bit like humanist or old-style.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.325
Also, this one another example is this Calibri font,

00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:12.985
Open Sans, Gill Sans.

00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:16.825
They are type of Humanist Sans-Serif.

00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:21.130
That is why you see Open Sans is very popular these days.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.230
One other variation of the sans-serif is Geometric Sans-Serifs,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.760
and they are built on some very specific geometry,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.420
like very specific triangles,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.755
rectangles, or maybe circles.

00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:38.550
They are based on geometry.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.235
You can see here we have the first font,

00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:43.380
a first example is Futura.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.170
You can see the os and the es,

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.705
they are almost a perfect circle.

00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:50.550
Here you can see.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.800
Now if you look at this Proxima Nova font, it is very popular.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.480
It is also geometric.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.500
If you look at its o and es,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.615
they are almost the perfect circle.

00:04:02.615 --> 00:04:05.510
Museo Sans is also geometric.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.640
Where the word geometric is,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.830
you can see how they are built.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.300
The letter c is also built on perfect circle.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.040
Then there is another font at the end, Texta.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.075
It is also a Geometric Sans-Serif.

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:27.350
They might resemble to Humanist or may have some curvy nature,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.460
but they must be built on specific geometric shapes.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.170
It might not be just circles or squares,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.630
it might maybe some deform shape of square or something like that.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.580
This rounds up our Geometric Sans-Serif and all the different classes.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:59.210
I am not going to go into too much detail of showing 16 or 17 different font classes.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.835
I think these are good enough to get you started.

00:05:03.835 --> 00:05:08.410
I will share some of the resources if you want to go ahead more than these,

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.820
like a grotesque and other sans-serif.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.150
In the next lesson, I am going to give you

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.685
an exercise to see how much you can recognize a font.

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:22.955
I might be giving you Geometric,

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.770
Humanist, and other fonts.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.180
This will be samples,

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.805
and let's see how well you do in recognizing different type classes.

00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:35.860
Let's move on to the next lesson.
