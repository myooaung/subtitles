00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
Now, in this lesson we are going to fine tune this design.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.875
Adjust some spacing and whitespace issues which is,

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:12.165
you can say, a very important part of your design.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:16.320
Basically, your design is going to improve and get more attention or

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.835
more shape and form with this whitespace issues.

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:23.850
What I'm going to do is first of all,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.970
this area or this text,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.785
our main headline, we are going to shift it to this top flow line.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:35.055
These are basically called flow lines.

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:39.980
These lines. These are basically modules or spatial areas.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.360
You can see over here,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.750
these are few modules. This is one.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.880
Now, what I'm going to do is I align it at the top along this line.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.215
Now, for this one,

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:58.070
this button, I'm going to align it in the middle of this module.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.975
This area over here,

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:02.910
I'm going to get the middle of it.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.000
This is really helpful.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.050
Why? Because you can see that this is

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.010
taking this whole space and this is taking this whole space.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.980
Now, again, I'm going to repeat this area,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.930
this same patron, and what I'm going to

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.420
do is I'm going to align this along with this, again, flow line.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.035
This is how I aligned my texts perfectly for better spacing.

00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:35.790
Here, we have space like that.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.090
If we can try to improve it,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.895
maybe we can improve it with some more line-height,

00:01:44.895 --> 00:01:48.160
maybe 52, something like this.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.710
Or maybe we can increase this to 38, something like this.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.820
Let's hide the flow lines and our guides and see how it is looking.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.930
Maybe this should be 36.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.970
Thirty eight was looking good.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.625
Let's move it to 54,

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:16.415
let's enable the lines and they are looking good.

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:20.195
The distances between these two are looking great.

00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:22.400
Even if you want to use 48,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.765
still it will look great.

00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:26.605
All the distance will be harmonious.

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:30.750
This is how I treated this area.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.240
Now for this area,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.350
you can see over here,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.760
we need to have same space around over here.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.885
Let's enable our guides and remove this guide over here.

00:02:46.885 --> 00:02:50.955
Also, I'm going to move this guide at the top like this,

00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:54.390
and one guide, I'm going to place over here.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.935
Now, we are going to select this container,

00:02:58.935 --> 00:03:01.950
Control and click or Command click on this,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:12.090
and we are going to use Griddify to get some spacing of 42 around it at the top,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.840
like this, and also from here like this.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.585
I think 42 is looking too much,

00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:23.910
maybe. Let's just try it.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.735
Now, what we are going to do is we are going to align

00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:35.240
our navigation with these lines over here, like that.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.440
So 42 is the space I'm using at the top and at the bottom,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.710
like this, looking good.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.585
Also, I'm going to do the same for this userable.

00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:49.535
I'm going to align it at the cross of this.

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:53.030
Now, you can see how it is looking really cool,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.955
you can see the space around this area.

00:03:55.955 --> 00:03:58.550
It is very manageable, very nice.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.085
This is the benefit of living margins around your design.

00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:04.985
Now, everything seems good.

00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:08.465
There is a bit of small problem which is, you can see,

00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:11.120
this hand is a bit of transparent in

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.080
the background and also in this architecture background behind.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.310
Now, what is happening here is that this phone is

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.010
clipped inside this container and the container is basically opacity of 90 percent.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.889
It is a bit of transparent, 10 percent transparency.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.135
It is taking the properties of this container.

00:04:30.135 --> 00:04:34.050
What we are going to do is we are going to unclick this like that,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.340
and we are going to use a mask.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.505
Command click on this container,

00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:43.495
then go to the phone, and click this.

00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:45.030
So we are done,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.045
we have completed this design.

00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:51.345
If you have any questions, ask me.

00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:56.375
If you want further exercises or something you have in mind,

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:57.995
you can message me.

00:04:57.995 --> 00:04:59.840
If something looks good,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.870
I will really try to update this course.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.690
I'm going to add one more exercise to this course and then

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.480
I'm going to stop because I have almost

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.580
conveyed a lot of design tips and techniques related to spacing and grid usage.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.760
If you have any further questions,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.055
ask me. Let me know.

00:05:19.055 --> 00:05:21.454
If you are facing any problems,

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:24.665
you can go ahead and ask me any time.

00:05:24.665 --> 00:05:29.390
If needed, you can set up a video conference call with me.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.655
One of the students already did that.

00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:35.700
So let's move on to the next lesson.
