00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
In this lesson, we are going to improve the last lesson we did ours in section one.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.015
This is the lesson we did in section one.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:14.280
Now what we're going to do is we are going to apply the skills we have learned,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.635
typographic skills we will apply on that.

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:24.915
Then we will apply baseline grid to this design and line-height and everything.

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:26.535
Let's get started.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:30.285
This is our blog article from the previous lesson,

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:34.050
so let's save it as another file.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.980
Maybe fixed or something like this.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.970
Now first of all,

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.580
we are going to use this site which is gridlover.net and our base font size is 20 pixels,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.920
line height, I'm going to use 1.6,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.470
scale factor is 1.3.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:00.300
Scale factors basically means how much the difference from one heading to the another.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.620
Our font size scaling difference. This is the ratio.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.315
I'm using very low ratio.

00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:09.330
Don't mix this line height with the scale factor.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.350
Scale factor is different,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.590
line height is different.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.790
So 20 multiplied by 1.6 is 32,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.925
so our line height will be 32.

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:22.695
First let's apply the line height to this page or this design.

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:26.720
What I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate this background.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.250
First we are going to quickly apply the pattern.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.850
In the previous lessons, I have told you how to create this pattern,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.150
so I don't want to repeat it again.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.245
I have already created a pattern for this 32 pixels.

00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:48.055
I'm going to apply it to this document.

00:01:48.055 --> 00:01:53.405
You can see this document is not fitting well at the top and the bottom.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:57.095
What we're going to do is we're going to edit the image size.

00:01:57.095 --> 00:02:03.650
Let's see, divide 800 by 32 and it is 25,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.600
so it is almost perfect.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.550
Let's get started.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.880
Let's shift the background a bit up.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.220
Zoom it, 1, 2,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.605
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:19.550
This looks perfect.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.955
Now it is fitting our pattern overlay of 32 pixels is fitting.

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:28.280
If you don't remember how to create this,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.280
see the section one,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.535
I have created this for you.

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:35.480
Now first of all, now we are going to shift

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.415
the settings and sizes for our text and everything.

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:41.940
This is our text.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.995
First we are going to use 20 pixels because 20 pixels is our baseline size.

00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:52.235
Let's go to 20 pixels and line height was 1.6,

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:55.670
so it is equal to 32 points.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.340
Let's shift that to 32 points.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.390
Let's move our text according to the baseline lines over here, grid over here.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.510
This is how it looks.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.220
Let's move the Thursday.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.470
Thursday size is 18.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.475
Now here we have the problem.

00:03:17.475 --> 00:03:22.925
We need another scale which shows our small text too.

00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:28.715
We are going to use modular scale and 20 pixels and 1.3.

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:30.440
This is already I have saved,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.020
so enter 20 pixels, 1.3 ratio.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.300
I am going to see the size smaller than this 20 pixels, it is 15.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.480
If you want, you can use 15 over here like this,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.855
15 points and move it above and below this heading.

00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:51.650
Now, why I use this one?

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.760
Because this grid level doesn't show me the size for the small text.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.130
If you go to this code,

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.100
you cannot see any small text over here.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.515
Heading five is 20 pixels and no size is below 20 pixels.

00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:10.130
We need a size which is below 20 pixels,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.740
so I shift it to this modular scale.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.390
Now if you see our font sizes is 20,

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.350
26, 34, and 44.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.760
Same is over here.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.820
You can see heading one is 44 pixels.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.150
You can see over here font size 44 pixels,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.365
then we have 34,

00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:29.700
then we have 26, and 20.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.140
Scale is the same,

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.590
just we don't have the small size calculation over here.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.790
Our next step will be to size this heading perfectly.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.830
We are going to use maybe 57 or 44.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.350
You can decide whatever you want to use.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.830
I will go with this 44 pixels.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.960
Now I'm going to select this heading and let's set it to 44 pixels.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.550
This is how it's looking right now.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.890
Let's add few more text to it so it fits on two lines.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.575
We do not want to leave a second one or two letters at the end.

00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:17.680
It is not a very good typography practice.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.840
Size is 44. Now I am going to set the line height to 44

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.350
too because I want just one equal to line height, one for headings.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.610
If you remember my last tutorial or lesson,

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.985
you might remember that line height for heading is almost 100 percent or 110 percent,

00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:40.590
so it's closer to 100 percent.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:49.865
You can see I am using these three lines over here to balance this heading.

00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:54.710
You can see I am using these three lines,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.190
so let's align it a bit more at the down.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.700
Let's have the size of this one equal to 20 pixels,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.230
so it is easily readable.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.120
We are not looking for too much variety.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.640
We need the user to read it and everything is set right now.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.745
I guess just we are going to change the size of this one.

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:23.900
Height is 15, so we make it equal to eight,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.620
which is also related to our baseline size and we

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:34.500
just place it in the middle of the C like this.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.270
One more thing. In the previous lesson,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.590
we applied this grid line,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:45.490
so make sure your elements are aligned to this grid line.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.985
If you don't remember how to create this grid line, go to View,

00:06:49.985 --> 00:06:53.745
New Guide Layout, and then use eight columns,

00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:57.325
30 pixel gutter and everything else.

00:06:57.325 --> 00:06:58.540
Just leave it margins.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.755
If you don't want margin,

00:06:59.755 --> 00:07:03.120
just leave them like this and press Okay.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.185
You will generate something similar to me.

00:07:05.185 --> 00:07:07.900
Eight columns, 30 pixel gutter,

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.560
and up till now I think you might not know

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.010
what gutter is because it will be in the next lesson.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.550
So don't worry about it.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.960
Just keep the settings like this.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.970
I enabled my grid with

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:32.755
this control columns to see where my things are lined up.

00:07:32.755 --> 00:07:36.120
This orange bar is lined up accurately.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.490
Everything else is looking great.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.434
This is our first milestone.

00:07:42.434 --> 00:07:47.975
Let's hide the pattern overlay and see how our document is looking.

00:07:47.975 --> 00:07:49.865
It is looking really nice.

00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:53.974
The spacing between elements is great, everything looks fine.

00:07:53.974 --> 00:08:01.495
We have applied typographic scale and baseline to enhance our designs.

00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:04.380
Now the second step.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.580
Second step is that if you see closely

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.820
between these two paragraph and the lower paragraphs,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.845
I think it's a bit bigger space between all these paragraphs.

00:08:15.845 --> 00:08:18.850
Why not make them closer?

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.950
We are going to Control J in this text.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.640
This is our old text,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.360
so I'm going to duplicate this layer.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:36.270
What we are going to do is we are going to remove one space or return over here.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.855
I pressed Enter or return over here.

00:08:38.855 --> 00:08:41.260
Now they are lined up.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:47.600
Now select the first line and see what's the line height is it's 32.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.825
We need something between 48 or 64.

00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:52.550
The next step is 64,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.780
but we will divide our baseline to half,

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.800
so half the baseline is 16 points.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.255
I'm adding 32 plus 16, so it's 48.

00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:09.740
I'm going to shift this to 48 rather than 64,

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.735
which was the previous setting.

00:09:11.735 --> 00:09:14.650
Also this one to 48.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.690
I will show you the difference once it is finished.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:23.070
Let me enable the pattern overlay for our baseline grid.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.500
This is our baseline grid.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:32.000
You can see over here that our baseline is getting off beat like in music,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.200
but as soon as it goes to the next point it is again inside the pattern.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.400
It is again lined up to our baseline grid.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:51.550
Why? Because our baseline scale which is 48 points is basically, what's it is?

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:58.200
It's basically 1.5 times our baseline size, so 32.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.320
Let's tell you the secret over here,

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.140
32 multiplied by 1.5, 48.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:09.480
Whenever you try to go off beat just go something like this,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.640
multiply it with 1.5 or 1.25,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.190
32 multiply by 1.25, something like this.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.955
1.25 and 40, it might also go well,

00:10:25.955 --> 00:10:28.835
but I think 1.5 is good enough.

00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:37.135
This is how we used our baseline grid and this is the previous text.

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:41.195
This one is previous and this one is a bit shifted up.

00:10:41.195 --> 00:10:47.855
Over here you can see a bit less gap between paragraphs and it is looking very nice.

00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:54.330
This is the secrets of line height and scales,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.240
typographic scales, baseline grid.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.430
Also if you count the words in this line,

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:06.440
I think they are closer to something like maybe 70 characters.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.665
I think it's closer to 70 or 80 maybe.

00:11:09.665 --> 00:11:12.790
It's I think optimal line length.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.505
I don't want to waste your time counting over here.

00:11:16.505 --> 00:11:21.950
This is how we applied our line height with two different methods.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.860
One is using perfect line height,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.290
which is 32 pixels or 32 points.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.470
Then we went a bit offbeat with multiplying

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:35.650
our line height to 1.5 by shifting two paragraphs closer to each other.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.605
These are two techniques we did.

00:11:37.605 --> 00:11:41.000
I hope you guys liked this exercise,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.230
download its files from the resources,

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:48.645
and see you soon with more at such exercises.

00:11:48.645 --> 00:11:51.255
This is another challenge for you,

00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:54.655
try to replicate what I did over here.

00:11:54.655 --> 00:12:02.510
Let's see what you can come up with and hope to see your designs very soon.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.340
Let's move on to the next lesson.
