00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
In this lesson about responsive typography,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.995
we are going to look at the first example we saw in our previous lecture,

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:13.920
the percentage value change for the HTML element to control the font size.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.799
Now this is the file we were using in our previous examples.

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:22.305
Let me show you what are the settings we have.

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:26.400
Font size which is 18 pixels, gridlover.net.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.940
We are using these settings,1.5 line height,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.595
and scale factor is 1.44.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:41.040
What I did is I copied this REM code from here to the CSS file.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.605
This is the same CSS file.

00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:46.850
There are few things I did with it.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.445
One, is that I imported normalize,

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.940
always try to import this normalize to reset

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.785
your CSS styles or default styles from your browser and everything else.

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:00.230
So this is a must-have,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.009
always include this in your projects.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.590
Second one is this meta viewport.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.830
You should have this one for your mobile screens or devices, small devices.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.815
This is our style sheet and this is how it is right now looking.

00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:22.595
Let me show you this one.

00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:25.810
Let's open it in the browser.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.620
Here we have, you can see at the right side it is showing large screen.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.195
How I did it,

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:35.750
I used body:after tag.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.510
If you are not familiar with these pseudo tags or pseudo elements of HTML,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.415
you should study about them.

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:49.090
Type in Google or W3C website to learn about them.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.700
This is basically adding a button after my body tags.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.535
So this is how it is showing over here.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:02.555
It's position is fixed and text-align center.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:06.230
Basically, I am displaying a button after the body.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.350
So as my body elements started,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.990
this one keep showing after that.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.200
So these are all the settings.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.235
This is the background color.

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:20.345
Why I am using it?

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:21.830
Because, let me show you,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.110
if I switch to my responsive view,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.815
you can see as the screen goes too small,

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:30.830
it changes the text and the color for small.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.850
I used it for the testing purpose of our responsive topography.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.695
This is medium screen and this is large.

00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:41.090
Here we have like this.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.055
You can see small,

00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:44.730
medium, and then large.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.450
Let's make it a bit bigger.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.435
Now, this is one thing,

00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:53.610
how I have achieved it fast?

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.960
I declared this body in my simple normal CSS.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.430
Then I went to this media query at media only screen maximum width 600 pixels.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.810
At this point, any screen that is 600 pixels or less than 600 pixels,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.960
I am adding a content of small to this body: after tag and background color is this one.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.850
This one is a bit greenish.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.950
This is a very small snippet I picked from a guy online.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.890
I am not sure remembering what his name was,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.135
but it's very handy tool when you have to test your media queries.

00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:38.030
This is all set.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.730
Right now, our font size doesn't change.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.835
If you go to medium or small screen,

00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:47.510
you can see if I go to this small screen size,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.370
which is like 360,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.160
something like that, it is not changing at all.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.080
So the heading is you can see one letter, sorry,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.670
one word per line,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.790
it is looking very strange to me.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.170
I guess it shouldn't be looking like this.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.610
Now, what we are going to do is,

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.205
let me see if the correct file is open in the browser.

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.215
Yes, it's the same one.

00:04:18.215 --> 00:04:23.689
Now what we are going to do is we are going to use another scale,

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:27.470
sorry, a percentage for our HTML documents.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.745
What I did is, I copied all this code.

00:04:31.745 --> 00:04:37.790
Let's copy it again just to make sure that you pick up everything.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.975
So "Copy" this and I am going to paste it in my style.css like that.

00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:48.280
Just delete everything else I had before.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.455
Not this body: after tag and Control V. This is what I am using.

00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:57.930
Just refresh the file,

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.100
and you can see these are the settings I was using.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:10.160
You can see here I have some issues with the margin bottom at this heading 1,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.840
let's ignore it right now.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.810
Now the first change we are going to do is,

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.580
we are going to write up our HTML model because we need to control the elements.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.090
So HTML, and we are going to use font size and line height into this one.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.160
I'm going to use rather than 1.25 REM,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.320
I am going to use 18 pixels.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.255
This is our base font,

00:05:35.255 --> 00:05:41.130
and the line height is going to be 27 pixels.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.310
So first step is,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.640
I am going to remove this font size from my body to this HTML element,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.515
and we have saved this let's refresh it.

00:05:53.515 --> 00:05:56.650
Nothing is going to change.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.200
Let's change this margin bottom equal to this margin top for

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.660
the heading one it is looking very different from my perspective.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:23.535
Now it's better. Also you can see in this area over here,

00:06:23.535 --> 00:06:25.500
this heading 2 tag,

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.230
it has a lot of line height,

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.690
which is this one.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.420
Let's make the line height equal to this,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.615
equal to this font size,

00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:43.480
which is two point something like this.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:50.760
It's better now. These are the few adjustments I made.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.670
I used my inner guts feeling or whatever you call it,

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.565
to ensure that everything looks fine.

00:06:58.565 --> 00:07:01.190
Now if we step to the small,

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.230
and medium, and then large,

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:09.540
it is showing very big font on the small screen, I guess.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.000
Let's see what is the size of this font.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.465
I think it will be 61 pixels before we go to compute it.

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:20.220
Yes, it's 61, 60.75,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.409
which is 61 pixels.

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:25.780
So let's ignore it right now.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:34.690
Now we are going to use our HTML percentage to control the size on the screen sizes.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:41.270
So we are going to copy this code and we are going to this media only screen.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.020
I am going to paste it inside this,

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.945
because this one is related to- let's move it over here.

00:07:49.945 --> 00:07:53.930
I am going to paste it over here like that.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.665
Now, for the small screens,

00:07:59.665 --> 00:08:08.490
we are going to shift our font size to 80 percent or maybe 85, 80 percent.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.160
Let's set it to 80 percent.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.750
For our medium screens,

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.915
we are going to use system medium,

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:22.620
we are going to use 90 percent.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:28.905
Let's see how this looks or feels.

00:08:28.905 --> 00:08:36.420
Yeah. Now on the small screen you can see we have at least two words on us,

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.475
a single line and it is looking better than before.

00:08:40.475 --> 00:08:44.575
Before it was only single word on one line,

00:08:44.575 --> 00:08:47.660
and it was taking up a lot of screen on the medium,

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.770
you can see the size is going to shift up.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:58.020
You can see how the size is changing on the different screen sizes.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:09.695
The problem with this technique is you can see that the paragraph font size also shifts,

00:09:09.695 --> 00:09:16.430
and it looks a bit smaller on your small screen.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.245
So if you want to adjust that,

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:22.760
you can adjust your paragraph font size over here like that.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.800
Font size, 120 percent.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.060
Increase the size because your HTML is already decreasing it.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.225
Let's copy, sorry.

00:09:35.225 --> 00:09:39.200
We have to paste it over here, like that.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.910
So let's see how it is going to look like. Now it's better.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.970
You can see over here,

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.775
at the medium screen,

00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:49.365
it is looking better.

00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:51.935
On the small screen, again,

00:09:51.935 --> 00:09:56.105
our paragraph size is better than before.

00:09:56.105 --> 00:10:01.030
This is a quick fix for your responsive typography,

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:05.445
and if you don't know about media queries,

00:10:05.445 --> 00:10:07.970
you read about them or learn about them.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.920
It is not very difficult.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:17.145
Let's see what is the effect of this.

00:10:17.145 --> 00:10:24.060
So this is how we use percentage values for our HTML,

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:29.405
sorry, HTML font size and different elements like I have used on paragraph.

00:10:29.405 --> 00:10:33.800
You can also target your heading tags like H1, H2,

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.140
H3, H4 and size them using percentage values.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.635
I think it's a very neat technique.

00:10:42.635 --> 00:10:49.705
But the problem is with these margins,

00:10:49.705 --> 00:10:55.215
they are going to look the same on all the screens like you can see over here.

00:10:55.215 --> 00:10:57.380
So if you want to adjust them,

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.070
we need the second technique.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:05.620
I am going to include all these files in the resources,

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.975
so make sure your download them and see the code yourself.

00:11:08.975 --> 00:11:11.584
If you get into any problem,

00:11:11.584 --> 00:11:15.740
if you don't understand anything, just ask questions.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.745
Don't bother about it.

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:22.940
I am going to answer any of your dumbest question.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.755
So don't resist, don't worry, just ask.

00:11:26.755 --> 00:11:29.660
So let's move on to the second technique,

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:36.200
which is we are going to use two different typographic scales for different screens.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.900
Let's move on to the next lesson.
