00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.550
Now next stop is effect of color on typefaces.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.120
Now, you can see in the previous lesson,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.575
I have shown you different typeface modes.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:18.615
So color have a create effect on typeface mode.

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:24.060
If you are using a color which is very different from your theme,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.960
it can really change or alter its mood or voice.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.465
You can see, can you run like a cheetah?

00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:37.005
I'm using cheetah colors and a bit of a brown color which is related to ground,

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.650
maybe sand, or something like this.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.070
Then you can see in the next line, 69 push-ups,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.780
I'm using grayish-black color,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.395
which is related to toughness or something similar.

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:51.360
Then in the elephant line, I'm using color,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.160
which is related to elephant and slim is the main focal points,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.715
so I'm using red color that you can get slim.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:00.830
Fantasy is related to purple color,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.700
it's magic, it's spiritual.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.730
Or something like this,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.630
so I am using purple color for fantasy football is here.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.860
So when you are designing or choosing typeface,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.805
make sure you choose the right color for the right team,

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:21.510
and don't get too much into these colors.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.565
If you are already using a single color for your headings,

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:29.225
use them on your typeface for headings.

00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:32.285
If you have another color for your body text,

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:34.600
use that on your body texts.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.035
So don't fix your mind,

00:01:37.035 --> 00:01:38.940
try to select two different colors,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.475
maybe you might have a different color for your subheading or tagline,

00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:47.745
and a different color for your heading,

00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:50.095
so something like this.

00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:55.910
Let me show you a few examples from my work where I have used this color.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.370
You can see over here menthol flavor.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.020
I'm using menthol color for this one and you can see here we have

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.560
three traditional tobacco flavor where I'm using brown color for this tobacco flavor.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.585
Also you can see these boxes are also the same color which I'm using over here.

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:20.870
You can see here I have heading, then a subheading,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.320
then these are section headings,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.810
and we have two features like this one in this product.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.675
So this is one example of using colors with your typeface.

00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:36.835
Let's see if I can find another one,

00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:39.630
another example over here.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.740
Here we have another example,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.175
you can see I am using three colors over here for different icons on the left,

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.700
in the middle, and the right side.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.560
I am using the same color for each step,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.255
like for this one, our step number 1, 2, 3.

00:02:58.255 --> 00:03:00.345
This is how I'm using two colors.

00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:05.860
Then again, I'm using over here two colors for showing some interest like,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.325
let us help you acquire,

00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:13.030
and then the number for calling is in different color just to emphasize it.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.745
Now you can see here I'm using again two colors,

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:19.445
one is for heading and second is

00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:25.180
a bit grayish color because I don't want it to be very prominent.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.780
Again, here I'm using A+ rating with Better Business Bureau in

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.060
red because I wanted to highlight it or make it more powerful,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.705
maybe look more powerful.

00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:43.640
So this is how I'm using different colors on different typefaces.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:52.105
So this is all about how to use colors for different typefaces.

00:03:52.105 --> 00:03:56.850
So let's move on to the next lesson.
