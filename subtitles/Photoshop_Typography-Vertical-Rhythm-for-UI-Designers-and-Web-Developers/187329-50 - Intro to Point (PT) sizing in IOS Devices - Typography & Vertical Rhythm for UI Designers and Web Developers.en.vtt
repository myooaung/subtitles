00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.460
First of all you need to understand what are these points sizes

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.755
because all the sizes for iPhone design are in points.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.140
So you need to understand two concepts here.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.530
One is points and one is this 1x, 2x,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.545
and 3x, so it's called basically pixel density.

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:23.495
Now, the original iPhone when it came,

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:27.515
it had small screen and the pixel density was 1x,

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:34.399
so it means that if the iPhone specifications are 320 by 480,

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.740
it means same should be in the pixels.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.750
If you see below,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.625
it is translated into pixels.

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:44.655
So 1x means that it is the same,

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:46.470
and what are points?

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.720
Points are basically relative measuring units for Android.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.255
They have different DPs and SPs and for iPhone it's points.

00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:59.130
This is the screen size,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.555
320 is the width,

00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:02.730
480 is the height.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.375
Now, if you come to iPhone,

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.565
which is iPhone 5,

00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:13.025
you can see 320 width is same and the 568 is the height.

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:16.730
Now, if you see actual pixel sizes,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.670
its actual pixel size is double its points.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.255
So 320 multiply by 2 is equal to 640,

00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:27.765
568 multiplied by 2 is equal to 1,136.

00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:34.935
Now one point is basically equal to two pixels.

00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:38.610
Here we had in the original iPhone,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.350
one point is equal to one pixel,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.500
now we have one point equal to two pixels.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.910
This goes on until we reach this iPhone 6 plus,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.220
which have 414 points.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.815
So 414 multiplied by 3,

00:01:52.815 --> 00:01:54.915
so it is 3x.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:57.980
Each point contains 3 pixels,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.830
so each point is equal to 3 pixels,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.930
so it is 1242 pixels actual,

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.120
and it is down-sampled by iPhone 6 device to

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.800
87 percent to be at 1080 by 1920 high-definition size.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.585
Keep in mind all this relation that we have points,

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:26.330
which are actually iPhones own relative measurement units.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.385
So everything will be in points,

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:30.080
even your text size,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.160
which we will be discussing in the next lecture will be in points.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.900
If you are designing for like this size,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.900
320 by 480 in Photoshop,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.920
you don't have to change any of your font size.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.170
You should use the same font size and it will be 320 by

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.550
480 because your pixels and points match.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.190
So if you try to design for iPhone 5,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.040
then your points will be different.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.819
Also in this, because our pixels,

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.080
now pixels have different ratio in this screen.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.270
Here we have doubled the pixels,

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.230
here we have tripled the pixels in the same screen.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.680
So before designing any iPhone app or anything,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.600
you should understand all this relation between points and pixels.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.445
Here's another very good screen size explanation by this Kyle guy.

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:29.825
I found it online.

00:03:29.825 --> 00:03:31.375
Kyle Larson.

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:34.310
You can see here is the actual screen size,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.625
5.5 inch, then we have screen size in points,

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:45.500
multiply by 3x, and the rendered pixels should be 1,242 by 2,208 pixels.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.920
Then it is down-sampled by physical pixels,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.480
which is device pixel,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.280
on device they are going to be displayed 1080 by 1920.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.155
This is how all this points and points is converted into actual pixels.

00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:08.540
This is the pixels we are going to design for 1,242 by 2,208.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.120
Here is a relative comparison in Photoshop,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.825
so I'm going to share this PSD file with you,

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:16.265
so don't worry about it.

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:19.090
These are four different artboards.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.505
If you don't know about artboards,

00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:27.090
you should see my other course on UI design for beginners.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.120
This is original iPhone,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.740
this is 320 pixels.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.740
So I'm just right now calculating the width.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.500
I'm not showing any height.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.290
So 320 pixels on original iPhone is 320 points.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.930
So this is the screen size.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.130
Then on iPhone 5, we have 2x,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.590
so it is almost a double.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.035
So 320 points, but the screen size on our Photoshop document is 640 pixels width.

00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:56.660
Then we have 375 points and 750 pixel width, it is a double.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.800
Then on iPhone 6 Plus,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.585
this is iPhone 6 Plus,

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:03.750
so we have 1,242 pixels,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.675
which is down-sample to 1,080 pixels.

00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:10.485
Actual point size is 414 points.

00:05:10.485 --> 00:05:14.600
Let me show you an example in Photoshop on how we are going

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.605
to scale all these things, all these screens.

00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:23.270
First we are going to open up the first screen, original iPhone.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.750
The standard is to design using this screen.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.980
So it is 1x.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.820
So always design in 1x rather than 2x or 3x.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.615
So I'm going to click over here.

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:38.460
This is our art board.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.890
So I'm going to use Sensitive Compact Display,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.935
semi-bold, 32 points says my heading.

00:05:46.935 --> 00:05:51.280
This is my heading.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.250
Let's put some dummy text over here.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.310
Let's put the dummy text.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:08.175
I'm going to put 16 points over here and I'm going to use type, paste Lorem Ipsum.

00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:12.825
Let's adjust its line height to 24.

00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:21.350
Let's change the color so it doesn't look that different from our heading.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.350
Now we have set up this artboard,

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.230
which is our original iPhone.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.560
Now, how we are going to design our second screen or third screen,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.480
so go to this image size.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:44.255
You can easily double it up 640 and make sure everything is selected like this.

00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:46.625
This is on lock.

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:48.800
So these two are locked.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.075
They are going to increase with each other.

00:06:52.075 --> 00:06:55.040
Resolution will be 72 pixels,

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.835
the same resample plus click "Okay".

00:06:57.835 --> 00:07:01.200
Now, this is our iPhone 5 screen,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.835
so it is 2x.

00:07:02.835 --> 00:07:05.250
I multiplied it to 2x.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.650
You can see here 640 x 960.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.730
Our actual height is different,

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.895
but don't worry about it right now.

00:07:12.895 --> 00:07:15.480
Now, let's check the font sizes.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.175
I have double-clicked this font,

00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:18.455
it is 32 points.

00:07:18.455 --> 00:07:24.565
You can see Photoshop has automatically doubled my font size.

00:07:24.565 --> 00:07:27.960
Before it was 16 points for my text,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.540
now it is 32 points.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.440
Make sure this is how the scaling is happening.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:43.140
If I revert back to original size and I go to the third 3x,

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:50.085
and so what I need over here is 3x means 320 by,

00:07:50.085 --> 00:07:54.255
it was something like 1,080 maybe.

00:07:54.255 --> 00:07:57.000
It was 1,242.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.765
So I'm going to use 1,242 and press "Okay".

00:08:00.765 --> 00:08:05.290
This is my iPhone 6 plus screen.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.155
Let's see how the sizes have been.

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:18.720
So you can see my heading size has been increased to 124 points and my deck size is 62.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.850
I think it should be 64 actually.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:29.495
Now the problem is between this multiplication of these four sizes.

00:08:29.495 --> 00:08:37.075
What is happening here is that Photoshop is trying to multiply and adjust our font sizes.

00:08:37.075 --> 00:08:42.295
Make sure your font sizes are multiples of two.

00:08:42.295 --> 00:08:49.230
If they are multiplied by three or something like two or three,

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.970
there should be a whole value.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:09:02.330
Now, 16 should be 3 multiplied by 3,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.040
16 threes are 48.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.515
I guess it is the correct size.

00:09:06.515 --> 00:09:08.954
Then for the heading,

00:09:08.954 --> 00:09:18.300
it should be 32 multiplied by 3 is 96,

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.580
so it should be 96.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:27.825
This is our heading and it should be 96 points.

00:09:27.825 --> 00:09:29.730
Something like this.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.440
No, I don't know why Photoshop has scaled it differently,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.800
but there is another way to scale this.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.770
I'm going to change everything back to my original size,

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.965
which is this one.

00:09:45.965 --> 00:09:50.075
Now I have downloaded some actions

00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:54.560
which are related to scaling by B Django scale actions.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.600
You can see over here.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.920
If you don't know how to install the actions,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.720
you should watch my other course where I have discussed all the basics of Photoshop.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.380
Now, let's scale it to 300 percent.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.265
I'm selecting this and play it.

00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:11.200
This is how it has been scaled to 300 percent.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.480
Now you can see the sizes are perfect,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.670
so I'm preferring that you should use these actions.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.820
I will include the link to scale up or scale down.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.060
So let's scale it down like that.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:33.260
Now, this is all about points and pixels and how we are going to

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:39.815
use different types sizes and how they shift from one size to another.

00:10:39.815 --> 00:10:49.200
This is how we are multiplying our size when we are designing in what resolution?

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.990
Seventy two pixels per inch.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.340
There is another way which I will be discussing in

00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:00.685
the next few lessons that how to adjust different font sizes.

00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:07.855
We will be using 144 and 216 pixels resolution per inch over here.

00:11:07.855 --> 00:11:14.540
For this lesson, I just wanted you to get an understanding of how these pixels and points

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:20.405
work with each other and how we are going to scale our 1x design,

00:11:20.405 --> 00:11:27.170
which was, this one

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:31.400
was actual design which was on 320 x 480.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:41.490
We upscaled it in 200 percent and 300 percent and try to use these B Django actions.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.235
These are really great actions.

00:11:44.235 --> 00:11:48.180
This is all about scaling, and point type,

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.420
and physical pixels and points,

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:57.375
and rendering at 2x or 3x Retina or 3x Retina, whatever it is.

00:11:57.375 --> 00:12:01.390
Let's move on to the next lesson.
