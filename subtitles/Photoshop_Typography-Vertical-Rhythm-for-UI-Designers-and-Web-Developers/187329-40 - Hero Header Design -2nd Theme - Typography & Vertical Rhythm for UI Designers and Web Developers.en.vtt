00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Now, in this lesson we are going to design something similar to this one.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.565
It is very elegant and very powerful looking business website

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:16.170
or business to business website with a lot of solutions provided to other companies.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.540
So from the last lesson,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.660
we are going to convert our last exercise into this one.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.170
First, let me show you what are the fonts and colors I'm using.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.680
You can see that the dominant color is red over here,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.500
and the background is a bit of textured, this architecture.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.940
Now you can see the whole theme has been changed by

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.380
just changing the background and few colors and few fonts.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.790
So this is how we are going to create and use our design thinking or

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:57.205
typography combinations and to convert one design into another totally different theme.

00:00:57.205 --> 00:01:00.030
Calculations, height and width,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.260
everything is the same,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.750
just I have changed through fonts,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.995
which is basically topography and few images over here which reflects this organization.

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:13.835
So this is how you convert one theme to another.

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:19.650
Let me show you some of the fonts and resources I'm using in this lesson.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.860
Now the font I am using for the logo is this ARCHIVE TYPEFACE. I really love it.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.525
It is very bold, very thick,

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:31.625
and very techno-side or maybe you can say technology-based,

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:35.255
very rounded and straight.

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:38.465
Then we have this Clear Sans.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.970
It is modern Sans Serif,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.790
I guess, and it has some curves in it.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.525
I'm using Clear Sans for smaller text.

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:50.630
Then this is a premium font I'm using,

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.010
which is Amsi Pro.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.670
I bought it, I think a year ago at that time it was

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.500
launched and I think I got it for maybe 26 or $30.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.580
Right now it's for $300.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.760
So I'm going to give you one other alternative for this one if you don't have this one.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.950
Here is an alternative for this Amsi Pro.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.270
If you don't have this Amsi Pro,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.060
you can use this Google font which is Muli.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.215
You can use light version or extra light version of it for the text.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:24.590
So I'm going to show you the document we're going to design.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.945
So here is our Amsi Pro,

00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:28.595
and here is Muli.

00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:31.190
So I am showing you both examples.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.340
You will not notice much of the difference.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.810
So what I did is actually I selected this font,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.765
some of the text over here and I used Photoshop's newest thing which is this match font.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:47.610
When I match this font,

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.430
I found Muli over here.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.300
So it was very close.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.010
I think it will take some time to match fonts.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.975
So give it some time and if you have a similar font or mine, you can go ahead.

00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:03.930
You can see here are few fonts it has matched.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.990
Also, I went to Google fonts to see by my eyes which font is going to help,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.555
and it was this Muli.

00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:14.580
So you can use Muli over here.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.445
It is very elegant, very unique.

00:03:17.445 --> 00:03:20.410
So you can use Muli instead of Amsi Pro.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.360
So in this example I'm going to use Amsi pro.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.505
It has some curves and very nice rounded curves around it, around the text.

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:30.245
So I really love this.

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:32.510
So for this area,

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.375
we are using Clear Sans,

00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:36.165
this is also Clear Sans,

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:38.445
this is also Clear Sans.

00:03:38.445 --> 00:03:44.540
For this logo, we are using archive and few colors over here,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.200
I have already assembled them.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.890
So let's get started and see what we can come up with in this design session.
