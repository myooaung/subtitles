00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820
Today we are going to learn how to use Bootstrap custom typographic scale,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.040
so how to edit base font and other things for Bootstrap.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.850
Now one thing you should know that Bootstrap really sucks

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.990
at vertical rhythm because there are too many elements,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.550
and paddings, and everything.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.285
You can't change everything over here.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.385
Also it is responsive,

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:31.065
so it is going to cater for different screens and different sizes

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:38.385
so you should use default typographic scale which Bootstrap already have.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:44.010
What I did, I just downloaded Bootstrap and get started Bootstrap.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.525
Right now it's version 3.3.6.

00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:52.550
Now if you want to download the source,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.105
you can download the source in Sass or Less. I use Less.

00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:58.310
Sass and Less, if you don't know,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.980
they are basically CSS pre-compressors.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.340
If you don't know them already,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.220
you should start learning any of them, Sass or Less.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.400
Sass is a bit more popular and Less is a bit less,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.620
but they are also almost the same.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.920
Now you can click over here and download the source.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.085
You can use both of it.

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:23.270
If you want Less, you can download Less or this one.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.980
I downloaded this one,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.380
and I extracted it over here.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.285
The folder I really need is this Less.

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:35.655
This is the folder I need.

00:01:35.655 --> 00:01:38.940
I just copied this folder and

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.925
included it in this blog post or typographic scale document.

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:48.925
Both are using all these Less files.

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:52.425
Let me show you how all this is working.

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:57.105
Now here we have our HTML file,

00:01:57.105 --> 00:02:05.310
and you can see here I have link rel="stylesheet/less," so I am using "less.js".

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.235
You can see at the bottom or here script type, JavaScript and CDN.

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:15.150
This is the "less.js" you need to include to let

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.390
the last script or code to compile it to CSS.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.370
If you don't know about Less,

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.520
just go to this "less.js" and read about it.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.935
It's very easy, as you can see over here.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.895
It's not difficult to use.

00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:38.810
You just need to include one line of code into your front end and,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.905
and you can change the style sheet rel to this stylesheet/less rather than CSS,

00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:48.865
and you start using Less files.

00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:55.720
Here I have this less/bootstrap file, imported over here.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.595
I think I imported it twice,

00:02:57.595 --> 00:03:00.650
so let's just remove this one.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.150
Let's open it in the browser,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.420
and see everything is working fine.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.870
We have this Heading level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.805
and this paragraph font, and this one.

00:03:14.805 --> 00:03:21.900
Let's see how I have used this custom sizes for my fonts.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.045
First thing is that we already know this gridlover.net,

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:29.150
and I am using again the same setting,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.385
18, line-height 1.5, scale factor 1.44.

00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:38.595
Now what we need from here is these em values of these fonts.

00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:43.865
Turn this to em, and we are going to use them in Bootstrap.

00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:46.190
So let's open up Bootstrap files.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.820
Basically the main file you need to include over here from

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.730
this Less folder is this bootstrap.less file.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.365
It has all different file imports,

00:03:58.365 --> 00:04:04.225
and the files we are going to change are these "variables.less",

00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:09.410
and another one, if you really need to mess with it, is this "type.less".

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.040
I recommend that don't mess this "type.less".

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.585
It has other settings.

00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:18.020
Just we are going to this "variables.less",

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.355
and go to this section where we have typography,

00:04:22.355 --> 00:04:24.415
font, line-height, and color.

00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:27.075
Now for the font family Sans Serif.

00:04:27.075 --> 00:04:28.400
If you want some other font,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.180
like I wanted to have Source Sans Pro,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.365
I changed it to Source Sans Pro,

00:04:33.365 --> 00:04:40.175
and I also imported this Source Sans Pro in my HTML documents so we can use it over here.

00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:45.075
Then font family Serif is this one, font family mono-space.

00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:49.340
Now font family base is basically our font family Sans Serif,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.765
so our base font is basically this one, Source Sans Pro.

00:04:52.765 --> 00:04:56.300
They are replacing values with these variables.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.939
It is not very difficult to understand.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.735
Now font base size was 18 pixels,

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.130
as we see over here.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.240
It's 18 pixel.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.470
I set it to 18 pixel.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.820
These are different functions,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.450
ceil and floor, to round up these values.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.460
You can use any of them.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.530
One rounds up to the next digit,

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.640
and one to the previous.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.450
You can check it out if you want to change it.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.625
Now how this value is coming,

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.725
this is basically my scale.

00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:31.400
1.44 is my scale.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:39.749
You can also use this Modularscale to get all these values,

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.080
so I'm going to use this one.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.630
Let me show you how to use this one,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:54.570
18 pixels and our ratio is 1.44.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.665
This is our first font,

00:05:58.665 --> 00:06:01.215
which is 18 pixel, then 1.44,

00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:07.700
then 2.074, then 2.968, then 4.3.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.615
In the same sense, if we go to this,

00:06:10.615 --> 00:06:12.610
it has different calculations,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.900
font size 3 em,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.780
2.05, or something like that.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.840
So what we are going to do is we are going

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.345
to copy these values and paste it where we need them.

00:06:25.345 --> 00:06:28.345
Like 4.3 is going to be our,

00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:30.680
for example, Heading 1 size.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.260
So what we are going to do is Heading 1 size is 4.3,

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.370
then we have 2.986.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:02.870
I'm going to quickly skip everything so you can use whatever size you want.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.610
I am using Heading 5,

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.400
which is the same size at 18 pixels.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.230
Heading 6 is a bit smaller.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.330
I think we should both have the same size for this one.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.150
Heading 6 is a bit smaller,

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.170
maybe we can use a small size for this one,

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.630
which is 0.694 over here,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:29.540
but we are going to use smaller size which is 694 over here.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:36.630
It's 694. Then we have 2.074,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:46.240
and then we have 1.44.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.600
I have to change a lot of screens, 1.44.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.705
Then we have 1 em,

00:07:54.705 --> 00:07:56.940
this one, and then this one.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.700
We are all set for the headings.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.660
Line-height. You can change the line-height, if you want.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.345
I have set it to 1.25 because,

00:08:05.345 --> 00:08:10.380
if you remember, headings need less line-height.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.760
So we are setting less line-height for headings.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.230
You can also use 1 or maybe 1.1, something like that.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:26.850
Let's save it and see how our post is going to look like.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:34.440
This is our typographic scale set in Bootstrap.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.650
This is the, basically,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.830
custom scale for Bootstrap, vertical rhythm,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:45.555
so we are not going to mess with Bootstrap's custom vertical rhythm.

00:08:45.555 --> 00:08:47.205
If you want to really,

00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:50.415
go ahead and mess with it.

00:08:50.415 --> 00:08:52.820
Let me show you an example.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.045
You need to change the "type.less" file, basically.

00:08:56.045 --> 00:08:58.490
So here we have a heading for family

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.930
with line-height and everything set for all the headings.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:07.935
What we are going to do is we are going to change margins,

00:09:07.935 --> 00:09:11.240
top, bottom, and everything for each heading,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.100
even paragraph and everything.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.200
Let me show you the example file.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.960
I will include it in this post.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:28.115
This lecture exercises sources, check them out.

00:09:28.115 --> 00:09:31.720
Let me show you where it is.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.565
This is also an exercise for you, guys,

00:09:34.565 --> 00:09:37.415
so I just made it a bit difficult.

00:09:37.415 --> 00:09:42.335
This is the post I showed you blog post with

00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:47.765
Bootstrap using custom typographic scale and sizes,

00:09:47.765 --> 00:09:51.515
and I'm using 27 pixels as my baseline.

00:09:51.515 --> 00:09:53.465
How I did it,

00:09:53.465 --> 00:09:59.000
let me show you the variables in that type file.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.150
Let me show you what it's like.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.250
Now you can see over here,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.710
I have changed line-heights and everything for h2.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.465
It's different.

00:10:13.465 --> 00:10:16.050
You can see margin top, bottom, padding, 0,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.530
but line-height is line-height multiplied by 2.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.630
Then we have Heading 3,

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.985
everything is 0, line-height by two.

00:10:23.985 --> 00:10:26.075
Then we have Heading 3 test,

00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:29.125
which is the top headline over here, this one.

00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:32.065
It has [inaudible] them off beat,

00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:35.645
so it is padding-top 11, then padding-bottom 11,

00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:40.005
line-height 32 so all of these equal to 54,

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:44.590
font size 32, and font family is also custom.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:53.775
These are the custom settings from Bootstrap default settings,

00:10:53.775 --> 00:10:55.610
so don't worry about them.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.985
So this is how I have set everything over here.

00:10:58.985 --> 00:11:03.120
You need to adjust each heading top,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.560
bottom margins and everything,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.610
and line-height to really use vertical rhythm in Bootstrap.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.060
So I don't advise this because this is going to just set the text.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.205
But what about buttons,

00:11:16.205 --> 00:11:18.605
modal windows, other controls?

00:11:18.605 --> 00:11:22.235
They are going to suffer from this setting,

00:11:22.235 --> 00:11:25.440
so I suggest that you just stick with

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.520
the default Photoshop settings and just change the variables.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.490
Just play with them.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.165
So what today we learned is that we use

00:11:35.165 --> 00:11:40.700
our Modularscale to get these values and use them in our Heading 1,

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:48.290
2, 3, and 4, or you can also use these values too if you want, if you like them.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:55.820
So this is how we use custom typographic scale in Bootstrap.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.340
This ends my lecture.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.280
Also I want you to play with it,

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.660
try to download it,

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.920
and change a few settings,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.025
and see how these look like.

00:12:07.025 --> 00:12:11.180
Also try to change this font families and play with it.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.720
So this is the end for this section.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:22.165
I will try to include anything new I come up with like changing fonts

00:12:22.165 --> 00:12:25.820
or typographic scale for mobile devices and medium-sized devices

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.335
like iPads and other medium-sized devices.

00:12:30.335 --> 00:12:34.770
Let's move on to the next lecture.
