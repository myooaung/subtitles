00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Here's a brief introduction about font pairings,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:12.255
so just to clear your mind of some assumptions or some thoughts about how to pair fonts.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:14.505
First and foremost rule,

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:17.925
there are no hard rules to pair fonts,

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:21.900
so you need to train your eyes and guts for that.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.720
Try to develop your gut feeling that, okay,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.140
these two combinations look awful man,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.815
it's ugly or something.

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:35.430
These two fonts are looking great together.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.730
This is how you train your eye or gut feeling,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.350
but it comes with time.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.290
You keep on seeing different combinations again and again from different designers,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.020
and then your eye and guts will be automatically trained.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.245
There are a few basic rules.

00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:55.700
First one is avoid too much similarity between fonts.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.945
If there are fonts that are equally round,

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:01.880
and the X-height is same,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.950
and curves are same,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.195
then they will be identical to install [inaudible] such fonts.

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:10.230
Then the second rule is look for contrast.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.830
Even in nature, you can see contrast is everywhere,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.290
even in plants, flowers, colors, everything.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.345
So two different fonts that are very different from each other,

00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:25.400
like Serif and Sans Serif,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.350
or Slab serif and sans serif,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.020
they work great with each other.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.030
Now, the third rule is look for similar features.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.910
You need to look for geometry of that font,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.915
roundness, open counters or closed counters.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:44.570
Whether the counters have very big space or they have very less space.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.030
Then also look for the X-height.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.190
If they share the same X-height,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.385
they might get well together.

00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:55.280
We are going to see all these rules in detail in the next lesson,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.560
so don't worry about it.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.780
Here are a few important points you need to keep in mind while trying to pair fonts.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.880
First one is readability.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.110
It is very important.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.540
If you are choosing text for your body,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.845
then readability is our first priority.

00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:15.885
Second one is display font or heading font.

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:18.640
You can be a bit creative here,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.855
you can select any font,

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:23.150
maybe very wide, very thick,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.735
very squiggly, or something like that.

00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:29.700
Now, the third one is voice of typeface.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.570
You are going to appear both fonts or select both fonts,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.055
keeping in mind about your theme or purpose of your design.

00:02:39.055 --> 00:02:43.505
If it's an organic design or something related to nature,

00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:49.825
then you should keep in mind that both font pairs should reflect that.

00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:53.450
There is last thing that I need to clear,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.475
which is some fonts,

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.400
they just stored match at all.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.389
So if you are feeling that these fonts are not matching,

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.340
then don't try to match them.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.970
Some fonts they really repel each other.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.830
Last one is that keep on combining different fonts together.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.755
You will learn with experimentation.

00:03:16.755 --> 00:03:19.685
Nobody tells you this trick.

00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:23.010
It is the best one to learn typography pairing.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.640
Open your fonts, select one for the body text,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.405
and then iterate for the heading in your theme.

00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:32.795
Keep on iterating till the time you find the best one.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:39.430
So this is how you train your gut and train your eye for combining different fonts.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.070
This is a little intro about font pairings,

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.680
so let's get started and see and dive deep in

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.370
the next few lessons that how to pair fonts.
