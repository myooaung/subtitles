00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
In this lesson, we are going to look at

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.260
percentage unit usage in CSS font size specifications.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.285
If you are using percentage,

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.260
it is also similar to emulate,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.145
so that is why I discussed emulate before.

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:16.560
Now, here in my body,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.745
which is my main base font size.,

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:25.230
here I'm specifying base font size equal to 100 percent,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.480
which means 16 pixels.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.185
For almost every browser default,

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:34.470
100 percent is 16 pixel value.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.025
It is also considered standard,

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:45.780
so make sure you specify font size 100 percent in your body element or your HTML element.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.930
Now, we have left and right containers.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.464
In the left container,

00:00:51.464 --> 00:00:56.145
you can see I'm specifying font size 140 percent.

00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:59.450
In the right container there is no font,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.460
so everything inside this container will be

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.985
calculated on the base of this body because this is their parent.

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:16.915
There is no specification of font size in the other parents like this one,

00:01:16.915 --> 00:01:21.500
but this one has font size specification of 140 percent.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.360
So everything inside this left container will be treated in the same way

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.955
as we calculated M. Let me show you an example over here.

00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:35.365
This is the usage of percentage unit,

00:01:35.365 --> 00:01:39.840
and you can see on the left container everything is larger,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.410
and on the right container everything is the right size.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.340
Why we are having this problem?

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.500
It is also the same problem with M unit that the immediate parent of this left fourths,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.870
this one, H1, H2, and H3,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.990
they have their parent size set to 140 percent.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.175
It means the parent size is 16 multiplied by 1.4,

00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:09.215
which is 140 percent.

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:14.550
So 22.4 is their base size.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:29.400
Now here we have 22.4 pixels as our base size.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.250
If we have 22.4,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.980
then the font size 100 percent will be 22.4.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.360
You can see over here,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.440
if we go to this paragraph and right-click and inspect element,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.910
it will be equal to 22.4 because it is right now

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.785
calculated according to its parent which is this left container,

00:02:57.785 --> 00:03:02.635
this one over here.

00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:06.735
Now, this is also same as M,

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:12.050
so I'm not going to show you a very detailed lecture on this one.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.240
You can see over here,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.610
for the other sizes I'm using rem,

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.300
so let's remove it right now to avoid confusion.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.175
So heading 1, 2, 3.

00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:26.110
Now you can see here on my heading 3,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.480
I'm using absolute value 36 pixels.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.190
Let's see in both examples,

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.280
right side and left side you can see heading level 3 is fixed,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.245
so it is 36 pixels,

00:03:39.245 --> 00:03:43.490
but everything else is in relative unit, which is percentage.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.240
So they have different sizes in both the containers.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.020
Now you can see over here I'm using 400 percent,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.260
350 percent, and so on, and so forth.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.555
For small, I'm using 90 percent.

00:03:57.555 --> 00:04:02.640
Okay. There is another use of

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.040
this percentage which I will be discussing

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.990
in the later lectures when we will look at responsive typography,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.590
so let's move on to the next lesson.
