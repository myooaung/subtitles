<v ->Hi!</v>



2

00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:04.752

I'm very excited to have you in this course.



3

00:00:04.752 --> 00:00:06.741

In this course, you will learn how to



4

00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:09.352

connect Angular2 as a front end,



5

00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:13.435

with Node.js, Express, and mongoDB as a back end.



6

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:16.861

Now this combination, with Angular1 of course,



7

00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:20.120

was already pretty popular in the past,



8

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.448

and therefore the next logical step is to use Angular2.



9

00:00:23.448 --> 00:00:24.581

Throughout this course,



10

00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:28.741

we'll both work on an overarching project, or application,



11

00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:31.741

there are the individual pieces of Angular2,



12

00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:36.293

working together with Node.js, will be taught step by step.



13

00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:37.292

In the next modules,



14

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:40.781

I will start with refreshers on Node.js, mongoDB,



15

00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:41.923

and Angular2,



16

00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:44.712

but in these modules I will already start



17

00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:47.840

with the project too, which of course,



18

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.400

needs a basic front end and a basic back end.



19

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.280

So if you feel like you don't need refreshers,



20

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.949

you may very well skip ahead to the module



21

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.251

which is actually about connecting Angular2 and Node.js,



22

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:02.381

but make sure to download the latest state of the project,



23

00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:03.851

which will always be attached



24

00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:06.169

to the first lecture in a module.



25

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:08.280

The application we both build,



26

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.588

will be a little social network or messenger like app.



27

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:14.709

Where we will be able to sign up as a user,



28

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:17.720

sign in of course, and then create messages,



29

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.131

new messages, and of course edit or delete messages.



30

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:23.509

Though, only our own ones.



31

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.899

And this will also be a key part of this course.



32

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.010

Authentication, authorization.



33

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.069

You will learn how to implement authentication



34

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:33.280

in an Angular2 and Node.js app,



35

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.531

and how to make sure that only authenticated users



36

00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:38.149

may access certain routes on your back end,



37

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.819

as well as only users who create the message



38

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.320

are able to delete it, for example.



39

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.789

We will finish all of this with error handling,



40

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.739

to not only log an error to the console,



41

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:52.811

or let it drop into the void,



42

00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:54.879

but to actually show it to the user.



43

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:56.419

Now of course this course covers



44

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:57.939

a lot of other concepts too,



45

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.606

so enough of the talking, let's get started.
