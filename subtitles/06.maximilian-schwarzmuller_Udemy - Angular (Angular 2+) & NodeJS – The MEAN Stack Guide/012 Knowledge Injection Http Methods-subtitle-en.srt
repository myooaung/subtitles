1
00:00:01,824 --> 00:00:03,363
<v Instructor>I explained how to set up</v>

2
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:06,328
routes, for example, and get the post route.

3
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:09,063
Now there's more than just get and post,

4
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:10,722
especially when creating an Angular

5
00:00:10,722 --> 00:00:13,285
to a Node.js application, we're not

6
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:16,124
limited to the get and post routes,

7
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:18,536
the browser typically is able to send

8
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:20,622
through a form or through a link.

9
00:00:20,622 --> 00:00:22,647
We can use more HTTP words and methods

10
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:27,002
which better describe the nature of our request.

11
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:29,016
So we of course got the get request

12
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:31,152
whenever we wanna get a resource,

13
00:00:31,152 --> 00:00:33,178
and this is how you should use it.

14
00:00:33,178 --> 00:00:36,489
Use this type of request if you want to get a resource.

15
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:37,790
You will see all these methods

16
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,542
or the usage of these methods

17
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:41,022
throughout the course, of course.

18
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:43,831
Post should be chosen if you want to

19
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:46,387
send some data to the server to store there.

20
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:49,221
So if you want to create a resource on the server.

21
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:51,912
Patch would be a request you use

22
00:00:51,912 --> 00:00:53,875
if you want to change an existing

23
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,898
resource on the server, whereas put would be

24
00:00:56,898 --> 00:00:59,613
a request method you use if you want to

25
00:00:59,613 --> 00:01:01,883
replace an existing resource on the server,

26
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:04,073
so entirely replace it.

27
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:06,161
A delete request is typically sent

28
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:08,266
if you want to delete a resource,

29
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:10,430
and there are a couple of other requests.

30
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,106
The requests I listed here are the

31
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,367
most important ones and the ones

32
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:16,186
you will use most often.

33
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:17,934
In this course you will learn how to both

34
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:21,879
send different types of requests from Angular 2,

35
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,288
it's really easy, and how to handle them.

36
00:01:24,288 --> 00:01:26,421
Well, handling them on Node.js is,

37
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:28,770
as you already saw it, use the express router

38
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,772
and then for each of these methods,

39
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:34,137
you've got an appropriate method in Node.js.

40
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:36,915
So we use router get for a get request,

41
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:39,023
router post for a post request.

42
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:40,902
I guess you can figure out what we would use

43
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:42,642
for a patch request.

44
00:01:42,642 --> 00:01:46,270
These are the HTTP requests we typically will use,

45
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,437
and again you will see the usage throughout this course.
