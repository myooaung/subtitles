00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:04.001
- Most Spring projects require quite a few dependencies

2
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:07.007
and libraries, and a lot of initial configuration.

3
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.005
Luckily for us, the folks at Spring

4
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:13.002
created "Spring Boot" and it allows us

5
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:17.006
to quickly ramp up a project by using

6
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.008
the Spring Initializr.

7
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:23.008
So, the Spring Initializr allows us to define

8
00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:27.002
the different technology's and different parameters

9
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:30.005
of our project, and then it simply hands us

10
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.008
our project configuration.

11
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:35.008
So Spring Batch is no different, quite a few libraries

12
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.008
little bit of initial configuration.

13
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:41.002
Using Spring Boot we can quickly

14
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:44.008
get started with a Spring Batch project

15
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.002
without all the hassle of setting things up.

16
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.004
So, here you see the Spring Initializr

17
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:55.003
it's found at start.spring.io, and within this form

18
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.002
we're simply going to define

19
00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:59.008
our initial project configuration.

20
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:03.005
We're going to be using Maven, in order to package

21
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.005
and build our application

22
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.009
and it's also going to be Java based.

23
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.005
You'll notice that we're using Spring Boot version 2.2.5

24
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.004
and then a little bit lower on the form

25
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:18.007
we're going to get into the configuration

26
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:20.005
specific to our project.

27
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:24.001
So, here it's asking for our Maven coordinates

28
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:29.007
and we need to provide a group ID for our project

29
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.006
which is going to be com.linkedin

30
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:37.000
and then we need to specify the artifact name

31
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.004
and our artifact name is going to be linkedin-batch

32
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:45.007
and then we're going to add our chapter and lesson number

33
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:49.000
as a suffix to that artifact name.

34
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.007
Now you'll want to expand the options, and within here

35
00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:56.008
we can provide some additional configuration

36
00:01:56.008 --> 00:02:02.007
so the name is going to be the name of our main class

37
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:05.001
within the application, so I'm going to go ahead

38
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.004
and remove that suffix, so that it doesn't appear

39
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:11.007
within our class name, and then we'll go ahead

40
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:15.007
and change our description, we'll say this is

41
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:20.006
a simple Batch application, and then here

42
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:24.000
we'll want to adjust our package name

43
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.003
in order to be a little bit more simple.

44
00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:29.008
So, we're going to make our package name

45
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:32.003
and this is where our classes will be packaged

46
00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:33.007
within the app.

47
00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:37.006
We want to make that com.linkedin.batch

48
00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.007
and then, very important you'll want

49
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:44.004
the Jar packaging as well as Java 11.

50
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:47.004
Then, scrolling down on this form you'll see

51
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:50.004
this area, search dependencies to add

52
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:52.008
and here's where we can specify

53
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:57.003
the different Spring projects that we would like to include

54
00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:59.007
within our application.

55
00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:03.003
So, once we select a Spring project

56
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:08.004
there's going to be a starter dependency added to our palm

57
00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:10.005
and Spring Boot is intelligent enough

58
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:14.000
to pull in the right versions of the different libraries

59
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.003
and apply some initial configurations

60
00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:19.004
that get us ramped up extremely quickly.

61
00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:21.006
We know we're going to want Spring Batch

62
00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:23.003
so we'll just search for Batch

63
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:25.000
and there you can see it appears

64
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
just click on the + button, and it will get added

65
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.004
to your project, and then from there

66
00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:33.006
we're also going to initially use

67
00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:37.007
an in memory database H2, just for out first

68
00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:40.006
run of a Batch application.

69
00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:43.009
Once we have those, click on generate

70
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:48.002
and this is going to allow us to download

71
00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:53.002
our pre-configured project within a zip file.

72
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:57.004
So, on my desktop I've built my eclipse work space

73
00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:02.004
and in here I'm going to go ahead and save

74
00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:06.002
that zip file containing the project

75
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:09.008
and then I'm going to open the file system

76
00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:13.005
navigate to my desktop, and within the workspace

77
00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:17.005
I'm just going to go ahead and extract this project

78
00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:22.001
and here you can see all of the generated configuration

79
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:25.007
and code, that Spring Initializr provided.

80
00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:31.004
Now we can head over to Eclipse and I'm going to import

81
00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:35.000
that project as a Maven project.

82
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.005
so just click on file import

83
00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:40.002
and then you can just type Maven

84
00:04:40.002 --> 00:04:43.000
and you'll see that we get the option to

85
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
import an existing Maven project

86
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.001
select that and hit next, and then we will browse

87
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:54.007
into our workspace, and go ahead and select our project

88
00:04:54.007 --> 00:04:57.001
and once we've found it we can just

89
00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:59.004
hit open and then finish.

90
00:04:59.004 --> 00:05:03.007
And you'll see that our new Spring project

91
00:05:03.007 --> 00:05:07.006
gets imported into Eclipse

92
00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:11.006
and Eclipse is able to compile the project

93
00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:15.009
and we're ready to go very quickly, right off the bat.

94
00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.003
So, that completes the setup

95
00:05:18.003 --> 00:05:20.003
of our first Spring Batch project.

96
00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:23.001
You can see how easy Spring Boot made it

97
00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:25.008
and it ensures that we have the right dependencies

98
00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:29.000
and initial configuration in place for our project.
