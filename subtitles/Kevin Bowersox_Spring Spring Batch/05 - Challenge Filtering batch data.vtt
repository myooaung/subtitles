(upbeat synthesizer music)

2
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.008
- [Instructor] Having seen several ItemProcessors in action,

3
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.007
this challenge will require you

4
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:14.006
to implement your own ItemProcessor that identifies

5
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:19.000
and filters orders which qualify for free shipping.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.007
Our business requirements indicate those orders

7
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:25.005
over $80 qualify for free shipping,

8
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:27.006
so we'll want to identify them

9
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:31.008
and then filter out those lower than the price threshold.

10
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:35.001
Additionally, H+ Sport provides free shipping

11
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.003
only for government orders,

12
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:42.002
so you'll want to keep the existing ItemProcessors in place.

13
00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:45.003
Here are a few hints to get you started.

14
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.005
Divide the work between our existing ItemProcessors

15
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:53.005
and a new ItemProcessor named Free Shipping ItemProcessor.

16
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.007
You will need to set the free shipping Boolean

17
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.003
on the tracked order object to indicate

18
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.005
if the order qualifies for free shipping.

19
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:05.007
Finally, filtering items in a processor is pretty simple.

20
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:09.000
Take a peek at the documentation for how to proceed.

21
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.009
Once you've built the processor, it should be chained

22
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.008
with the other processors in our job.

23
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:19.005
This challenge should take about 20 minutes to complete.

24
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:23.003
In the next video, I'll show you how I solved the challenge.

25
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:25.000
Good luck!
