00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Kevin] Before we wrap up the course,

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.005
I want to take a moment to give you a path

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.006
for expanding your technical skills

4
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.003
and give you some information

5
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.008
on how to stay in touch with me.

6
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.000
The best way to gain a deeper knowledge

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.002
of Spring Batch is to build your own batch process

8
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.006
with the techniques we covered.

9
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:22.003
This might be a personal project or a project at work.

10
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:24.005
But if you put these skills to work daily,

11
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.000
you will quickly become an expert.

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.006
Also, throughout the course,

13
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.000
we worked quite a bit with Spring.

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.009
There are courses on the LinkedIn Learning platform

15
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.000
that dive deeper into all of the Spring projects

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.001
that I highly recommend you investigate.

17
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:41.009
If you want to stay in touch with me,

18
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.003
I'm not hard to find online.

on the LinkedIn Learning platform.

24
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.009
Git for Teams is a course I built

25
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:02.003
that delivers strategies for teams using Git,

26
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:05.008
that can help your team operate more fluidly.

27
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:09.006
Building APIs with Swagger covers a design-first approach

28
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:15.000
to creating APIs and teaches you the OpenAPI Specification.

29
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.003
Java EE 8 Essential Training covers 13

30
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:21.004
of the most widely used Java EE APIs

31
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:23.009
and gives you a rock-solid foundation

32
00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.008
for building Java web applications.

33
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:29.006
Check these out if you like spending time in the editor

34
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:32.001
and you like my teaching style.

35
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:34.007
So that is all I have for you, for now.

36
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.009
Congratulations on finishing this course,

37
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.001
and thank you for taking it.

38
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:41.002
Now put your skills to work,

39
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:43.008
and go build some exciting batch processes

40
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.000
with Spring Batch.
