00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.004
- [Narrator] Before we take a closer look at Spring Batch,

2
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:06.000
let's talk a bit about who the course is for,

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.004
and what information you should know ahead of time.

4
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:12.005
This course is primarily for Java developers

5
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:17.000
that want to gain hands-on experience with Spring Batch.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.004
The lessons in the course will get you quickly

7
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.009
up to speed on how to use Spring Batch

8
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.004
for both simple and complex Batch processing jobs.

9
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.003
Software architects will also benefit from this course,

10
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:33.006
because it gives a good overview of the capabilities

11
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.009
within the framework so that you could apply them

12
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.006
when architecting new systems.

13
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.004
Also, if you are a COBOL developer looking

14
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:45.006
to convert Legacy Batch jobs to Java,

15
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.006
this is a great course for you.

16
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.007
To get the most out of this course,

17
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:53.009
you should have some experience with Java.

18
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:55.008
You do not need to be an expert,

19
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.003
but this course shouldn't be your

20
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.008
first exposure to the language.

21
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.007
Additionally, you should be comfortable

22
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:03.000
with the Spring Framework,

23
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.005
since Springs Batch is built on top of it.

24
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.009
If you understand the basics of Spring applications,

25
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.004
you shouldn't have any problems

26
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:14.002
completing the lessons in the course.

27
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.009
If you're not familiar with Java or Spring,

28
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.004
you may want to take a course or two

29
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:22.000
on those topics within the LinkedIn learning platform

30
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.006
before completing this course.

31
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.003
Finally, you should have a general understanding

32
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.000
of relational databases, or flat files,

33
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.007
since we'll be moving data to and from these data stores.

34
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:37.008
During this course, we'll be using several technologies

35
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:41.001
that need to be installed on your work station.

36
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.001
Of course we'll need Java.

37
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:46.005
I've created every lesson using Java 11,

38
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:50.007
so you will want to download and install JDK 11.

39
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.002
I use Eclipse for my day to day development,

40
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.007
and in the course.

41
00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:58.001
However, you can use the IDE of your preference.

42
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.008
If you go that route, make sure you're very comfortable

43
00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:05.003
with that IDE, since you'll need to replicate my actions.

44
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:07.002
We'll need a database for the course,

45
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.004
so I've chosen MySQL.

46
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.008
In addition to the actual database,

47
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.008
we'll use the MySQL workbench to inspect the

48
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:18.005
data models used by Spring Batch.

49
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:22.000
Finally, feel free to use whatever operating system

50
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.008
you are comfortable with for the course.

51
00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:27.002
I'll be using Linux Mint in a VM,

52
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:29.006
but any operating system will work

53
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:33.001
since the JVM is cross-platform.

54
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.009
In the exercise files, you will also find helpful materials

55
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:40.002
including both Batch and powershell scripts,

56
00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:43.001
handouts that explain job flow,

57
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:46.004
and a data directory that contains seed data

58
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:48.003
for the lessons.

59
00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:50.004
That's all you need to know about the course.

60
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:52.000
I'll guide you through the rest.
