00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.008
- [Instructor] Batch jobs normally contain more

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:04.007
than a single step.

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:08.000
The execution of most jobs flows sequentially

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
from one step to another until the job completes.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.005
When configuring a job with multiple steps,

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:18.001
the job builder interface allows us to define transitions

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:23.002
from one step to another to create a multi-step job.

8
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.009
Let's add a few more steps to the delivery job

9
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.008
to see these transitions.

10
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.008
We'll need to drive the package to the customer's address

11
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:35.004
in the process of completing our package delivery job.

12
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:42.003
So let's create a new step in order to include the action

13
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:45.009
of driving to the customer's address.

14
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.003
I'm going to name the method

15
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:53.003
for this bean driveToAddressStep and then,

16
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:57.004
just like before, we'll use the stepBuilderFactory

17
00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:03.008
to create a new step named driveToAddressStep

18
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:07.009
and then we're going to create a tasklet

19
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.003
and within this tasklet, we're going to add

20
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:15.004
the logic we would like to execute

21
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:17.004
while driving to the address.

22
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.007
We're going to keep it simple

23
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.001
and we'll just add some console output

24
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:28.000
that says successfully arrived at the address

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.003
and then within the return section of our method,

26
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:39.007
we're going to specify the repeat status as finished

27
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.009
and once we've done that, we can go ahead

28
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.005
and build our step and that completes our next step

29
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:48.009
in the job.

30
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.006
Now while we're at it, let's go ahead

31
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:52.009
and add one more additional step

32
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.000
so I'm just going to copy our last step

33
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.001
and then we'll supply a name for this method

34
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.002
and the name for this step is going

35
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:07.006
to be the givePackageToCustomerStep

36
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:12.001
and this step is going to be after we arrive

37
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.004
at the address,

38
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:16.001
we simply want to give the customer the item

39
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.007
that they've ordered.

40
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:20.006
So we'll go ahead and change the name

41
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:26.003
to givePackageToCustomer and then we can modify

42
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:29.006
our console output so we know which step we're on,

43
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:35.003
we can just say that we have given the package

44
00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:38.006
to the customer and at this point,

45
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:42.006
we now have three steps that are available

46
00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:45.002
as beans within our job.

47
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:49.001
Now at the moment, these steps are not specified

48
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.007
within our job configuration

49
00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:54.000
so in order to include them,

50
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.008
we'll need to navigate down to our job configuration

51
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:01.009
and let's just start to organize this sum

52
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.001
and there we can see our first step

53
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.006
where we package the item

54
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:10.003
and then after that, we would like to drive

55
00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:12.005
to the customer's address

56
00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:16.008
so in order to transition from one step to another,

57
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:19.008
there is a transition element that we can use

58
00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:23.005
and it's next and you can see that when we use next,

59
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:29.002
we just specify the next step in the sequence of the job

60
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:35.003
so here we can provide our step driveToCustomerAddress

61
00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:39.007
and then we can specify the next step in the job

62
00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:42.006
that we would like to execute and in this case,

63
00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:46.000
it is the givePackageToCustomerStep

64
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.009
and now we have a job that contains three steps.

65
00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:55.002
These steps are executed in sequence

66
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:57.006
so we'll start with packaging the item

67
00:03:57.006 --> 00:03:59.003
then we'll drive to the address

68
00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:03.000
and then we'll give the package to the customer.

69
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now one of the things I've done

70
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.006
in order to make it a little bit easier,

71
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:12.000
I've added a script that will run this job

72
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.006
so let's head over to our terminal

73
00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:17.009
and we can take a look at this script.

74
00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.007
You'll see that it's basically doing

75
00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:21.005
what we've previously done

76
00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:25.006
where it's passing in the two job parameters

77
00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:28.005
and then it's invoking our job

78
00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:32.008
by using the java -jar command and our jar file.

79
00:04:32.008 --> 00:04:36.006
So with that in our project directory,

80
00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:39.004
all we need to do to run this job

81
00:04:39.004 --> 00:04:44.006
is just hit ./ and then the script name

82
00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:47.008
and that's going to help us launch the jobs

83
00:04:47.008 --> 00:04:51.008
so that we don't have to type in those commands every time

84
00:04:51.008 --> 00:04:54.007
and we see that our job does kick off

85
00:04:54.007 --> 00:04:59.008
and we're looking to see those three steps execute

86
00:04:59.008 --> 00:05:03.004
so here you can see that we package the item

87
00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:06.005
and that step executed successfully

88
00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:08.005
then we drove to the address

89
00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:11.005
and then we gave the package to the customer

90
00:05:11.005 --> 00:05:15.002
so we now have a job with multiple steps

91
00:05:15.002 --> 00:05:20.007
and those steps are specified by using the next method

92
00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:24.001
that allows us to transition from one step

93
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:26.000
in a job to another.
