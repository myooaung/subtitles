(upbeat techno music)

2
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:06.009
- [Instructor] Now it's time to put

3
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.001
your new skills to the test.

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.009
We're going to expand our package delivery job

5
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.006
to include a new conditional flow

6
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:18.001
that will be executed when the customer is present

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.002
and receives their item.

8
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:23.004
In this conditional flow, the job will be updated

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.009
to either thank the customer or give them a refund

10
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.001
if the item is the incorrect item.

11
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:34.001
The correct item is delivered roughly 70% of the time,

12
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.002
so this should be factored into the logic

13
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.000
for any conditional decision.

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.004
To build the flow, you will need to create new steps

15
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:46.000
and a decider that produces a custom exit status

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.003
that controls the conditional flow to these steps.

17
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:53.001
Additionally, you'll need to modify the job flow

18
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.005
to include the decider and its transitions

19
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.001
to the appropriate steps.

20
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.006
As a helpful resource,

21
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:04.005
you can consult the deliver package job handout.

22
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:07.003
Here I've highlighted the new steps

23
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:11.003
in the decider that will be required for the challenge.

24
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:15.001
This challenge should take you about 15 minutes to complete.

25
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:19.000
In the next video, I'll show you how I solved the challenge.

26
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Good luck.
