(upbeat digital music)

2
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:07.007
- [Instructor] Having worked with several ItemWriters

3
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.009
and the constructs they follow,

4
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.005
this challenge will require you to write a JSON file

5
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.006
using a JsonFileItemWriter.

6
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.002
Within our project, we're currently reading information

7
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.009
regarding shipped orders

8
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.002
from the databases SHIPPED_ORDER table.

9
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:27.004
Using the appropriate ItemWriter, create a job

10
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:31.009
that writes the data to a JSON file on the file system.

11
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.008
Here's a few hints to get you started.

12
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:36.005
First, make sure you take a look

13
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.009
at Spring Batch's documentation.

14
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.003
It should include all of the information required

15
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.003
to complete the challenge.

16
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:46.000
Second, you should look to utilize the builder

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.002
for the JsonFileItemWriter.

18
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.003
It will simplify the job configuration.

19
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:55.001
This challenge should take you about 15 minutes to complete.

20
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:56.009
In the next video, I'll show you

21
00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:00.000
how I solve the challenge, good luck.
