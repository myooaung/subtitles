00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.005
- [Instructor] Spring Batch uses a job repository

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:07.009
to capture metadata regarding the execution of a batch job.

3
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.002
The job repository typically stores this metadata

4
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.005
in a relational database that Spring Batch uses

5
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:18.001
to make decisions about job executions.

6
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.000
Whilst Spring Batch will create the table schema

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.001
required to store the metadata,

8
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.002
we'll need to supply the database

9
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.009
where the schema can be created.

10
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.007
So, we're going to install the MySQL database

11
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:33.003
on our work station.

12
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:35.004
And to do that, we're just going to work

13
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:37.000
within Software Manager

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.004
to first install the MySQL Database Server.

15
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:44.004
And, once we have the MySQL server identified,

16
00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:47.000
we can go ahead and click on install.

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.005
And that will start the installation process.

18
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.005
Once that completes, we're going to open up a terminal

19
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.002
so that we can set the password

20
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:57.005
for the root user of the database.

21
00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:01.000
So to do that, we sudo over to mysql,

22
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.002
and then from there,

23
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:16.000
we're able to alter the root user's password.

24
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.006
And in this case, I'm just going to go ahead

25
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.006
and set the password to "password".

26
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:24.008
I'd highly recommend picking a stronger password

27
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.001
for your production environments.

28
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:31.004
But there we see we've set the password for our root user.

29
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:34.009
And then we're going to go back to the Software Manager,

30
00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.007
and we're going to install the MySQL Workbench.

31
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.000
This is a graphical user interface

32
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.002
that we can use to interact with our MySQL database.

33
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:48.006
And it's going to allow us to see what's going on

34
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:49.008
within that schema,

35
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:54.004
storing information related to our batch jobs.

36
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:58.009
Once the Workbench installs, let's go ahead and launch it,

37
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.002
and we'll make our first connection.

38
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.009
So here you can see that we already have a connection

39
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.003
for our root user.

40
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:11.000
Just go ahead and enter the root user password

41
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.005
that you've created.

42
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:17.007
And then what we need to do within the Workbench

43
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:20.007
is we need to create a new schema

44
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:26.009
that is going to hold the metadata for our job repository.

45
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.006
So just click on the Create a New Schema.

46
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:34.008
And here we need to provide a name for our schema.

47
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:40.005
We're going to go ahead and name this schema the batch_repo.

48
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:44.007
And once we've provided that name, we can hit Apply.

49
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:47.004
And we'll go ahead and create the new schema

50
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:49.001
within our database.

51
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:52.009
Now the other thing that we need to do is create a user

52
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:57.006
that is going to connect to this schema.

53
00:02:57.006 --> 00:02:59.003
So within the Workbench,

54
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:02.006
we can click on Users and Privileges.

55
00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:05.000
And this is going to give us the ability

56
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.002
to add a user to the database.

57
00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:10.001
So just click on Add Account,

58
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:14.003
and here we can specify the name for our new user.

59
00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:17.007
We're just going to name the user batch_user.

60
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:20.007
And then we can set a password for this user.

61
00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:22.001
I'm going to keep it really simple,

62
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.001
and just make the password "batch".

63
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:28.004
And then if we take a look at the scheme privileges,

64
00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:31.008
we'll want to add privileges

65
00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:35.005
on our schema for this new user.

66
00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:37.003
So we can go ahead

67
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:38.003
and

68
00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:42.001
select our batch_repo schema.

69
00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:46.009
And then from here, we're going to grant every privilege

70
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.003
to this user on that schema.

71
00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:53.004
Once that's in place, just go ahead, click on Apply,

72
00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:55.008
and now we have our

73
00:03:55.008 --> 00:03:56.006
schema

74
00:03:56.006 --> 00:04:01.003
that will hold the metadata regarding our job executions.

75
00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:04.005
And we've also created the user that we'll use

76
00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:08.000
to connect to that schema from our job repository.
