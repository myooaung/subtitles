00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.009
- [Narrator] When building batch jobs it's common to execute

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:08.005
the same sequence of steps or flow within multiple jobs.

3
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:12.001
Spring Batch provides a Flow Builder that allows us

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.007
to externalize a sequence of steps into a flow

5
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:20.000
that can be reused across different jobs.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.005
Let's take a look at how we can apply the concept

7
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:27.005
of an external flow to our deliver package job

8
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.005
and our prepare flowers job.

9
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:34.009
Currently within the deliver package job, we have a sequence

10
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:39.007
of steps that deals with taking a particular item

11
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.007
and getting it to a customer.

12
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:45.002
I've highlighted those and annotated them

13
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.007
with the delivery flow.

14
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:51.003
What we're going to do is externalize this section

15
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:55.009
of our deliver package job and then within our prepare

16
00:00:55.009 --> 00:01:00.005
flowers job, we're going to leverage and execute

17
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:05.007
that delivery flow as part of our batch processing.

18
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:10.008
We'll also be able to keep that flow within our deliver

19
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:16.002
package job achieving reusability across both jobs.

20
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:20.001
Let's take a look at how to pull the steps related

21
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:24.004
to our delivery into an external flow so that both

22
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:27.000
of our jobs can reuse them.

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The first thing that we'll need to do is within

24
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
our linked-in batch application class.

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.004
We'll need to create a new bean and this bean

26
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:42.004
is going to be of type flow.

27
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:45.004
So, go ahead and add the bean annotation,

28
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:50.008
and then we're going to declare a method that returns a flow

29
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:54.002
and we're going to name it delivery flow.

30
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:59.008
Now, within this method, we're going to use a Flow Builder,

31
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:03.006
and that Flow Builder has a generic type argument

32
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:06.006
of simple flow.

33
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:10.003
And then similar to our other constructs,

34
00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:13.006
we're going to provide the name of the flow.

35
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:17.005
And in this case, it's going to be the delivery flow.

36
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:21.005
Now, the delivery flow is going to execute those steps

37
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.004
that will deliver an item to a customer.

38
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:29.001
So, we're going to take a look at our deliver package job

39
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:32.003
because it contains those sequence of steps

40
00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:34.003
that we would like to execute.

41
00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:39.003
So, pretty much everything after the package items step

42
00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:43.007
is going to be applicable to delivering the item

43
00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:47.002
whether it be flowers or shoes to the customer.

44
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:49.009
So let's go ahead we'll copy that,

45
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:54.007
and then we're going to navigate back to our delivery flow,

46
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:59.004
and within the delivery flow, we're going to go ahead

47
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:04.003
and add those steps because we'd like to externalize them.

48
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:08.001
And then the first thing we'll do, we need to change

49
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:11.008
next over to start, because the drive to address step

50
00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:15.000
will be the first step in our flow.

51
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.003
And then you'll remember that we're using a builder,

52
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:22.001
so, we need to call the build method in order to create

53
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.001
our flow object.

54
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:28.007
And then we'll just be sure to import the flow type.

55
00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:32.004
And at this point, we have our external flow.

56
00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:36.007
Now, we know that both jobs are going to use this flow.

57
00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:43.005
So, let's first add this flow into our prepare flowers job.

58
00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:46.002
And here you can see we're going to select the flowers,

59
00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:47.009
we're going to remove the thorns,

60
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.007
and then we're going to arrange them.

61
00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:54.009
So, at this point, we would now like to deliver the flowers

62
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:56.003
to the customer.

63
00:03:56.003 --> 00:04:01.004
And we can do that by leveraging the configurator

64
00:04:01.004 --> 00:04:04.000
in our external flow.

65
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.005
So, we're going to go from the arrange flowers step,

66
00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:12.007
and once it completes, then we're going to proceed

67
00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:16.005
to execute our flow so we can pull in

68
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.007
our delivery flow here.

69
00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:22.005
All right, so that's all it takes in order to pull in

70
00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:25.008
that external flow into another job.

71
00:04:25.008 --> 00:04:32.002
Now, we still have our deliver job that will need

72
00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:34.000
to be modified.

73
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.006
So, let's navigate to that.

74
00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:40.002
And here we're going to make some adjustments.

75
00:04:40.002 --> 00:04:44.004
So, we know that we copied pretty much all of these steps,

76
00:04:44.004 --> 00:04:48.008
so let's go ahead and pull them out of our job

77
00:04:48.008 --> 00:04:52.003
because we don't want to execute them twice.

78
00:04:52.003 --> 00:04:59.005
And then, we're simply going to add the on transition

79
00:04:59.005 --> 00:05:05.004
and for any exit status, we are going to proceed

80
00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:08.009
to the delivery flow.

81
00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.003
So, at this point, our flow is externalized

82
00:05:12.003 --> 00:05:17.003
and it's included within both of our jobs.

83
00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:21.003
So, we can go ahead and run both of these jobs.

84
00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:24.006
To run these jobs, we're going to navigate over

85
00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:26.001
to our terminal.

86
00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:30.007
And the first job I'll run is the delivery job.

87
00:05:30.007 --> 00:05:34.007
We'll see the job build, and then kick off and we can take

88
00:05:34.007 --> 00:05:39.007
a look to make sure that our package does get delivered.

89
00:05:39.007 --> 00:05:44.008
Okay, so we can see that we package the item,

90
00:05:44.008 --> 00:05:48.002
then we proceeded to the drive to address step

91
00:05:48.002 --> 00:05:50.006
the customer was not present

92
00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:53.000
so we left the package at the door.

93
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.009
Excellent.

94
00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.004
Okay, let's go ahead and we'll clear the console,

95
00:05:57.004 --> 00:05:59.007
and then I'm going to run the flowers job

96
00:05:59.007 --> 00:06:02.001
so we're going to prepare some flowers

97
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:05.001
and then those flowers will be delivered

98
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:12.006
using the job configuration within our external flow.

99
00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:15.007
So here you can see that we arranged the flowers

100
00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:21.003
for the order, and then we proceeded into the delivery flow.

101
00:06:21.003 --> 00:06:23.009
We were able to drive to the address once again,

102
00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:29.003
they weren't home, and then we left the flowers at the door.

103
00:06:29.003 --> 00:06:33.001
Using flows introduces a lot of reusability in Spring Batch

104
00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:36.009
by allowing us to specify common sequences of steps

105
00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:38.007
in a single definition.

106
00:06:38.007 --> 00:06:41.009
If you find yourself copying and pasting from one job

107
00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.001
to another, it would be beneficial to introduce a flow

108
00:06:45.001 --> 00:06:47.000
into your jobs.
