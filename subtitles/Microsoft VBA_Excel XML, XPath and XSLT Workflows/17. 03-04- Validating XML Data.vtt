00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.910
in this video,

2
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.850
we'll look at validated XML data as you import it into an Excel worksheet.

3
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.350
So 03 Exelon XML.

4
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.650
It's now going to number four,

5
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.350
validating XML data.

6
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.010
Let's begin by opening the scheme a document that will be working with courses,

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.090
not XSD.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.310
So here you'll probably recognize the three levels which an XML document needs to have in

9
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.450
order to be successfully imported into Microsoft Excel.

10
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.080
First of all,

11
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.530
we have courses,

12
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.150
which is the root element.

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.390
Then we have the repeated element course,

14
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.380
and inside that we have the child elements,

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:00.940
which will correspond to the columns within an XML table in Microsoft Excel and these child

16
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.450
elements the specified to be a sequence.

17
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.350
This means that they must occur in the specified order,

18
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.010
and in this case,

19
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.180
very importantly,

20
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.650
they can only occur once.

21
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.520
None of them has Mexico's on bounded or anything which detracts from the default of me

22
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.390
knickers once and Max occurs.

23
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.300
Once you know the words,

24
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.250
they must occur once and only once,

25
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.050
so to test excels powers of validation.

26
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.960
Let's just open up the XML file and break the rules slightly.

27
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.270
Let's say that one of the tubes that e mails is missing.

28
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.050
If we simply leave to you to email intact and then delete the email for that tutor,

29
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.530
we haven't broken any rules because the element to to email still exists.

30
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.950
But if for some reason the system that generates the XML completely removes Tuesday email

31
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.470
for that record that we have now broken the rules,

32
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.450
we've broken the sequence that specified in the scheme a document.

33
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.680
So let's save out changes and so that we don't love the file.

34
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.150
It's also closed most the scheme and documents on the XML file.

35
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.580
Now let's go into excel so we'll open courses that XLs X and then import.

36
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.450
The file to do is we go across the developer and click on Import.

37
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.420
We're in the right folder,

38
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.050
30 days in XML data,

39
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.960
and it's double click on the XML file.

40
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.800
In order to ensure that Excel value dates using the XML Schema document,

41
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.150
we now need to click on properties and activate the track box,

42
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.150
validate data against schema.

43
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:07.290
And now when we click OK and OK again as we anticipated,

44
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.070
we get an error,

45
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.290
failed scheme,

46
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.350
validation,

47
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.850
and when we click on details,

48
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.920
Excel explains exactly what it doesn't like on the two most useful pieces of information

49
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.970
it's supplying are the reason element to to day rate is unexpected.

50
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.590
So in other words,

51
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.390
it's sane in record one,

52
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.710
we're going straight from tutto last name to to to day rate to to email.

53
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.730
Is there four missing,

54
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.420
which is also confirmed in the expecting attributes.

55
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.750
What you to email is specified is being the missing element.

56
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.370
We've engineered this era,

57
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.670
but hopefully this demonstrates that Excel will pick up errors if you ask it to validate

58
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.550
using a schemer document.

59
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.170
So whenever possible,

60
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.510
If you're working with a client who supply an XML,

61
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.750
you should ask them to also supply a schemer document which you can use to validate the XML

62
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.750
.
