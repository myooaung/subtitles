1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,520
in this video,

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,110
we'll carry on where we left off in the last video.

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,750
So we go into number four Filter XML,

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,820
hopefully save your changes.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:29,230
So let's just be the file amoled has pasted into using predicates and then Evan it from

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,950
there enable content.

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,150
And this is where we left off.

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,660
So we've got a formula which basically only targets.

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:47,750
The first person in the XML document on what we need to do is to ensure that the person

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:54,520
that we actually target is the head of the Finance Department in this case and worse in the

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,450
London branch.

12
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:06,170
Let's just reopen the XML files from that folder for just to remind you what the structure

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:06,950
looks like.

14
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:16,220
So basically the things that we need to test about attributes the department attributes and

15
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,550
the bronze attributes off the head element.

16
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:28,050
So let's edit our function on what we want to do is to home in on the right head element,

17
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,680
so are predicated.

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,190
It needs to go on our middle location,

19
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,620
step after the head.

20
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:45,780
No test predicates are written in square brackets like so and then between the square

21
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,580
brackets,

22
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,450
you put the equivalent off the first argument Oven Excel if statement.

23
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,850
So in this case,

24
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,410
we're testing two attributes when,

25
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:03,110
right in the name of an attribute you simply preceded with an outside on that distinguishes

26
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,950
it from the name of an element.

27
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:16,050
So let's start with the Department Department equals and then we need to slot in Cell B two

28
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,050
.

29
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,950
So that means we've got a close quotation marks.

30
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,250
The news M percent.

31
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,170
We're working locally,

32
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,760
so we don't need to worry about things like you are all in code.

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,510
And of course,

34
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:32,290
so you just click on B two and per send on.

35
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,670
One thing I've for gotten is that B two has to go in single quotes.

36
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,670
So just before the close quote,

37
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,050
I'm going to insert single quotes.

38
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,070
And then,

39
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,350
after the ampersand,

40
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,490
we opened double quotes and close single quotes.

41
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,120
So,

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,610
in other words,

43
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,850
the value and be too will end up inside single quotes.

44
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,310
And then we do the same for bronze.

45
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,080
So we simply say,

46
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:07,450
and bronze equals single close close double quotes,

47
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:15,240
ampersand to slot in the value in C two emphasis end open double quotes,

48
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:23,360
closed single quotes and then we've already got the close in the square bracket so that

49
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:31,070
middle locations that now has all three possible components has the implied child access.

50
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,310
It has a no test,

51
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,150
which is head,

52
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,230
and now it has a pretty kids inside the Reddick.

53
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,850
It we just inserting two values from our excel worksheet.

54
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,210
Suddenly we click enter.

55
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,270
We now have the correct staff i D.

56
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:56,360
But the person who is head of the violence department at the London branch so we can know

57
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:06,060
can't be all of this and paste it into getting the first name and last name.

58
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:29,870
So now when we come for you down,

59
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:36,230
we have the appropriate details that each of the heads of department at the bronze

60
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,580
specified on each road.

61
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:45,590
So that's a very quick example of how predicates he used in an expert statement.

62
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,580
So if you're looking at a formula that uses filter XML and you see these statements inside

63
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,500
square brackets,

64
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,850
hopefully you know have a better idea of what's going on
