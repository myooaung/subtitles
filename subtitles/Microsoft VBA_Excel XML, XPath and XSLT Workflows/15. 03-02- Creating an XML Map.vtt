00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.750
in this video will discuss the role of XML maps in excels XML Work flows.

2
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.640
We're working in 03 XL and XML.

3
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.000
That's now going to number two creating an XML map.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.810
And to begin with,

5
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.970
let's open up courses that XLs X on work with the XML file that we worked with in the last

6
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.720
video and what we saw in the last video is that when you import an XML file,

7
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.260
Excel has to create an XML map in order to import the data and know which part of the

8
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.180
external structure goes into which column within the Excel table that it creates.

9
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.350
So now we'll move on to look at creating an XML map manually before you import any XML data

10
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.350
.

11
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.970
So to work with XML is restored.

12
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.900
In the last video,

13
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.370
we moved to the developer Tab on.

14
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.870
On the right,

15
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.500
we have the XML group and to work with external maps.

16
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.250
We click on the source button,

17
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.250
which makes the XML source task pain visible.

18
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.900
To create a map,

19
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.830
manually click on XML maps and then click Add,

20
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:30.430
they told the three sub folded to You'll notice that both XML and excess defiles are

21
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.180
displayed.

22
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.620
So Xsd is the schemer document and obviously XML is the XML document and you convey build

23
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.200
your map from either of these two documents and providing that there are no errors in the

24
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.520
XML file.

25
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.450
You should get exactly the same result regardless of which of the two use.

26
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.870
So let's use this scheme a document for the Courses XML file that we saw in the last video

27
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.870
.

28
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:04.340
Excel generates the man and you have the option of renaming the map and you'll notice that

29
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.020
the default consists of the original file name,

30
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.150
followed by Underscore map.

31
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:16.270
Let's rename it cause schedule and then click.

32
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.000
OK,

33
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.490
so within the XML source task vein,

34
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.250
we can now explore the structure of the XML document.

35
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.820
If we want to do exactly what we did in the previous video,

36
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.750
which is to import the XML file as is,

37
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.780
we can simply drag all of the elements which will generate the column headings by dragon,

38
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.590
their container.

39
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.720
So they're all contained in the course element.

40
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.350
We simply drag the cause element into a one,

41
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.620
and then we have a table which corresponds to the XML elements on which the column headings

42
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.160
are based Let's Undo.

43
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.870
But the real benefit of this workflow is that you can choose exactly which elements you

44
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.880
want and exactly where you'd like to display them.

45
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.350
So let's say that the first thing we wanted is playing out.

46
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.050
Table is the start date,

47
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.150
so I drag start dating to 81 Then let's say we want the course name,

48
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.950
but we don't need the category.

49
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.850
And next we want to move on display for all of the tutor information.

50
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.200
So I click on the first tutor element and then hold down control toe.

51
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.310
Have the other four,

52
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.750
and with them selected by then drag into C one.

53
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.150
Next,

54
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.080
let's have duration in price again,

55
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.750
control clean to select the second element,

56
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.650
and then we contract them in.

57
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.990
And finally,

58
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:56.300
let's have the three men you feels so you'll notice that everything that has Bean added to

59
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.350
the table is in bold.

60
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.510
And in fact,

61
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.950
the only elements I didn't add was category on that stand in plain.

62
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.650
When I click on an element name,

63
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.080
Excel highlights the corresponding column of the table.

64
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.880
When I click on any column within the table,

65
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.450
it highlights the corresponding element name in the XML source task pain.

66
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.160
So using this workflow,

67
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.350
I've been able to customize which fields I want to display on the order in which I want

68
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.850
them displayed in my example table.

69
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.010
And of course,

70
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.200
now,

71
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.250
when I import the XML file,

72
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.780
it's obviously going to follow the map pins that I've specified.

73
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.290
So we go across the developer,

74
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.750
clip on import and now bring in our school schedule.

75
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.750
As we can expect,

76
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.420
you'll see that Excel respects the column order that I've specified and just places the XML

77
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.350
into the correct column.

78
00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:02.550
So let's close this file and save our changes and let's look at a second workflow.

79
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.590
So in the same folder,

80
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.000
we have a schemer document called Expenses That Access T.

81
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.210
And let's say this time we want to use the schema document purely to create an XML

82
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.680
structure,

83
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.750
which we can then manually populate within excel.

84
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.410
So let's open the Excel file that we're going to use cold staff data and then let's create

85
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.650
the external map.

86
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.810
So we click on XML maps people had,

87
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:40.320
and this time we want expenses that xsd and just to remind you that we can let's rename the

88
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:47.170
map Let's call it expense claims don't like.

89
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.760
Okay,

90
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.850
so here we're looking at the structure that we need.

91
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.740
So is the very simple three level structure that we've discussed.

92
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.250
We have the root element called expenses,

93
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.020
and inside that we have.

94
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.590
What we can assume is the repeat in element called expense on the child.

95
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.240
Elements of expense are meant to contain the actual data,

96
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.650
so they will become our column headings.

97
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.580
And as before,

98
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:19.460
we can generate a table simply by tracking all of the fields into a one on.

99
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.750
Then we've got them in exactly the same order as the originals.

100
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.360
Let's undo.

101
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.590
Let's do a bit of customization,

102
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.450
so we'll have the person's name first.

103
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.850
Then we'll have a date.

104
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.350
Let's have a date reimbursed next.

105
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.150
Then let's have their brunch,

106
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:45.140
the category under which the expense claim fools And finally,

107
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:52.050
the amounts so amount claimed and amount reinvest on.

108
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:58.090
What we can then do is to complete the table by inserting a calculated column.

109
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.150
So let's say we'd like to keep track of the percentage that was reimbursed.

110
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:12.000
So this part of our table is static and it lives in excel only because there's no

111
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.550
corresponding XML element.

112
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.920
When we export this data,

113
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.550
the percentage reimbursed will not be exported with the XML.

114
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:27.780
So we can now enter data knowing that it's going to conform to the schemer off our proposed

115
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.340
XML documents on at any point in the future,

116
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:38.300
we could either import XML into this structure or we could enter data into the structure

117
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.150
within excel and then export that data as XML.
