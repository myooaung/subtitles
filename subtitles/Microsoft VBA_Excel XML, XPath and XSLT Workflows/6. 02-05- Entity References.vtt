00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.450
entity references exist to remove ambiguity from an XML document.

2
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.490
As we've seen my right in XML,

3
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.950
he used certain special characters.

4
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.750
The left angle bracket and right angle bracket are used to enclose elements.

5
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.070
When you define an attribute,

6
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.550
the value of the attributes has to be placed inside quotation marks.

7
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.090
By the way,

8
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.590
both double and single quotation marks are permissible so clearly,

9
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.240
if you want to use any of these characters in normal usage within your data,

10
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.890
this concretely eight ambiguity and the main function of entity references is to remove

11
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.620
these ambiguity the most typical way of writing an entity.

12
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:08.150
Reference issues in these three components m percent the name of the entity and then a semi

13
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.850
colon.

14
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:18.800
An XML has five built in entities designed to remove any potential ambiguity from your XML

15
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.410
Marca.

16
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.080
The less than sign has the name lt greater than GT double quotation marks.

17
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.750
Quote.

18
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.380
The ampersand is,

19
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.810
um,

20
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.610
and apostrophe is a pause.

21
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.920
Let's get some practice on using entity references in zero to X Emily Central's Let's Go

22
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.450
into Number five entity references.

23
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.040
Let's begin by opening this Jay Pek file in design XML Doctor A pig.

24
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.540
So the scenario we're going to simulate is where we want to submit.

25
00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.450
A tutorial to a website on the tutorial has to be submitted in XML format.

26
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.770
This is a diagram showing the XML structure that's required.

27
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.530
The root element is called tutorial and inside this building and also a title and then one

28
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.040
or more topic elements inside each of the topic elements.

29
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.880
We must start with a title and then we can have as many parent elements as we want next.

30
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.830
Let's have a look at the raw text that we're going to convert into the XML.

31
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.150
That's tutorial dot txt is our title.

32
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.350
He is our author and he has the title off our topic.

33
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.030
We've only got one topic element this time,

34
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.550
and then each of these would be inside a parent element.

35
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:56.230
Let's go ahead and create the XML file open up to you to real dot XML and here we've got a

36
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.080
blank XML file,

37
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.660
so we'll start with the XML Declaration Next,

38
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.850
the root element tutorial if we will work into a specification.

39
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.960
XML is case sensitive,

40
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:23.900
so we need to take the case into account and then we'll leave some space for the child

41
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:46.550
elements next to want the title of the editorial Also on the topic inside the topic,

42
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:58.370
we then have a title and insight that we then have a series of para elements and I'm just

43
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:07.720
gonna copy this line three clicks to highlight the whole line Control C and control the and

44
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.920
I think from memory We need five of these.

45
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.630
So I've just got five power elements and next we just copy the text from our plain text

46
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.180
file.

47
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:25.920
Is the title control Visa pace?

48
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.690
No,

49
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.950
right.

50
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.150
Take available in brackets.

51
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:43.410
And when we come to the title inside the topic and then we've got to think about the

52
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.360
paragraphs.

53
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.110
So this point,

54
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.550
it would be good to address the question off these illegal symbols.

55
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.510
So what we need to do is to replace each of them we have,

56
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:05.410
I think three of the five we've got greater than less Stan Onda double quotes.

57
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.710
So we need to replace every occurrence of these three symbols with the entity references.

58
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.480
I'm just using note pad,

59
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:20.620
but I'm sure that whatever editor you're use in as the fine and replace command so less

60
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.540
than will be replaced with ampersand.

61
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:34.650
Lt for less than and then semi colon replace all greater than will be replaced with

62
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.180
ampersand.

63
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:47.530
G t semi colon replace all and finally quotes double quotes We replaced with ampersand.

64
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.660
Quote semi couple and replace all.

65
00:05:51.660 --> 00:06:06.430
So now we safe so we could start copying across our paragraph elements on just control V to

66
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.750
paste each of them in.

67
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:36.790
So let's say that changes

68
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.010
and fingers crossed.

69
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.840
If we haven't missed anything,

70
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.050
that should now be a valid XML document.

71
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.750
So let's just move back to the training folder.

72
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:59.650
Let's move back into structure of an XML document on its Remember in XML validation,

73
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:10.800
we have the Earl of Code beautify so we could just copy that going to a browser and then we

74
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.450
can validate our XML.

75
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:25.850
So he called me a liar.

76
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.180
XML control,

77
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:35.320
See or edit copy control V to paste it in on validates.

78
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.450
Did you see that we have valid XML
