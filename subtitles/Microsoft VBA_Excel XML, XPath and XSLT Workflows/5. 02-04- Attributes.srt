1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,180
continue Now look at the different types of node that you can find in an XML document in

2
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:23,630
this video will move on to look at attributes on how attributes differ from elements we saw

3
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,450
in the previous two videos.

4
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:33,850
But elements are the most important nodes within XML documents they used both to contain on

5
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,370
their elements and to contain the actual data that the XML document is.

6
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,090
Story.

7
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,840
By contrast,

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,850
attributes are normally used to store metadata.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,460
That is to say,

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,440
information about your data here in the tools example which we worked with in the last

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,030
video.

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,690
We want to add an a tribute to the tour's element,

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,270
the apparent element called Season On.

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,040
We want to give that attribute a value of 2017 on.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,890
We're doing this because we regard it is meta data.

16
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,730
It's information,

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,200
which is important,

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,850
but which isn't part of the data set.

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,800
That's,

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,950
for example,

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,460
if this XML was going to be used to produce a brochure,

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,780
the season probably wouldn't appear as part of the data.

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,420
That's what we're implying by using season as an attribute rather than having it is an

24
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,450
element which contains data and let's take another example,

25
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,550
we have a price element.

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:45,550
Let's say that we want to clarify that the currency being used is pounds sterling tpp.

27
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,650
But we don't necessarily want to indicate this in the brochure itself.

28
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,760
So again we have metadata rather than data.

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,890
And for that reason we want to implement.

30
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,950
This is an attribute rather than as an element.

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,580
So that's the logic behind that tributes.

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,950
Let's now have a look at how they're written.

33
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,050
Attributes have written inside the Oaten in tag often element.

34
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,430
So this generic example.

35
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,880
We have an element called My Element,

36
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,650
and we want to assign an attribute to it called My Attribute.

37
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,020
In the opening tag we write,

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,950
my attributes equals.

39
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,720
And then,

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,950
in double quotes,

41
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,950
we put the value that we want to assign to the attribute.

42
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,290
Then we have the content of the element,

43
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,080
and we have the clothes in tag.

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,970
It's when you implemented an attribute,

45
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,330
only the open in tag off.

46
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,090
The element is affected.

47
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,120
Nothing happens to the content,

48
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,840
and nothing happens to the close.

49
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,550
In tack.

50
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,060
Let's get some practice on.

51
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,450
Working with attributes in zero to XML essentials,

52
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:02,000
open up some folder Number four attributes And then let's open tools dot xml,

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,060
which is the file that we created in the last video.

54
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,350
And let's create the two attributes that we've just been discussing.

55
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,470
The first was season on.

56
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,350
We want to put this into the root element tours simply click after the name of the element

57
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,350
,

58
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,740
put his space and then put the name of your attributes.

59
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,440
In this case,

60
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,990
we call in its season equals.

61
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,570
The spaces are optional,

62
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,650
input in them in for readability only.

63
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,230
And then in double quotes,

64
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,050
we put out 2017.

65
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,750
And then let's do the same for price.

66
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,220
Nothing happens to the close in Tak.

67
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,310
It's always the opening tag.

68
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,090
We click after the name of the Element,

69
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,360
which is price but a space.

70
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,150
And then we put our attribute.

71
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,590
This time we want currency equals,

72
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,950
and we always use the double quotes CBP.

73
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,150
So let's say about changes.

74
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:09,650
The very first example of XML that we looked at on this course was a file called Basic.

75
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,280
And here's a diagram representing the XML structure in that file,

76
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,250
and you'll notice it contains two attributes.

77
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:25,130
We have an attribute inside the staff member element called department and We also have an

78
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,850
attribute inside the photo element called Age Ref.

79
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,350
There's one important difference between the stump member on the photo element.

80
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,340
Staff member has contents.

81
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,850
It has child elements.

82
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,130
Photo has no child elements and it has no textual content.

83
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,350
Theeighties ref attribute is its only content.

84
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,450
This type of element is normally referred to as an empty element.

85
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:58,950
Empty implies that it has no child elements and no textual content,

86
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:05,990
empty elements that have an attribute normally written with one tag only.

87
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,910
So using generic syntax,

88
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,450
we would say my element space,

89
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,390
my attributes equals.

90
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,730
And then,

91
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,470
in double quotes,

92
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,550
we have the value.

93
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,640
And then to indicate that this tag is both an opening and closing tag,

94
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,050
we put it forward slash before the close in angle bracket.

95
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:32,640
Let's have a look at the file to remind ourselves in zero to XML essentials.

96
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:40,220
Some folder four attributes Couple quick on staff dot xml and this is what the Fire looks

97
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:49,050
like is our first attribute in the staff member Element department equals accounts.

98
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,250
Staff member is an element that has child elements,

99
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,260
but in contrast,

100
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,050
photo has no trial elements,

101
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,900
so you'll notice that it's written as a single tag.

102
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,600
Hey,

103
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,150
Trev equals then we have a file path,

104
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:11,050
and then we have a forward slash in front of the close in angle bracket.

105
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,850
So that's the difference.

106
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,750
Let's just closed the file.

107
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:22,670
Let's implement the same structure in our tools.

108
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,590
Example.

109
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,360
You know,

110
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,920
folder.

111
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,310
You'll notice that we haven't images Sub folder and inside.

112
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,770
We've got a couple of photos matching the two destinations that we've inserted into our XML

113
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,650
so far,

114
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:47,850
and I'd like to say a quick thank you to pick sabei dot com for supplying these energies.

115
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:55,620
So let's go back to our XML on Let's add in images element to our structure,

116
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,450
says Reach to We have image.

117
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,990
And then we'll put an attribute,

118
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,670
which points to the photo.

119
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,050
We can call the attributes anything we like.

120
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,050
I'm going to call it S R C,

121
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:17,910
which is taken from HTML equals quotes and then I'm just gonna put a relative path to the

122
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,490
file.

123
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,210
So images is the name of the folder forwards.

124
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,950
Laugh,

125
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,850
Santiago,

126
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,210
don't drink,

127
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,740
Peg.

128
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,430
And then to finish off,

129
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,840
we put forward slash on the clothes in angle brackets and then we could just copy this

130
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,410
whole line three clicks to select the entire line,

131
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,040
and then we can copy by use in control and drag.

132
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,530
This works in most editors apologies.

133
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,450
If it doesn't work in the one you're use it.

134
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:54,870
And here we just change Santiago to Caracas,

135
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:01,100
and that completes our look at the use of attributes and just to summarize.

136
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,550
Attributes tend to be used for metadata rather than data.

137
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,450
The attributes is always inserted into the open in tag oven element.

138
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,550
When the element has no content,

139
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,650
a single tag is used.

140
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,210
The attribute is inserted into that single tag on.

141
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,790
Then the single tag is closed with forward slash,

142
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,850
followed by the close in angle bracket.

143
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,960
And just to point out that currency equals G V,

144
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,320
P will probably be inserted on a low price elements.

145
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,150
Even though I didn't do this in the demonstration.
