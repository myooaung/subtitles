1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,790
In the last video,

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,640
we looked at important data from different parts of a multilevel XML file into separate

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,450
tables.

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,060
In this video,

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,650
we'll look at doing the same thing but assembling all the data into a single table.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,280
So 03 Excel in XML.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,050
Let's open up some folder six multilevel import single table.

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,730
So let's begin by opening up.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:44,470
Start data Unified and here you'll see we've got exactly the same file that created in the

10
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,340
last video.

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:51,040
So we have three separate XML maps,

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,570
heads,

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,270
managers and stuff and then is restored in the last video.

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,290
We'd use these three maps to populate three separate tables so,

15
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,790
naturally,

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,180
what we can now go on to do if we want to have ALS,

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,540
the data in a single table is to manually create a new table and copy and paste all of the

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,550
information into that table.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,120
The limitation,

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,610
of course,

21
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,600
is that the data in the table will be static.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,850
It won't be linked to the XML in any way,

23
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:28,950
so let's close the XML source task pain and then let's just make the profile column a bit

24
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,350
narrower so we can fit everything onto one screen So I'm going to select all three seats

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:44,150
and then just resize profile like so And then let's de select our sheets on group seats.

26
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,250
So before we create our unified table,

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,300
we need to identify the role,

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,870
the job role of each of these individuals.

29
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,730
So I'm currently in branch managers,

30
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:04,400
so I'll just add a column here called Role and just Time Brahms manager and then copy that

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,750
down into all of the other Rose.

32
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:25,950
Then I'll do the same for department heads and staff members.

33
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:39,950
So now we've got a column to specify the role of all of the individuals.

34
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,150
We can create another table.

35
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:51,050
I'll just move that to the end and just call it full stuff.

36
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:57,750
And we vendors copy all of the data across total staff.

37
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,590
So the first copy,

38
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,980
I'm gonna take all of the data,

39
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:22,330
including the headings and then for the other two.

40
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,080
I'll obviously just need the data.

41
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,750
I won't want to copy the headings.

42
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,150
Seven department heads.

43
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:35,290
I click in the first column first row of data and then used the usual keyboard shortcut,

44
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:51,740
which he probably no control shift end to select all the way to the bottom and finally we

45
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:59,450
do the same to stuff controls it and on a copy and paste.

46
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:11,050
So this is one approach.

47
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:17,300
We import all the data into separate tables so that we can access different sections of the

48
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,450
XML file,

49
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,340
and we then manually assemble all the data into a single table on.

50
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,830
As I said,

51
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,850
the limitation is that this table is in no way dynamic.

52
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,690
I now have all the data in one table,

53
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,850
but it's not dynamically linked to any XML source,

54
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,620
and it doesn't correspond to the structure off the original XML.

55
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,810
So if I wanted to export this data back into the original XML,

56
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,380
I wouldn't be able to do so.

57
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,950
So let's now save out changes,

58
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,950
closed the file.

59
00:04:53,950 --> 00:05:01,040
And now let's look in our second example.

60
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,590
So let's open up stuff.

61
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,990
Data amplified,

62
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,680
and what we'll do in the second example is to create a single table,

63
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,650
which references the three different job roles that we've just seen staff members,

64
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,750
heads of departments on branch managers.

65
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,060
So let's go across the developer and creates an XML man.

66
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,600
To do that,

67
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,720
we take a source and then in the XML source task pain.

68
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,670
We click on XML maps,

69
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:36,560
then add and elects the same file.

70
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:44,190
I'm going to switch across to hold a six multilevel import single table a man DoubleClick

71
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,550
on branches down xsd to generate the map.

72
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,160
There will only be one map this time,

73
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,150
so there's no rolling to rename it.

74
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,250
So let's just like Okay,

75
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,250
so let's start by putting in all of the staff member data.

76
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,100
So as before,

77
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,710
I'm going to control click on photo and then control.

78
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,090
Click on age rest,

79
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:16,650
drag the selective elements to create the external table and then rename a dress photo.

80
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:25,080
So what we can now do is do an in the details of the heads of departments and branch

81
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,950
managers in the context off each staff member.

82
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:36,150
So let's begin by specifying the department and the branch at which eat start member works

83
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:44,190
say we scroll up and we've got the department name so we drag in name and we'll need to

84
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,450
rename the column.

85
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:54,330
Let's just call it department and then we want the name of the branch again.

86
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,510
The element is called name and we can just read a mitt brunch,

87
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:08,050
and now we can add in the name off the head of department on the branch.

88
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,530
I said Before I do that,

89
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,450
I'm going to switch on word Ram.

90
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,700
Just get back to home Special lead,

91
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,650
right then vertically aligned to the top.

92
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,190
Let's also get rid of all these Underscores.

93
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,080
So while that selections in place is tight control age which is a short cup,

94
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:38,130
the replace and then we're replacing under school with a space and replace all.

95
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:49,650
So now we can start with the name off the department head head section we track first name

96
00:07:49,650 --> 00:08:08,050
and the same for last name.

97
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:22,570
And finally you do the same for the branch manager.

98
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:22,570
-

99
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:56,360
So

100
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,850
complete sound mapping.

101
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:06,370
And finally we import our XML data into that structure.

102
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,960
So developer,

103
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,750
import and branches.

104
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:28,270
So as we look at each stunk member,

105
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:33,250
we can see the name of their head of department on their branch manager.

106
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:40,080
So the staff member details occur once and obviously the heads of departments on branch

107
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,580
manager details are repeated as many times as necessary.

108
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,800
So hopefully this gives you an idea of how you might use data from different parts of a

109
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,350
multi level XML structure within the same table
