00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.570
So far,

2
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.090
we've only discussed import in a single XML file.

3
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.890
But you may encounter work flows where you have several XML files that need to be combined

4
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.610
into one data set or where the XML is supplied to you in batches.

5
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.510
So you have to import the data incrementally.

6
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.870
Let's look at those two scenarios.

7
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.460
So that's open sub folder three important XML data incrementally.

8
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.050
And then let's have not the Excel file cool schedule.

9
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.210
So we started from scratch.

10
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.080
There's no XML map on There's no XML data in the workbook at this point in time,

11
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:57.960
and what we want to do is to combine all four of these XML files into a single excel table

12
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.960
.

13
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.200
Let's look first of all of the technique which won't work,

14
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.950
so you can then dismiss that technique and not waste time trying it.

15
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.050
We go to developer on import.

16
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.750
We can simply select all of these files and click on import.

17
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.670
But this generates an error because Excel doesn't give us the option of creating the XML

18
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.530
map that we need so we can click OK to dismiss the error message on what we need to do when

19
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.420
we're important.

20
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.120
Multiple XML files is to specify the XML map in in advance.

21
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.770
We saw how to do that in the last video.

22
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.290
Best of all,

23
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.790
we bring up the XML source task pain.

24
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.650
Then we click on XML maps and add,

25
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.710
and wherever possible,

26
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.650
I tend to use thes schema document rather than the XML file.

27
00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.450
Let's click on open except the default name and click OK.

28
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.580
And let's say this time we're happy to have everything in the same order is the XML so it

29
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.750
can simply drag the course element onto the page to generate out table.

30
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.520
And now,

31
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.830
with this mapping in place,

32
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.960
we can go ahead and import or of those exile files.

33
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:29.840
We select the full files that's like on import and we know imported the schedule for or

34
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.950
quarters starting from January,

35
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.250
right up until December.

36
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.090
And naturally,

37
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.210
this has only worked successfully because the four XML files that we've imported are all

38
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.610
based on the same schemer and can therefore all use the same XML source map that we've

39
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.300
defined.

40
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.650
So that scenario one let's close them without saving our changes.

41
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.120
And then there's reopened the file and look at a second similar scenario this time,

42
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.450
let's say that we'll import the data incrementally as each quarter becomes available.

43
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.150
So let's say that when we do the first import,

44
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.680
only quarter one is available.

45
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.190
So this time,

46
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.640
because we're importing a single XML file,

47
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.300
we know that Excel will automatically generate the XML that forests so we can simply click

48
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.560
on import and that's important to you.

49
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.590
One on will leave the default XML table inexistent worksheets and click OK,

50
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.730
Excel brings it'll the data and it automatically generates the XML source,

51
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.990
man.

52
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.120
Now it's a few weeks later,

53
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.530
we've got the quarter to data and we want to add it to our existing quarter one data.

54
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.470
So as you can see,

55
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.700
this ends on the 31st of March and we want to add the course information for April,

56
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.950
May and June the second quarter.

57
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.750
So the key thing here is when we go to developer,

58
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.220
we need to sell properties.

59
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.010
So we click on map properties and at the bottom,

60
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.870
we've got the option when refreshing or important,

61
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.610
data override or upend.

62
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.150
And of course,

63
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.650
what we want to do is to append new data to exist in XML tables.

64
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.580
So they're like OK,

65
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.490
and now it's safe to import Q two.

66
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:38.280
So here we've got the last quarter one and the first quarter two on.

67
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.250
We can then just continue with that.

68
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.050
At a later stage,

69
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.850
we import Q three.

70
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.910
Herman.

71
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:49.790
Finally,

72
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.750
we import cute for I'm would be finished.

73
00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.450
We've got all the information right up to the end of December.

74
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.850
So those are the two main scenarios involving the important or multiple XML files.

75
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.460
Scenario one,

76
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:17.080
importing them into the same table and then scenario to incrementally important them into

77
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.150
the same table.
