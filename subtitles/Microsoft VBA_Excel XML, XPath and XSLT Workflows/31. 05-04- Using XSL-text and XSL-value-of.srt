1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,160
in the last video,

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,010
we looked at the centre acts for copying elements from the input document to the output

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,290
document without any modification in this video will live on to look at how you can

4
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,450
transfer elements from input to output.

5
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,650
Modify the contents that you have inside the element.

6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:35,450
So let's move into folder four years in xsl text and xsl value off.

7
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:41,920
Let's live in the branches don't xsl and this is the style sheet that we finished up with

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,350
at the end of the last video.

9
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,150
So just to recap what we've got so far in our first template,

10
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:56,720
we especially find that we want people as the root element and as the output we want.

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:03,080
Branch manager Ed and staff combined into one note set and then,

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,350
in our second template,

13
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,250
was specifying what we want to do to each element within that note set.

14
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:15,310
And what we do want to do is to create a person element for each of them and then place all

15
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,350
of the child elements of branch manager,

16
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:25,340
head or staff member with the exceptional staff I D and photo photo.

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,950
We want to suppress all together,

18
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,450
so that's taken care off,

19
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,720
but with staff.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,550
I d we actually do want the staff.

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,850
I d We simply want the contents to change.

22
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,150
So this time we can't news copy off.

23
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,860
Because if we do that,

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,850
we have both the exterior and interior,

25
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,520
um,

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,560
modifiable.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,150
So we always get a replica of the original element.

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:56,380
So what we have to do is to create the exterior of the element and then use a different

29
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,750
technique to put stuff inside it.

30
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,410
So we know how to create an element use element.

31
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:19,250
Xsl element name equals Stop I d And let's just go back to branches.

32
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,950
Let me just remind you what we're trying to achieve.

33
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,950
We basically want to have an apostrophe in front of the stop i d.

34
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,650
So the next cell will store it as text as opposed to a new marrying value.

35
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,050
So to do that,

36
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,450
we can use the text element.

37
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,150
This basically enables you to insert any literal string,

38
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,250
thanks a cell text.

39
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,720
And then between the opening and closing tax,

40
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,850
you can put any literal string that you want.

41
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,350
In our case,

42
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,500
we want a solitary apostrophe,

43
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:11,090
then going back to branches that xml what we now want is the original contents of staff.

44
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,580
I'd be intact and as we said,

45
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,380
we can't use xsl copy off because this will coffee,

46
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,620
not just the value.

47
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,300
It will also copy staff.

48
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,430
I d so in excess.

49
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,140
Lt,

50
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,850
when you want the text inside an element,

51
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,550
you use xsl value off.

52
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:44,420
So after xsl text xsl value off and then select equals whatever output you need at this

53
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,750
particular stage.

54
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,100
So we want the contents of stop I d.

55
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:57,350
So here we need an expert statement and we put in an expert statement in the context set by

56
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,050
the template that were inside.

57
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:07,350
So the context is either gonna be a branch manager head all staff member element.

58
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,950
And from that starting point,

59
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,430
we want a child element.

60
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,550
So we're going along the child access,

61
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,370
which is,

62
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:15,910
you know,

63
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,680
can be written like this,

64
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,520
but it's normally simply admitted because it's the default axis.

65
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,370
So they go along,

66
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,900
the child access on.

67
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,170
We look for an element called staff I d.

68
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,850
So that's the technique.

69
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,070
We reconstruct the elements step by step,

70
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:38,520
starting with the shell xsl element Name equals start by Deeble.

71
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,450
Create the shell of the element and put nothing inside it.

72
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:49,210
Then we use xsl text to insert a literal string so we can have the apostrophe and then xsl

73
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,090
valuables.

74
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,720
Well,

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,410
look inside stuff I D.

76
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,370
On output,

77
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,450
that text that it contains.

78
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,810
So let's save a man.

79
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,080
Just go across to exult.

80
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,350
Attest that it's working.

81
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,640
So file open.

82
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:22,670
There we go to number four and branches use the style Sheen's and here's our stuff I D.

83
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,640
And as you can see,

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,150
we've got an apostrophe.

85
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,650
So Excel will now stole of these numbers as text.

86
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,050
So that takes care of all the elements that we want in the output.

87
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,290
And in the next video,

88
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,150
we'll move on to look at creating attributes.
