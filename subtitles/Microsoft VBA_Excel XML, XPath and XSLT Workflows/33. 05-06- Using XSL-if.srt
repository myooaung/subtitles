1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,290
Let's now move on to look at the two conditional statements that you can use with xsl style

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:14,940
sheets,

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,010
the first of which is xsl.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,100
If let's move into under six and then open up branches,

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,250
don't xsl where we can see our file as we left it in the last video.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,230
So he got out two attributes,

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,890
and the third attribute was the more complicated one.

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,250
Because we go back to our XML,

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:44,720
we want to process the branch manager element differently to the way in which head and

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:53,490
staff member elements of processed there are two conditional elements in xsl xsl.

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,570
If an xsl choose excess,

12
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,990
I live is the simpler of the two.

13
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,870
It is similar to excels if function,

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,030
but it's simpler with excels.

15
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,750
It function.

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,790
You have a test,

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,800
a value of true value,

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,810
false with xsl.

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,400
If you have a test and then you do something.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,850
If the test is true,

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,020
if the test is false,

22
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,730
nothing happens.

23
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,710
So in other words,

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,240
you can only do something.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,750
If the test is positive when the test is negative,

26
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,350
nothing occurs.

27
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,150
So let's have a look at how it works.

28
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:44,890
So we created our third attributes which has a name of departments on what we want to do,

29
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,520
is to test the name of the context element.

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,130
Is it staff member,

31
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,970
head or branch manager?

32
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,050
And if the name is not branch manager,

33
00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:01,110
then we want to move up the ancestor access to find the name attribute of the department

34
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,750
element.

35
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:10,850
So we use xsl if and then instead of select used test.

36
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:16,610
And then we can use the name function that we've seen a few times Name of the current

37
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,010
context element not equal to which we've also seen.

38
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:28,900
Men in single quotes Franch under school manager Close single.

39
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,540
Close.

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,980
So you close out if and then between the open and close in tanks.

41
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:47,180
We specifying the output that we want xsl value off and then select,

42
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,450
will equal ancestor access for which there is no shortcut.

43
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:02,810
This time we're looking for department end of location steps forward slash switch to the

44
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,850
attribute access by using the at sign and again the attributes is called name.

45
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,080
And that's all we can do with the If statement,

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,350
he is out test.

47
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,710
And here's what we want to do if the test is true.

48
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:26,380
But xsl if doesn't provide a mechanism for saying what we want to do if the test is false.

49
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,710
So we happy to say that if the name is equal to branch manager,

50
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,820
do nothing.

51
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,820
In other words,

52
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,750
leave the value empty,

53
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,670
then we're home and dry.

54
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,800
But if we want to put a value,

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,390
for example,

56
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,670
you want to say not applicable or administration.

57
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,670
Ben will need to use the other conditional provided by xsl,

58
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,350
and that's xsl choose.

59
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,600
So that's it for this video.

60
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,250
Let's save and just test that it's still work in.

61
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:04,350
So they were in number six,

62
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,850
Uh,

63
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:16,650
so if we look at the branch managers by filtering on the roll,

64
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:24,950
we can see that none of them have a value inside the department.

65
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:33,810
Where is everyone else?

66
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,850
Does have a value.

67
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:41,920
So that's how xsl if works in the next video,

68
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,950
we'll move on to look at it slightly more sophisticated partner in crime xsl choose
