1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,750
in this video what we want to look at working with an XML document,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,250
which has a slightly more complex structure than the one tweet clean so far.

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:28,850
Zero Free Excel in XML that's now going to number five multilevel import on multiple tables

4
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:28,850
.

5
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,750
Let's have a look at the XML file will be working with its cool branches,

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:40,150
and it contains information about people working at a given organization.

7
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,550
So we have the branches root element.

8
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:50,050
And then we have a repeat in Branch Element inside that we have branch manager,

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,980
and then we have the actual information.

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,810
So these are the elements which will correspond to the columns within an acceptable table

11
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,700
within Microsoft Excel.

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,190
So far,

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,950
so good,

14
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,350
however,

15
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,580
only branch managers a listed at this particular level within the hierarchy.

16
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,590
To get to the heads of departments,

17
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,480
for example,

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,090
we have to drill down into the department's element and the repeating department element.

19
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,700
And then within each department element we have a staff element on the first child.

20
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,550
Element of staff is head,

21
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,950
and here's where we'll find information about all our heads of department.

22
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,100
Then,

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,550
after the listing for the head,

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,890
we have a star remember element,

25
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,900
which again has exactly the same child elements.

26
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:45,380
But the thing that makes this situation selectable complex is that the child elements may

27
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,200
be the same,

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,130
but the parent element is not so.

29
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,650
We have stumped member,

30
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,770
we have head,

31
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,150
and we have Bronze Manager.

32
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:04,900
All that's slightly different levels within the XML structure that's just close this file.

33
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,240
Then let's just have a look at the diagram off the XML structure.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,690
So if we have a broad interest or PdF and if you're using Adobe Acrobat,

35
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,970
you can type control elf to go into full screen mode and then control one to go to actual

36
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,770
size.

37
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,170
And then let's just move.

38
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:29,290
It's absolutely so we can see the whole thing so we can see that the elements that all

39
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,950
contain text exist at different levels within the structure.

40
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,570
So we want the trial elements of Bronze Manager,

41
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:44,950
head and staff member and within Excel.

42
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,330
The only real way of doing this it's toe have three separate tables to bring the branch

43
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,930
managers into one table,

44
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,250
the heads of departments into a second table and the staff members into assert.

45
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,660
So let's press escape and just close the branches.

46
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,750
A Pdf file.

47
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:11,160
So now let's open up the Excel file staff data and inside you'll see that we've got a

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,880
worksheet for each of the three bits of data that will be bringing in staff department

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,100
heads and branch managers.

50
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,870
So the first thing we need to do is to create three XML maps,

51
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:31,330
one but each of the sections of data that we want to target and as we've seen before to do

52
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:31,540
that,

53
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,350
we go to developer click on the source button.

54
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,750
This brings up the XML source task pain,

55
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,350
and here we click on XML Maps.

56
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:50,760
Then we click on Add on its work Out waiting to fold it five multilevel import multiple

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,070
tables and then let's base the map on the schema.

58
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,650
Document branches don't xsd.

59
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:07,540
Since what we create in three XML maps from the same schemer will need to rename There's

60
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,450
gonna be stuff.

61
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,300
Let me have a second.

62
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,870
That's cool.

63
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,120
This one heads remember,

64
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,500
third manages I mean,

65
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,150
we click OK and here l three XML maps.

66
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,050
Let's start with staff.

67
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:45,560
So here we need to navigate to the staff member parent element and we want a little bit

68
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,520
child elements of START member.

69
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,550
With the exception of voted,

70
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,550
let me just remind you why we don't need photo.

71
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,450
If we open up the XML document branches dot xml,

72
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,550
you'll see that photo is what's called an empty element.

73
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,690
In other words,

74
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,150
it contains no textual data.

75
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,970
What it does contain,

76
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,650
however,

77
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,520
is the attributes called a dress on.

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,050
This contains the location off this person's photo.

79
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,790
So what we need to do is to control,

80
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,050
click on a photo,

81
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,850
deactivated and then control click on age ref to activate that,

82
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,650
because it's a draft that actually contains the data that we want.

83
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,690
With that selection in place,

84
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,520
we can then create the XML table.

85
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,080
I drank in the selection into the Work Street,

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,550
and it's finished by renaming age ref photo.

87
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:53,450
And then we simply need to do the same thing all department heads and branch managers.

88
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,250
So that's navigate up to the head section.

89
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,050
The highlight the Parents,

90
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,820
which is an highlights.

91
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:08,420
All the trial elements control linked to de select photo and control glimpses selected a

92
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,020
dress.

93
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,830
Let me track this election into the work feet and again,

94
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:20,670
let's rename age ref and finally,

95
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,650
branch managers who are at the top.

96
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:39,160
So those three map pins in place,

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,690
we can now import our XML file.

98
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:48,100
And it's that one XML file that will populate along the tables very often.

99
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,290
When you've got these mapping set up all point into the same XML file.

100
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,590
Import in the XML file will populate all the tables in one hit.

101
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,210
But even if it doesn't,

102
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:05,330
you simply select another table and reimport the same XML file said.

103
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,360
To import the XML,

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,850
we go to developer on import and double click on branches dot xml.

105
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:23,950
So here we have a lot of bronze managers and our department heads and allow staff members.

106
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:30,800
So that's an example of how we can populate multiple XML tables from one XML file.

107
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,950
That same out changes.

108
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:37,130
And in the next video,

109
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,110
we'll discuss strategies for bringing in data from her multi level XML file into a single

110
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,260
XML table.
