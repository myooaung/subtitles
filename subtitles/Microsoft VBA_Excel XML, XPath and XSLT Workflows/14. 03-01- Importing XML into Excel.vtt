00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.790
in this section will move on to look at importing XML into Microsoft Excel worksheets.

2
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.580
So we now working in 03 XL the next time l and let's begin by going into number one

3
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.990
important XML into Excel.

4
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.160
Yes,

5
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.760
the XML file that we are going to be important.

6
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.250
So let's begin by having a look at the structure of the file,

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:42.010
you'll see that it contains a root element called courses and then inside this route

8
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.620
element,

9
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.250
we have a repeated element called course,

10
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.850
and the child elements off the course element contained the actual data that we want to

11
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.650
import.

12
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.350
This simple three level structure is the ideal format that you need whenever you want to

13
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.450
import XML into Microsoft Excel.

14
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.270
So obviously you have the obligatory root element,

15
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.590
and then you have a repeated element,

16
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.550
and each of these repetitions will become a road within an Excel table,

17
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.180
and the column headings of the table are provided by these troubled elements.

18
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.450
So each of these repeated elements has exactly the same child elements in the same order,

19
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.850
and that's very important.

20
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.650
If the schemer permitted different child elements for each of the repeating course elements

21
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.650
,

22
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.470
then the important to excel wouldn't be successful.

23
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.960
It's very important that the scheme a document defines the child of the repeated elements

24
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.300
as the sequence.

25
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.520
In other words,

26
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.600
each of these child elements must occur,

27
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.750
and they must occur in a particular order.

28
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.270
Let's have a look at the schema document.

29
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.550
How that specified.

30
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.360
So let's open courses that access D.

31
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.570
So here we have the definition off the root element courses on because it contains other

32
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.280
elements.

33
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.750
It's defined as a complex time,

34
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.260
and it's child element is defined as a sequence.

35
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.050
So it's a sequence of one child element,

36
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.350
which can repeat as many times as necessary.

37
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.990
And here's the child element cause.

38
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.790
This is one that repeats and these repetitions air specified.

39
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.320
Using the max occurs attribute,

40
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.740
which is set to unbounded the men occurs,

41
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.500
attributes defaults toe one,

42
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.900
which means effectively that the course element must occur at least ones,

43
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.750
but it can occur an unlimited number of times,

44
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.850
and then the course element is itself a complex type because it contains child elements.

45
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:59.350
These child elements are sequence and you'll notice that none of them has a max occurs.

46
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.580
So the default for of men occurs and Mexico's is one.

47
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.250
So this means if you admit both Max and Mina occurs,

48
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.750
each of these elements must occur once and only ones,

49
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.590
and because they are part of a sequence,

50
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.850
they must occur in the order specified within the scheme of document.

51
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.970
So that's the structure will be imported.

52
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.050
Let's now have a look at the process.

53
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.850
So number one important XML into excel that's open up courses of XLs X.

54
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.480
And here we've got a workbook that contains a single worksheet,

55
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.310
and we want to import that XML as a table within that worksheet excels.

56
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.750
XML commands are located on the developer tab,

57
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.800
so the first thing you need to do is to make sure you have the development and visible by

58
00:03:50.800 --> 00:04:00.690
going to file options and then clicking on the customized ribbon category on the right hand

59
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.640
side of your screen.

60
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.110
You'll then see all the taps that are visible and available on to make developer visible.

61
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.850
You simply click in the track box next to his name.

62
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.750
When you click OK,

63
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.250
you'll find that you got a new tamp,

64
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.620
and when we go across to that town,

65
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.850
we have an XML group with all the XML commands.

66
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.890
So here we would click on import and then,

67
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.540
if necessary,

68
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:35.190
just navigate to the training folder and into 03 excellent XML and then number one

69
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.450
important XML into excel.

70
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:44.060
And then we simply double click to import the XML file on.

71
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.440
We obviously have a worksheet ready for the data were important.

72
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.440
So we import XML table into existed mark treat ment of specifying that the schemer document

73
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.780
should be used to verify and validate the XML.

74
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.560
We click on properties and here we switch on validated data against Schemer that important

75
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.060
export the properties that we're looking at our or a map and XML map,

76
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.310
which is the mechanism that excel uses to determine which part of an XML file corresponds

77
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.250
to which column within an excel table.

78
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.540
I will discuss XML Memphis in the next video.

79
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.090
So for the moment,

80
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.350
let's just click OK,

81
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.370
and then when we click OK,

82
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.860
again,

83
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.150
Excel goes ahead and imports all of the data.

84
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.930
And it's very easy to see the correspondence between the data that we've imported on the

85
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.250
original XML.

86
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.650
They've been back to our school schedule.

87
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.590
Here's the first row basically,

88
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.100
So we can see that the course name is advanced Web design.

89
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:59.860
We have a start date of the eighth off Jan and duration of war in the price of 900 on all

90
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.330
of these things weaken see,

91
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.050
replicated within the imported data.

92
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.050
The data is housed in an X old table.

93
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.650
So we could if we want to rename that data,

94
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:20.700
and we can also format the data within the table in any way,

95
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.700
that's convenient.

96
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.260
So,

97
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.210
for example,

98
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.840
the start date is held in the standard XML date time format.

99
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.390
We wanted to look a bit more familiar.

100
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:36.050
We could just change it to the Standard Excel short date format.

101
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.470
And,

102
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.900
of course,

103
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.350
if we were to export this data from Excel,

104
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:46.740
Excel would be intelligent enough to convert it back into the standard XML daytime format.

105
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:53.450
The relationship between the XML File and the Excel table that we're looking at.

106
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.150
It's examined by this thing called an XML map.

107
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.660
So the development tab if you click on the source,

108
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.550
this displays the XML map,

109
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.300
and as I click on each of the individual elements,

110
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.990
we can see the correspondence between the various elements within the XML file and the

111
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.250
columns within the table.

112
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.670
So in the next video,

113
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:25.710
we'll talk a bit more about XML men and how they relate to the tables that house your

114
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.050
imported XML.
