1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,250
we saw earlier that XML enables otherwise incompatible systems to exchange data.

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,870
However,

3
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,460
in order for data exchange to be successful,

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,490
it's important that the integrity of an XML document could be very fight in some way and

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,290
this verification is referred to as XML validation.

6
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,860
In order to be trusted,

7
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,950
an XML document has to pass to levels of Verification Festival.

8
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,390
It must be what's referred to as well horned.

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,780
A well formed document is simply one which adheres to the fundamental syntactical rules of

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,850
XML and secondly,

11
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,050
an XML document must be valid.

12
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,550
The term valid is reserved for those XML documents which had here to a specific set of

13
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:07,450
rules laid down for a particular type of XML document a particular XML vocabulary.

14
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,310
The two main tools for check in that an XML document is valid,

15
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,470
uh,

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:22,020
be TDs and XML schema documents d t D stands for document type definition and can either be

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,490
embedded within an XML document or more typically exist as an external document with a file

18
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,310
extension.

19
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,840
Not d.

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,550
T d.

21
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:38,730
DTs work well with XML documents which mainly contained textual information such as books,

22
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:44,050
journals or articles like D TDs,

23
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:50,450
XML schema documents allow you to define the nature and structure of your XML data,

24
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,190
but they offer a much more robust type of validation than D TDS.

25
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:01,670
Scheme is allowing to place very precise restrictions on the content of the elements within

26
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,330
your XML documents such as the type of data which each element may contain schemers air,

27
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:15,370
therefore ideal for validating very data centric XML documents where strict data typing

28
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,780
becomes very important in the next three videos,

29
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,050
we'll take a closer look at these three methods.

30
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,880
Evaluated XML firstly,

31
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,850
checking that an XML document is well formed.

32
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:34,090
Then we'll move on to look at DT DS and finally will get an overview of external schemer

33
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,950
documents.
