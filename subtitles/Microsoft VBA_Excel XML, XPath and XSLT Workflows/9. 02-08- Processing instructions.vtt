00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.540
process in instructions like comments which we looked at in the last video can be placed

2
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.850
anywhere within an XML document in the prologue or anywhere within the Intel Ament,

3
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.150
and they achieve a similar objective to comments.

4
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.880
They're not part of the XML structure.

5
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.630
However,

6
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.550
where comments are designed for humans process in instructions a design for systems.

7
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.650
They provide a mechanism for XML developers to insert within the XML structure instructions

8
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.750
which will only be noted by the systems process in the XML.

9
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.650
Generically speaking,

10
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.950
this is how processing instructions written.

11
00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.220
We have the left angle bracket with a question mark and to close behind the question mark

12
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.650
with a right angle bracket.

13
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.460
Inside,

14
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.080
we have what's referred to as a target,

15
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.350
which is essentially the name of the process in instruction.

16
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.650
And then we have the content,

17
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.450
the actual instructions,

18
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.660
the most common form of content,

19
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.170
his attributes and values.

20
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.090
So we have attribute one equals value.

21
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.120
One attribute to equals value to and so forth.

22
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:35.160
By far the most widely used process and instruction is the one which links an XML file to

23
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.850
an excess lt style sheet,

24
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.780
and this is the only process in instruction that will be used enduring this course,

25
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.950
this is what the command looks like.

26
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.270
The target is xsl style sheet,

27
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.400
and then the content consists of two attributes.

28
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.870
The type attributes,

29
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.350
which has to be text stroke xsl,

30
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.470
and the eight ref attribute,

31
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.750
which specifies the location off the excess lt style sheet.

32
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.950
Let's get some practice on implement in processing instruction in zero to XML Essentials.

33
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.210
Let's open up number eight processing instructions and here we have an XML file with an

34
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.970
excess lt style sheet.

35
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.410
Let's open up the XML.

36
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.250
First of all,

37
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.400
you'll see that it contains the root element called branches and inside that we have a

38
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.050
child element called Branch,

39
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.580
whose first child element is branch manager.

40
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.870
And if I close up the first branch element by clicking on the collapse like on here,

41
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.970
you'll see that the second Branch element also has a first child called branch manager.

42
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.870
On what our excess lt style sheet does is to grab all of these branch manager elements and

43
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.510
their child elements into a new output structure.

44
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.710
It ignores everything that follows the branch manager,

45
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.300
everything that's inside departments.

46
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.090
It just ignores that if you'd like to have a peek at the xsl file.

47
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.290
You'll see that in excess sanity style sheet is essentially an XML document with the roots

48
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.550
element called xsl style sheet,

49
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.180
and then it has a couple of template elements which dictate the output that we're gonna

50
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.850
create.

51
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.240
So this is the line where the bosses element is created.

52
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.350
This is the output root element.

53
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.640
And then he we've got an instruction to look for,

54
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.180
although branch elements.

55
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.580
And each time we find one do whatever these template tells us to on what the template tells

56
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.750
us to do is to create a boss element,

57
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.820
and inside it place all the child elements,

58
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.980
the branch manager.

59
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.650
So it's not place in branch Manager itself that's being replaced by the boss element,

60
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.250
its place in the Children of the branch manager element.

61
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.180
So that's how a style she works.

62
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:12.150
And what we now want to do is to link the XML file to that style feet.

63
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.160
I said earlier that process and instructions gonna be placed either in the pro lock or

64
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.710
anywhere else in the document.

65
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:26.500
The XML style sheet processing instruction has to go inside the prologue.

66
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.160
Naturally,

67
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.420
it can't proceed.

68
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.680
The XML declaration.

69
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.540
That has to be the first thing in the prologue.

70
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:40.770
So the syntax less Stan question mark and then it closes with question mark greater than on

71
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.550
between these two d limiters.

72
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.520
We start with the target,

73
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.750
which is XML hyphen style Street.

74
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.430
And then we have our two attributes type and a dress,

75
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.450
and these could go in any order.

76
00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:08.990
So time has to be text stroke xsl on an eight ref because the excess lt file is in the same

77
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.300
folder as the XML file Weaken.

78
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.830
Simply put,

79
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.420
it's name put.

80
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.490
His branches don't access.

81
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.280
So and that's it.

82
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.550
Let's say about changes.

83
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.150
We've now created a link between the style sheet on this XML document.

84
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.050
So to test that our link is working,

85
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.280
let's go to a website which provides online xsl transformations.

86
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.980
So,

87
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.780
in the same folder,

88
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:47.400
just open up on my transformation dot txt and copy that you are l into your favorite

89
00:05:47.400 --> 00:06:00.850
browser and this is a very useful website completely free for doing online transformations

90
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.850
.

91
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.470
So if you do end up using it quite extensively,

92
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.210
I strongly recommend that you consider donating to the owners of the Web site so they can

93
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.150
keep it open.

94
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:18.150
Let's copy all of our XML so that all on copy.

95
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:26.390
And then we paste that into the XML box and we do the same for the xsl.

96
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:43.880
And the xsl goes into the box marked xsl brackets fo I went to do the transformation.

97
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.480
You simply click on the button marked transform and insert generated fo below.

98
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.200
At the moment,

99
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.530
our style sheet contains no effort,

100
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.900
and here's our output.

101
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.050
That's just copy it into an XML document.

102
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:15.150
So I'm just going to right click choose new text document and replace dot txt with dot XML

103
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.150
.

104
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.950
This is called it outputs.

105
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.390
Yes,

106
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.450
I do want to replace the file extension,

107
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.620
and then we can just open that and paste,

108
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.900
you know,

109
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.600
output so we can see.

110
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.970
Here's the close intact for our route bosses element.

111
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.420
That's the oven intact.

112
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.220
That man is begins.

113
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:46.190
Each of our branch manager elements has created an element called Boss with the original

114
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.990
child elements inside it.

115
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:59.750
So,

116
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.380
as I say,

117
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.850
this is the only process in instruction that will need your in this course.

118
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:10.780
But that's just a quick look at how process and instructions work and a sneak peek at what

119
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.980
will be covering in the next section when we talk about excess.

120
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.170
Lt style sheets
