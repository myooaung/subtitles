1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,050
as we've seen the Web service function can't be used on local XML files.

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,160
On the work around,

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,880
I've suggested,

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,650
is to use a unified XML file.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,280
What if many find your XML isn't really an option.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,080
If,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,980
for example,

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,940
the XML file is over written fairly frequently,

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,570
you'll have to manually updated each time and get a unifying version.

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,330
So in this video,

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:44,290
we'll look at using the new contract function in Excel to enable you to import on ordinary

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:50,870
XML file I non men ified and then can Katyn ate all the roads that it occupies,

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,150
so it can then be treated as being inserted into a single cell.

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,600
So that's going to number six.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,050
Then you can cat function and open up expense claims.

16
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,390
Let's move across to Excel connections on,

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,350
then connect to the UNMIN ified XML file that we've got here called Head Start XML.

18
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,260
And,

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,250
as you can see,

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,580
because it's not,

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:27,340
many find it will take up 363 rows within an Excel worksheet so they can Katyn eight

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,990
function can't be used because it has a maximum of 255.

23
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,900
Paramus is,

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,150
however,

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,360
in Excel,

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,680
2016

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,050
There's a new function called Can Cat,

28
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,550
and it offers much more powerful.

29
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,190
Can cast a nation options.

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,580
Let's have a look at how it works,

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,850
so we go across the data,

32
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,050
get external data from text.

33
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:58,760
Now we work our way into folders six View along files and then import,

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,050
hence dot xml.

35
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,240
We important is the limited.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:14,530
The limiter is other and then unspecified XT qualify and none and we form in the colon has

37
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,280
text on before clicking.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,630
OK,

39
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:25,700
that's just going to properties on Switch off that pesky option problems for file name on

40
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,540
refresh.

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,950
Let's say we want to refresh every time we get in the file,

42
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:38,150
so we've now connected to our XML file.

43
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,550
But when we go back to our other worksheet,

44
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:51,870
we won't now be able to use Filter XML because our XML is distributed across 300 rose.

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,350
So what we need to do is to assemble the XML into a single cell.

46
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,250
So let's just merge a whole bunch of cells.

47
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,250
I think we need to go all the way down,

48
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,680
um,

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,870
emergence center vertically aligned to the top.

50
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,420
And then in that cell,

51
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,050
we use Excel 20 sixteens new can cat function equals Can cat.

52
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,950
And what's new is that I can now simply click on column A.

53
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:30,350
Have the function will automatically contaminate the values in each row.

54
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,250
And the fact that there are 363 rose is not a problem.

55
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,870
I don't have 363 arguments.

56
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:46,350
I only have one argument so I could put if I wanted to another 254 arguments within the cat

57
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,480
function so you can see how much more powerful it becomes than the classic Can Katyn,

58
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,710
a function that we've had for some years.

59
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,380
So when I enter my function and special lead wrap,

60
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:11,450
you'll see that I have my XML file sitting in a single cell.

61
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,750
I won't bother repeating the creation off the formulas.

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:24,050
All I wanted to show you basically is that if the trick of many find your XML isn't really

63
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:24,920
possible,

64
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:31,530
you can still assemble all the lines of your external document into a single cell.

65
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,080
Use in that very useful can can't function.

66
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,890
But what if you don't have Excel 2016?

67
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,390
Unfortunately,

68
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,950
you'll have to do it the hard way,

69
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,090
but it's still not super difficult Let's have a look at how it would work.

70
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,250
I'm gonna make this column narrower.

71
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:55,550
And then here I'm just gonna put in a column of numbers.

72
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,360
We know that there are 363 rows,

73
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,850
but let's say we want to go all the way down to 500 encase the XML ends up growing,

74
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:24,280
so I go down to about 500 on.

75
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:31,550
What I can now do is to get Excel to build a really complex formula automatically.

76
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,640
So I'm using a series of formulas to build another formula.

77
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,350
You'll see what I mean in a moment.

78
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,530
So we start with equals on.

79
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,150
We want to pick up a one.

80
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,910
So we put the A in quotes,

81
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:52,220
and then we say ampersand and click on the one which contains one.

82
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,850
So that gives us a one.

83
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,160
And then we want an ampersand.

84
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,340
So we say Ampersand quotes,

85
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,340
ampersand close,

86
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,150
close.

87
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,550
When I press enter,

88
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,850
you'll see we now have a 1%.

89
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,860
In other words,

90
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,540
are formula needs to say a one m percent a two and percent a three etcetera.

91
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,200
It's on the second row,

92
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:24,630
we can now say equals the cell above followed by Okay.

93
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:32,150
Ampersand de to Anderson quotes Empress end.

94
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,950
Hopefully you can see where I'm going with this.

95
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,070
As we copy it down,

96
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,870
it's gonna take the cell above and then just add on the reference for that road so I can

97
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:53,370
just double click to copy it them myth to the bottom on This is now gonna be my completed

98
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,050
formula.

99
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:02,150
So I can just copy that into note pad time equals,

100
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,670
paste it in there,

101
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,320
lose the trailing ampersand,

102
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,100
and we've got ourselves a formula.

103
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,750
So not a huge amount of work to created,

104
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,850
likened a little of this.

105
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's just make another one of these big cells.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,050
So let's win this a bit.

107
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:40,020
Select a bunch of cells and then Myrdal of these cells left the line aligned and hopefully

108
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,910
my clipboard is still intact.

109
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:49,680
Suddenly placed all of that in and so on.

110
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,040
World run and we've got exactly the same results.

111
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,250
Very untidy formula.

112
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,860
But as you can see,

113
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,450
not so much work to create.

114
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,860
So if you haven't got Excel 2016 this is the approach you can take.

115
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,700
But if you have 2016 and I'm sure that they can cat function is one that you'll be very

116
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,040
keen to start using
