1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,500
continue.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,910
Now look at the various objects which could be placed inside an XML file.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:21,940
We now come to comments and you'll notice that comments can be placed both in the prologue

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,150
and also anywhere inside the root element.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,290
Comments are useful feature found in all coded environments,

6
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,060
which enabled you to insert text anywhere within the document,

7
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,750
which will not be treated as code and will be totally ignored.

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:47,360
So comments of purely for the reference of the person working with the XML file to look at

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,390
how comments are implemented in XML in zero to XML essentials.

10
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:59,900
That's going to number seven comments and I know tools dot xml to insert a comment in the

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,540
prologue.

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,450
Place the comment after the XML declaration,

13
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:10,810
it can't proceed the XML declaration and above the rigs element in terms of the appearance

14
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,640
of a comment.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,850
If you worked with HTML XML comments are identical left angle brackets,

16
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,210
exclamation mark,

17
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,650
two hyphens,

18
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:30,050
then your comments and then to close to hyphens and a right angle bracket.

19
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,450
So in this document,

20
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:42,930
we might say these files can only contain five day tour listed,

21
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:50,150
so that's an example of a comment in the prologue and I'm just gonna copy that.

22
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,750
And let's place one in the root element.

23
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,920
For example,

24
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,150
Special offer expires with the August.

25
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:16,230
Another frequent use of comments in all code in environments is to comment out a section

26
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,350
off your code.

27
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,790
For example,

28
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,970
if we didn't want this element to be taken into account when we use the XML file on this

29
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,250
occasion rather than delete in this section,

30
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,280
we could simply turn it into a comment so it will be ignored when any XML process in its

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,310
done so.

32
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,830
All we need to do is to put the open in tax here,

33
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:44,250
but closing tags where we want the comment to stop,

34
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,750
and then everything between the opening and closing tax effectively becomes a comment and

35
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,750
is therefore temporarily disabled.

36
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,320
And that's all there is to an XML.

37
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,950
Comment.

38
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,270
If you've encountered comments in your HTML code in as you can see,

39
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,550
a completely identical in XML
