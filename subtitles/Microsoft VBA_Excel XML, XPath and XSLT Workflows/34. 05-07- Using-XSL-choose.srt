00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,910
in this video,

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,550
we'll take a look at the xsl choose element,

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,800
which allows you to happen if else if functionality.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,110
So it's going to number seven using excess old shoes and again open up branches.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:28,670
Don't xsl where you can see the file as we left it in the last video.

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:35,150
So so far we have a single test,

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,350
but we have no mechanism for test into the alternative occurrence.

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:47,650
This is where xsl choose becomes useful so we can still use although code we have so rather

9
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,370
than the late in it,

10
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,250
I'm just gonna tablet in and then above it,

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:02,850
we'll put xsl choose an xsl chooses just a shell,

12
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:09,350
so we'll need the clothes in tag off the excess and live.

13
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:17,290
And the mechanism that xsl choose uses to do its test in is to have a child element called

14
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:24,650
xsl when so we now need to change this if to a when and it caused the clothes in.

15
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,680
Tak needs to be changed as well,

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,150
so this becomes the equivalent of our if statement.

17
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:39,450
But what we can now do that we couldn't do with the xsl if is to repeat xsl when as many

18
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,650
times as necessary to test for different possibilities.

19
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,750
On this occasion we only need one test.

20
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:56,910
But what we can also do inside xsl choose is to put a cattle which will only kick in if all

21
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,150
the preceding xsl went tests proved to be false.

22
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,230
So obviously,

23
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,720
on this occasion there is only one xsl went test.

24
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:13,070
But the point is we could have as many as we like and then to say if all of them are falls

25
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:22,220
due the following we used xsl otherwise And of course,

26
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,860
this is not a test We've done all the test in so xsl otherwise simply means if all of the

27
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:36,390
tests proved to be false so obviously out test Waas name is not equal to branch manager.

28
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,240
Hence the otherwise will pick up the circumstance when name is equal to branch manager.

29
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,550
And in that circumstance,

30
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,250
let's say that we want to display the text not applicable.

31
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,440
So because this is a literal string,

32
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,660
we don't need xsl value off.

33
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:03,230
We can just use xsl text and then we have opening and closing tags on.

34
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,450
We don't need any double quotes weaken Just put the literal stream.

35
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,140
So that's how xsl choose works.

36
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,400
The xsl choose itself is just a shell on then xsl,

37
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,470
when with test equals is used to test for all the possible values that you're interested in

38
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:23,470
,

39
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,580
check in for and then you use xsl.

40
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:33,650
Otherwise is a cattle which will only kick in if all of your xsl went tests are false.

41
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,430
So again,

42
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,450
let's save on test.

43
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:55,350
So this time,

44
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,100
when we display,

45
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:05,650
only the branch manager rose older than have not applicable as the department entry.

46
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,290
So that completes our look at condition ALS and to finish off this section and indeed to

47
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:17,090
finish the course will stay with attributes that never look at a very useful feature called

48
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,050
attribute found you template.
