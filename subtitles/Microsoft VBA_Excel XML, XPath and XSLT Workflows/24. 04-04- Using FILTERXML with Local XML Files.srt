1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,450
Although the filter exceptional function is designed to work with Web services,

2
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:22,150
you may occasionally find it convenient to use it with your local XML files in this video.

3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,250
We'll look at a work around for doing that.

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,250
It's going to sub folder before using Filter XML with local XML files.

5
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,890
Let's open up.

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,450
The Excel file will be working with expense claims.

7
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:41,190
So here we've got a bunch of expense claims by staff members.

8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,840
We want to do the equivalent of a V look up to find out the I.

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,950
D first name and last name off their head of department.

10
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,250
But we want to do this from an XML file.

11
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,960
Obviously,

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,020
in some scenarios you'll be able to simply import the XML file into a table on then USVI

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,250
look up index match as appropriate to pull across the data that you need.

14
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,960
But as we've seen,

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,450
the all XML files lend themselves to being imported into an Excel table.

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:22,460
So there will be times where it's more convenient to connect to the XML file externally and

17
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,550
then to use the Filter XML to pull in data from different parts of that XML structure.

18
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,670
There are a couple of limitations.

19
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,430
So let's have a look of the work around that we're gonna use.

20
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,850
Let's create a new work Feet called XML Connections.

21
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:51,450
And the first thing I need to tell you is that this work around has one key limitation.

22
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,050
And that is because we use in Filter XML,

23
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,250
which takes as its first parameter an XML document.

24
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:10,470
The XML file that we connect to can't have more than 32,767 characters because that's the

25
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,090
maximum number of characters which will fit within a cell in Microsoft Excel and for the

26
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,650
Filter XML function to be used,

27
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,650
we have to have the entire XML document in one cell.

28
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,050
So we go across the data,

29
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,930
the feature that we use it,

30
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:38,560
get external data and we simply connects to the XML file as a text file on this operational

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:38,800
course,

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,550
excel to import the XML,

33
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,340
and under normal circumstances,

34
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,350
it will take up several rows.

35
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,450
What we want to do is to have it all imported into a single cell.

36
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,850
So the first work around is to use what's called a min ified XML file.

37
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,050
Let's go back into the train in folder so you can see what this means.

38
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,580
Here's the XML file that will be connecting to hence the XML.

39
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,970
But as I've said,

40
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,550
if we import this,

41
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:16,250
it's gonna be imported on lots of different rose rather than into a single cell.

42
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:23,150
So what we've done is to convert it into what's called a min ified XML file one with all

43
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,670
the spaces taken out.

44
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,610
So we open up heads magnified.

45
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,750
It's exactly the same document.

46
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,590
But as you can see,

47
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,070
all the returns,

48
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,220
tabs and spaces between the elements have been removed.

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,050
So it's just one long string.

50
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,780
This means that when you connect to a text file in this format,

51
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,750
it all comes in into a single cell.

52
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,670
So it's close.

53
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:52,950
Both of these let's get back to excel and connect to the mini find version.

54
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,630
So in the data tab of the ribbon,

55
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,310
we go suit,

56
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,150
get external data from text.

57
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:10,370
Let's just work out waiting to fold a number four view along files the man connect to heads

58
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:10,370
.

59
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,880
Many find because we treating it as a text file.

60
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,210
The text import was it appears so in step one,

61
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:27,630
we specify the Limited instead to will say that the delimit er is other,

62
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,450
without specifying what it is.

63
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,970
And just in case.

64
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,450
Let's say that the text qualify is none,

65
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,110
and then instead,

66
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,040
three we can choose.

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,250
Text is the format,

68
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,180
then we click on finish before clicking.

69
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,580
OK,

70
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,250
it's a good idea to have a look at the properties because there's one property which is

71
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,430
rather irritating on that is that every time you refresh the data,

72
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,750
you're prompted to specify the location of the file.

73
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,030
No idea why that's the default,

74
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,350
but let's switch it off.

75
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,330
And then,

76
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,130
as you can see,

77
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:06,070
you can specify in the frequency of the refresh and you can specify to repress the data

78
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,480
every time you open the file,

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,810
the data formats and of course,

80
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,530
worms apply.

81
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,080
Because we're not bringing this in in a tabular format,

82
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,250
we're bringing it into a single cell,

83
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,450
so click OK when we click OK,

84
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,150
again.

85
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,450
The entire document is now being brought into a single cell.

86
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,250
If I go out to the home tab and speech onward ramp,

87
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,150
we can see our many fine XML format.

88
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:39,550
There are several websites available which will create a unified version off your XML.

89
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,950
We're going to the training folder.

90
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,650
I have the u R l of one of them XML many fire.

91
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,790
So if you want to experiment with this feature,

92
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,950
just visit this u R L Paste in the original XML.

93
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:59,540
It's like on many fi and you'll have a unifying version off your file toe work with.

94
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,050
So now that we have our XML in a single cell,

95
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,250
we can go back to expenses and use Filter XML to navigate our way through it.

96
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:17,570
So let's open the UNM unifying version so we can have a look at the structure so we can see

97
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:23,860
that we need to navigate from heads to hand and then to stop i.

98
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,450
D.

99
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:31,450
Last name first name on we using underscore to split words.

100
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:39,650
So let's put the basic formula in equals.

101
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,400
Phil drinks ML.

102
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,180
The XML document is in our XML connections.

103
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,050
Work feet.

104
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,750
When we click on the cell that contains the linked document,

105
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,780
you'll notice that it's the name of the link document that gets put in because that name

106
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:03,090
has been applied to the cell that we put our expand statement or would slash to indicate an

107
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,250
absolute path.

108
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:12,850
Heads slash head slash stuff on the school i d.

109
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,650
Close quotation marks can be close in parenthesis.

110
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:23,100
When we enter what we've actually targeted,

111
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:31,350
we'd go back to the XML structure is the staff i d of the first of our heads of department

112
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,350
.

113
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,510
In other words,

114
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:40,760
out formulas not quite finished because we're not hoping in on a particular department or a

115
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,750
particular branch,

116
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,510
But we'll leave it like that for this video.

117
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,320
And then in the next video,

118
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,350
we'll finish it off when we talk about X path predicates.

119
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,450
But for the moment,

120
00:07:52,450 --> 00:08:03,120
let's just copy the formula and paste it in so we could pick up the first name and last

121
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,950
name.

122
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:22,240
Since I've said,

123
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,330
these three formulas are purely picking up the details of the first person.

124
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,310
And if we were to copy it down,

125
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,660
we simply get that person's details replicated for every room.

126
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,550
So let's just don't do save out changes.

127
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,990
And in the next video,

128
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,480
we'll discuss the use of expert predicated,

129
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,250
which will enable us to complete these three formulas
