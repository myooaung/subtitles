00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.820
in this video,

2
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.170
we'll look at how you create attributes in excess.

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.250
Lt Starfleet's so that's going to fold it five,

4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.150
Creating new attributes and an open up branches that xsl.

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.900
So we've completed the creation of all the child elements of our person element.

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.270
So here we've got xsl element in Amy Was Person and then inside it,

7
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.130
we've got to stop I d element and then all of the elements,

8
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.710
with the exception of staff I.

9
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.070
D and photo,

10
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.300
that's the elements taken care off,

11
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:54.150
and now we want to create three attributes Roll Branch and Department.

12
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.850
So let's start with the role attributes.

13
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.150
The role will simply be taken straight from the input document,

14
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.820
and it will either be branch manager,

15
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.950
head or staff member in a similar way.

16
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.840
Branch will be taken from the name attribute of the branch element and in a similar way,

17
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.950
department will be taken from the name attributes off department.

18
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.430
So that's not great.

19
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.030
Our first attributes the attributes,

20
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.600
of course,

21
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.250
go inside the element to which they're related,

22
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.050
and that element is person.

23
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.450
Let's just put a couple of spaces into highlight.

24
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.970
What's inside?

25
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.550
What,

26
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:50.850
so here we've got the element person and inside it we haven't element cold stuff I d.

27
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.250
And then we use an xsl copy all to generate all of the other elements.

28
00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.050
So let's now place out child attributes in here.

29
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.580
And as you can probably guess,

30
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.000
justus,

31
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.600
you have xsl element.

32
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.990
The created elements you have xsl attribute,

33
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.380
creating attributes,

34
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.570
name equals role,

35
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:25.620
and then you can use xsl valuable to specify what you want to go inside.

36
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:41.640
That attribute on the role will simply be the name of the parent element branch manager,

37
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.350
head or staff member.

38
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.080
So although it will be the parent of role when we put our experts statement,

39
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.850
our starting point is always the context that set at the template level.

40
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.250
So in other words,

41
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.680
we want the name of the element.

42
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.150
At that context,

43
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.300
we don't need to live down the child access to find it.

44
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.400
We're already at the right position,

45
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.060
so we use name and then in parentheses.

46
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.350
We want to say self Cohen Coulombe,

47
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.680
which has the convenient short cut dot and we think it's a good idea to get rid of the

48
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.150
underscores and perhaps replace them with spaces.

49
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.520
We can use the equivalent of excels.

50
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.050
Substitute function,

51
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.480
which is translate,

52
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.730
works in a similar way.

53
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.880
So translate the original string,

54
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.420
which is provided by the name function comma and then in single quotes.

55
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.160
What do you want to get rid off?

56
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:50.510
What you want to replace younger school comma and in single quotes space and then the

57
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.750
clothes in parenthesis.

58
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.000
That's our first attribute.

59
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:14.580
Let's move on to the branch and let's just open up branches that XML remind ourselves where

60
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.350
the name of the bronze lives.

61
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.350
So the name of the bronze is an attributes of the branch element,

62
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.910
but the relationship of that element to the elements that we've combined into one notes

63
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.250
that is different.

64
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.350
So the branch Manager name is an attribute of the parents.

65
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.200
Where is when we go down to head and start member?

66
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.740
We've got a mover,

67
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.990
something like four or five levels.

68
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.540
We've got to go to staff department departments and then to branch,

69
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.890
so the parent access is rather inconvenient on this occasion.

70
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.500
Fortunately,

71
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.150
however,

72
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.950
experts also has an ancestor axis,

73
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.380
so with the ancestor access,

74
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.880
it doesn't matter how many levels up you have to go.

75
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.350
You're still talking about an ancestor so branch is an ancestor of branch manager,

76
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.750
and it's also an ancestor of head and Start member.

77
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.650
The number of levels you have to go up to get from one element to the next becomes

78
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.350
irrelevant.

79
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.450
So let's go back to our style sheet.

80
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:38.750
So value off can now use ancestor,

81
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.440
and this time there is no convenient shortcut,

82
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.250
so you have to type it longhand,

83
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.370
As you probably remember.

84
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.070
When you type the Axis longhand,

85
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.150
it finishes with two Coghlan's.

86
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.750
So we go along the ancestor access and look the branch.

87
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.850
That's the first location step.

88
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.900
So we finished with a forward slash and move on to the next location step and the next

89
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.650
access.

90
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.280
And,

91
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.660
of course,

92
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.970
having got to brunch,

93
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.000
the next access is the attributes.

94
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:23.480
Access have a long hand for that is a tribute coat on colon.

95
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.130
But this time there is a convenient shortcut,

96
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.230
which is the at sign.

97
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.980
So we simply say at name.

98
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.310
So,

99
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.350
just to recap,

100
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.340
we've got to location steps,

101
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:44.450
the first using the ancestor access to move up an indeterminate number of levels.

102
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:52.450
Then the second lives along the attribute access to find the attribute Cool name.

103
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.050
So that's two of our three attributes completed,

104
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.550
The 3rd 1 is a bit more tricky.

105
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.950
We want to find the department of all of these people.

106
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.910
In the case of head and Staff member,

107
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.150
that's no problem.

108
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.950
They both have an ancestor called Department,

109
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.850
which has an attribute called name detail in the name of each department.

110
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.090
But Branch manager is on the level above departments.

111
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.740
So in other words,

112
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:30.710
the branch manager is not the descendant at any particular department will probably want to

113
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.660
put something like,

114
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:37.200
not applicable or if in our organizational branch managers were part of the administration

115
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.050
department,

116
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.950
we would put administration for all of them.

117
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.320
But the point is,

118
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:48.340
we want to process Bronze manages differently to the way in which we process head and staff

119
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.330
member elements.

120
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.150
So for that,

121
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.470
we'll need a conditional.

122
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.280
We'll talk about conditional in the next video.

123
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.280
So for the moment will stay with these two attributes,

124
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.890
roll on branch and just verify that they're working correctly.

125
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:11.950
So let's say that changes I live across to excel a man just use file open to check whether

126
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.970
it's all working.

127
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.430
So number five.

128
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:25.050
Let's open up branches applying to style sheets on generates our XML table,

129
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:33.210
and here we can see we've got our role branch manager for the first head for the second and

130
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:40.450
then start member until the department changes when we have another head and so on.

131
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.760
So everything's is it should be.

132
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.940
And if we go across the developer and look at the XML map,

133
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:53.740
you can see there's a subtle difference between the icon next to roll in Branch and the

134
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.700
icon next to all of the others.

135
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.130
So we have an attribute icon next to Roll and Brandt,

136
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.670
and we have an element icon,

137
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.650
which is slightly lighter in color next to all of the others.

138
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.070
And as we saw before,

139
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:12.570
we have our people and person elements replacing the original branches,

140
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.450
etcetera.

141
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.350
So so far,

142
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.050
so good.

143
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.940
And in the next video,

144
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.950
we'll move on to look at the use of conditional statements
