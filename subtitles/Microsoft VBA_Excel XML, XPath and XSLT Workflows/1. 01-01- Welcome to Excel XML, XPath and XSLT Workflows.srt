00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,750
uh,

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:16,240
hello and welcome to Microsoft Excel XML experts and excess lt Work flows My name's ground

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,120
gamble on the train on this course on what will cover is basically just about everything

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,580
you could do with Microsoft Excel involved in the manipulation of external data.

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,060
Microsoft Excel is a very XML aware application,

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,330
and there are quite a few things that you could do involved in the manipulation of XML.

7
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,290
We'll start the calls by covering the basics of XML.

8
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,820
So for those of you who haven't worked with exceptional very much before,

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,420
you may find this useful.

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,540
If you've worked with external before,

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,180
you know Alexis works.

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,400
Feel free to just get this section and move onto the next one,

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,460
where we cover the import and export operations within Microsoft Excel.

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,990
We'll look at bringing in XML data on the creation of external maps on the way that you can

15
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:17,270
link XML tables to an extent Man in the next section will move on to locate Microsoft's Web

16
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,980
service,

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,800
filter external functions,

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,170
which enable you to query online XML services,

19
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,220
return an external document and then extract data from any part of that document.

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,450
Use in ex parte statements,

21
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,750
I will talk about the way that experts statements are constructed.

22
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,550
Although these functions are meant to work only with online services,

23
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:45,890
there is a work around which permits you to use them on your own local external files.

24
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,840
So we'll spend some time looking at that work around on just learning how to use expert

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,490
statements in much the same way as you could use.

26
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:54,800
V.

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,670
Look up for ordinary Excel data.

28
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:04,080
We look at how you can use Filter XML to query a local XML file and call in the data that

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,680
you need for your solutions.

30
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,410
In the final section,

31
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,170
talk about one of excels less unknown external beaches,

32
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:17,240
which is the ability to apply an excess lt style sheep as you import XML Documents came to

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,290
Microsoft Excel well,

34
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,890
if it the way that excess lt documents are constructed and we'll learn how to use expert

35
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,660
statements to navigate your way through the Input XML document as you construct your help

36
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,830
with exiled argument.
