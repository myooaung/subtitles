1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,090
and all the examples with you.

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:11,780
So far,

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,930
we've only been working with one axis the child access,

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,050
which is the default and therefore doesn't need to be specified.

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,090
In this video,

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,830
we'll talk about another access that you'll encounter,

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,250
which is the descendant or self access.

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:35,660
So let's going toe hold of five where we finished up our expense claims.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,550
Examples.

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:45,150
Let's just copy that and paste it into folders seven and then open up the completed file.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:52,500
So here's the formula.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,180
We ended up creating and all I want to show you in this video.

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,880
It's how you can avoid having toe always use an absolute pass,

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,360
which,

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,950
if you remember,

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,140
is one that starts with a forward slash,

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,950
and that's fine use in the descendant or self access.

18
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:18,730
So let's look festival at the longhand if I deletes.

19
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:30,050
Forward slash heads forward slash and time descendant iPhone along hyphens Self Colon

20
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:35,950
Coghlan's That's the longhand way of specifying the descendants or self access.

21
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,620
And if I presenter,

22
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:44,480
you'll see I get exactly the same result on what the descendant or self access enables you

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,680
to do is in this case to find head elements wherever they occur.

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,330
within the document without having to navigate through the XML structure,

25
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,130
starting with the root element and then working your way down so you'll find Descendant

26
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,840
ourself used quite a lot.

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,300
What you won't find is the longhand that I've just written.

28
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,640
I rose it like that just to emphasize that this is the access that we working with.

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,650
But the shorthand way of writing it is to forward slashes.

30
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,960
So whenever you see these two forward slashes,

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,630
just remember that this is what's going on.

32
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,060
Instead of having an absolute path which starts at the document,

33
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,280
Root goes to the root element and works its way down.

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,490
You simply use the descendant or self access to find that element wherever it occurs within

35
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,350
a document.

36
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,150
So because it is such a useful shorthand,

37
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,450
you'll encounter this in tax quite a lot.

38
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,030
So hopefully that's just given you more of an idea of what's going on when you see an

39
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,850
expert statement containing these two forward slashes.

40
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:59,690
So that completes our initial look at Expo in the next section will move on to look a xsl t

41
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,050
on will continue using X path in the context of xsl transformations
