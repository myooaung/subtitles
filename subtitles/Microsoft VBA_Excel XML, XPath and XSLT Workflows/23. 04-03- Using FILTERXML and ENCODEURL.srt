1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,350
in this video,

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,180
we'll move on to look at the other two functions which are available when you're working

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,650
with XML in Excel,

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:26,910
Filter XML and encode U R L So in zero fall Web service Filter XML the next part that's now

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,800
go to number three years in built XML and encode u R l To see how these two functions work

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:33,800
,

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,140
we're going to be using a Web service from a free website called Geo Names Torborg.

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:46,230
So let's begin by opening up geo names dot txt And here we've got all the information that

9
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,990
we need to work with this pre site,

10
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,250
and the first thing that you'll need to do is to sign up for a free account.

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,290
And here's the U.

12
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,250
R L at which you can do this.

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,050
So let's just copy that you are l.

14
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:07,820
Then just move into your favorite browser and use the paste and go feature to go to that

15
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,640
you are l.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,350
So the first time you visit the website,

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,250
we'll need to create a new user account.

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,680
Just choose a user name those faces allowed,

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,590
and then just put your email,

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,580
confirm your email,

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,020
choose a password and confirm your password and then go ahead and create an account on the

22
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,770
confirmation.

23
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,110
Email will be sent through to the email address that you supplied.

24
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,550
The email would look something like this,

25
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:42,080
and it will include an activation link so you simply click on the activation link to

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,450
activate your account.

27
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,420
Once he validated,

28
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,980
your account will automatically be logged in and thereafter.

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,770
Future.

30
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,050
You obviously can just click on the log in button,

31
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,180
put in your credentials and log in.

32
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,180
And then there's just one final step you need to perform on.

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,220
That is to going to manage account,

34
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,820
and you get to that by clicking on your user name in the top.

35
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,380
Right.

36
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,120
You'll see you've got the two wings there,

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,090
one for logging up on the other,

38
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,270
which consists off.

39
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,850
Your user name is the managed account link.

40
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,450
So you click on that,

41
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:26,450
and here you have the opportunity to change your user email and to change your password.

42
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:32,850
The thing that's most important for our purposes is to be able to use the free Web services

43
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:32,850
,

44
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,350
and to do that,

45
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,890
you have to click on this link at the bottom,

46
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,990
says he can see it says the account is not yet enabled to use three Web services.

47
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,540
Click here to enable,

48
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,550
So we click on that and then we good to go.

49
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,900
So from now on,

50
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,080
we can use that free Web services.

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,150
There is a limit as to how many requests you can send that day,

52
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,670
but beyond that,

53
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,550
it's all free.

54
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:05,800
So we now click on Website This a Van Web service overview.

55
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,130
These are all the different Web services.

56
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,270
And of course,

57
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,130
the XML column is the one that we're interested in.

58
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,350
Because Excel has an offer an option to use Jason,

59
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,090
it only uses XML using the Web service function that we've seen.

60
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,970
So the Web service that we're interested in using it's postal code search,

61
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,610
which is you can see is available in both XML and Jason.

62
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,950
So let's click on that.

63
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:39,250
And here we have all the possible parameters that you can use with this Web service,

64
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,140
and then we go to the bottom.

65
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:48,340
We confined an example which we can use in Excel with the Web service function.

66
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,550
So let's just copy that,

67
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,750
and I'll add that to the text file.

68
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,640
And,

69
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,030
of course,

70
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,130
when using this girl you simply need to replace the user name demo with the user name that

71
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,850
you chose when you signed up to this service.

72
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,860
And,

73
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,210
of course,

74
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,660
the other thing will need to change is this.

75
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,950
We want to have different postal codes when we actually use this facility.

76
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,850
So let's leave the text file.

77
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,450
It's no open up the Excel file.

78
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,120
We're working with postal codes.

79
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,950
Example,

80
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,750
and inside it you'll find hotel information.

81
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,420
So we've got the address of each hotel and then the rating,

82
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,350
the average rating given by our start members.

83
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,420
And let's say to completely solution,

84
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,550
we need tohave the latitude and longitude off each of these hotels,

85
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,470
and we're going to use a Web service.

86
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,050
To obtain this information,

87
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,050
select three new columns.

88
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,750
The first will contain the XML that we retreat from the Web service.

89
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,180
Then we want the latitude,

90
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,840
longitude,

91
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,650
and it's coming full minutes.

92
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:21,710
The logic of having a separate column for the XML is that both the latitude and longitude

93
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:30,220
can then be extracted from that one cell instead of embedding to Web service calls in each

94
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,450
of these two columns,

95
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,150
and this way of working becomes quite important.

96
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,750
If you're paying for every single call that you make to a given Web service.

97
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,250
So now let's put the Web service function equals Web service.

98
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,950
And as he saw in the previous video,

99
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,830
the only parameter is the URL,

100
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,650
which is a string and which we can just can't be from our text file.

101
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,980
And before we do that,

102
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,390
I'm just gonna change the maximum number of rows toe one.

103
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,910
We don't really need that much detail since we're only interested in the latitude and

104
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,550
longitude.

105
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:17,350
So we called you all of that on paste it in and then we need to make a couple of changes.

106
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:24,360
Festival the postal code that we're looking up is the postal code from cell F to that we

107
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,250
need to tag on to.

108
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,810
And this is where we use encode U R l What it does,

109
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,620
basically,

110
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:38,850
is to take your data on converted into a format which is Earl legal.

111
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,930
In other words,

112
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,980
any characters which were illegal in a URL will be converted to their equivalence.

113
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,490
So,

114
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,300
for example,

115
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:54,530
spaces will be converted to percentage 20 so just not enough to we closed quotes,

116
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,750
then use ampersand.

117
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:07,450
Then we use encode U R L click on it to on close parentheses to end the function.

118
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:13,850
Now we need another ampersand on We reopened the quotation marks.

119
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,290
So the whole thing looks rather strange because,

120
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:16,690
of course,

121
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,250
we can an M percent inside this string,

122
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,740
but as you probably know,

123
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,860
1% a very common in you RL's Well,

124
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,250
you're supplying parameter values.

125
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,470
Then,

126
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:27,810
of course,

127
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,460
the other change we need to make is to replace Demo with our user name.

128
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,370
Let me close quotes,

129
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,950
close parentheses that we're done.

130
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:51,960
We can then copy that formula down and each of the cells in column h will now contain a

131
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,450
slightly different XML document.

132
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:01,690
What I always like to do at this point is to copy one of these XML documents into a text

133
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,550
file so we can take a good look at the external structure.

134
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,050
So let's go back into the folder and create a text document.

135
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:16,550
It's just rename it result dot xml.

136
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,740
Yes,

137
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,950
we do want to change the file extension and then we can just open it and paste in our XML.

138
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,550
So here's our X terminal document.

139
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:38,150
We can lose the double quotes so we can see we have a Roose element of geo names,

140
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,160
and then it's got to child elements.

141
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,950
So it'll result count and code.

142
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,880
So let's just select all of these and tap them in,

143
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,790
and then code has child elements that contain the data that we actually want.

144
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,360
So again,

145
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,640
let's just tap those in on the two bits of information we want their Agassi lacked on LNG.

146
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,750
So in terms of our experts statement,

147
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,950
we're gonna have three location steps G any names,

148
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,830
code a man,

149
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,250
L A T or L N dri,

150
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,800
and in each case,

151
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:25,410
we maybe along the default child access so they can from parent to child each time that's

152
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,750
save this document.

153
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:43,950
And now let's get back to excel so we can hide column H That's Desprez escaped to come out

154
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,270
of copy mode and then create a formula.

155
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,250
So we've got equals Filter XML.

156
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,300
The first parameter is the XML,

157
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,510
which is in our hidden cell H two on the second parameter is our expert statement which

158
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,150
goes inside double quotes.

159
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,030
For an absolute experts statement,

160
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,930
you always start with a forward slash,

161
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:13,000
which represents the root of the XML file and then you put your location steps.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,370
So first,

163
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,100
as we said,

164
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,350
was geo names.

165
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,450
Then we had a code,

166
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,850
and then the latitude is L.

167
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:31,780
A t close quotes close parentheses and we can just copy this inside formula because the

168
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,450
longitude is virtually the same.

169
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:41,420
But let's just paste it in for longitude.

170
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,850
Maintain l a t i N g.

171
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,650
And we're good to go.

172
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:56,150
So we can now coffee this formula down for every road on because basically,

173
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,750
you know,

174
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,850
hidden column.

175
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,950
We return in a slightly different XML result on each road,

176
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:07,450
the experts statement is retrieving a different value each time.

177
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:14,790
So that's our first look at using expert statements with the Filter XML function on.

178
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,770
Just remind you,

179
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:23,830
we have these three locations steps in each case we use in two off the three possible

180
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,800
components we use in the access on the no test.

181
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
We're not using the optional predicated.

182
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,660
It will come to that later.

183
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,540
And as I said,

184
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,040
because the child access is the default,

185
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
it's normally permitted.

186
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,540
So if you did want to write it in,

187
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,250
it would be child Cohen Colon.

188
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,050
In each of these three cases,

189
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:53,750
you will see you get exactly the same result.

190
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,880
But of course,

191
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,090
because child is the default axis,

192
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,350
it's always omitted,

193
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,250
so it's just undo.

194
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:08,150
Although the Filter XML function is normally used in conjunction with the Web service

195
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,880
function,

196
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,650
it's also possible to use it on local XML files.

197
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,450
I will take a look at doing just that in the next video.
