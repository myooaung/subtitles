00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.290
In this video,

2
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.250
we'll look at exporting XML data from an Excel workbook.

3
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.010
So 03 Excel in XML.

4
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.510
Let's now go into the last sub folder,

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.750
seven Exporting XML Data and then open up the Excel workbook Expenses Q one and Q two.

6
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.980
And here we've got a single work feet that contains its,

7
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.140
um,

8
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.250
Excel data.

9
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.260
It's not an Excel table,

10
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:44.150
and the first thing to note is that we can't simply export any old Excel data as XML.

11
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.510
And the reason for this is that unlike formats such as CS,

12
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.080
V,

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.150
XML is not generic.

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.500
Whenever you work with XML,

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.950
you work with a specific XML vocabulary.

16
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.420
In other words,

17
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.750
you're XML Document adheres to a particular structure normally defined by a schemer,

18
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.070
Document said.

19
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.650
We go across the developer,

20
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.450
you'll notice that the export command is unavailable.

21
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.280
So before we can export XML,

22
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.250
we have to link this particular data with an XML vocabulary.

23
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.960
And as we've seen in previous videos,

24
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.410
the way that Excel does.

25
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.350
This is through the creation of XML maps.

26
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.190
So we make the XML source task pain visible by clicking on the source button and then at

27
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.840
the bottom,

28
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.550
we click on XML maps.

29
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.780
We keep on ad,

30
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.150
and now we need to navigate into full the number seven.

31
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.490
And here's our excess defile our schemer document.

32
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.850
We double click on this and when we click OK,

33
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.670
we now have an exceptional man,

34
00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.450
which contains all of the elements defined by the schema.

35
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.810
We can see that this external vocabulary has the simple three level structure,

36
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.590
which excel requires.

37
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.650
We have the root element expenses,

38
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:17.210
the repeated element expense and the Children of the repeated element are the elements that

39
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.650
contain text and which will correspond to the columns with a now Excel data.

40
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.350
You'll see we've got a match or all of the columns with the exception off percentage

41
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.730
reimbursed on.

42
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.790
This is obviously a simple calculation,

43
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.150
which we've done in Excel.

44
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.350
Let's say we need it in Excel frowned convenience.

45
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.050
But because it's not part of the external vocabulary,

46
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.680
we can't export it.

47
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.910
So when we do our mapping,

48
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.850
we simply need to miss out percentage reimbursed.

49
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:58.310
So the 1st 5 columns are all in the same order name branch bait claimed amount claimed and

50
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.450
amount reimbursed.

51
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.090
I could just use the control key to select all of them and then dragged the selection onto

52
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.320
the first column.

53
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.380
And because they're all in the same order,

54
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.650
there automatically mapped in the correct fashion.

55
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.110
Then I want to miss out presented,

56
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.430
reimbursed and Man Date reimbursed on category,

57
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.050
so I couldn't click and control click to select them.

58
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.750
But what I can't then do is to simply drag this election onto Dane reimbursed.

59
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.540
If I do that,

60
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.850
I'll end up with two separate tables.

61
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.450
Let me show you says I drank here because I'm missing out a column.

62
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.190
I've now got Table two and Table one,

63
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.880
which,

64
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.240
of course,

65
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.340
is not what I want,

66
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.290
so I just need to undo that.

67
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.730
So what we need to do is to make sure that the scented reimbursed it's part of the table

68
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.140
before we'd met the last two columns on.

69
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.480
We can do that simply by going to the bottom and drank in the resize handle so that column

70
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.850
F presented Reimbursed is now part of the table.

71
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.760
So now it's safe to select the last two columns.

72
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.260
Dave reimbursed category and dragged him onto column G to complete the mapping.

73
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.400
So now we're going to table tools design.

74
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.250
You'll see we only have a single table,

75
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.730
and while we're here,

76
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:40.420
let's rename it so without having in place,

77
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:48.450
we can now safely export the data as I click on each column you can see in the XML source

78
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.550
task pain the corresponding element.

79
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.950
The only exception is that when I click on percentage reimbursed,

80
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.300
there's no change within the XML source task pain Because that's the only column.

81
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:11.880
It's not mapped to element with that XML mapping in place when we go to developer export is

82
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.860
now available on the interest rate on exports.

83
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.690
Unless just call the file expenses on export.

84
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.350
And here's the exploded final expenses,

85
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.250
Toe XML,

86
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.450
and when we open it,

87
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.510
we can see that it corresponds to the exile structure that we saw in the XML source task

88
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.040
pain,

89
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.550
the columns and now Matt correctly to the appropriate elements.

90
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.850
And as we anticipated,

91
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.740
percentage reimbursed has not been exported because it's not part off the external

92
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.380
structure.

93
00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:01.720
So that's all there is to export in XML from an Excel worksheet and that completes our look

94
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.120
at importing and exporting XML in the next section will live on to look at two very useful

95
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.450
Excel functions,

96
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.650
Web service and filter XML
