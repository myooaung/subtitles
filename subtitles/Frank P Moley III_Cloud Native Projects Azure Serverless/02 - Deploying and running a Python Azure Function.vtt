00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Narrator] So now that we've written our function

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.007
in Python and tested it locally,

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:06.009
now it's time to go ahead and deploy that

4
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.004
out to Azure and run a test against it there.

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.004
So let's jump into our IDE

6
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.008
and I want you to go to the Azure extension.

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:18.006
You'll see that we have the local functions selected

8
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.005
under the functions option,

9
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:22.008
and I already have a resource group selected.

10
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:24.008
And of course I'm logged in.

11
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:26.008
Now I'm going to click the button here

12
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.007
to deploy to function app.

13
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:31.003
It's going to ask me a few questions.

14
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:32.002
The first thing I'm going to do

15
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.005
is I'm going to create a new function app in Azure.

16
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:39.007
I'm going to call this one Python LIL FPM.

17
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.006
And it must be globally unique.

18
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.009
So I would recommend

19
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.008
that you put some sort of an initial behind it.

20
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:47.004
Go ahead and hit enter.

21
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.008
Now it's going to ask me for a runtime stack.

22
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:53.000
Now I can choose 39, which is in preview mode

23
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.007
but I'm going to go ahead and go back to 38,

24
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:58.005
because I haven't used anything in 39 in my kit.

25
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:02.004
Now it's going to ask you for a location for your resources.

26
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.004
You're going to want to pick a location close to you.

27
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.000
And since I'm in the middle of the US,

28
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.008
I'll go ahead and choose east US,

29
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.006
which technically is a little closer.

30
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:14.000
Now it's going to start the process of uploading.

31
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.009
And this is going to take a little while.

32
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.009
Okay, hopefully that didn't take too long for you

33
00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.004
but now we have the function

34
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:25.006
uploaded to our subscription in Microsoft Azure.

35
00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:27.006
What you can see is we can open up

36
00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:32.002
underneath our subscription, the function itself

37
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:33.007
and within there, you'll see

38
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:36.006
that we have our function defined.

39
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:38.001
We can right click on that

40
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.008
and we can execute the function now.

41
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:45.006
We'll go ahead and put in a message,

42
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:50.000
and the message that we are going to send it is hello,

43
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.008
LinkedIn learning from Azure.

44
00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:59.002
And we'll send an account.

45
00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:01.008
Let's send 10 this time.

46
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:06.000
Put our close brace there and hit enter.

47
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.006
Now we can pop up in the message box

48
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.009
and you'll see the new executed 10 times,

49
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.005
each time with that message.

50
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:18.003
Let's jump into the Azure control plane next.

51
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:21.007
So within the portal, I've navigated to app services

52
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:26.000
within my subscription, and I can refresh

53
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.002
and you'll see that our Python function is listed here

54
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:32.004
with the plan that it's under, the region

55
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:34.004
and the fact that it's running.

56
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:38.004
Let's go ahead and open that up,

57
00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:40.006
and you'll see we get some basic details,

58
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:43.008
including our function execution.

59
00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:46.002
You'll see any memory that was consumed

60
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:48.000
and the megabytes that we transferred

61
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.002
over that period of time.

62
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.000
Now, those are the basic details

63
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.001
of our function that we're going to get

64
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:58.002
by simply uploading it to Azure itself.

65
00:02:58.002 --> 00:02:59.006
Now, of course, you can dig in

66
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:01.006
and look at more of the function,

67
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:05.003
but for the most part, that's all we have to do.

68
00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:06.008
Now because we've run this function

69
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:07.009
and we're done with this video,

70
00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm going to go ahead and delete it from Azure

71
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.007
so it doesn't sit around,

72
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:14.004
because remember, it is publicly available

73
00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:16.008
with the anonymous type.

74
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:21.001
So we'll come over here to the hamburger menu and delete it.

75
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:27.001
You're going to have to type in your app name

76
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:31.004
and go ahead and delete it.

77
00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:34.001
And we've now deleted our function from Azure.

78
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:36.003
And that's all there is to deploying it, running it

79
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:39.000
and then obviously deleting it at the end.
