00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.006
(bouncy upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.004
- [Instructor] Now, it's time for our

3
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:08.009
next challenge exercise

4
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.002
and this is going to be using the Java language.

5
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.005
So, we're going to be doing a FizzBuzz program,

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.001
which is another interview type program

7
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.003
but we're going to do this using Azure functions

8
00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.005
with a few caveats.

9
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:23.000
So, first and foremost,

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.006
I need you to create a simple Java template

11
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.006
to be used as a serverless function.

12
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.000
Again, this is the FizzBuzz program.

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.001
You are going to take a request that includes a count,

14
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.000
which is the number to calculate.

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.006
Now, if the number is divisible by three,

16
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:41.006
I want you to log fizz.

17
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:45.000
If it's divisible by five, I want you to log buzz.

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.006
Otherwise, I want you to log the number.

19
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.008
Now, while you're doing this,

20
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.008
I want you to keep track of the number of fizzes,

21
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:56.004
the number of buzzes, the number of fizzbuzzes,

22
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:59.003
which is when it's divisible by three and five,

23
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:01.003
and I want you to return those

24
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:06.006
as well as the original count after the function executes.

25
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.007
So, I'm going to come back with my solution to this problem

26
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:11.006
but I want you to take a stab at it.

27
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:12.007
Something you might consider

28
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:14.003
for a little bit of a challenge

29
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.000
is instead of doing an HTTP trigger,

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.001
maybe do a blob trigger, or a database trigger,

31
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:21.009
where you're pulling that value

32
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.006
when you change it in the object store,

33
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.003
or you could do a message trigger office,

34
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:28.005
something like Kafka or Rabbit.

35
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:30.008
Again, the sky's the limit here.

36
00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:33.006
The purposes of these exercises are just to show you

37
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:36.008
how to interact with Azure serverless functions.

38
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:40.000
Not necessarily the best use cases

39
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
for what you use in the real world.
