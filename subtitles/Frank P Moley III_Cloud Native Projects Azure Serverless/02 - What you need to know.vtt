00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] There's some initial details as well

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.005
as set up on your machine that is needed in order

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.009
to be successful in this course.

4
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.003
For this course, we were looking at

5
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:11.006
a couple of different languages for development.

6
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.000
First and foremost, each operating system

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.008
has its own caveats with installing the languages,

8
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.004
interpreters, compilers and other machinery.

9
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:24.000
The installation of those for each OS

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.005
is outside the scope of this course.

11
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.003
So please refer to the documentation

12
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.005
for your specific OS on those.

13
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:36.001
We'll be using Java as a language for serverless functions.

14
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.000
For Java, we will leverage Maven

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.001
as a dependency management framework to work with.

16
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:45.000
We also will be deploying to a Java 11 backend

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.007
so language compatibility with Java 11

18
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:49.005
is all that is required.

19
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.004
We also will be using Python 38.

20
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:56.005
Now I'm going to be using 3.8.5 specifically on my machine,

21
00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:00.000
but anything within the 3.89 X line of Python

22
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.005
should work fine for this course.

23
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.007
There is some backwards compatibility

24
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.004
to three seven and three six,

25
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:09.004
but again try to stick with three, eight or three nine

26
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:13.001
which is experimental with the current Azure functionality.

27
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:14.008
Now, when it comes to development,

28
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:18.001
the ADE is critical for most developers.

29
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:22.000
Normally I stress to know your IDE

30
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.006
and use what is comfortable for you.

31
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.007
I usually use JetBrains IDE

32
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.007
because that's what I use with work

33
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:31.009
and they are the ones that I am most comfortable with.

34
00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.003
However, Azure is an exception for me.

35
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.005
Personally when working with Azure,

36
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:39.007
I use a very specific IDE

37
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.006
and that IDE is Visual Studio Code.

38
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.000
And the reason that I use that with Azure

39
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
especially with Azure function development

40
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.003
is because it is a very rich integration with some plug-ins.

41
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:54.009
Now I do get similar plug-ins with JetBrains

42
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.007
but they are not as rich as Visual Studio Code

43
00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:58.007
and it's free.

44
00:01:58.007 --> 00:01:59.006
So I'm not going to tell you

45
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.008
that you have to use Visual Studio Code,

46
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:04.002
as I said, often you should use an IDE

47
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:06.004
that is very comfortable for you

48
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:08.005
but when it comes to Azure,

49
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:13.001
it's worth using Visual Studio Code if you have access to it

50
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:15.003
and you can install it on your machine.

51
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:19.000
Now I will use and recommend several specific plugins

52
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.005
for this course.

53
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:23.008
Again, assuming that you're using Visual Studio Code,

54
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:27.005
Microsoft's Python extension, the Java extension

55
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:29.007
and Visual Studio Code from Red Hat

56
00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:33.009
and the Azure account and functions extensions

57
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.006
are ones that I will be using

58
00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:39.002
in Visual Studio Code for this course.

59
00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:41.009
Now, when it comes to the command line,

60
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.003
we're not going to get into the command line a lot

61
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.000
but knowledge of the command line

62
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.001
is important for developers.

63
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.006
And of course the command line

64
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:53.000
is very different for each OS, as well as the shell

65
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.008
that you're using if you're on a Mac or Linux.

66
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.005
Now, if you're using Windows

67
00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:00.009
it can require some in-depth knowledge

68
00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:02.008
when targeting Linux back ends.

69
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:05.006
So again, you do need to know the command line

70
00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:09.009
for your OS as well as what you are targeting

71
00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:13.005
in order to be successful in any cloud native course.

72
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.002
Know as well how to use your tool kits

73
00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:20.003
and specifically, you're going to have Azure functions

74
00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:23.000
core tools installed on your machine.

75
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.002
This is a requirement

76
00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:27.001
to test your serverless functions locally.

77
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:28.005
So you need to go to Microsoft

78
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:31.008
and download the Azure functions core tools

79
00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:34.002
specific to your operating system

80
00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:36.000
and get them up and running.

81
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.004
We're going to play with them a little bit

82
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:38.006
but you do need them up

83
00:03:38.006 --> 00:03:41.002
especially within Visual Studio Code

84
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:43.008
as we're running our debug operations.

85
00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:48.002
And finally, the core aspect of the course is Azure itself.

86
00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:50.003
You're going to need an account with Azure,

87
00:03:50.003 --> 00:03:52.006
the good thing is like every cloud provider

88
00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:54.003
you can get a free account

89
00:03:54.003 --> 00:03:56.008
with nothing more than your email address.

90
00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:59.001
You will need to know some of the basics of Azure

91
00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:01.001
and there are courses to teach you those

92
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:03.000
in the LinkedIn learning library

93
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.004
but we're not going to spend a ton of time in the console

94
00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:08.003
as much as we are in Visual Studio Code

95
00:04:08.003 --> 00:04:10.008
and then going and looking at what happens in the console.

96
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:13.003
So your knowledge doesn't have to be deep

97
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.006
but you do need to have an account

98
00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:16.007
and you do need some base knowledge.

99
00:04:16.007 --> 00:04:19.001
More importantly than understanding that console

100
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.003
is understanding how to read Azure's documentation.

101
00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:24.002
Their tech writers have done a pretty good job

102
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:27.007
at giving us a very clear set of documentation

103
00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:30.005
specifically around Azure functions.

104
00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:31.006
So that's really where you're going to need

105
00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:35.002
to focus your time on and make sure that you can read them

106
00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:38.001
and understand them, especially in the challenge exercises

107
00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:40.000
if you choose to do the extra credit

108
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and go above and beyond.
