00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.002
- Many people talk about serverless,

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.002
however, not everyone has a clear picture

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.004
of what it actually is.

4
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:12.000
This course will not only explain what serverless is,

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.006
but also answer the benefits and negatives

6
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:16.007
of this development toolkit.

7
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:18.004
Hi, I'm Frank Moley,

8
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.009
I'm a cloud native developer, architect, and manager,

9
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.004
working in both public and private clouds

10
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:25.006
throughout my career.

11
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.005
I am passionate about technology as a whole,

12
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:31.002
and sharing that technology with others.

13
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.009
So, let's get ready to learn about cloud native challenges

14
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.007
focusing on Azure functions,

15
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:40.000
as a serverless technology.
