00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:06.007
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:09.006
- So, now it's time for our first challenge exercise

3
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.002
for this course.

4
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.002
We will use Python for this challenge.

5
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.001
Now here's the steps to the challenge

6
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.000
that I want you to execute on.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.007
I want you to create a simple Python template.

8
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:22.006
Of course, if you want to start from scratch,

9
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:24.004
instead of using Visual Studio Code,

10
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:25.008
you're more than welcome too.

11
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm going to use Visual Studio Code in my solution,

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.007
just because it's a lot easier

13
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.001
with Azure Serverless functions.

14
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.004
You're going to create a simple coin-flip program.

15
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:39.006
The purpose of this program is to take an input

16
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:41.002
for the number of flips

17
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:44.002
and to output the number of heads and the number of tails.

18
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:48.004
It's a pretty simple interview type program.

19
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.007
The idea being that we are going to execute it remotely,

20
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.000
using our Serverless function.

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.004
Again, input the number of flips,

22
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:57.005
I do want you to make sure

23
00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.000
that you fully randomize your results.

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.007
So don't just do heads on the first, tails on the second.

25
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:05.000
Use like an odd, even scheme.

26
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.004
I want you to actually use randomization

27
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:10.004
to get either a zero or one, or a true or false,

28
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:12.008
or however you want to do heads and tails.

29
00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:14.005
Now the output requirement,

30
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:16.007
I want you to output the total number of flips

31
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.003
that were requested,

32
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:22.001
then the results of the heads and the results of the tails.

33
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.000
That's all there is to this one.

34
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.007
Go ahead and jump into this challenge

35
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:28.000
and I'll be back with my solution.
