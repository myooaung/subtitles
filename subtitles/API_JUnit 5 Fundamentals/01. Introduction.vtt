00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.320
In this module, you'll learn how to create unit tests with JUnit. I'll start

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.740
by explaining the structure that good tests have to follow.

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.840
Next, you'll learn about the lifecycle of a test,

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.290
then about nested tests to create hierarchies and how

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.440
to give them custom display names.

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.590
You'll also learn about the assertion methods JUnit

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.340
provides, how to disable tests, assumptions,

8
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.280
how to use interfaces and default methods in tests, and how to

9
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.040
repeat a test a specific number of times.

10
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.490
After this module,

11
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:51.000
you will have the knowledge to create unit tests for most of your requirements for JUnit 5. Let's get started.
