At the time of this recording,

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,680
JUnit comes with a built‑in extension, TempDirectory, that

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,230
creates and cleans up a temporary directory if a non‑private

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,380
field in a test class or a parameter in a test or lifecycle

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,140
method is annotated with TempDir.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:27,040
The type of the field or parameter must be path or file.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,340
Here's an example of this extension in a test method.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,840
After the method finishes, the directory and its content will be deleted.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,600
However,

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,660
most extensions are packaged and maintained in separate libraries.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,410
On the Wiki of the JUnit 5 GitHub repository,

12
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,540
you can find a page about third‑party test engines and extensions.

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,940
There are some extensions for running tests with other engines. But as you

14
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,540
can see, most of the extensions are for JUnit tests.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,640
There are extensions for Docker and JPA, for example.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,370
Also, there are projects, such as JUnit Pioneer, that pack many extensions

17
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:19,440
into one dependency. On JUnit's GitHub, you can find another repository

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,820
that contains a collection of sample applications and extensions for

19
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,500
JUnit. About extensions in particular, there's a project that, at the time

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,730
of this recording, contains two sample extensions that show you how to use

21
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,440
ParameterResolver,

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,510
which we already covered in this module, and

23
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:46,540
TestTemplateInvocationContextProvider and TestTemplateInvocationContext.

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,140
Take a look at the code of these extensions. And if

25
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:58,000
you have questions or problems, don't hesitate to contact me. All right, let's wrap up this module.
