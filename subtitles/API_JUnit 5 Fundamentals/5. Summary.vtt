00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.760
In this module,

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.910
we have reviewed all the API differences between JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 from the

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.630
package that contains all the classes and annotations to how some JUnit 4 rules

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.640
are replaced by JUnit Jupiter assertion methods. If you want to migrate your

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.340
JUnit 4 or even JUnit 3 tests to JUnit 5,

6
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.650
you can do it gradually. By using the JUnit Vintage and Jupiter engines,

7
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.510
you can have both types of tests on the same project at the same time

8
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.090
without conflicts. Finally, you learned that the JUnit 4 extension

9
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.440
mechanism is not supported in JUnit 5. However,

10
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.900
some selected types of rules can be executed on JUnit

11
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.160
Jupiter with adaptor extensions to enable a gradual

12
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.940
migration to the new extension model.

13
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.630
With this, we reach the end of this course. We have covered

14
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.840
topics like the importance of unit tests,

15
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.630
the new architecture of JUnit 5,

16
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.840
dynamic and parameterized tests, and the extension model of JUnit 5.

17
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.250
But remember,

18
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.840
JUnit is just a tool. I encourage you to learn more about unit tests in general.

19
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.040
Remember that you can contact me if you have questions or problems.

20
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:37.000
Thanks for watching this course. I hope you had a great time learning about JUnit 5. Take care, and bye for now.
