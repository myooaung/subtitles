00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.850
If you have watched the module introduction to JUnit 5,

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.250
you'll remember I showed you the minimal configuration

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.400
to run JUnit 5 tests with Gradle.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.310
Starting with version 4.6,

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.940
Gradle provides native support for executing JUnit 5 tests.

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.750
You only have to declare the JUnit dependencies and,

7
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.140
in the test section, specify useJunitPlatform.

8
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.940
It can take options to filter tests by tags,

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.340
which we'll review later in this module, or by test engine.

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.760
If you want to filter tests by package, class,

11
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.740
or method, you'll have to use the filter option instead.

12
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.440
This way, with includeTest or excludeTest,

13
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.430
you can specify a test class and its corresponding method under any package.

14
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.940
Or with includeTestsMatching or excludeTestsMatching,

15
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.880
you can use wildcards, for example to exclude all tests from a package.

16
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.080
And within the test task,

17
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.760
you can provide configuration parameters for JUnit as systemProperties,

18
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.440
either one or many.

19
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.840
All right, let's review how to filter tests with Gradle.

20
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.220
I have opened the Gradle project that you can find in the

21
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.540
directory of the demos of this module.

22
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.340
At the end of the build.gradle file in the test task,

23
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.440
I'm going to add an option to execute only the test classes of

24
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.540
the package com.wiredbraincoffee.reward.tests.

25
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.830
You can import the changes if you want. And in the terminal,

26
00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.440
I'll execute the command gradlew test.

27
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.840
Great.

28
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.210
Now, by default,

29
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:14.940
the test report is generated in the directory build/reports/tests/test.

30
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.740
There's an index.html file that you can open in a browser.

31
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.940
Here it is.

32
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.040
If you click Packages, you'll see the tests executed by package.

33
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.710
Of course, in this example,

34
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.340
there's only one package. Nineteen tests were executed,

35
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.340
one ignored.

36
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:47.000
And here, we can see the classes and, for each class, the tests that were executed.
