00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.970
In this module,

2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.980
you have learned how to run tests from the console using the

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.760
ConsoleLauncher, a standalone JAR that includes all the

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.140
dependencies to run JUnit tests.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.880
Then, I showed you how to run tests with Gradle and Maven

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.720
using configuration options to include and exclude tests and

7
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.740
how to use tags for this purpose.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.840
Finally, you learned about the concept of code coverage,

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.340
a metric that indicates how many lines of your code are executed by your tests.

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.390
I showed you how to get coverage reports in Maven and Gradle

11
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.600
using JaCoco and even how to fail the build in case your tests

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.140
don't meet the coverage percentage.

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.000
I'll see you in the next module. Take care, and thanks for watching.
