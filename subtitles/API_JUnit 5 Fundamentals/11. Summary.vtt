00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.180
in this module,

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.740
we have talked about a lot of topics that are the foundation of this course.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.490
We talked about types of tests, especially unit tests and why they are important,

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.740
about JUnit, how it works.

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.740
We talked about why Junit 5 was redesigned and divided into three projects,

6
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.740
JUnit Platform, JUnit Jupiter, and JUnit Vintage.

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.890
And you learned about the internals of this new architecture.

8
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.700
About IDEs and build tools,

9
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.010
you learned how IDEs work with JUnit and how to configure

10
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.040
JUnit 5 in Gradle and Maven projects.

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.920
Finally,

12
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.640
you learned about the JUnit Platform Launcher to use a different version

13
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.250
of JUnit from the one bundled with an IDE and the JUnit Platform Runner

14
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:06.000
for tools that don't support JUnit 5. I'll see you in the next module. Take care, and thanks for watching.
