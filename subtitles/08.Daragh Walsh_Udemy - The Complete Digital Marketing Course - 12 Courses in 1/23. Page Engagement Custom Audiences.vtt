In this video you are going to learn how to create a page engagement custom audience.

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.320
And this is a fantastic customer audience that you can build even if you don't have any website traffic

3
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.270
or an email list so you can actually see here that I've already created it.

4
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.250
And really this is a custom audience of people who have engaged with your Facebook page and you can

5
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.710
see here for me now it's ten thousand five hundred which is actually a lot bigger than my email list

6
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.030
customer audience.

7
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.660
And the Web site traffic costs more insults build up so far.

8
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.930
So this is a really cool custom audience that you can build straightaway if you've had some engagement

9
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.460
on your Facebook page.

10
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.130
So to get started and set it up really what you want to do is firstly come into your ads manager once

11
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:55.930
again and come down into the audience's top once that opens up then just click on Create audience click

12
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.460
on custom audience and come down here and select the option to create this custom audience from a list

13
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.110
of people who have engaged with your content on Facebook.

14
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.650
Now as you can see you can create a number of different types of engagement audiences.

15
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.630
But we're focusing here in this video on the page engagement custom audience.

16
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.090
Now once in here again you can see that you can set the parameters for this custom audience.

17
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.180
So if you are the admin for a number of different Facebook pages you can get selected from the drop

18
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.840
down here and you have the option of who you want to include in this page engagement custom audience.

19
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.350
Now by default it is set to everybody who's engaged with your Facebook page.

20
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.320
But if you see the drop down here there are a number of more targeted custom audiences for page engagement

21
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.330
that you can set up so anybody who's visited your page.

22
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.330
People have engaged with any post or people who have clicked on any call to action.

23
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.040
People have sent the message to your page people save your page or any post.

24
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.080
Now as the engagement's on my Facebook page is not happy it's not that big a page.

25
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.720
I'm just going leave it by default to everybody who's engaged my page and even over the last 365 days

26
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.700
you can change that really depending on how narrow you want to focus the audience tend to simply then

27
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.480
just put in the audience names a page engagement

28
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.370
because an audience might be good to put in the time frame as well.

29
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.590
I'm just going to make sure label this is number two because I've already got one create it.

30
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.760
So all you need to do then is go ahead and click Create the audience.

31
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.960
Now remembered that it can take up to 30 minutes for your audience to be ready to use.

32
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.400
And as it says here Facebook will notify you when your audience is ready and you'll see a status in

33
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.230
the audience manager.

34
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.230
Now the next steps once you've got it set up is to create an audience using that audience.

35
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.600
And this type of engagement custom audience can be great to maybe target people who engage with your

36
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.700
page but not like to your page.

37
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.790
So you can create a likes campaign using this campaign.

38
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.990
You can also exclude this audience from a campaign if you want and you can also use this audience to

39
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.910
create a look alike audience.

40
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.680
So using this source audience people who engage your page to build a much larger lookalike audience.

41
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.320
Now as you can see the page engagement pro-stem audience Issaq when I'm set up here it's just populating

42
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.230
but I've already set this up and you can see that it's ten thousand five hundred So that's a quite a

43
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:56.350
big custom audience and one that you can use very quickly very easy to set up and a great source of

44
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.810
audience to later on.

45
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.910
Build a look alike audience.

46
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.600
So now that you know how to set up a paging a human custom audience go ahead and set it up for yourself.

47
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.220
Following the steps that you've learned in this video.
