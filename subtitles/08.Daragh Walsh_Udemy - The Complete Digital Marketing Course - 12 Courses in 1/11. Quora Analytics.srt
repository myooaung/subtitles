00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:07,790
In this video you will learn how to analyze your curious stats in order to know how to grow.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:15,330
And also I'm going to show you how to tracking Google Analytics how much traffic all these curagh answers

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,960
are actually delivering to your site and I'll show you had to set it up so you can even track how much

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,800
traffic one individual question is bringing in.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,840
So first let's get started by looking at the curious stats to access them.

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:36,600
You can just come and click on your icon and then click on Staats and you can see your answer views

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,110
of votes and shares over the last 30 days and you can extend that out if you wanted three months or

8
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,030
all time as well.

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,260
Now below here you can just see a view by day by day.

10
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,490
A graph of that.

11
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:59,330
And then over here perhaps the most interesting part is the number of answer views by question.

12
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,400
And so the top question here has the most amount of cancer views.

13
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,810
This is really helpful to know because then you can continue to answer more questions like your top

14
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,720
questions and that will allow you just to get a lot more answers views and exposure across curagh.

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:22,870
So what I would do is have a look at my top question look at the way that I laid this sage and maybe

16
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:29,680
use a similar format in future because obviously this was successful and it's got a lot of votes.

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,150
It's got a lot of views.

18
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:38,560
And what I could also do is not only look at the format of how I answered that but also come into the

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,860
question as well.

20
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,000
And maybe I could have a look at these questions.

21
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,520
That are related.

22
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,160
I continue to answer those related questions.

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,830
And again I could answer those later if I wanted to add those to the list.

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,360
So the easy way to grow and cure is just to do more of what is working and continue to answer related

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,840
questions to your top answers.

26
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,940
Now the Stotts is pretty basic.

27
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,130
Here on Q&amp;A.

28
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,460
But probably that's all you really need to see.

29
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,550
You just want to see what your top answers are and answer more questions like that.

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,780
Now it is interesting to see how many views we're getting.

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,470
But the real test of the return on investment for our cure a marketing efforts is to understand how

32
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,300
much traffic that is actually driving to our Web.

33
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:38,620
And so we but we really want to see like I can see here in Google Analytics is how much traffic an individual

34
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,970
question is bringing.

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,030
And so this is pretty good I can see that.

36
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:51,870
Four hundred and fourteen sessions in a 30 day period just from one questioning curagh and also that

37
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,520
this has actually led to 54 e-mail sign ups.

38
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,290
So that is a really great result from answering a question on curagh and I'll show you the question

39
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,150
here.

40
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,170
OK.

41
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,920
Is Google Analytics.

42
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:12,270
And so the way that I can understand and get that information in Google Analytics is really by using

43
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,540
a special link at the end of my question here.

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,830
So if I open this up I go to edit this I show you what the link looks like and then I'll show you how

45
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,060
to create that link.

46
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,610
So maybe I can see this.

47
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,610
I get it.

48
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,990
Well essentially this is the way that we understand and get this information in Google Analytics is

49
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,170
by creating this special link.

50
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:51,070
So to create a special link what you want to do is go ahead and type into Google Google Analytics you

51
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,290
are our builder.

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,470
And that's going to bring up this free tool from Google Analytics where we can really input the page

53
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,450
on our Web site that we want to send people to from our cure.

54
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,540
QUESTION So the next thing we need to put in is our campaign source.

55
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,820
So it's going to be curagh our medium is social I mean meaning people are coming here organically through

56
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,730
that social network and then we want to put in our campaign name and I'll show you what this looks like.

57
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,380
You can see our campaign name.

58
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:31,050
We can see in Google Analytics under our campaign's report and then if we click in we can see the source

59
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,210
we've put in and the medium curagh social.

60
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:41,500
So the information that you put into this your builder is what you we're going to see in your Google

61
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:49,690
Analytics reports and if you use this link then if you copy this link and then you paste you use that

62
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,100
link in your cure answer.

63
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,810
So I'll paste this in that.

64
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,840
Now anytime anybody clicks on this link and comes through to my Web site that's going to be recorded

65
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:10,420
in Google Analytics and then I know definitely where I'm getting my traffic from curagh how many visits

66
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:18,340
and email sign ups that is contributing to and even what individual questions are delivering the most

67
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:25,240
amount of traffic and that is really the most accurate way to make sure that your cure efforts are paying

68
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:32,080
off and we to see which are the questions not only get the most views but the questions that really

69
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
get you the most.

70
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:40,780
Web site visits and say e-mail sign ups or even a Cobi sales on your product.

71
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:49,020
So now that you understand how to analyze your curagh stats and to create the links with the world builder

72
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,700
so that you can track this in Google Analytics.

73
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:58,720
Go ahead and do it for yourself so you can really track the return on investment for your cure and marketing

74
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,250
efforts.
