00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.710
In this video you're going to learn how to grow your Facebook page.

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:10.520
Would Facebook insights so to access Facebook sites you want to click on the insides tab at the top

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.080
of your Facebook page.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.390
Once you're launched in the first report you're going to see here is the overview report.

5
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.120
And this will give you an overview of some of the key metrics from your Facebook page over the last

6
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.880
seven days by default.

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.670
Now if you do want to change the time frame you can select today yesterday the last seven days or the

8
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.530
last 28 days.

9
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.670
I know you can see then all of those metrics really on the last 28 day basis if you want to go beyond

10
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:51.230
28 days you also have the option there to export the data and you can export up to 180 days at a time.

11
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.080
So you can see like maybe this quarter or this month set the dates and then export the data.

12
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.250
If you do want to get that longer term view now while this overview report is great to get a snapshot

13
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.720
of your performance your Facebook page to get the insights for how to grow.

14
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.130
We really want to come into the individual reports in the sidebar here.

15
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.870
So let's come into some of these individual reports to see how we can grow our Facebook page.

16
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.230
Well first thing we want to know is OK how are how has our growth rate and how are we doing here we

17
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:34.990
can see a graph over the top in terms of our page follower's up and down over the last.

18
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.020
We can change this to month quarter or week.

19
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.460
And one thing to note here is or whether we might be wondering is what's the difference between followers

20
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.440
and likes and why is there two different charts for this.

21
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.270
Well this is a little bit confusing when you see it for the first time.

22
00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.000
But if I come to a Facebook page here I can show you this example if I like a Facebook page you can

23
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.110
see that I automatically follow the Facebook page as well which means that I will see their content

24
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.290
in my news feed.

25
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.240
And I get notifications of events and suggested live videos etc. However I can on follow up page and

26
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.290
still like a page which means I won't be seeing their content in my news feed.

27
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.470
So why would Facebook even set this up it seems a bit confusing.

28
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.990
I think the key idea is that you could follow a page but not necessarily like the page.

29
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.790
So it kind of gives that that allows you to have that privacy if you want so people don't know what

30
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.320
pages that you like.

31
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.430
And it's a little bit confusing but I think it's for privacy reasons except for I think in terms of

32
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.950
a business you shouldn't really be too worried about this.

33
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.220
The number you should want to be focusing on is actually the followers because the followers have opted

34
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.860
in to see your content in their news feed.

35
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.340
And if we look at the numbers here I actually have more followers 23000 than Page Likes so more people

36
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.730
have opted to see my content in their news feed than actually wanting to publicly shared things like

37
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.280
the page.

38
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.320
It's only about a 3 percent difference for me here so it's not huge and nothing to worry about.

39
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.760
But it is a little bit confusing when you see it for the first time and that's why I just want to explain

40
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.560
it to you.

41
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.090
Bottom line focus on the followers and really just worry about that.

42
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.420
Now when the followers report here you can see net followers because you probably will have some on

43
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.290
follows and they are shown these red graphs here.

44
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.890
So I can see sometimes by three five on Fallen per day.

45
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.610
And if we actually look at this benchmarking tool here I can see that on average per day getting about

46
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.270
three on follows and that's the same as the last period.

47
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:12.720
If we look at organic follower's this period I'm getting there 51 a day last period about 79.

48
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.560
So a little bit then paid follower's none because I've been in promotions in the last couple of periods

49
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.040
and then non-followers in general we can see 47 per day.

50
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.520
And then 75 per day in the last period so last period is definitely a bigger one for me always putting

51
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.620
out more content.

52
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.180
And that's why I was getting better results there.

53
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.700
So that's that's a handy little tool just to check how you're doing compared to the last period.

54
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.980
And then here we have where your page fall has happened.

55
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.260
And you can see on the page it's going to be the vast majority of them here or you may be seeing the

56
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.820
option of it hasn't been categorized and they're not sure where that's coming from.

57
00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.630
So this report can sometimes be helpful but not always so helpful.

58
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.080
Okay.

59
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.850
And then moving on to the reach report this is really where it starts to get interesting and we can

60
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.110
see how many people are actually seeing our posts on a daily basis so this will depend.

61
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.410
When you post you can see it really spikes when I've posted it here.

62
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.740
And then the day is over.

63
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.630
I don't post obviously there's not a lot of people going to see my content content.

64
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.960
So that's why it's important to regularly put a content if you want to get people to see your posts.

65
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.010
They're coming down we can see reactions Commines shares.

66
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:46.920
And once again we can see those average on a daily basis and they'll probably pretty closely coincide

67
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.250
with the posts up there.

68
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.410
Reactions.

69
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.840
OK.

70
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.110
Someone likes Baree.

71
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.910
The key thing to note is there's your trough is going to spike when see purÃ©e posts.

72
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.080
Now let's come down to the actual actions on page.

73
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:09.280
It is pretty interesting because actions on page are going to be when people click on this button here

74
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.190
or say if you got a phone number is a local business that they click through there or even click through

75
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.180
to your web site link.

76
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:23.320
So you can see Web site CLECs phone number clicks action button clicks get directions clicks user the

77
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.540
total actions on Page and depend on your type of business what you really want.

78
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:35.270
So I can see who click the action button which is the key thing that I want them to do on my page.

79
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.660
And obviously there's no directions because it's an online business.

80
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.830
No phone numbers.

81
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.890
So it is good to come in here and see how effective that button underneath your cover image is and how

82
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:54.430
many people are actually clicking on it and you'll see that in the actions on page report coming down

83
00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:01.920
to the posts reports is probably one of the most interesting places to spend a bit of time and keeping

84
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:09.190
to look at is when are your fans online and you can see here that in this graph there's definitely a

85
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:20.830
peak on Friday Thursday Friday biggest days Sunday Monday Tuesday less so and although it is pretty

86
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:27.250
consistent at four o'clock on Thursdays and Fridays would be a very good time for me to maybe start

87
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.700
a competition or something like that.

88
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:34.150
And the maximum amount of people is and then for the other days of the week really around 4:00 o'clock

89
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.980
is when most of my audience are online.

90
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:43.660
So that's really a good indicator of when I should be setting my posting schedule coming down in terms

91
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.510
of the post types.

92
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.020
We can have a look at them here.

93
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.880
This really shows us all reach for each posting engagements on each post.

94
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.950
And a quick summary of what the post looked like.

95
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.040
So we've been scanning day in here I can see that if I click into this that could I create more posts

96
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.220
like this that got a larger reach and engagements.

97
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:15.820
So what you should really be doing is having a look at these posts that had a much bigger than normal

98
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.490
reach and engagement.

99
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:23.170
So I can see the reach the bigger the graph is in the bar here is bigger here you can you really want

100
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.470
to be making more posts like this.

101
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:32.320
Here I actually shared a resource list of fake news that was helpful to people and I just said you know

102
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.620
thumbs up if you like and even feel free to tag friends which I think some people do.

103
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.060
Did they share.

104
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:45.580
So this was a good post because it was a helpful resource and people wanted to share it with their friends

105
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:52.120
then so it's always good to remind people to actually like a post or tag their friends and that will

106
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.970
help you get increased engagements.

107
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.610
So looking down on that more

108
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.770
again just have a look at those top posts that you've made.

109
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.290
Again I said feel free to tag friends and thumbs up if you like.

110
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:15.860
You can see there's been six shares and so that's how you get more people to really see your posts by

111
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.810
giving instructions like that and sharing helpful things with them.

112
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:27.830
So the key thing to do on this post's pagers that come in have a look at the time that you should really

113
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:35.340
be posting on the days and then have a look at those posts that have been most successful for you and

114
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.740
even copy that format for future posts in the future.

115
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.100
They're coming down let us have a look at.

116
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.880
There are some other reports here like events.

117
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.250
Now I haven't set any up and but if you're a local business that's something and important you want

118
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.230
to be looking at closely.

119
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.780
Also if you're putting a lot of videos on your Facebook page there's a separate report showing the number

120
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:00.980
of minutes watched.

121
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:08.080
I don't have a lot on this page but you can see that they showed the mini views over the last time frame

122
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.390
the 28 days or whatever it is the timeframe that you set last seven days.

123
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.950
And down here is where it gets really interesting as well the people's report.

124
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.680
So this will show you really the demographics of your audience.

125
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.870
And this is the interesting thing you can see the demographics.

126
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.670
And by your fans and your followers.

127
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.420
Explain the difference between that.

128
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:42.490
But you can see that it's almost identical that really there's this strong skewed towards males of 25

129
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:48.480
to 34 in both the fans and followers by 25 percent.

130
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:57.580
If we come to people reached again 25 percent men in that age bracket and even the people who are engaged

131
00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:04.360
are actually even more so 26 percent male males of that age range.

132
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:11.290
So this is an interesting distinction between not only here fans our followers are but really who are

133
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.370
the people who engage with your posts.

134
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:20.110
So what you want to be true doing is really keeping this demographic in mind what are going to be the

135
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:30.610
pain points the problems that a person a man of 25 to 34 for your for say digital marketing What are

136
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.230
you going to be the type of problems that they have.

137
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:40.480
And then to create more content around that speak to them directly in your examples that you're using

138
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:48.160
try and create an example for a guy of that age and really tailor your content towards them so they

139
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.690
can see themselves in your example and the problems that you are pointing at.

140
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.830
And that's just going to make them even more engaged.

141
00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.760
And down here as well you can even see the country and the city and the language.

142
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:08.680
So again you want to be serving your content and creating content that really relates to your most engaged

143
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.940
people.

144
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:20.470
So the U.S. or maybe even in city in India in English of that age great age range and it's just very

145
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:28.240
helpful to come in here and use this information to build an avatar or a buyer persona for your fans

146
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.160
and for your ideal customers.

147
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.650
So the peoples are extremely helpful definitely come in here and check that out.

148
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.780
And below that we have messages.

149
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:43.260
If you've enabled messages on your Facebook page you're going to see the total conversations here.

150
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.820
I've disabled them.

151
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:50.560
And again if you set up like a Facebook store you're going to see the number of orders here as well.

152
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:56.020
But the key report's I think everybody is going to want to look at it especially the people report.

153
00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:01.720
So you understand the demographics of your most engaged people your post types.

154
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.840
So you can really understand when your funds are online.

155
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.640
The days of the week to post and the type of content to post and also then just keep in mind you know

156
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:17.500
how you're doing in terms of your followers because the more followers you have the more people are
