00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:06,410
In this video you're going to learn how to add an About section to your Facebook page to give you an

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,110
example of why this is important.

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:14,390
Let's have a look at an existing Facebook page and you can see down here in the right hand side that

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:20,450
there is an Abiud section which includes a map an address a phone number and even the opening hours

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,970
in the popular times.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,590
Now this is going to be especially important if you are a local business so people can easily find your

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,560
business.

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,520
And if you want to add this and come back to your Facebook page click on the bad section in the left

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,180
hand side bar and you're going to see the option to opt in misinformation here.

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,630
You may also see some other options like this a way to add in the story and tell more people about your

11
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,140
business and Facebook are always adding little features like this in.

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,730
So if it appears slightly differently when you see it don't worry.

13
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,390
Now you can see here that you can edit the phone number email Web site.

14
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,960
You can even add some other information there as well if you want and if you're not seeing an option

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:18,920
to buy a location you can just click on the three dots here and you can come and edit page info and

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,630
then you will see the option to the phone number of Web sites.

17
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:32,130
Select or de-select if this place has an address on it so you can just add it in and you can even add

18
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,120
ins any opening hours here.

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,090
So that really appears like we saw in the example.

20
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,780
So it's the same information there.

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,880
It really just scrolls down.

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,610
So for every business it's going to be slightly different.

23
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,790
What do you put in here.

24
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,490
And once again the best way to really know what to do if you're not so certain is to use that search

25
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,680
bar to look at a top competitor and really have a look at what they are doing.

26
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:05,030
But it is another piece of prime real estate on your Facebook page and it can really help drive traffic

27
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,830
or sales because it's telling your customers exactly where to go.

28
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,740
So once again to set this up come down into the left side bar click in the band section and if you need

29
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,480
to click the three dots here and edit your page in for.
