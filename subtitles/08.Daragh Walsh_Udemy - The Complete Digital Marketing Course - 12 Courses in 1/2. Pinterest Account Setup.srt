00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:07,450
The first step to getting your business in front of 200 million people on Pinterest is to set up a Pinterest

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,930
business account so to do that you want to go to Bisan stop Pinterest dotcom and go ahead and join as

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,570
a business.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:23,080
Now in here you can put in your business name or set up a Pinterest profile for your personal brand.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,780
Now I do want to say that if you do already have a personal Pinterest account and you want to use Pinterest

6
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:34,780
as a personal brand all you need to do instead of setting up a new profile is to go into your Pinterest

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,470
profile and then in settings you can convert it to a business profile.

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,040
And the reason that you want to set up a business profile either for a company or for a personal brand

9
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:51,370
is because the business isn't Pinterest profile will give you Pinterest analytics and it also enable

10
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,110
you to advertise directly on Pinterest if you want.

11
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,250
So you need to do is go ahead and fill out the details.

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,250
And I'm just going to fill this as my own name and then I'm going to go ahead and create create and

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,310
it can't so just select whatever language and country that's suitable for you.

14
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,780
And then we want to pick three things your audience cares about.

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,290
So I can say for me education

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:32,580
technology and I can also say maybe 10 here means OK or inspirational quotes maybe better.

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,200
And now we've created our Pinterest business that can't.

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,510
If we come into our profile here we can see it is pretty bare at the moment.

19
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,210
But that's really the first step to getting set up on Pinterest to go ahead.

20
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,730
Pinterest of business dotcom and create your Pinterest can for your business.
