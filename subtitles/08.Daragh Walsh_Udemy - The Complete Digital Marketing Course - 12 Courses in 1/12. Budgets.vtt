00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.450
Now the final piece in the onset level is to define your budget and Cheryl.

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.710
So just remind you again we're still in the sounds great tool at the outset level.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.420
Final piece here is bhajis and said Joel when we can actually get this done pretty quickly.

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.200
But it is important that you understand the different options here for your campaign.

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.780
Now by default Facebook will suggest a daily budget for you and you can see this.

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.230
This is popping up for me in my example as 20 euros per day.

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.570
Now you can edit this very easily just clicking on it and changing it around.

8
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.970
Now one thing that you should keep in mind as you set your daily budget is that there are minimums on

9
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.450
Facebook and those minimum daily budgets will that will depend on the campaign objective that you have

10
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.990
chosen.

11
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:56.160
So for example if I try and put in one euro here as my daily budget I'm going to go and get a notification

12
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.120
here and it says the budget for this odd set must be at least five euros and that's because my campaign

13
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.100
objective is really to get clicks to a Web site on the minimum budget for that type of campaign is â‚¬5

14
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.620
per day.

15
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.700
So I'm going to actually say that this is 10 years maybe low.

16
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.210
The daily budget once you have set up the next thing to really define is your schedule and really when

17
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.090
you'd like your ads to appear and this is worth giving a little bit of thought to because by default

18
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.470
you're are both scheduled to run continuously starting today.

19
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.010
Now I am creating the sod on a Saturday.

20
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.280
Personally I would prefer to start it on a Monday because I think people are probably more likely to

21
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.860
take those click through as they're going to be in work and maybe a little bit more serious about actually

22
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.630
taking the action rather than just maybe browsing on the weekend.

23
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.490
So what I'm going to do is instead of leave it at the default option set a start and end date.

24
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.120
And as you change these dates an important thing to do is keep an eye on the sentence here that shows

25
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.530
you a summary of when your ads will run on the Baaja that you will spend.

26
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.290
So right now it says your ads will run for 30 days and you'll spend no more than 300 euros.

27
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.310
Now what I'm going to do is just change this so I'm going to start this on Monday.

28
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.230
And I am going to change this and and get it to end on Thursday.

29
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.670
So that's why it's important to keep an eye on this sentence here because even when you set the dates

30
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.000
it is actually a little bit confusing but when it comes up.

31
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.090
So there we go three days going to spend more than 30 years.

32
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.680
And really this is where you want to check that everything is in order and that's going to be no surprises.

33
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.100
So for a first campaign it is probably a good idea to set a start and end date.

34
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.290
So you know how much you're going to spend on you're not going to get any surprises moving down after

35
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.700
you have shed set the shed jewel.

36
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.600
You can see here optimization for delivery.

37
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.110
And this says little clicks here and this is really you just want to check that this is as you want

38
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.090
it to be.

39
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.130
Remember that the campaign objective for this example is to get clicks to a Web site.

40
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:25.050
So I want mine to be build on that basis on the basis of getting link clicks and not on getting just

41
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.430
impressions.

42
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.240
I don't want people just to see my ad.

43
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.400
I want people to actually click through and I want Facebook to optimize for my campaign on that basis.

44
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.800
They're moving then after optimization for ad delivery you can see bidda meant and by default this is

45
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.830
set to Automatic.

46
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.170
Now this is one of the few areas where you want to leave it on automatic.

47
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.170
Now remember that Facebook ads and the ad platform is actually a auction.

48
00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:02.280
And so when you are buying ads on Facebook you're bidding against other advertisers who want that same

49
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.080
real estate as you want.

50
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.780
Like putting an ad in front of those same people on their Facebook news feed for example.

51
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.350
Now I would suggest you just leave this as automatic.

52
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.030
It works really well and it makes sure that Facebook sets them and help you get the most clicks at the

53
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.130
best prices.

54
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.650
There is an option here to set manual clicks but I would only recommend that you do this if you really

55
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.410
understand what you're doing and that you have worked out exactly how much a click is worth to you based

56
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.960
on how many people then converge on your Web site after that click or make a sale or whatever.

57
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.360
So it's a bit more of a complicated thing you have to understand all the calculations that every single

58
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.290
step.

59
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.800
And personally I think it's just a lot easier to stick to automatic bid amount.

60
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.220
You know how much you're going to spend on Facebook does a really good job of getting you clicks at

61
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.110
a good price.

62
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.800
Now moving down on from that you can see when you get charged.

63
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.530
So I'm purling click which is exactly what I want to do and not per impression.

64
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.880
So it's more just again making sure that everything is in place.

65
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.210
Next up we have our share jelling.

66
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.180
And you can shed Juliar odds for specific hours of the day or the week and note this option is only

67
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:26.440
available if you set a lifetime budget for your campaign Saddam is back up here at this section here

68
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.730
instead of a daily budget setting a lifetime budget.

69
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.890
And that really is set up that way so that Facebook can get you the clicks that he need with in a lifetime

70
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:39.380
budget.

71
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.400
And if it's restricted to doing that and cited daily bodges a it may not be able to get you those clicks

72
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.040
because you've said only certain timeframes.

73
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:56.620
Now this could be interesting for example if you want to offer a promotion for a local business at lunchtime

74
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.330
and capture people who can get a coupon at that specific time only.

75
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.340
Or if you have a business that only has certain opening hours and you want to show the ad for that local

76
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.440
business only when your business is open that can be a good option for that.

77
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.860
Finally we have delivery type.

78
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.950
I know that you have these little information buttons here if you're going through this and you kind

79
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.910
of forget exactly what these things are so you can choose as standard or accelerated delivery as standard

80
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.940
delivery as it says here is the recommended and preferred option for most advertisers.

81
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.460
And I would really recommend you leave this as well as standard delivery accelerated delivery can be

82
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.190
useful for promoting time sensitive events and really reaching that target audience quickly.

83
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.530
So if you wanted to spend all of your ad budget straight away you could use that accelerated delivery

84
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.220
option.

85
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.830
So that covers all of those advanced options that are available there.

86
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.740
And just to recap this is for just checking that everything was in order.

87
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.090
I haven't made any changes so you can hide these advanced options.

88
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:07.330
Now one thing to do at this stage is maybe note over here the estimated daily results after you set

89
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:14.180
all of your targeting options and placements and budgets you can have a look at how the estimated reach

90
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.880
is looking for your campaign and the daily like in clicks that you can be expected to do.

91
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:26.830
What I would recommend maybe at this stage is that you just know Dan these estimated daily results and

92
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:33.500
when you actually get your campaign results you can compare these and really get a sense then of accurate

93
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.610
as it was for your campaign.

94
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:47.210
So I'm just going to note down reach 440 just 2 6 0 0 and link clicks 4 to 27 per day.

95
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.240
So we can compare that in our reports afterwards.

96
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.880
The next thing to do is just go ahead and click this continue button.

97
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.230
So what I would recommend you do now is go ahead and set the budget for your campaign.

98
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:05.740
I'd recommend that you do start small because that's a great thing to really Kickoff first campaign.

99
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.440
Don't put yourself in a situation where you spend too much money.

100
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.410
So go ahead do that and I'll see you in the next lecture.

101
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:17.350
Are we getting into the level creating the image and text for you're out.

102
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.010
I'll see there.
