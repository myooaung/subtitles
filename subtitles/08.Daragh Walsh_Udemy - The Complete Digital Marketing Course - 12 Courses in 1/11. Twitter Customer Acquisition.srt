00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,710
In this video you're going to learn how to search for potential clients on Twitter.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,420
And this is something you can uniquely do on Twitter and it is a great way to win business directly

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,060
from a social network.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:22,560
So what you want to do is come up to the Twitter search bar and type in I need and whatever it is the

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,170
product or service that you deliver.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:33,280
So for example if I was a web designer I'd type in I need a web site on what I'm really searching for

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,150
here are people that have tweeted hey I need a web site I want a web site.

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,920
You can see I want a web site.

9
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,680
I need a dope graphic designer.

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,230
I need a very good web site designer.

11
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,430
It's urgent.

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,500
I need a website designer.

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:55,210
Scrolling down I need someone to help me create a web site so you can see that there are a lot of people

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,530
tweeting out and asking for help.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:06,280
So what you can do is reply to these tweets and let them know that you are a web designer and that you

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,980
can really help them.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,690
And one thing to note is that you will probably be other people using this strategy.

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,190
So if we click in to the replies here we can actually see someone has responded already a web design

19
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,950
company.

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,100
Good evening we are an experienced digital agency and can handle your project.

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,380
Here is our portfolio and what type websites you want.

22
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,240
So they have already use this strategy to respond.

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,910
And even if I scroll down a little bit you can see some other responses.

24
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,410
So the key thing here is that when you reply to these to stand there from the competition you need to

25
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,950
give something unique in your message that's going to stand out.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,770
So Message me please.

27
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,370
That's not going to work.

28
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,680
You can you can probably imagine that this person just ignore that straightaway.

29
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,640
This person definitely would have caught my attention.

30
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:05,500
But maybe they could even be more specific like we can get started straight away and have it done in

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:13,200
a week where you can do it for less than most Web sites we do for less than $200 something like that

32
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,880
that is going to really kick off the conversation and get you to stand out from any other messages that

33
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,640
pop up.

34
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:26,380
So having a great response that really communicates your unique selling proposition is a way to win

35
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,220
business.

36
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,880
With this strategy Don't say just message me please.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,410
That is not going to get the client excited.

38
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:43,270
Now another way that you can actually win business in a less competitive way is not to look at the top

39
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,780
tweets but do actually come over and look at the latest tweets.

40
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,740
So the reason there's quite a lot of comments on these views because these are the top tweets.

41
00:02:50,970 --> 00:03:01,360
But if we come to latest tweets then we can see the people who have said I need a web site or including

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,740
some of those words you can see this is only seven minutes ago.

43
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,670
Nobody has counted on this.

44
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,410
So that is something that you could just drop in and comment on straight away.

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,690
I need a brilliant Web site.

46
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,360
OK.

47
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,810
Again you could probably comment on that you'd have to read all these carefully to see what they say.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,330
Now you can see that some of these tweets just include our Web site they don't see I need a web site.

49
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:35,310
And so if you want to narrow your search what you can do is put these parentheses around the search

50
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,600
and now you are only going to see tweets that have that exact phrase in it.

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,740
I need a web site so you can see the end here.

52
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,940
I need a web size I need a web site you could probably reply to that person straightaway.

53
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,290
I need a website who can get the job done.

54
00:03:53,350 --> 00:04:02,510
DME etc. so it's a it's a way by filtering for the latest tweets and even the tweets that have that

55
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,790
exact phrase in it.

56
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:11,430
Again you can get those people and identify them who maybe aren't appearing in those top searches.

57
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:17,570
Now you can also search for not just on need web site but also maybe i need a web designer.

58
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,450
And so changer in the phrase is a little bit in order to really find what you need.

59
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,260
Another strategy as well is to look for people who are frustrated with an existing solution.

60
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,690
So what you could do is using those parents.

61
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,740
Again look at type in hate Wake's.

62
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,290
So what we're going to find here.

63
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,360
I'm thinking about switching from weeks to WordPress plus because I [REMOVED] hate wakes.

64
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:56,660
So what you could do here is really reply and say hey Katie if you want to if you want help with that.

65
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,040
It's very easy to switch from weeks to WordPress.

66
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,460
We can help you get it done in one day and you wouldn't lose any of your content.

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,880
Interested to learn more and then they might say yes and then you could say OK let's jump over to email

68
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,040
etc..

69
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,770
So looking for frustrated customers or frustrated customers.

70
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:23,720
Another solution is a great way to identify any clients that you can really poach on if they're really

71
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,890
frustrated.

72
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,640
Then they are really going to be looking for a solution.

73
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,810
Today I was reminded why I absolutely hate Wick's.

74
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,280
Hey works.

75
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,720
I think any business is going to get frustrated customers like this.

76
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,550
So the opportunity for us really to swoop in save the day when them as a client.

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,050
So just considering it's leave my whole sodding blog paid so much money for the site I have no support.

78
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:54,090
So again what you could say is hey don't worry we can help you.

79
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,320
There's no need for you to delete your site.

80
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,920
We can transition into say WordPress in less than a day and it's a very simple process.

81
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,920
So again swooping in and saving the day for those frustrated customers is another way that you can find

82
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,360
potential customers and really get a huge Your A-Y off Twitter.

83
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,750
So go ahead and check that out for yourself.

84
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:24,530
Come up to the search bar and search for he was saying I need a website graphic designer financial planner

85
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,520
personal coach etc..

86
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,150
You can use these parenthesis to narrow it down and you can also search for those frustrated customers

87
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,960
as well.

88
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:38,510
So go ahead now and find Try that for yourself to find potential clients or put this strategy in your

89
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,650
back pocket for later.
