00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.340
In this video you're going to learn how to create a look alike audience.

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.250
And this is a marketer's best friend because it allows you to scale your marketing efforts in a really

3
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.660
targeted way.

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.200
So how this works is when you first need is a base audience or a custom audience that you've created

5
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.100
and then you want to really create a look alike audience.

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.750
People who are similar to that sort of audience.

7
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.200
So you can really reach a lot more people.

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.180
Let me give you an example to really explain this.

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.950
So I have created a page engagement custom audience people who have engaged with my Facebook page over

10
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.990
the last year.

11
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.560
You can see that this is ten thousand five hundred people.

12
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.980
Now that is not a lot of people.

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.660
So if I want to run a campaign to get people to like my page eventually I'm going to run out of people

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.820
in this audience.

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.280
So what I want to do is now try and reach people who are like those people who engage with my page and

16
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.010
that's what I can do really with a local audience.

17
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.920
I've gone ahead and done it already and you can see this the lookalike audience up here and you can

18
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.230
see it.

19
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.730
It's over two million people.

20
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.610
So I'm using this audience from my custom audiences as a source of information.

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.350
It's a group of people who have things in common.

22
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.220
And then I ask Facebook to go out and find people who are similar to those people who've engaged with

23
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.150
my page.

24
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.940
And you can see that now.

25
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.760
Can you use an audience of two million people in my campaigns.

26
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.870
So it's a way to really extend the reach of your campaigns.

27
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.680
But still doing it in a targeted way you're not just using maybe interest targeting or behaviors you're

28
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.150
using your own source audiences as the base and the data that you're feeding in to create these targeted

29
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.940
audience.

30
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.590
So streaming volleyball I hope that example really highlights going from 10000 to 2 million target away

31
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.400
is really a way to scale your marketing efforts really easily.

32
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.100
So let's go ahead and set one up.

33
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.030
What you want to do is come back into your ads manager come up to the left side once again and just

34
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.370
make sure you're in the audience the screen.

35
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.950
I'm already in it here.

36
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.240
So what I'm going to do is click on Create.

37
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.520
Audience we're creating a look alike audience now.

38
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.450
And now you want to choose your source audience.

39
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.890
So I will use this page engagement custom audience once again as an example.

40
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.910
And now you have to choose the location.

41
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.060
So what you are is telling Facebook here is I want you to find people who were like that people who've

42
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.770
engaged my page but only say in the countries that I'm operating in or where my best customers are.

43
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.870
So for example I can just put in the United States here.

44
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.060
This is where a lot of the people who end up buying my products are from.

45
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.450
So if I want to put an ad in from them that's a good place to start with.

46
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:10.640
Now what I can do is set the audience size so the minimum audience size that you can create is 1 percent

47
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.380
of the population that you've chosen.

48
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.780
So you can see here that's why it's saying look like us 1 percent.

49
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.830
Now if I wanted to create an even bigger audience I could bump this up you can see right now that the

50
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.450
estimated reach is two million people.

51
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.000
If I bump it up and trying get to 2 percent of the U.S. You can see goes up to four.

52
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.270
They could even bring it all the way up to 10 percent 21 million people who I can then be targeting

53
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.520
in this campaign.

54
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.890
Now if you move is up and up and up.

55
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.020
Obviously there are similarities between your base audience are going to become less and less so it's

56
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:55.490
probably best to start down on the minimum which is really 1 percent once you've got selected your location

57
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.620
and your audience size.

58
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.930
All you need to do is go ahead and click Create audience.

59
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.150
Now one thing that notice here is that you can actually create a duplicate look like I've already set

60
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.300
this up before.

61
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.410
So if I want to set up a new look alike I'll just pop in Canada here and you'll see I'll be able to

62
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.950
create this audience here.

63
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.130
Now what you will see is it's updating the audience.

64
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:27.320
Get this the full half an hour until this loads up and that is really how you create a look alike audience.

65
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.870
It's very very simple.

66
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.110
You want to use any of the custom audiences that you've created.

67
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.210
And remember that you can use any of these custom audiences that you can set these up your email subscribers.

68
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.100
People who have visited your web site people who've engaged with your app people engage with your Facebook

69
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.840
page.

70
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:54.400
So there are really tons and tons of lookalike audiences that you can create and you can really go back

71
00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:02.010
if you want if you for example here I've created a custom audience of people who visited my web site.

72
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.710
If I think that I want to make that more targeted people who visit my website in the last 30 days then

73
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.380
I can go back create a custom audience create a new look alike audience based off that new custom audience

74
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.510
and that makes sense.

75
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.720
So there are tons of options here that can really allow you to scale your marketing efforts extremely

76
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.450
quickly.

77
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.950
Now that you understand how to create a lookalike audience go ahead and create one for yourself following

78
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.590
