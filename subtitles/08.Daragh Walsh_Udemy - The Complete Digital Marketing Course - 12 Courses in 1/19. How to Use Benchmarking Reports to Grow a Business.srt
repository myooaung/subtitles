00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,030
In this video you are going to learn how to use benchmarking reports in Google Analytics to grow a business

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,540
benchmarking reports in Google Analytics appear here underneath the audience tab and really want they

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:21,240
allow you to do is to select from sixteen hundred industry verticals and to compare the performance

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,810
of your website to other Web sites that are in the same industry as you.

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,490
And that gives you a fantastic baseline to measure your own business and can also give you insights

6
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,930
into industry trends.

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:42,090
And with those insights then you can make changes in your business and grow in a particular way based

8
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,520
on how your industry peers are performing.

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,530
So the first thing to note is that these reports won't appear by default.

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,890
You do need to enable them so to do that come into the admin section of your Google Analytics they can't

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,720
click on a Can settings and then just click enable benchmarking here.

12
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,300
So what this is going to do is by sharing your information.

13
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,420
Of course it's all going to be anonymous.

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,370
There won't be anything to say it's from your Web site but by sharing it.

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,510
You will then receive all of the data back from the other websites who shared them as well.

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,450
So it's a great anonymous way of sharing data and receiving data and just gives everybody got better

17
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,300
insight into their industry.

18
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:32,580
So let's come back to the benchmarking reports here and have a look at how you would actually analyze

19
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,410
them.

20
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,610
So first thing you can see that there are three different reports here.

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,350
And the first one that we can look at is the channels report.

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:48,600
So what we want to do in order to get some good insights is to firstly select our industry vertical.

23
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,870
So we're here inside the Google merchandise store.

24
00:01:51,870 --> 00:02:00,720
So what I'm going to do is to select the shopping vertical I'll just type this in to shift to safe speed.

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,710
So we're coming in shopping and I'm just going to leave it as all shopping here you can get more specific

26
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,970
if you want.

27
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,890
Now also what you can do is select the specific region.

28
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,890
So I'm going to narrow it down some comparing against a smaller and more accurate set of Web sites by

29
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,480
picking people and in like country just for example United States own regions.

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:33,650
Now to get a more accurate benchmark what I'm also going to do is narrow down by size of daily sessions.

31
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,090
So this is really the number of sessions that I get per day.

32
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,280
I want to find websites that have similar man.

33
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,790
So if you don't know how many sessions you get per day you can just come into your audience overview

34
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:54,660
report you can select and make sure it shows for the last 30 days and then you can see the number of

35
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,860
sessions that you have just take out a calculator and divide that by 30.

36
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,640
I've done this in advance so that's about eighteen hundred sessions.

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:12,900
So coming back to my benchmark reports I can just pop that in now and once it load so we're really going

38
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,440
to be looking at a set of Web sites then that are very similar to my own.

39
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,510
So here we go gives you range.

40
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm going to select eighteen hundred that's between and this range here.

41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,110
And while we can see then once this loads up is in the top right hand corner.

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,690
So there are four hundred and eighty three web properties contributing to this benchmark.

43
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,720
So essentially I'm comparing myself to four hundred and eighty three similar sites in the same region

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,930
in the same industry.

45
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:50,040
So while we can see Dan below here is now how my Web site is performing against the benchmark across

46
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,450
all of these different marketing channels.

47
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,360
So everything in green is positive this is where I'm outperforming the benchmark and everything in red

48
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,870
here is where I am underperforming compared to the benchmark.

49
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,780
So just to make this clear if we look at the referral and marketing channels so this is other Web sites

50
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:18,420
sending visitors to me directly I can see that these are my numbers here as the sessions over the last

51
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,610
30 days have been eight thousand nine hundred forty six on the benchmark which is the aggregate figure

52
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:33,570
for all of those four hundred and eighty three sites is three thousand three hundred and thirty one.

53
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,360
So I am outperforming the benchmark by one hundred and sixty eight percent.

54
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,530
So that's very positive to see that my referral channel is performing extremely extremely well on an

55
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,570
inside for me seeing this as well if that's performing so well I should continue to do that because

56
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,360
that gives me a serious advantage over other competitors.

57
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,160
Now if we look then at the performance of other marketing channels I can see that I am not as strong

58
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,270
on say organic traffic although it's down 20 percent.

59
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:15,060
But if we really look and say display advertising social media paid search compared to my competitors

60
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,900
I don't put as much effort into those marketing channels or at least I'm not getting the number of users

61
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,580
for them.

62
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,520
So how could I grow this site based on the information that I'm seeing.

63
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:34,230
Well I can see that my competitors and the 483 other sites are much more heavily using paid search social

64
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:41,850
and display advertising and potentially those are untapped marketing channels for me ad that I could

65
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,220
really use to get much more traffic to the site.

66
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,580
Now if we look at some of the other green ones here and this is just to look at other metrics not just

67
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:57,030
the number of sessions you know the number of users that come to the site per day essentially but some

68
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:05,520
of the other metrics so I can see even though let's say for paid search even though I use it much less

69
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,450
as a marketing channel than other marketing channels on my benchmark I can see that the pages procession

70
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,960
and the average session duration and the balance rate.

71
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:22,500
So these are all user metrics this is showing me that users when they come through paid search they

72
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:30,600
do spend a lot of time on my site because all of these metrics that indicate that are very positive.

73
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:38,490
So once again I would really if I was running the Google merchandise store and it was built for profit

74
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,830
obviously it's not it's more just like an example site to sell Google merchandise they could heavily

75
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:50,190
invest in paid search because the other people in their industry are the small amount and traffic they

76
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:55,590
are getting from this marketing channel is performing extremely extremely well and you could say the

77
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,050
same for social maybe not the same for display.

78
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:04,480
So if you really want to juice paid search would be the way to go.

79
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,800
So that was just the channels reports in the benchmarking.

80
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,150
We can also look at the location report now that location report compares your country or territory

81
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,770
data to the benchmarks for each of the countries and territories from which you receive traffic.

82
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:29,100
Now since we have selected just the United States we're only going to see the U.S. show up in this report.

83
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,890
But if you'd select the different regions you're going to see how you compare in different regions compared

84
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:41,250
to the other websites in your benchmark and that can give you great indication just like the marketing

85
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:47,340
channels where perhaps you're outperforming and where you're underperforming compared to the benchmark

86
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,110
and where there might be opportunities for you to grow.

87
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,200
Next is the device's benchmarking report and this compares your device's data to the benchmark for desktop

88
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,920
mobile on tablets sessions or traffic.

89
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:08,540
So what we can see here is that on desktop over the last 30 days the Google merchandise store has a

90
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,650
20 percent more sessions.

91
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:18,570
But what is very interesting is that on mobile and tablets compared to the benchmark we are underperforming

92
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,540
by 75 to above 80 percent.

93
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:28,590
So this is a great insight to understand why this is happening is are not our site not mobile friendly

94
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:35,820
enough is you know maybe an app something that we need to develop and this is a great insight that compared

95
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:43,140
to the industry we could be missing out on a massive number of sessions and sales.

96
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:51,390
So if we look back over and recap on how to use the benchmarking reports to grow a business in this

97
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:58,800
example we can say that in terms of channels we are outperforming and referral traffic so we should

98
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,650
continue to invest in that to have a advantage over competitors.

99
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:12,000
We could maybe invest in paid search because this is performing extremely well for the small number

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,590
of users that we have.

101
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:21,270
And our other benchmark are using this as a marketing channel if we look at locations we just selected

102
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,430
one location.

103
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,180
But there could be great insights if you can see how you're underperforming or over forming in different

104
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,640
regions and definitely on devices.

105
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:38,220
Now we can see that we are potentially missing out on a lot of traffic and sales on mobile and top tablet.

106
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,130
And if we make fixes to that and track this trend then we can really grow our business.

107
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:49,680
So go ahead now enable the benchmarking reports and check these out for yourself so you can get insights

108
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,080
to grow a Web site.
