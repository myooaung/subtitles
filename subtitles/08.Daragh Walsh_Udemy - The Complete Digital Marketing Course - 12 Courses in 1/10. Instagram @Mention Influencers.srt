00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,350
In this video you're going to learn how to get reposted by topic cance on Instagram.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,030
And this is probably the number one strategy that you can use if you are running in Strohm have no audience

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,910
and you've no audience outside of Instagram either.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,000
So this will help you get in front of a big audience.

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,790
Very simple strategy and very very effective.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,320
And let me give you a couple of examples to bring this to life.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:34,300
So I'm just going to show you a quite a simple example of this from Tim Ferriss is again he's an author

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,420
and you can see that he has a post here and this is actually a repost.

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,600
You can see that he's said that in the comments of the image and he's actually mentioned the original

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,500
poster which in this case is Jaydee poor pere.

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:01:02,320
So if I click through I can see here from Jane Cauley that this was her original post same image and

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,270
all she said is I love the holidays and she's hashtags for his hashtag tribe of mentors.

13
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:14,070
So why would Tim Ferriss repost this.

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,660
Well because it's essentially a mini testimonial.

15
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,090
It's somebody who is enjoying their products.

16
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,420
You see all of the holidays that's kind of a perfect post for Christmas time.

17
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:34,070
It's a subtle way for him to remind his audience that the book is XYZ and then they can get for Christmas.

18
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:41,050
So essentially if you want to get reposted by big cats you've got to give them a post that is going

19
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,160
to make them look good.

20
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,940
That reminds people to buy their products or services.

21
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:52,450
That's essentially a mini testimonial essentially where you're going to be the poster boy for them that

22
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,190
they can then resell right now in this case here.

23
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,890
I don't think Jade McCauley kind of uses strategically.

24
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,570
You see him is impersonal.

25
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,110
But if you're even a business that can't or a personal brand that you want to grow why you can do is

26
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:16,210
identify topic cats in your niche and say something good about their product or service their book their

27
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,550
course whatever it can be.

28
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,000
So then they have the opportunity to read posters.

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,030
So that was one example there.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,530
You can see Tim first and author he has a book.

31
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,050
So anybody who says something good about his He's probably going to reposes.

32
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:36,190
And even if I look down here you can see that he's reposted somebody else which is the Christmas tree

33
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,810
in the books.

34
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:44,040
Again a great way for him to his mind his audience to buy the book for Christmas.

35
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,290
And so what you can do is even look at these top accounts look at the types of posts that they have

36
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,810
re posted before.

37
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,940
And if you wanted to get in front of them you could create a post similar to that and you could just

38
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,940
make sure that you put in the hash tags or whatever that get their attention that they'll be monitoring

39
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,580
on their notifications or other way.

40
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,340
And let me give you another example of this just to make it really clear again.

41
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:20,610
So here's another account this guy Dave Ramsey and you can see here that this is another post.

42
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,670
So they they said that paid off 61000 in 2017.

43
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,420
Now that is a great achievement.

44
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,510
Obviously that is something that was a result of the work that this guy does.

45
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,770
He's the kind of help people get out.

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,300
Yes.

47
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,850
This is a success story a case study someone who is a poster boy for what he's trying to do and encourage

48
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,450
his audience to do so.

49
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,100
Of course he's going to share that.

50
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,950
This is exactly the outcome that he is trying to get his audience to.

51
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,830
So this builds his authority.

52
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:01,970
It also shows that his products or services work etc. and so of course he is going to repose.

53
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:08,160
So if you wanted to get the attention of this guy Dave Ramsey and get reposted Well then you create

54
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,550
a sex success story from his products or services.

55
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,940
Make sure you tag him onto the hashtags.

56
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:21,710
And then there's a good chance that he's going to repots that eyes they can see that's the original

57
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:28,110
post there and you can see that they said we were happy that we were able to continue our Debt-Free

58
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,570
Gjert journey.

59
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,650
We're shipping a way that I hope would be done a couple of years and you can see them below then they've

60
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,160
actually tied that big top influencers.

61
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:47,050
Dave Ramsey So that was kind of two examples there of maybe an online influencer show you another example

62
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,700
of this because it really does work for whatever type of product or service you have.

63
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,230
This is an e-commerce products.

64
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,690
It's kind of camping attendance up off the ground looks pretty cool.

65
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,350
To be honest and you can see here is a picture of their product in action that one of their customers

66
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:14,500
took and the way we know this is because you can see PC Photo Credit comping intense.

67
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,670
Now I think this is an example of someone using it quite strategically.

68
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:31,170
Now we can see that this 10 Cylons 186 thousand followers we can see that this got 280 are 2008 832

69
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:31,710
likes.

70
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,410
That got quite a lot of engagements and you can see the photo credit going back to the original account

71
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:44,150
which if we look here I'm guessing has a much smaller audience 447 followers.

72
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:51,720
So this is the perfect example of the much smaller can getting the attention of a massive change by

73
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,250
really showing them showing their products in a positive way.

74
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:03,690
So if we come back to the original post here we might have scroll and find this.

75
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,040
Here we go.

76
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,270
This is the original post.

77
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,310
And they're saying Check out this setup.

78
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,910
Spread the word.

79
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,930
They put in even the link to the to the company account.

80
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:24,140
They plant a tree while you're at it so it's a customer really spreading the message positively and

81
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,370
you can see that they have even shown where it is weak park trees snow hammock.

82
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,430
So it's kind of like a pretty interesting way that they've shown the product.

83
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,310
And essentially again it's a success story it's a testimonial a visual testimonial of the product.

84
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,110
And as a result that much bigger account is going to share that out and the benefit for this morning

85
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,200
is that it puts them in front of the big cance audience.

86
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:58,520
So if you want to use this to grow your own in ceramic can watch need to use firstly identify those

87
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,430
big accounts that you want to get in front of you could be following those they're going to be slightly

88
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,530
different for any type of business Daryn.

89
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,980
And once you've identified them what you want to do is think about how you can create a set success

90
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:19,030
story a mini testimonial that will catch their attention and that they're are going to want to share

91
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,330
action and you can do this over and over and over again.

92
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:31,230
It is a fantastic way to grow your Instagram account by simply being reposted by top Instagram account.

93
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:36,090
So go ahead and use that for yourself for these clients for your companies.

94
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,980
