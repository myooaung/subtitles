00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,560
In this video you are going to learn how to out a profile image to your Facebook page.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:11,620
I'll discuss some of the options that you have and then only even show you how to design a Facebook

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,410
profile image for free.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,240
So the mechanics of adding a profile image are very simple you just click on a picture then you can

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,630
take a picture directly from your computer where you can upload a photo.

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:31,420
So if you do have a company logo or a profile picture that you always use you can just upload those

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,610
directly.

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,620
And that is really this step completed.

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:42,190
Now if you want a couple of ideas on what you should be putting in your Facebook profile for your Facebook

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,110
page there's two main options.

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:51,110
One as you can see here on Eudemus Facebook page is just to include your brand logo.

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:57,250
And really this should be consistent with the logo that you're using on any other social media profile

13
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,930
so that when people see it it's instantly recognizable to them.

14
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:09,400
Now a couple of things and best practices for this type of business logo is that you can see that it's

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:16,150
just two colors which keeps it simple see red on a kind of a gray background here.

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,840
So it needs to be simple.

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,740
And also you can see it at square here.

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,410
But when you move then to actually see a post and then this will happen will be how it appears in the

19
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,930
news feed of somebody following this page you can see even though it's small it's very recognizable.

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,240
And that this time is round but it still isn't being cut off or cropped.

21
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,720
So when you're designing your logo or uploading it makes sure that there is some space around the edges

22
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,980
so that when it does appear around that it will be cropped out.

23
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,950
Also keep it simple.

24
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,660
Two colors is really the best strategy.

25
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,910
Now if you are more of a personal brand or the face of your business than you can do what I've done

26
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,980
here which is just simply upload your profile picture.

27
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,720
And that's a quick way to get it done.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:11,650
Now I do want to show you how to design your own business logo if you don't have one already.

29
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:17,770
And I think the easiest thing to do here is just as you did me have done just take the first letter

30
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,720
of your business and use that as your business logo.

31
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,510
So you you to me show you another example of this.

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,570
This is Bunson.

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,310
It's a restaurant here in Dublin Ireland.

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,510
And you can see they've done the same thing.

35
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,010
It's a little bit more designed.

36
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:39,940
They've got their brown color and a bit of Typepad graphy but essentially the same idea just the first

37
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,880
letter of their business name be Bunson.

38
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:49,240
Here's another example of that style so simple and an s so you can get up and running and have a pretty

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,660
attractive profile image on your Facebook page very quickly.

40
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,980
And I do want to show you a very simple way that you can design this for yourself what you want to do

41
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,910
is come into Kanva dot com.

42
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,090
It's absolutely free.

43
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,690
It's essentially like Photoshop.

44
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:14,080
But a lot simpler and totally free so you can come to Commodore com log in with Facebook or Google.

45
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,870
And then once inside you can make sure that you're on creative design and then you can come across and

46
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,440
click use custom dimensions.

47
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,590
And once that pops up you want to put in five 40 by 540.

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,140
Those are the pixels.

49
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:37,420
And then we're going to really design our Facebook image in here so you can see we've got to square

50
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,730
what we can do first is put in our background color.

51
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,620
Now we can select any of these back green colors.

52
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,660
And as we said you want to keep it as simple as possible.

53
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:57,400
So what I can do is maybe just select this orange or what you could also do is upload your own background

54
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,500
image so you can just upload your own images there from your computer.

55
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,580
And maybe I'll do that here.

56
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:14,710
You can delete this and then I can add in this image that I've uploaded previously.

57
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,490
Put that in as my background image.

58
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,910
I can even move that around if I want.

59
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,520
And the next thing that I want to do is add my text so I'm going to follow that strategy of you to me.

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,460
And the other companies we saw just putting the first letter of my business so I'm just going to stick

61
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,000
with S is my page name is set up demo.

62
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:46,530
Now I can select that piece of text I want to change the color to Weisse and now I want to increase

63
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,040
the size.

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,190
So right now it's 42.

65
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,130
I mean increase this to go away that you're

66
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,570
44.

67
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,260
OK.

68
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,300
Are probably when we change this font it's going to appear bigger.

69
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:10,500
So select this come over here to change the font and you can do it girl and through and pick any font

70
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,980
that you think is going to kind of represent the style of your business I'll just pick this one here.

71
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:27,560
And I can even type this in whatever I want to be saying and I've to just go up to something like 250

72
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,300
or maybe even 300.

73
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:40,180
You could see that it gives you help to really centered the text as well which is very handy.

74
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,030
But there I mean that is very simple.

75
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:43,940
Two minutes.

76
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,780
But I think it looks pretty good to get up and running and for the first profile image of the Facebook

77
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:58,990
page now to download this you just want to click download you can select PLG and then you can just click

78
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,010
download and it's going to download to your Downloads folder.

79
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:10,120
Now one thing you might want to do before leaving this is just click File Save so that you can come

80
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,000
back and do just this later if you want.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,280
Now what I'm going to do is come into back to my Facebook page at a picture upload the photo going to

82
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,040
come to downloads.

83
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,750
I can see this here.

84
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:36,400
I did a practice one before and now I may need to reposition this or I can just zoom in and see him.

85
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:42,530
So it's the perfect dimensions there and then click save.

86
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,970
And now my profile picture has been successfully saved.

87
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,460
So there we go.

88
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,340
That is how you add a profile picture to your Facebook page.

89
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,150
We talk about some of the best practices and even how to design one for yourself for FREE.

90
