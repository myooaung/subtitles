Digital Marketing is an incredibly powerful way to grow a business and to drive revenue.
1

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.260
But if you're new to digital marketing it can also be quite overwhelming there's so many different marketing
2

3
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.300
channels there's so many different tactics and strategies.
3

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.230
And so what I want to do in this video is get everybody on the same page and give you a high level overview
4

5
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.010
of how to grow a business with digital marketing really demystify it for you and give you that 30000
5

6
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.520
foot view.
6

7
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.010
So the first thing you need to know about digital marketing is that it's a process and the first step
7

8
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.140
in that process is to define a target audience.
8

9
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.530
The marketing channels like Facebook and YouTube are so big so noisy you need to be really clear about
9

10
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.980
who you're going after not only their age and gender and maybe where they live but also what are the
10

11
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.560
problems that they have.
11

12
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.850
How is your solution going to be better or different than the competition.
12

13
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.410
And also what difference is it is that solution going to make to their lives in terms of how those your
13

14
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.270
life going to be better.
14

15
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.830
You need to be able to paint a really clear picture to them of that.
15

16
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.180
And that's so important to be clear of right from the start because that's what you're going to be using
16

17
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.930
in your marketing messages and videos and posts.
17

18
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.920
to really capture their attention.
18

19
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.670
So that's the first step so important to do as an exercise.
19

20
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.250
Before you even jump in to the different market channels.
20

21
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.140
Now the next step in the process is to track that target audience with free content and Ads and you really
21

22
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.770
want to go on to the platforms that your target audience are already using.
22

23
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.320
And that could be the search engines with Google Facebook YouTube Twitter Instagram Linked-In whatever.
23

24
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.450
And in terms of how you attract them with free content well these 3 types of content that you can
24

25
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:58.030
really make. one is just how to type educational content could be how to articles that you post and to
25

26
00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.410
appear on Google.
26

27
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.380
It could be educationalist style videos and for example if there is an e-commerce store that I know
27

28
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.230
that's selling women's hair extensions and they create videos like how to do a french braid and everybody
28

29
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.120
who searches for that finds their video and then maybe will buy their product which is a hair extension.
29

30
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.260
And the second type of free content that you can make is really more a kind of brand storytelling maybe
30

31
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.780
customer success stories testimonials that type of thing.
31

32
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.060
And the final type of content you can make for free to track your target audience is Entertainment's
32

33
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.380
style content.
33

34
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.120
You can see this a lot on YouTube.
34

35
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.520
People building up an audience with entertainment type stuff and then sending them back to their merchandise
35

36
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.910
store or you see a lot on say Instagram where influencers build up an audience kind of entertaining
36

37
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.180
content and sell affiliate products are promoted for the products.
37

38
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.080
Now you can also attract your target audience not only with free content but also with Ads and all of
38

39
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.290
these platforms have an Ad platform built in.
39

40
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.160
Google Google Ads Facebook ads YouTube ads Twitter ads Instagram ads and LinkedIn ads etc etc .
40

41
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.480
Now once you've attracted your target audience the next step is to really make sales and you want to
41

42
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.440
drive that audience back from those platforms to your website or your off line store.
42

43
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.250
Now many businesses will have an intermediary step between these two steps and that could be to build
43

44
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.430
up an email lists if you want to win the trust of the customer first before asking for a sale or maybe
44

45
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.220
don't have a product yet and you just want to build up an audience.
45

46
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.550
We can really just drive them to sign up your email lists or you can also use retargeting to really
46

47
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.520
get people who came to your Web site and retarget them back on say these platforms come back to your
47

48
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.410
Web site.
48

49
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.040
So those are some other kind of details there.
49

50
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.280
Now the final step in the process is really to measure and optimize and you can do this for free with
50

51
00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.710
Google Analytics.
51

52
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.910
And really this is just to make the whole process better and better.
52

53
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.140
So if you know that a lot of people are coming to your site from YouTube and they're buying stuff well
53

54
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.960
you can see that in Google Analytics and then you can put more free content or ads on that channel to
54

55
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.280
really drive more sales.
55

56
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.350
But it's so important that you're measuring what you're doing because that's the only way that you know
56

57
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.320
what's working so that you can do more of it.
57

58
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:32.390
So I hope that this was helpful in demystifying digital marketing and this is hopefully clarified things
58

59
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.040
for you if you're an absolute beginner.
59

60
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.140
We're going to be going into all of these steps I've seen a lot more detail in the course but I do want
60

61
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.690
you to keep this in mind if you start to get overwhelmed and a bit confused just come back to the high
61

62
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.760
level view.
62

63
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.410
It's actually very simple at a high level what we are trying to achieve and how to grow business with
63

64
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.200
digital marketing.
