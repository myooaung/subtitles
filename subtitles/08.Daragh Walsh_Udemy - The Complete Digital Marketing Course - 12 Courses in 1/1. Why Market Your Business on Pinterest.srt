1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,770
So why should you market your business on Pinterest.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:09,050
Well essentially Pinterest is just another channel through which you can get in front of your potential

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,320
customers so you can drive traffic to your website and generate sales.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,910
But there are a couple of unique things about Pinterest compared to other social media platforms so

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:27,350
I do want to really highlight those now and also give you some examples of how businesses are using

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,960
Pinterest successfully.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,030
So the first thing to know is that Pinterest has over 200 million active monthly users.

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:41,690
And if we compare that to other social media sites out there we can see that Facebook's at the top here

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,820
with 2 billion.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,430
Then we have YouTube then we have Instagram Twitter etc. and down here is Pinterest which comparatively

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,190
you would think of Pinterest is tiny.

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:59,930
Its not even worth my time but theres still 200 million active monthly users on Pinterest so it is a

13
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,850
massive audience there's a massive amount of people there.

14
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:10,280
And it's also not nearly as competitive as these other better well-known marketing channels so that

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,150
is a great reason to even be interested in Pinterest always where there's less competition is where

16
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,310
you want to be and in terms of the gender split on Pinterest.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,640
A lot of first impressions are Pinterest is only for women but actually it's about 60:40 splash splish

18
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:35,870
And so even if you are a business that's more focused on males than Pinterest can definitely be a good

19
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,050
marketing channel for you as well.

20
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,140
Now to understand really how to use Pinterest as a business.

21
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,170
I think its first really important to understand how people actually use Pinterest.

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,030
Why did they even use Pinterest when they had all these other social networks out there.

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,130
And what I have here is a Pinterest profile of Lauren hunt Xander.

24
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,840
This is just a random person I don't know her but I found her profile and I think it does represent

25
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,820
very well why people would use Pinterest.

26
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,620
So she has a couple of boards here.

27
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,660
Boards are just a way to categorize her ideas and inside these boards.

28
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:24,570
You can see that they they have pins so these pins all they are are just images.

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:33,050
And then what happens in these pins is that you can see the link back to the original blog post her

30
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,110
site where there's more details on this.

31
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:44,930
So in this example we can see that Lauren here wants to create a dream has she creates a board so she

32
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:51,710
can categorize all those ideas together and then inside there when she searches Pinterest or is following

33
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:57,680
certain things that she likes then she just saves this to her board so that she has it there and then

34
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,550
she can always go back to the Web site to read more about it or to buy the product.

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:11,480
So the thing about Pinterest and why people really use it is that they're here to plan buy or do things

36
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:18,200
and that is very very different to say Facebook where there more there to just hang out with their friends

37
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,520
and catch up with news people on Pinterest are very proactive.

38
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:30,310
They really want to bring their ideas to life and they come to Pinterest in order to get the ideas gather

39
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,820
them together so that they can really visualize their ideas in a much better way.

40
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,130
So why is that good for businesses.

41
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,720
Well when you're dealing with very proactive people who want to see thing happen things happen in the

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,900
world.

43
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,360
You could say is a lot better than Facebook where people are very passive and they're just consuming

44
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,270
content.

45
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:59,220
And also in terms of you know what stage they're out in the buying process here Thorne for example for

46
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,160
a dream house she's very early on in the process of planning that idea.

47
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,500
And again that's something quite unique and it's something that actually Pinterest really sell as their

48
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,980
unique selling point for businesses to reach people early inspired them to act.

49
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:25,880
And that is also very different to say if you go to type into Google as a user they already know exactly

50
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,490
what they want whereas on Pinterest they don't know exactly what they want that and the paint they want.

51
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,930
So by having visual images of it here and catching their attention they go oh that's what I want.

52
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,890
They're going to add it to their board and that makes it very likely or at least more likely that they're

53
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,760
going to buy your paints or whatever in the future.

54
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,140
So hopefully now you understand why people use Pinterest.

55
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:56,330
It's really because they're looking for things to plan Byard do Karoubi even travel place want to travel.

56
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,640
Ideas for digital marketing that they want a group together that they might be using for later.

57
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,750
It could be weddings they're planning whatever they're really here.

58
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:11,510
They're very proactive people and they're very early on in the planning stage which is a great place

59
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,160
to catch them.

60
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:21,320
If you're a business now let's have a look at some actual businesses taking advantage of Pinterest then

61
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,850
as a marketing channel and driving a lot of traffic and sales.

62
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,270
And one of the biggest hands on Pinterest is Moria's seal.

63
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,180
It is an e-commerce store.

64
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:37,700
You can see they've gone over 900000 followers and their e-commerce store that sells handmade gifts

65
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,390
fashion home decor cetera.

66
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,110
Now what you can see that they've done here is created their own boards.

67
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,410
So really grouping together their different products etc..

68
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:56,000
And you can see here if we click in that these are actually just images from their e-commerce store

69
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,770
highlighting their products.

70
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:05,270
And if we click in here and visit this some bringing back to the e-commerce check page.

71
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,550
So I mean it's pretty cool for an e-commerce store as well.

72
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,920
They're just showing their products here.

73
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:20,240
Someone like Lauren she like those earrings they she could add them to her fashion board and maybe go

74
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,950
ahead and buy them later on.

75
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:28,000
So the key thing is for a business you're actually not creating a lot of new content.

76
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:34,160
All you're doing is making your content available on Pinterest so that people can address and create

77
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,990
their ideas so you can see here that these this is not new content that the e-commerce store has created.

78
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,460
These are just the images of their products that they've organized on to pit Pinterest into certain

79
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,120
categories and added a little bit more information about them here as well.

80
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,160
So that was an e-commerce store I think is a perfect fit for Pinterest.

81
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,390
And let's have a look.

82
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,900
In another type of site now as well.

83
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:09,220
So this is a blog it's called pinch of yawm it's a food blog.

84
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,300
And you can see what she's done here is just make sure that they have eye catching visuals here.

85
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:21,150
But essentially it is just going to be recipes that are on their size.

86
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:27,920
And if we click into this we can see if people want to make this then they come back to the Web site

87
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,500
to read the full recipe here.

88
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,410
So it's a great platform actually for getting people back to your site because you're only giving them

89
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,870
a visual preview of what you can help them do.

90
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,180
And then they have to go back to your site to actually find out how to do it.

91
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,350
And so it's a great way to just redirect traffic from Pinterest funnel it back to your Web site.

92
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,600
Now I do want to give you one other example.

93
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,160
And this is actually geared towards males.

94
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,420
So come back to this.

95
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:08,970
So this is a this is a Pinterest a can called beer to Holick obviously geared towards males.

96
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:16,020
They are helping those who want of a better beard solve problems and solutions guides for beard care.

97
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,960
Beard from a woman's perspective and much more.

98
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,910
So this is actually a Web site and they're actually an e-commerce store as well to sell products for

99
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,820
beards.

100
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,790
So if we look at beard grooming tips you can see that they have the images here are six reasons why

101
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,400
you should be using beard oil a quality beard oil.

102
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,630
And then you can see the article here as well which just brings it back to their Web site.

103
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,610
So very good way to get traffic back to your site.

104
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,280
Just using Pinterest and all you really need are those good visuals to catch people's attention.

105
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,170
So one final thing that you can do if you're still not sure if Pinterest is going to be good marketing

106
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,440
channel for your business now or in the future has just come in and use the Pinterest search bar so

107
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,800
you can type in anything here like say yoga and actually you can see yoga for men before and after pants

108
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,440
girl flexibility work and weight loss.

109
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:20,060
This search bar on Pinterest is actually something as well that makes it very unique compared to other

110
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,080
social networks.

111
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,660
Now remember Pinterest is really designed to help people plan and do things and buy things.

112
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:33,950
So that's why this search bar is extremely good and they have even they suggest a lot of the popular

113
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,830
terms that people are searching for.

114
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:43,160
So as a business you can come in here and just look at what they are suggesting and these are posts

115
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,010
that you can definitely put up in order to get ranked in the Pinterest search engine here.

116
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,760
And the cool thing is is that if you rank in the search engine here on Pinterest you can be liking Google

117
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,180
getting traffic for that term.

118
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,860
Back to your Web site.

119
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,940
For weeks months or even years.

120
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:10,800
So thats another cool thing about Pinterest is that it has that long term potential as a marketing channel

121
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,880
because unlike Facebook where it's filtered out after a day or two you can be appearing in this Pinterest

122
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,630
search engine for a long long time and that's another great reason to get in on Pinterest.

123
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,880
So to wrap it up why should you be using Pinterest as a marketing channel.

124
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,640
Well it's less competitive than others.

125
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,500
It's also very proactive people who want to get things done.

126
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,310
You can get them early on in their decision making process.

127
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,760
And it also has an amazing search engine which means that your content can really appear at the top

128
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:51,350
of the rankings for weeks months or even years which gives you a lot of long term Web site traffic and

129
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,220
sales.

130
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:58,880
So hopefully that has convinced you that Pinterest is a great marketing channel and at least clarifies

131
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,300
for you why you should be using Pinterest.
