1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,020
In this video you're going to learn how to create your own Linked-In group.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:10,540
And this is one of the best tactics to build your brand and generate leads to grow your small business.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,200
So we're going to run through the three important steps you need to complete.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,820
And the first step is actually just to go ahead and create the group.

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:24,010
So to do that log into your Linked In profile come across to work and then you'll see the option to

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,910
go over to groups.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,560
And then if you come to my groups you can see the option to create a group now in here you can see that

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:41,330
you can give your group a title you can upload a description a logo includes some rules and you probably

9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,360
want to leave this as the standard groups.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,940
It can be visible in search results so people can find it.

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,980
Other members can be invited to it.

12
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,690
So in terms of what should you be putting in the title the logo and the description.

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:55,910
Well really.

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,080
You just want to communicate the benefits of people joining this group what is this group about.

15
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:07,730
Is that a topic like social media marketing and in that description then you know what is the benefit

16
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:13,610
of this group learn strategies for social learn the latest strategies for social media marketing that

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,580
can grow your business better.

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:22,090
You need to get across the benefits there so that is step number one just simply create a group.

19
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,560
And if you're a little bit unsure about this you can always come in and discover some groups to see

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,750
the titles that they've put in to see some of the descriptions here that they've put in.

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,030
And you can just have a glance through those two to really help you get started setting up the group

22
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,550
who we're having problems with that.

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,020
So step number one is just create your own LinkedIn group.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,450
Now step number two is where it starts to get interesting.

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,780
This is where we want to find people to join our group and to do that.

26
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:56,270
Let's go back to living in essentially what we want to do is funnel people who are already active in

27
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,900
similar groups back to our group.

28
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:08,600
And so to do that let's just say I'm going to search search for Social Media Marketing and we can see

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,640
that I'm seeing all these search results here people jobs content companies.

30
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,430
But I really want to filter this tend to groups.

31
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,200
And so what I want to do is go ahead and start to join these groups.

32
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,460
Now I'm a member of this and already see just keep working day and through the live list.

33
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:34,030
You can see two million people on this group which actually I've requested to join.

34
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,640
So you don't join immediately you need.

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,860
You may see a pending and so you can just keep going and through the list and you can become a member

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,890
of up to 50 groups.

37
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:51,040
They may not approve your request to join straightaway but usually it's done with in 24 hours.

38
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:58,790
So that was Step number two just join up to 50 relevant groups that already contain your audience.

39
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,210
Now Step number three is to come back to the group section again.

40
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:11,020
And really we want to have a look inside of these groups that we have really joined here.

41
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,940
So let's go to this one looks quite active.

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,450
And now what we want to do once we're inside one of the groups and we're approved as a member that we

43
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,190
want to click on the members tab here.

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,380
And once we are in the member's tab then we can actually start to message people directly for free.

45
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,720
We don't have to pay to do this and we could send a personalized message invite them to join our group

46
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,100
and paste a link to our group in there as well.

47
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,220
See you can work down through the list if you want and them as you can see there's quite a lot of people

48
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,120
in this group.

49
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,120
So sometimes it's a good strategy to actually come in and maybe look at those smaller groups say this

50
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,370
one here that has a smaller number of members 444 and you can invite them personally or you can just

51
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,700
take the time to go through.

52
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,580
Have a look at their profiles and see are they really a good fit for you on.

53
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:15,000
That is a great way that you can read just build up a viable pool of your potential customers.

54
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:21,480
So inside of your group what you can do is just maybe block any from competitors for getting in.

55
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:28,980
You obviously want to demonstrate your valy demonstrate your expertise don't be overtly spammy or sales.

56
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:34,100
But it's hugely beneficial to have all of your target audience in one place.

57
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:40,000
So now that you know how to create a group on LinkedIn consider using this tactic for yourself to build

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,220
your brand and generate leads to grow your small business.
