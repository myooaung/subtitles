1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,150
After you have targeted your ad campaign by location and language the next step is to determine your

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,410
bids and Budget.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,210
Now by default this would probably show up as manual CPC manual cost per click and over on the right

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,560
here we can get an explanation of what this is.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,430
It really allows you to set your own maximum cost per click for your ads so you can say I only want

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,230
to pay one dollar for a click.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,810
You can set that up now.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:33,440
Now this is a manual bidding strategy because you really set that cost per click your self.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,170
But there are also automated bidding strategies.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,590
And I just want to give you a high level overview of these.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,620
But ultimately for this example and for your first campaign I'd recommend you do manual CPC so you can

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,920
really keep the costs low and not let things kind of go out of control.

13
00:00:51,930 --> 00:01:00,210
So if we come over to target CPA we can see this law is here to set the bids to get most conversions.

14
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,210
So if you select this option you won't be saying that I want one dollar per click you will be saying

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,470
I want to really increase my bids as much as possible to get a cost per acquisition.

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,260
So if we click in to that in order to really for AdWords to determine their cost per acquisition they

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,130
need to be measuring how many ads there resulting in acquisitions.

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,380
And so to do that you need to set a conversion tracking so to use this type of automated bidding strategy

19
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,170
there are a couple of extra set setups steps and that would really require you to put a little piece

20
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,410
of code on your Web site so that words can see which ads are resulting in the most amount of conversions

21
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,980
and those conversions could be email sign ups.

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,530
They could be even in sales on the site.

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,410
So I won't go into all the details but I just want to briefly run through these other automated bidding

24
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:59,760
strategies do you have a understanding of what they are and target or OAS target return on ad spend.

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,550
So this is a slightly different metric you're not trying to get that cost per acquisition you're really

26
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:11,460
trying to get a target return on ad spend and once again you would have to set up conversion tracking

27
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,210
and to really get that done.

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,650
Next up we have maximum Quick's.

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,370
So if you just want to get the maximum amount of clicks on your Web site well then this is the option

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,150
that you would select.

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,760
Next up with maximum conversions.

32
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,200
So once again it's just getting the maximum amount of conversions.

33
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,170
Not even for a targeted cost per acquisition which is the maximum again that would require conversion

34
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,310
tracking.

35
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,910
Moving on then we have target search page location.

36
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:53,060
So this is say for example if you wanted to appear in a certain position on the search results then

37
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,980
they will automatically bid as much as they need AdWords will automatically get as much as they need

38
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,700
to get say to the first spot.

39
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,940
So you can imagine that that can get pretty expensive.

40
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,730
So you want to be careful if you're selecting that strategy and target outranking share quite similar

41
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:16,010
but it's not that you're just getting to say the top spot that you could be ranking a competitor.

42
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,550
So for example if I wanted to always be ranking you da city.

43
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:27,980
Well then I could select this option and really put in the domain that I want to rank and then I'll

44
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,360
always be ranking them.

45
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,920
Now coming on than I have in hand CPC.

46
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,280
So again we need set up that conversion tracking and this will just allow you to get the it will actually

47
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,200
raise your bids for clicks that seem more likely to lead to a sale or conversion on your Web site.

48
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,990
So that is just a brief overview of those automated bidding strategies.

49
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,690
You can see there is that extra set up process for conversion tracking for a lot of them.

50
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:03,110
And the dangerous thing I think if you're a beginner is that you will be handing over the the bid to

51
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,340
Google Adwords for them to determine.

52
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,250
So that's why I would recommend you really just stick with manual's CPC to get started.

53
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,740
So you can really understand and control the costs for your first campaign.

54
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,230
Now budget I would recommend you keep it pretty small.

55
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,870
You can just put it in as 20 euros per day to get started.
