00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,450
In this video you're going to learn how to use one of the latest features from Google Analytics.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:12,910
It's called analytics intelligence and this is a very impressive development from Google Analytics.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,890
They have built this feature using machine learning to help the better understand and act on your data.

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,150
There's two main parts to this.

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,030
Featuring Google Analytics.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:30,060
You can get answers to plain-English questions and we'll go through some examples of those and they

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:38,310
even suggest questions that you can ask and also as well as that they have an insight section and really

8
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:44,340
want this analytics intelligence does this inside's part is that they'll crawl through your data and

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,600
surface insights on any major changes or opportunities that you should be aware of.

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,600
So let's have a look at some of these for example so I can see a notification here that I have a SightSpeed

11
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,310
issue.

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,430
And then the top page loads slower now.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,690
So we click into this.

14
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,970
It gives me more information on this.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,260
It says this exact page on my web site is loading slower meaning that it's taking longer for people

16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,790
to access the page.

17
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,040
And that has changed quite dramatically in the last month.

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:28,400
So in October it was reasonable but now it's become much longer loge load speed in the last month.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,470
So that's something that I need to go and investigate.

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:39,990
And it's just very helpful for me to really understand what this is what the changes and even I get

21
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,730
an explanation of why this is important.

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:50,100
So it's essentially like having your own personal google this assistant who is surfacing this information

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,560
for you and bringing it to your attention.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,050
And one thing I did actually want to show you here is if you see an issue like that you can save the

25
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,300
inside and you can go and look at that later.

26
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,800
So it can be useful to go through a lot of these different inside's you can read all them here again

27
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:13,990
or you can just focus on the new ones and you can also see see those saved ones that you've seen.

28
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,060
So let's have a look at some of these other insights.

29
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,250
I can see even at opportunities that I can maybe really work on.

30
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:30,270
For example it's saying that referral traffic from this particular site is performing better than other

31
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,750
referral traffic.

32
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:38,150
It says that the average session duration is longer or not the band's rate is lower.

33
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,950
So those are very good signals that this is a good web site that is sending me quality traffic.

34
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:53,010
And so if I want to grow my business and get more ideal customers to my web site then I can focus on

35
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:00,100
growing this particular marketing channel or getting more referral traffic from this site.

36
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,210
Similarly I can see another source of traffic which is not performing as well.

37
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,510
The base rate is higher than the average and the session duration is shorter so maybe I can focus on

38
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,710
that one.

39
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,200
We have a bit more information about that loading speed issue here as well.

40
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:26,910
It's telling me the exact page you can and showing me a comparison to the other top five line pages

41
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,050
those pages that Soman is coming into my website on.

42
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,580
So again just extremely helpful.

43
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,910
It's like having your own Google Analytics assistant really telling you what you should be focusing

44
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,560
on now as well as them surfacing these type of insights and opportunities.

45
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:51,030
You can also go ahead and just type in any questions into the search bar here.

46
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,240
So let's have a look and show you a couple of the examples of these just to see the range of questions

47
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,070
that you can pass this on medic's intelligence.

48
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,360
So let's start to ask some questions here.

49
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:10,170
If we click on the search bar here we can actually see some of the questions here that I've asked before

50
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,710
and we'll have a look at those and they also suggest some questions that you can ask as well.

51
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,970
It's kind of a different icon.

52
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,160
So you can really type in plaining and ish questions here.

53
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,380
And let's start with something pretty basic.

54
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:30,680
Like many users did we get yesterday.

55
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,610
And I can see 723 users yesterday on that particular day.

56
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,340
Okay and that's pretty cool.

57
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,540
Let's have a look at something different because we don't just get single numbers like that.

58
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,590
We can actually get graphs as well as a trend of new users

59
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,520
new users

60
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:06,600
this month so you can also get that graphical representation as well of different pieces of information.

61
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,520
You can also compare different things.

62
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,480
So here's what I asked earlier.

63
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,960
Conversion Rate of referrals versus organic search.

64
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,160
So I can see by looking at this information that my referral traffic is actually converting better than

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,170
my organic search traffic.

66
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:34,010
So maybe I want to continue to build that referral traffic seeing as it is converting and getting more

67
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,130
people to complete the goals of my web site than organic search.

68
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:47,420
Now we can look at say percentage questions or percentage of users on desktop

69
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:57,660
and here we can see that eighty eight point to 2 percent of visitors over the last week were on desktop.

70
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,240
So as you can see you can really just keep asking as many questions.

71
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,940
Not every question is going to have a perfect answer and if it isn't helpful you can just click no.

72
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,210
This one was sold just click yes.

73
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:18,750
And as more people contribute feedback and ask questions and say yes or no if it's helpful it's just

74
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,930
going to just become better and better and as I said it's like having your own personal Google Analytics

75
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:31,200
expert who is showing you you know what to do in order to grow your site and optimize your site.

76
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,910
So to recap unlikes intelligence is a new feature from Google Analytics and I think it does really highlight

77
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:47,370
how interactive and useful Google Analytics can be on why you should really take time to set it up correctly

78
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,000
and to learn how to use it.
