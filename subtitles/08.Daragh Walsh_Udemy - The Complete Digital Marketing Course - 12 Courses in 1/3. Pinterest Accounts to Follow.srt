1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,410
The number one thing that you can do to have success on Pinterest is to follow five top influencers

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,260
in your niche now by doing this this will really help you when you're creating your profile filling

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:13,680
in.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,970
So you have somebody to model there.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:22,140
And also even in terms of the boards that you create and the content that you pin you can really see

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,820
where people in your name sure are doing what they're successfully doing and that makes that process

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,470
so much easier for you.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,860
So in order to find those top influencers in your nation they're cance what you can do is just type

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:43,140
in your topic into the search bar here in Pinterest and what you're going to see now here is all of

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,520
the pins so all of the images for that particular keyword what you might want to do is come across to

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,740
people and in here I can see then some of the top cance for my knee share.

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:03,130
So I can see the number of followers 30000 followers 17000 followers and 19000 followers etc..

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:14,420
So all I need to do is open up these all these accounts and we can even look at the marketing Philippines.

14
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:20,090
You can have a look around at some of these and maybe even just get a sense of which would be the best

15
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,290
ones to follow.

16
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:29,410
So all I need to do is have a look at their Pinterest account read their profile quickly.

17
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,600
Is this something that's going to be similar to what I want to do.

18
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,650
If yes you can just go ahead and follow their accounts and you can see if they've got 30000 followers

19
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,830
will they must be doing something right.

20
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:50,660
If we look here as well digital marketing publishing we can have a quick look at their content so they

21
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,760
seem quite a broad amount of different fidget spinner's amazing hair.

22
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,900
So maybe that's not exactly in account that I would want to follow.

23
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,610
Digital marketing consultants.

24
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,890
OK 19000 followers.

25
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,900
Content Marketing Social Media Marketing Pinterest marketing.

26
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,210
OK.

27
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:14,660
So I really like the way that he's laid out his profile here visual content is his deafening guy that

28
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,990
I could model my Pinterest account on.

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,440
So let's see digital marketing.

30
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,660
This looks like maybe an agency our revenues brain game logical puzzle.

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,920
So again maybe not the perfect type of a to follow.

32
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,490
Here is another one blogging online traffic online engagement e-commerce so I can even see by the way

33
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,650
that they've laid out their profile that looks pretty good.

34
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,430
And sometimes you might find when you type in just one term maybe the appropriate people.

35
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:54,670
So what you can do is you can actually click into even digital marketing tips you can use the Pinterest

36

search bar and the suggested search terms here to narrow down your search.

37
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,450
If you want to find something more specific and then look into people there.

38
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:15,640
Another cool thing that you can do is just go to Google and search in like top Pinterest the cance digital

39
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:23,110
marketing or whatever it is your keyword or knishes there and then let's see here we've got a list of

40
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,630
people 27 or some social media markers to follow on Pinterest.

41
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,040
So I can get this list a lot of pop ups here if I can get this list.

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,750
OK let's open up some of these

43
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,250
7000 followers.

44
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:41,810
OK.

45
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,350
She looks pretty good if you scroll down to Twitter for marketing.

46
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:45,830
OK.

47
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,870
Perfect.

48
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,530
If I go back to my profile Let's see how many people I followed there

49
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,560
got seven followers or seven people I'm following now so I've got one two three four maybe just want

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,070
to get one more so I can return to this list.

51
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,160
And that's what this person here

52
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,270
NYC 10000 followers.

53
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,200
Scroll down and see the boards.

54
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,580
OK this looks good as well.

55
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,050
So now I can see I'm following eight people are topics.

56
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,440
So I've got my five people here.

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,260
And actually I have my topics here that I set up in the setup process can actually follow those if you

58
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,650
want.

59
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:35,500
Now I'm just sorry you have that focus list of people to look at.

60
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:42,040
But already now just by following those top five influencers in my knees I have a much clearer idea

61
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,860
already about how I'm going to lay out my profile how I'm going to lay out my boards and even some of

62
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,860
the content that I'm going to put out there.

63
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,880
So I would highly recommend you do this.

64
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,240
I think this is the number one thing that you can do to accelerate your success on Pinterest.

65
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,520
Just model the people who are already successful on the platform and pull all the best ideas from their

66
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,380
profile.
