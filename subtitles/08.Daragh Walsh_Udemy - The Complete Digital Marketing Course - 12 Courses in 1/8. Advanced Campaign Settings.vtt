00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:08.440
Now once you have determined your bid and Budget the next step then is to just set or adjust these additional

2
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.060
campaign settings not really finish the first step in and setting a pre-campaign process.

3
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.340
And there are quite a few different additional campaign settings that you can adjust.

4
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.160
I will just run through them briefly with them with you so you can understand what they are.

5
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.480
And the first one here is delivery method and you can see by default that will be set to standard which

6
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.940
really means that your budget will be spread over the entire time.

7
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.840
So if you've set a daily budget of â‚¬20 then it will spend the budget evenly over the course of the day.

8
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.340
If you click accelerated Well then this could really spend all your budget in the first hour of the

9
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.770
day.

10
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.780
So usually you just want to leave it as a standard delivery method then moving on then you can select

11
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.580
the start date for your campaign.

12
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.890
By default it'll really be today.

13
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.900
You can adjust that if you want it started next week.

14
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.250
And once you can also do is putting an end date if you want as well so you can maybe set the date from

15
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.190
seven days from now.

16
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.900
See your week campaign that you really know an end date of it and you can assess the results on the

17
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.970
basis of that rather than just letting the campaign continue.

18
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.640
Now after that we have the option to add extensions to our ADD.

19
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.470
And there's quite a few different ones sightline call extensions review sessions et cetera.

20
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.910
Here's a visual of really what these extensions can add to your advertisements.

21
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.350
So we're setting up a simple text ad but there is the option to add all these extensions in for example

22
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.250
the site linked extensions which will show a link to certain pages on your Web site.

23
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.170
You've got a call extension so you can put in your phone number.

24
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.350
You've got consumer ratings you've got seller ratings by stars.

25
00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.280
You can put in a location extension etc. and for the most part you don't need to pay any thing additional

26
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.860
to put these extensions in.

27
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.600
They work on the same basis cost per click if they click on one of these pages then you will just be

28
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.870
paying for that click as you would if they click through on the headline etc..

29
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.180
So if you want to set up these extensions it's pretty simple you can follow the steps.

30
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.220
And what I also recommend you do is go ahead and open up the Adwords help center.

31
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:38.090
For example if you wanted to put in the Site Link extensions so we can just type in site link at and

32
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.390
let's see you site link maybe.

33
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.600
So we have that exact step by step to set it up etc..

34
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.860
Hide them in and read it and walk you through that.

35
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.270
But now I just wanted to give you kind of an understanding of what those really are.

36
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.240
And you can add those in if you want.

37
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.930
I'd say for your first campaign just skip this step and you can do this later on.

38
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.960
Now our schedule this is something that you might want to change and for example the local business

39
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.040
and you're only open at certain times.

40
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.450
Well then you don't want to show your hours in the hours outside of when you are open or answering the

41
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.950
phones.

42
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.560
You can set up that ad Cheryle there and then moving on then there are a couple of option other options

43
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.360
there which you probably don't need to know about right now.

44
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.260
So you can adjust to any of those settings as you want.

45
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.210
And then just go ahead and click save and continue and then that will bring us through to the second

46
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.090
step in our campaign set up process which is to set up our groups and this is where we can really put

47
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.730
in the targeting for our certain keywords that we want to target.
