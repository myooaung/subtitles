00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,570
In this video you're going to learn how to optimize your cure pro Fasi you can get more traffic to your

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:14,140
website and also show you how to identify the best topics for you to focus in on.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,470
So to optimize your profile just click on your profile image in the top right and click on profile and

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,410
it's here you'll want the odd headline for yourself and let a little description and include maybe a

5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,560
link back to your company's Web site or your web site so you can put in something very basic to get

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,540
started like your role.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:47,540
And then in that description you can include a link back to your website or the company's Web site and

8
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,820
maybe include a reason for them to do so or to get curious about it.

9
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:59,900
So for example I've put in here that 200000 students have taken my courses and that hopefully that creates

10
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,770
some curiosity for people to click through and check it out.

11
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,860
So you don't have to have massive credibility like this.

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,520
You can include something that's going to appeal to your target audience and encourage them to maybe

13
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,190
click through.

14
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,260
The key thing to understand here is that I wouldn't worry too much about what this profile says right

15
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,350
now but that you just want to get something down here to get started before you start answering questions

16
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,510
because people will come back clicking to your profile to have a look at this.

17
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:38,240
After Yvonne's requests see one of deafeningly that link to your company or personal web site and create

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,480
some curiosity for people to do that and also just create a title for yourself.

19
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:49,030
Now an important part of building your profile is to add in the topics that you know about.

20
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:55,700
You might have a couple in here from when you created your account but we really want to add as many

21
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:02,090
as possible here and in particular identify those topics which are most popular.

22
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,840
So if you add in another topic that you know about and that you want to attract potential customers

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,710
from.

24
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,920
See if I add in Facebook as I can see 110000 followers.

25
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,140
So right all day I know that that is a pretty sizable topic here on Q.

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,860
That's tied in something else.

27
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:32,590
Google Analytics so I can see Eighty thousand people or so already on other Facebook Gad's is more popular

28
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,390
here on core than Google Analytics and eagerly in as many topics as you want.

29
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,290
Course it's going to be different for the type of business that you have.

30
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:48,460
But you can just keep typing them in and really noticing the amount of followers for each topic because

31
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:54,310
that'll give you an indication of how popular they are or maybe which is the topic that you should focus

32
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,360
on to get started.

33
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,000
So now it's your turn.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,230
Go ahead into your profile and fill out your headline and description and that in as many topics as

35
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,460
you want so that you can really begin to see the size of them.

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,530
And even one when you're out of them you can move your mouse over them to see the number of followers

37
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,630
here and that will give you a sense of which are the most popular topics.

38
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,020
Maybe where you should be focusing your attention.
