1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,710
Congratulations on completing the course.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,740
Now that you are a skilled Facebook advertiser it's time to start thinking about setting up your own

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,080
Facebook ads business or working from home.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,230
In this video I'm going to show you three different ways that you can do that firstly by looking at

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,530
five or dot.com.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,240
Secondly by looking at up work of freelancing platform and finally how I would set up a digital marketing

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,190
agency focus on Facebook ads some of the things that you should think about and really how you would

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,620
manage that practically with tools like business manager.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,790
So let's start off with fiber.

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,960
Dotcom was spend a couple of minutes on this and the other options as well.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,520
Farver Dotcom is a market place for digital services.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,730
And originally all of the services offered here started at $5 that's how it gets the name fiver or dot

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,400
com.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,530
But as you can see now I've typed in Facebook ads and you can see some of the services no longer sort

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,430
of $5 but they're starting up $20 $30 and even they can go up and up.

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:11,590
So originally this plus platform was at the very low end of the market small services really bite sized

17
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,220
stuff.

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,360
But now it's starting to scale up and grow over the last number of years.

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,930
In fact I used to be a top rated seller on fiber and reading on my start online here.

20
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,780
So let's have a look at some of the services that people are offering here in relation to Facebook accounts

21
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,120
and services that you could easily offer as well.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,400
So here's one.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,950
I will design awesome Facebook.

24
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,550
So let's click into this.

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:43,340
Look it's starting at $10 you can move up to $30 and even a $50 service.

26
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,420
I'm just renting up from the Euros here.

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,710
So what this guy does is he's designing Facebook ads.

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,790
He's not even running Facebook Ads managing them picking the audiences that type of stuff.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,900
Just designing the images for them.

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,330
And that's something that you could easily do as well.

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,140
Once you understand the 20 percent rule and you understand the dimensions that are needed to fit on

32
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,010
out Facebook and Instagram and even a little bit of design skills you could go ahead and do this is

33
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,770
nothing really stopping you from doing this.

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,530
And the interesting thing about this is he has over 847 reviews which if we multiply that by the basic

35
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:30,000
fee $10 you can see that this guy's probably made over about eight and a half grand doing this and he's

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,740
based in Sri Lanka and that's probably pretty decent money there.

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,730
So that is just something interesting.

38
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,980
And the point I'm trying to make is you don't have to offer every single step of the face Pickard's

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,940
process you could pick out one element become specialized in it and offer it for a very reasonable price

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,600
on fiber but make a lot of money through the volume that you build up in terms of sales.

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,670
So let's go back and have a look at some other examples.

42
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,790
This is a different one where someone is actually setting up Facebook ads for a business starting at

43
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,770
a higher price point here of around 30 dollars.

44
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,610
So the basic package you can click in here it's seven days.

45
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,480
It's a targeted audience one platform.

46
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,640
One version we can see the standard packet goes up with two platforms.

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,390
So that is probably Facebook and Instagram and for versions of some testing done there.

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,250
And that's even the premium package $200.

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,300
That's basically the month management tracking pixel targeted audiences et cetera.

50
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,750
So $200 per client to continue that management $200 per month per client.

51
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,080
That's not bad if you can rack up 10 clients or make it to around a month and you could probably push

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,430
it way beyond that if you have your processes work flow really fine tuned.

53
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,560
But this is a great way that I think you could get started at offering Facebook Ads services on the

54
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,430
fiber platform.

55
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,280
The key advantage of doing it here rather than setting up your own business right from the start is

56
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,650
that five dot com is a marketplace that's really drenched in hungry buyers.

57
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,440
The only reason they're here is to buy services.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,370
It's not like Facebook where they're there to hang out with their friends.

59
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,860
They're just here to buy and that's what makes it so attractive you don't have to do the marketing that

60
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,150
the orders just flooding flooding and you get to work.

61
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,480
So in terms of fiber in general how do you really win on this platform.

62
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,900
Well one of the key things that you can do is to video and none of these services have a video here

63
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:44,610
certainly Or here's one if I was buying a service if I could see the person's face hear their voice

64
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,490
I probably trust them more and it would be easier for me to put money down behind them.

65
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,920
And that's something easy.

66
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,820
Most people don't do video.

67
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:02,130
And when I worked on the platform videos were said to have a 200 percent increase in sales if you use

68
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:02,740
them.

69
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,960
Another thing that is absolutely critical on fiver is their reviews.

70
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,600
You can see the reviews are visible here and it is a big factor that influences the ranking.

71
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:19,770
So when I type in Facebook it's normally that the highest rated gigs will appear at the top highest

72
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,140
rated services will appear at the top.

73
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,720
So if you are launching a service here you have to make sure that when you put it out there you maybe

74
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,600
get a friend or couple of close associates to buy your gig.

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,250
You can start at a very low price like $5.

76
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,990
That's not a big cost to them.

77
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:42,210
And then you can raise your prices once your reviews have build up and you can really raise the prices

78
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,460
them.

79
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,470
The key thing is getting the reviews initially.

80
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,870
Now as I mentioned I worked on farver before actually a whole course on it.

81
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,800
If you're interested in that you can maybe check that out.

82
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,770
But bottom line is it's a great platform to get started on.

83
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,000
Let's look at some other options you could start working on.

84
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:08,160
Work dot com and once again I've just typed in Facebook wants to see who's really offering these services

85
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,120
so they're earning at $35 per hour.

86
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,880
So the key difference with this platform is really that people are working on an hourly rate.

87
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,190
They're not defining the exact services that they offer.

88
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,130
Now personally I think it's better to define the service because often the customer doesn't even understand

89
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,340
what they need.

90
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,510
But here in up work it's a little bit more flexible and you really define your work by an error rate

91
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,200
so you can see thirty five dollars per hour in Ukraine that's probably pretty good.

92
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:49,490
Fifty dollars per hour $640 generic aka air and hundred dollars per hour twenty K earned $60 printer

93
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:49,980
48.

94
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,050
So there's plenty of people making money and they're making good hourly wages.

95
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,140
Now the key thing here again is the reviews you can see.

96
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,210
Ninety five percent job success.

97
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,380
The percentage of freelancers jobs that resulted in a great client experience.

98
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,920
So once again reviews are absolutely critical.

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,260
And one thing you might need to do on a pork.

100
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:20,640
More than you would on Fiverr is really be clear with the customer exactly what they want to agree on

101
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,160
that.

102
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,780
In real concrete terms before you start the job so that you can meet their expectations because it's

103
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,290
not a defined service and the clients come in from the client side.

104
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,780
You really have to be clear on what you're offering so they're not disappointed.

105
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:44,900
And the other thing that you can do on work is start to browse for jobs so you can compete on jobs and

106
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:51,410
a big part of winning business is even to craft together a personalized page for the work.

107
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,970
Most people would just blast out the normal I'll do your job and they have a template that they copy

108
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,620
and paste.

109
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:03,000
So if you want to weigh in on a book you've got to pitch and make a personalized And so what people

110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,970
say in the pitches and that'll help you with the work and get those better reviews.

111
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,650
And the third option is to maybe set up your own digital marketing agency and wanted to show you this

112
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,140
example surgical studio.

113
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:22,560
So what they do is they help plastic surgeons cosmetic dentists and dermatologists get new patients

114
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,480
and grow their business from six to seven figures.

115
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:31,020
Now if we move down a little bit you can see that they're actually a little bit broader than just Facebook

116
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:37,770
ads and that may be something you need to do if you really want to go home on a particular needs like

117
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,160
the surgical studio in terms of Plastic Surgeons.

118
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:48,000
Now this is a good example because number one they've picked a group of people that have a lot of money

119
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,270
plastic surgeons cosmetic dentist dermatologist.

120
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,270
They make a huge amount of money in terms of the services they offer.

121
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,180
Therefore they have a huge amount of money in terms of spending on getting more clients.

122
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:06,000
So if you want to go to this cruise it's probably best that you try focusing on people who have money.

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,920
Lawyers accountants dentists things like that.

124
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,850
People have very small shops and don't even make a big profit themselves probably won't have a lot of

125
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,400
money to give you.

126
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,600
So that's the first thing.

127
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:23,250
If you want to go down this route try and focus in on a nice night to get started what you could do

128
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:31,320
is just walk down the road and find a business that needs help getting set up and really just get started

129
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,830
that way.

130
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:39,570
Testimonials once again like fiber like a cork That's the key thing you need to get your first clients

131
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,210
and maybe you can even start working for free.

132
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,140
So you can walk down into a dentist you could say look a run a Facebook ad for you.

133
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,600
I could even pay for $10 and let's just see the results and take it from there.

134
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,950
Yes you're paying to acquire a comp a customer but that customer if he's paying you a thousand a month

135
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,980
in the long run well then it's going to be worth that so a little bit of investment and you can do a

136
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,250
lot after that.

137
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,080
So those are three different options that you have.

138
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,630
One is five or marketplace.

139
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:19,300
The other is the work marketplace and three is really to go it alone and maybe start it in your local

140
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,730
area.

141
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,120
Literally getting out and talking to businesses signing them up in all three cases.

142
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,760
The hardest thing to do is get those first clients.

143
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,430
And you should really contact people you know to buy your services or even hook you in and do work for

144
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,060
free.

145
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,630
Start low price build their reviews and work from there.

146
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,540
Now finally in terms of managing this stuff day to day business manager is going to be the absolute

147
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,610
key.

148
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,340
Remember that if we come into business settings here and you want to work on behalf of a client the

149
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:58,390
key thing that you are going to have to do is come into pages or our accounts here on request access

150
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,560
to their products.

151
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:06,390
So if we come into our accounts we can add a new ad account and we can request access to their accounts

152
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,890
so that we can re work on it.

153
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:13,550
And the key advantage of doing this is that they will have their credit card on their account.

154
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,100
So we're not paying for their odds.

155
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,510
We're they're paying for their ads themselves.

156
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:24,380
And then we have agreed a fee separately which they will pay us maybe at the end of the month.

157
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:30,430
And your fee could really depend on whatever you've agreed with them that you will run three campaigns

158
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,010
and set up the stuff just like you've seen here.

159
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,500
You could even copy and paste what this guy is offering an offer or something similar.

160
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,920
And there's plenty of agencies that you can look on line to see exactly had a stroke shooting.

161
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,770
Or you could base it on results like get you certain amount of conversions visitors per month.

162
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,990
Whatever way you want to structure it so the opportunities are there.

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,380
There's nothing stopping you.

164
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,200
You have the skills the platforms are wide open.

165
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,020
It will take time to build up but it's very easy to work from home and start to face God's business.
