00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,090
To actually build our Web site we are going to be using a web site builder called WordPress.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,530
And in this video I want to explain briefly why we're going to be using WordPress.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:17,800
Before we jump in to the actual steps and I also want to explain why we're going to be using WordPress

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,710
over other options out there like weeks we believe Squarespace et cetera you might have seen some of

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,560
these other Web site builders ad there.

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:33,280
Well I think the most important reason to use Wordpress is because it is the most popular Web site builder

7
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,710
or content management system as it's also known.

8
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:44,320
So 29 percent of the Web uses WordPress like this is insane from Hobby blogs to biggest sites to the

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,240
biggest news sites online.

10
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,590
So you can see some of them here.

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:56,650
Vogue magazine Bloomberg ad Beyonce Jay-Z like a lot of people use Wordpress So it is by far and away

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,350
the most popular option.

13
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:06,880
Now weeks weebly Squarespace even combined all of them are less than 1 percent of the Web sites out

14
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,210
there.

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,030
So if you're picking a platform to learn and to understand I think it's much more valuable to learn

16
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:20,050
WordPress because there is much more demand in terms of businesses and clients for people with wordpress

17
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:20,890
skills.

18
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,600
And personally I think that's a great reason to learn how to use Wordpress now.

19
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:34,090
Another great thing about Wordpress is that it's open source software so nobody actually owns WordPress.

20
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:40,360
It's actually free software and now in order to get our site up with what our own domain we do have

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,660
to pay for hosting.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,250
So it's not like it's free to have a branded WordPress site.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,170
But what is interesting and what I like about this open source software aspect is that you can never

24
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,400
just be they can never just raise the prices on you on weeks for example.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,690
You're kind of bought into their whole platform.

26
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:07,450
If they raise the prices well then you can't really just easily move your site somewhere else on WordPress

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,670
if you're hosting company which is who you pay to keep the site up.

28
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,270
If they actually increase the prices well then you can just move to another hosting company.

29
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:22,690
So I really liked that aspect that it's open source and it gives me a sense of security investing time

30
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:29,770
building a site that I know that for the long term it's always going to be there on them and they're

31
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,240
never going to increase the prices without me having an option to switch.

32
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,060
So I really like that about WordPress as well.

33
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,450
Now the final thing about Wordpress which I think is a great reason to use it is that they have a massive

34
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:51,700
team and plug in ecosystem so teams are essentially skins that you put on top of Wordpress and it can

35
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,320
completely change the look and feel of your site.

36
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:03,880
And there are roughly 10000 WordPress themes out there and that means that you've tenderize in options

37
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,350
to change your site.

38
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,490
For some companies like Wake's they maybe have a couple of hundred.

39
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,120
So there's just much more options for word press.

40
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:20,590
Similarly they have what's called a plug in ecosystem and this allows you to add additional functionality

41
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,330
to your site.

42
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:28,180
There's over 50 ties and plugins and these are just little pieces of functionality that you can add

43
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,950
to your site very very easily.

44
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,670
You just install them and essentially you can automatically that function of the inn.

45
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,850
And so it's great to have so many options to this whole in which you wouldn't have would.

46
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:47,620
Another Web site builder like weeks are we accept etc. they just don't they're just not capable of creating

47
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,010
all of this extra software because all of this extra software is created by independent companies and

48
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:58,480
that's the beauty of really that open source aspect of wordpress.

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,850
So to sum up then why use Wordpress over some other Web site builders.

50
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:09,100
Well number one twenty nine percent of the Internet use it so your Create your building skills that

51
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,860
are much more valuable in the marketplace to its open source which means you're always protected in

52
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,090
terms of a company shutting down or price changes.

53
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,620
And number three then there is a huge theme and plug in ecosystem which really allows you to change

54
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,510
the look and functionality of your site very very easily.
