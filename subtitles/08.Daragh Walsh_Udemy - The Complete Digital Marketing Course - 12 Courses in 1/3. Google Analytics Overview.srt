1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,260
In this video I'm gonna give you an overview of Google Analytics and will cover pricing layers on some

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:12,550
specific examples of how you can use Google Analytics as a powerful tool to grow a business.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,130
So first off pricing.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,600
The great news is that Google Analytics is absolutely free.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,950
It's been free since it was launched in 2005 and this free model is really how Google Analytics became

6
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,310
the standard tool for web analytics.

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:35,780
Now there is a premium version of Google Analytics called analytics 360 but you would not need to upgrade

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,390
to this premium version unless you're getting more than 10 million unique visitors a month so that is

9
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:48,400
a huge amount of traffic on your Web site and you actually can't even buy this premium version online

10
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,940
if to specifically talk to the sales team.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,750
So I think that's a guarantee that you can be using this tool for free for a long long time until your

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,310
business is absolutely huge.

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,750
So now that you understand pricing let's get you familiar with the layout of Google Analytics.

14
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:11,810
So when you log into Google Analytics the first thing you're going to see is Google Analytics home and

15
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:18,170
really a number of different widgets here which give you some of the most interesting information about

16
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,150
your business.

17
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:26,330
So the thing to understand about this is that these are actually summaries of more detailed reports

18
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,090
that appear here in these sidebar.

19
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,880
So while it can be great to quickly scan on this Google Analytics home if we want to do our analysis

20
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:41,090
we're really going to be spending a lot of time here by clicking through these reports laid out in the

21
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,590
sidebar here and you can see that these reports are broken down into five different categories real

22
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,520
time Audience acquisition behavior and conversions.

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,470
So what these reports are known as are these standardized reports in google analytics.

24
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,210
And if you click in and open up all of these then count them up as I've done.

25
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,060
There are more than 100 standardized reports in Google Analytics.

26
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,170
Now you don't have to be familiar with all 100 of those standardized reports if you know how to analyze

27
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,730
about 10 or 15 of them.

28
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:19,100
You can make some incredibly effective decisions to grow your business.

29
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:25,190
Now these standardized reports that think about them on why they were so amazing when they came out

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,300
is that they created a common language to really assess the performance of different businesses online.

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,520
So before people were like creating their own metrics creating their own different spreadsheets long

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,960
came Google Analytics create these standardized reports.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,780
What that allows us to do as business owners or marketers is to assess different businesses at using

34
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,600
the same metrics and reports it facilitates the buying and selling of online businesses because we have

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:01,490
these standardized metrics and it allows us to create these benchmarks that are common to our industry.

36
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,090
And that allows us to really compare against different websites in our industry.

37
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,690
So we might take this for granted but this is actually pretty revolutionary stuff when it came out and

38
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:18,050
created their common language for online business similar to maybe the International Accounting Standards

39
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,300
ad that really just helped consolidate and give a common language to industries.

40
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:29,030
So that's a bit of the history of the standardize reports and why they're kind of so exciting even though

41
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,790
they don't look at maybe at first glance now as well as these standardized reports.

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,940
There is the customized customization section of Google Analytics and this really allows you to go beyond

43
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:47,840
these standard AIS reports and create your own reports that potentially could merge your own company

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,780
metrics and all flying data with the data from Google Analytics.

45
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:00,200
So all of that can happen in the customization section and that can really give you that customized

46
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,140
view that you may wants in Google Analytics now as well as this kind of reporting interface here there

47
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:13,190
is the admin section and this is used really when you're setting up Google Analytics.

48
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,650
This is where you put the tracking code and get it and put it on your Web site.

49
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,090
It's where you can setup goals like your business goals.

50
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:26,420
You can link to other Google products you can add colleagues and clients and much much more so generally

51
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,660
when you're setting up Google Analytics you'll spend a bit of time in this section here.

52
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,040
But once that's set up you'll really spend the vast majority of time in the reporting section here.

53
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:43,040
So now that we've covered pricing online let's look at some specific examples of how you can use Google

54
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,900
Analytics to grow a business.

55
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,640
So in the audience standardize reports here we can really get insights into the characteristics of our

56
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,940
users and we can use information like the age gender and location and device to really pinpoint our

57
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:07,500
audience online through say Facebook advertising and the more specific we target those users the lower

58
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,720
our advertising costs are going to be.

59
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,420
So that is one of the main uses of these reports to really pinpoint your audience online to create more

60
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,830
content for them.

61
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,130
That's specific to them and their characteristics or to really lower your advertising costs by pinpointing

62
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:23,430
them.

63
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,950
So the acquisition reports these show how users are arriving at our site and for example if we can see

64
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:38,760
a lot of users coming from the Facebook or social media then we can really create more content there

65
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,400
and look at more ways to drive engagement from those channels because we can really see that those are

66
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,160
the channels that are working now the behavior reports here in google analytics help you understand

67
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:57,840
users as they interact with your site and we can really look at these reports to tell you where your

68
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,920
site is leaking money where people leaving the site where are they dropping off in the checkout process

69
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,120
etc..

70
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:13,560
Now the conversion reports here really allow you to track the success of your Web site goals and we

71
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,220
can analyze these reports and optimize our sites so that we can turn more of our Web site visitors into

72
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,170
email subscribers or paying customers.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,370
So to recap in this video I've given you an overview of Google Analytics.

74
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:33,300
We've covered pricing layout and some specific examples of how Google analytics can be used as a powerful

75
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,470
tool to grow a business.
