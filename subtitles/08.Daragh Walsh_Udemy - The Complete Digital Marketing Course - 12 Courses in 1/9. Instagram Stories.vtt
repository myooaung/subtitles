00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.930
In this video you're going to learn want surround stories are and how you can use them to grow your

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.560
business on and surround.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.670
So firstly let me show you where they show up on Instagram if you come to the home screen here you can

4
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.590
see across the top I can see the stories for the cans that I'm following.

5
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.190
Also if I come into this discovery tab I can see across the top some stories from some of the top accounts

6
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.190
on Instagram that Instagram think I might be interested in.

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:38.740
Also if I come in to the accounts that I'm following and I can see in their profile a small ring around

8
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.710
their profile image and it's in here I can look at really the stories as well.

9
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.350
So those are kind of the three main places they pop up.

10
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.710
And here's an interesting thing about stories.

11
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.300
You can see that in here.

12
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:58.450
There is actually a link where where I can send people off to a site and you can see that Gary Vaynerchuk

13
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:05.230
here is really pre-selling his new book and that is a great way to use Torys and there is a caveat for

14
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.470
that.

15
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.590
You need to have over 10000 followers in order to be able to add a link like that but it is a very effective

16
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.050
way to drive traffic.

17
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.680
You can see there he's encouraging people to follow an account.

18
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.400
He's encouraging people to listen to a podcast that he was on.

19
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.410
And I think that brings us off to the store so I might just go back.

20
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.250
But you can see inside these Instagram stories is quite a lot of call to action.

21
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.170
Listen to the podcast follow his secant pre-buy my book and that is something you may not want to do

22
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.790
on your normal posts that are going to appear on your account.

23
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.820
Because the key thing about Instagram stories is that they are only viewable for 24 hours and that means

24
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.340
that the the quality the content can be a little bit less.

25
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.140
So if you've content that you don't think you can put on your profile maybe even the the image quality

26
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.630
or video quality is lower.

27
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.100
You can put it in your stories because it's still content that's good.

28
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.680
And because it's only available for 24 hours people expect it to be a little less polished than what

29
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.280
you might normally find on.

30
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.130
And the profile images or the feed underneath here so you can use it to sell or you can use it to publish

31
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.920
lower quality images.

32
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.940
You can use it to Deeb kind of behind the scenes stuff.

33
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.960
So let's go to some of the top stories here.

34
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.520
This is Peter the famous kind of singer.

35
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.530
And you can see it's kind of behind the scenes look here and as well what you'll see is there's quite

36
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.520
a few stories in in the one 24 hour slot.

37
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.430
So this is him kind of behind the scenes.

38
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.620
Why people like these stories is because it shows maybe people in action more as humans.

39
00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.130
It's not just a staged photo that's very polished and maybe photoshopped it lives.

40
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.710
People doubt that more human connection with an individual or even for a company the people working

41
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.820
in that company.

42
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.930
What's going on behind the scenes.

43
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.000
How did they manage things.

44
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.040
What is their office looked like what their employees looked like.

45
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.900
People are interested in those things.

46
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.590
So you can see this is just kind of pretty natural stuff going on and people are interested in this

47
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.750
as well.

48
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.160
So the key thing to note is that Instagram stories are not essential.

49
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.300
You don't have to use this feature on Instagram at all if you don't want to.

50
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.210
If I come into some of the other accounts that I'm following here just as an example you can see Richard

51
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.120
Branson.

52
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.970
There's no ring around his profile image there.

53
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.960
It doesn't look like he uses stories at all.

54
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.220
Or maybe just not right now.

55
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.890
Tim Ferriss doesn't look like there's any stories there either.

56
00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.960
And in fact only about 30 percent of Instagram users use Instagram stories.

57
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.840
So that's the kind of interesting thing Instagram stories are essentially a social network within a

58
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.220
social network about 250 million people.

59
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.110
Do you use them but that's only about 30 percent of Instagram's total user base.

60
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.460
So it is a new feature.

61
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:22.780
And in fact Instagram just stole it from snapchat.

62
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:30.050
It's an interesting back story actually that Mark Zuckerberg who owns Facebook who owns Instagram tried

63
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.290
to buy Snapchat twice.

64
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.750
And when they were rebuffed or refused they just decided to kind of steal the main feature of snapchat

65
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.400
and put it into Instagram.

66
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.100
And that has actually stopped a lot of people from setting up an Instagram account because the main

67
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.700
differentiator then was available in an Instagram here.

68
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.590
So that's kind of a little bit of the history of it.

69
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.800
Now let me show you how to actually add a story for yourself on how to publish one.

70
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.430
So what you can do is come into your profile here and you can see next to your profile image.

71
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:12.170
There's a little plus button and what you can do is just take any video or picture or even look at your

72
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.990
videos your images taken in the last 24 hours.

73
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.580
You can only post videos and images in the last 24 hours.

74
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.380
So what you can do is just select the image and there's a ton of features in here that make it that

75
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.840
bit more casual like you can kind of right on top of images.

76
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.090
I can then if I'm unhappy with that I can add that to my story.

77
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:45.520
And you can see now and that is that circle across the top of my profile I can know if I want to throughout

78
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.710
the day add more videos or images to my story what I can do is click on my story.

79
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.550
Click on the plus image in the top right hand corner again.

80
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.950
And for example I put out a video and there's all sorts of features in here superzoom rewind hands free

81
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.040
stop motion a lot of quite creative features that can make it pretty interesting.

82
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.210
So I'll just take a boomerang image here.

83
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.360
See you can see

84
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.050
and there you can see this kind of boomerang feature you've probably seen this before and really that's

85
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.800
you set it up.

86
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.770
So I'm happy with that then I can just add that to my story once again.

87
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.200
And so throughout the day you can be adding these videos or images that kind of give up behind the scenes

88
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.110
look if I come into my story once again.

89
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.560
I can see that there's my kind of boomerang video

90
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.220
and I can see my merry Christmas thing as well.

91
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.250
And then I can see it going into the video there.

92
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.140
So that's really how you can add your own content.

93
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.050
Use some of those features like writing on images that boomerang videos.

94
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.550
And there's just a ton of tools in there for you to get creative.

95
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.200
So I would recommend you come in look at some of those top influencers see how they're using them.

96
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:12.190
Remember that unfortunately if you're just getting started you won't be able to link off to your Web

97
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.150
site at his stories until you have 10000 followers.

98
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:21.410
But it is a fantastic way to drive traffic and another incentive for you to really build up your audience

99
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.960
so you can open up that feature within Instagram stories.

100
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:32.240
Zanetti you know what Instagram stories are how to use them where they appear and how to add content.

101
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.310
Go ahead and create an Instagram story for yourself following the steps that you've learned in this

102
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:37.980
video.
