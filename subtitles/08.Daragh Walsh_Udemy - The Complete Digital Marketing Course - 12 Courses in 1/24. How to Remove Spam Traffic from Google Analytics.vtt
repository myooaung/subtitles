In this video you're going to learn how to remove spam traffic from your Google Analytics reports.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.130
So as you were looking at your acquisition reports you may see that especially in the referrals section

3
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:21.450
a report you might notice some Web sites that are look a bit strange that are sending you high volumes

4
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.450
of traffic but that their balance rates are extremely high.

5
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.130
They're not engaging with the site at all.

6
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.430
The names are usually a telltale sign if they're spam sites or not.

7
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.410
Well you can always just do a quick search in google if you're not sure and type in the domain name

8
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.270
and then spam and you can really check if other people have reported it as a spam's site really want

9
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.770
your Google Analytics data to be as accurate as possible and is useful.

10
00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.360
So if there's a site that's contributing a lot of traffic that's really altering your numbers and giving

11
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.230
an inaccurate view of how many visitors and real visitors are actually coming to the site.

12
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.160
That is really the reason that you'd want to remove at the this spam traffic from your reports.

13
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.020
So to do that you want to come up to your admin section.

14
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.770
And again you're going to put in a filter to really remove this traffic from your side so we can click

15
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.270
out a filter.

16
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.450
We can give it the name.

17
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.700
Remove spam traffic

18
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.340
or we can set it as a custom filter.

19
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:44.780
We can then set the filter field to campaign source and then we can put in the name of the spam site

20
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.430
there.

21
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.880
Then we can just go ahead and click we can actually verify this filter which in this case wouldn't because

22
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.880
this is just a aside I made up.

23
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.390
But then to really save the filter you can just click save.

24
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.070
One thing to note is that this filter to filter spam traffic and any filter on Google Analytics does

25
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:17.280
not apply retroactively meaning it won't be removed from your reports up to date but any reports going

26
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.020
forward that traffic will be filtered out of it.

27
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.660
So usually it's good to maybe leave it a day or two and then come back and make sure that for those

28
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.260
last two days that they're at that site isn't showing up as any referral traffic.

29
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.730
So never you know had to remove spam traffic from your Google Analytics reports come into the admin

30
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.910
