00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,940
In this video you're going to learn how to moderate comments and reviews on your Facebook page sort

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,660
of get started.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,820
Let us look at how to moderate Commines So any time that you make a Facebook post underneath you're

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,080
going to see comments from other people here.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:24,140
Now a lot of the time these comments are helpful they're real comments but in some cases you actually

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:32,240
see these kind of spammy comments and usually they are are bots or paid services that people use.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,080
Just to comment on a load of different Facebook pages in order to give some visibility to their business

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,410
her Facebook page.

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:48,620
So to avoid this and to really keep your comments section as something useful and not just allow to

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,370
spam comments what do you news actually start to moderate comments.

11
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:58,850
So every time I make a post made to come back the day after and you can look at the cons and you could

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,050
have the option to hide a comment.

13
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,330
So let me have a look here.

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,090
So I'm just going to hide the comments and then you're going to see that you have the option to hide

15
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,260
the current elitist reported or ban that person from commenting on your Facebook page.

16
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,340
Now I'm just going on behind this for the moment because I think that is a general comment.

17
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:30,450
But you can ban people from your Facebook page and this is the best way to get rid of those obviously

18
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,310
spam comments from the current post and from all future posts.

19
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,950
If the Commons had one as commons my policy is just look you're just banned.

20
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:47,450
And then if they reach out to me I can unlock them and I will show you that in a second.

21
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,430
So you can ban people when you ban people they're no longer able to comment on any of your posts.

22
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,730
They won't see your posts in their news feed but they can still come to your Facebook page.

23
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,850
So I'm just going to unhide that because I think it's just a normal comment.

24
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,790
Now if you want to moderate your comments even further are unblocked as people who want to come into

25
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:14,610
the settings section at the top right hand corner of your page you can see that even number of options

26
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,590
here.

27
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,390
Well first let's show you how to unblock people so you come to people and other pages in the right hand

28
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:29,280
side you select from the dropdown menu here and people on pages and then you can see a list of people

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,240
and pages here and you can select from then you can have the option to on them if you want.

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,880
So if you made a mistake on the message and say hey why did you ban me then you can ban them if it was

31
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,530
a genuine and comments.

32
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:51,240
But as you can see I've been quite a few people so this ban comments are a real thing on Facebook and

33
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,360
if you have a Facebook page is something they just want to moderate to really keep your Facebook page

34
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,930
looking good and helpful to your target audience now as well as being able to Un-Band people what you

35
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,410
can do in your settings section under the general section is hardy in a couple of more settings just

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,480
to keep your comments section helpful and family friendly.

37
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,000
So if we moved then you can see that there is a profanity filter.

38
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,830
Right now I've just kind of turned all known seems to now.

39
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:31,700
But if you were getting some kind of hate comments or just not good comments that reflect in your business

40
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:39,860
you can increase the profanity filter to medium that's going to filter out a lot of typical hate words.

41
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,450
Or you can even then put it up strong.

42
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,900
Maybe start a medium and move up to strong if you need to.

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,030
Personally I haven't had a problem with that but it's something that is built into Facebook to help

44
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,990
people with that the need is now moving on.

45
00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:02,250
Dan am we can see there was an option here you can restrict countries or different ages if you want

46
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,790
as well.

47
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:13,490
And there was one other option I wanted to show you here which was yes the page moderation.

48
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,170
So you can actually block certain words from your page if you see them coming up quite a lot.

49
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,990
They could even be competitors names potentially.

50
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:29,330
But if there are certain words like see S.K. things like that you can fill in the blanks.

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,370
You could easily just block that right.

52
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:37,820
And if they are caught by the profanity filter so that's another setting within Facebook page that can

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,050
really help you keep it clean keep the family friendly.

54
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:49,490
So that is really a couple of additional settings that you can turn on if you want to really moderate

55
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,850
those comments and in terms of reviews We'll come back to our Facebook page you can see in the sidebar

56
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:03,680
here click reviews and then here you can respond to reviews on your Facebook page if you want and we

57
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,460
can be filtered by most helpful most recent.

58
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:13,220
And you can even filter them damn with a star rating and you can have a look at the lowest ones essentially

59
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,120
and respond to those people on this page.

60
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,430
I personally don't respond to the reviews because a lot a lot of them are coming in but particularly

61
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,670
I think for a local business or hotel or restaurant and I think it is important to show that you are

62
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,280
listening and that potentially are taking action to resolve that problem.

63
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,960
So you could respond back say this.

64
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,930
This was a two star review and it was of her hotel and they said breakfast was cold than you could say

65
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,740
something like.

66
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,310
Thanks very much for your feedback Mark.

67
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,520
Sorry to hear that your breakfast was an up to what you expected and it was a bit cold.

68
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,480
We are implementing steps to make sure that doesn't happen again for future guests.

69
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:07,140
So it's a way to turn a negative review into a positive because you are really showing the reviewer

70
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,270
that you listen to their feedback and you've taken action and you're trying to correct it from other

71
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:19,620
people and instantly their perception of your business will improve dramatically because they'll say

72
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,490
OK hey they made a mistake but at least they're trying to make it better.

73
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,530
And when they talk to friends they might say actually that place wasn't too bad and they might even

74
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:35,840
upgrade their rating based on your productivity to help solve those problems.

75
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:42,690
So once again to respond to those reviews you can just come in here and respond to those if you want

76
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,450
and pay particular attention to those negative reviews.

77
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,400
If you do have a low score and you want to get a lot higher now on average as I said and anything above

78
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,000
4.6 is probably very positive.

79
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,190
But here it's four point eight.

80
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,410
If your ratings so high.

81
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Well maybe there isn't a need to spend time in this but if it's dropping a bit low.

82
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,470
Then take that action and actually implement those things in your business as well.

83
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,920
So that is really how you moderate comments on reviews on your Facebook page.

84
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,940
Now that you know had to do is go ahead and do that for yourself.

85
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:27,150
It's just those settings if you need or implement these steps for any coins that you have or for your

86
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,200
companies page.
