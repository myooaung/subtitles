1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,850
In this video you're going to learn about local awareness sides and how you can create Facebook ads

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:13,180
to reach people on Facebook and Instagram when they are near your business location.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,350
We'll start by understanding what local awareness sites are and some of the call to action.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,830
You can include in those ads then we will jump into a case study here and see how this business that

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:30,040
pest Korea was able to build a lot of excitement around their business through local awareness ads even

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,350
before they launched.

7
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,960
Then we will have a look at this case study here for a medical center in Israel where they were able

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,900
to generate leads using local awareness ads.

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,000
Then we will jump into the ads create tool and I'll show you some of the things you need to watch out

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,010
for when you're setting up one of these local or innocence.

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,810
And also the difference between a local awareness ads and these store visits marketing objective that

12
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,710
you can see here to get started.

13
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,110
Let us look at the local awareness side understand a little bit better.

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:14,860
So as you now understand you use it to really get local attention and some of the messages that you

15
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:22,240
can use for these local ad adverts are to highlight promotions tell people about and offer happy hour

16
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,180
sale and give them that incentive to visit your business.

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,170
The key thing is that you want to keep it local and you can tell a story about your business roots local

18
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,460
products.

19
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,070
You can showcase a fun fact.

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,020
Does your location have any quality or interesting backstory tell people that in your business so those

21
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,960
are some of the ideas for the content of these local awareness ads.

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,050
Now let's have a look further down here and look at the call to action buttons that you can use in these

23
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,670
local awareness ads.

24
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,730
Now they are called local awareness ads but there are some cool to actions you can include like giving

25
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,920
people directions help them find your shop from their phone.

26
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,970
It's great for driving foot traffic.

27
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,270
You can include your phone number in these ads.

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,030
They can call you when one top and speak to you directly.

29
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,800
You can also include the call to action for them to send you a message.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,830
And that is a great way to generate leads and people very close by and you can also just get them to

31
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,520
learn more and click through to your Web site for more information.

32
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,930
So there's more to these local awareness ads than you would think.

33
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,950
And those called the actions are going to be great for driving foot traffic.

34
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:44,650
And let's have a look at the first case study which is for this Italian restaurant franchise called

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,970
passcode here.

36
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,820
So what they did and what's interesting about this particular case study is that they really use Facebook

37
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:58,060
and Facebook ads before they even open the business to promote it and generate interest.

38
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,050
So let's scroll down a little bit and to see some of the details on this.

39
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:10,080
So two months before opening day the company began posting pictures of its dishes on Facebook.

40
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:16,030
The posts are aroused enormous interest and people began to ask for more information about the location

41
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,970
of the restaurant on the opening time on the opening day attracted 500 people who flooded the streets

42
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,270
and to get access to it.

43
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,860
So if we moved down here.

44
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,780
Here are some of the results.

45
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,460
So this is a combination of using Facebook.

46
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,110
It's page but also the ads as well.

47
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,100
So we can see that the Facebook is the number one source of new customers.

48
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,560
Seventy percent of the company's revenue is generated through Facebook.

49
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:50,380
They sold their signature dish 3000 of them in the first 30 days and 80 percent discovered thanks to

50
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:57,520
Facebook and 500 people attended the opening day promoted exclusively through Facebook.

51
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,630
So this case to be really shows that even a Facebook page is extremely powerful for a local business.

52
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:10,900
Now if we look up in terms of the actual ads themselves what they said is it seems to be after they

53
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:18,580
open they started to run the ads that they run ads to reach more potential customers the target audience

54
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,240
was defined by geographical location six mile radius of the restaurant.

55
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,740
And they have tested those boundaries over time as they've gone on to look at the different franchises

56
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,100
et cetera.

57
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,130
But I think that is just a great case study to see that you can promote through the Facebook page even

58
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,620
prior to launch and build up a lot of buzz for that opening day.

59
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,290
Now they don't seem to have mentioned it here but you could use an event response ad which will cover

60
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:53,920
later to really make sure that Opening Day is a big hit and you can get a lot of people coming in like

61
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
they did here.

62
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,760
In this case it seems like they were able to generate that interest organically but you could do that

63
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,010
with an event response ad for an opening day.

64
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,710
I'm going to show you how to do that later on in the course as well.

65
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:15,280
Let's move on to the second case study and look at how a medical center in Israel was able to generate

66
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,010
leads for their maternity services.

67
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:27,220
So we can see here that they got over 90 percent of target audience reached a quite a small audience

68
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,650
for these type of services.

69
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,060
Obviously there's not that many people having babies.

70
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,950
So it is a quite a niche market.

71
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,110
And they were able to meet to meet 90 percent of it in Israel which is pretty impressive.

72
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,280
14 percent of clicks converted into Leeds.

73
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,270
Eighty two percent of Leeds became customers.

74
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,820
So that's interesting thing that about 14 percent click through which is pretty high.

75
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,050
And then eighty two percent of those became customers which is very high again.

76
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,790
So they must have had a great strategy in order to make this happen.

77
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,650
So let's look at some of the ways that they do that.

78
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,800
Now in terms of the size of the audience nine thousand babies every year.

79
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,040
So you're talking about 9000 mothers which is pretty niche.

80
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,490
So let's have a look at how they did this so reaching parents to be.

81
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,390
Here's the interesting part.

82
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:24,810
The hospital wanted to reach pregnant women in Israel a relatively small audience at any given time

83
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,500
and a marketing team knew that they needed a very cost effective way to tap into this audience.

84
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:38,400
So first what they did is a targeted ad to relevant people based on age gender interests and location

85
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:46,670
then it used custom website audiences to retarget Web site visitors with a strong call to action and

86
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,800
people in the relevant locations who'd visited their campaign landing page was shown optimize lead ads

87
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,940
which encouraged them to make inquiry very quickly and easily.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,420
So the strategy here for them was firstly because they didn't know exactly who the people were and who

89
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,830
would be interested.

90
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:10,530
They did a broader campaign based on age gender interests and locations.

91
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,410
Women of a certain age who might be pregnant and might have certain interests in things that they could

92
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:24,260
pick up on and of course location because they have a medical center can only serve a radius of people.

93
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,500
Then they followed that up once they knew who clicked through on that ad with a lead ad.

94
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:36,750
And obviously Facebook was able to pre field maybe their phone number email and they were able to follow

95
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:36,950
up.

96
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,600
And that's probably why they had such a high number of leads becoming customers.

97
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,650
Maybe they call those customers afterwards and conversion over phone is going to be much much higher.

98
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,780
That could be the reason that you're seeing such big results there.

99
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,870
But the strategy in general very interesting interest age demographic targeting first followed up with

100
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,240
a lead ad based on a custom audience.

101
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,500
Very interesting to see.

102
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:10,710
Now let us jump into the ads create tool inside your ads manager and really want to walk you through

103
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,010
the process of setting up one of these local awareness sites.

104
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,760
They're very similar to most campaigns.

105
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,350
There's a couple of things to say.

106
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:23,850
And also in here I wanted to just explain the difference between local awareness sites and store visits.

107
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,130
It seems like it's the same thing.

108
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,670
Why are they in two different columns.

109
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:37,290
Well the key thing about these store visits here is that these are still for people to visit your brick

110
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:45,810
and mortar locations but the difference is that these ads are really set up to serve people and stores

111
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,510
with multiple locations.

112
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:56,250
So the idea about these ads is that you have one create creative on that you can serve that to a lot

113
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:02,430
of different neighborhoods and that it will dynamically change the phone number that you need to call

114
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:08,820
the address that you want to go to if you want to give people directions even if they're separate reps

115
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,400
websites for separate locations.

116
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,120
You can include the you or else there.

117
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:21,720
So this is location based ads at scale and that's really the purpose and the difference between these

118
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,840
store visits.

119
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,870
Now if you want to setup one of these store visits ad and you've got multiple locations and you want

120
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:34,290
to show a different at each location then the first thing you've to do is set up your business locations

121
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:40,460
in business manager and you can click here to really get a walk through of all those steps.

122
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:47,100
Now as I don't have a Facebook page that is has a specific location in it's fortunate I can walk you

123
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,280
through all the steps but it's fairly straightforward and all of these steps are given out here.

124
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,900
But the key difference is really that this is ideal.

125
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:05,190
If you've got multiple locations if you're a franchise and you want to develop these ads at scale let's

126
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,170
come to the local awareness ads though and really have a look through this process so you can select

127
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:18,600
this as my marketing objective and then hear you to select the radius of the audience that you want

128
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,200
to cover the age the gender of course you want to target specific people like we saw in the medical

129
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,890
center example they were really focusing on women of a certain age and so think about not just people

130
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:39,330
who ran your business but the type of people as well coming down to the ad example here I want to show

131
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:44,580
you quickly how you can change the call to action for these type of violence.

132
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:50,040
So right now you can see the call to action is like page but as this is the local awareness site there

133
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:56,730
are much better options that you can choose from like you can get people to call now.

134
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,430
Now here's the thing is that if you want to call now the action is only available on the mobile news

135
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:08,230
feed an Instagram feed placements so you can't put this on a desktop.

136
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,840
So I'd have to remove those placements which I can do here easily if I want to do that.

137
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,560
So coming back up to placements let's just see where this is now.

138
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,410
It's not on the audience network.

139
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,660
I'm going to see here for Facebook.

140
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,570
It's just in the feeds.

141
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,440
I can pop that in and then for Instagram as well I can see it's in the feed.

142
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,110
So if I come then again and it comes down to coal now.

143
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,060
Now it just stick in my phone number there.

144
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,510
I can also put in get directions as well.

145
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,850
Pop in the street at the address.

146
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,590
So I think remember for these type of local awareness stands you're really targeting people on mobile.

147
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:58,060
So for those placements as well you want to make sure that you are really targeting people for mobile

148
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:03,520
and make sure that you're not putting say we have mobile only up here and just make sure that's set

149
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,370
as that.

150
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,380
In terms of your ad creative.

151
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,880
Well you can put in a lot of different things here.

152
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:16,690
If we go back to our original example some of the ideas that you can use you can highlight some promotions

153
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,230
so you could say it's happy hour or there's a sale on.

154
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:26,620
Unfortunately you can't put it like a coupon in here for this particular type of art but you can say

155
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:33,280
sale on now or happy hour in our drinks that the Special Prize and you can also schedule designs to

156
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,280
run at a particular time which is probably going to be a good idea if your local business is only open

157
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,190
for a particular time.

158
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,970
And in terms of odd scheduling you can run these ads on a schedule as well.

159
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:54,880
You do have to set up a lifetime budget in order to enable that but that could be a great idea for a

160
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:55,680
local business.

161
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,970
So this lifetime budget is you set the lifetime budget of the campaign.

162
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,490
And it's not done on a daily basis.

163
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:09,160
And the reason for that is Facebook needs to make sure that it can deliver and and spend the budgets

164
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,850
not might not be possible to do it every single day.

165
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,940
So you can really set those schedules and that's probably a good idea for local awareness.

166
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,700
And so to recap on some of these things that you need to watch out for just make sure the placements

167
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,260
are for mobile only in terms of budget and schedule.

168
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,380
You might want to do that on an a particular schedule if your business is only open uncertain times

169
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:41,700
or you have a happy hour at a certain time and you want to run that then down in the ad level.

170
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:49,420
Just think about that call to action and what that should be and use an appropriate and creative for

171
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,580
the promotion that you're running or happy hour etc..

172
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,060
So now that you understand what local awareness ads are.

173
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:03,040
Go ahead and set one up if you want to reach more people on Facebook and Instagram when they're near

174
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,740
your business location.
