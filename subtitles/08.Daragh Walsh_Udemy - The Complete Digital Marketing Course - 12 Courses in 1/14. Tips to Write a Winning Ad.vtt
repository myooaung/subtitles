00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.120
After you've chosen the image for your AOD the next step is to write words for UROD that are really

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.730
going to convince people to click through or take that next step that you want them to take.

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.150
In this lecture I'm going to show you my example the text that I've written and also give me some tips

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.330
and tricks to enable you to write a winning Facebook card very very quickly.

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.760
So the first thing that you want to do to keep this process off is really come across to the odd preview

6
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.810
here and really see what her art looks like right now.

7
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.120
So remember that if you have added a couple of images up here you can just come across to click to number

8
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.390
Vance click across and you can start to see what's your odd.

9
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.920
Really looks like.

10
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.100
Now I have gone ahead and updated my headline and text and call to action here so I can run through

11
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.910
without you.

12
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.810
But if you have just loaded this up now you might be getting some text here.

13
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.940
And that is because Facebook is pulling it from the page that you are going to be really directing your

14
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.600
ad to.

15
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.550
Now they do.

16
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.470
This is a good base to start from.

17
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.200
But there isn't often the type of language there that you would want to so I'll show you how to edit

18
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.660
that.

19
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.450
Now the first thing that you really want to be focusing on is the headline.

20
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.570
You have 25 characters here to really grab attention.

21
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.440
This headline appears underneath the odd image and you can see that the text here is a lot larger than

22
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.120
text.

23
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.320
On the other parts of the ad.

24
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.440
So if your image catches people's eye the next thing that they're going to look at is this headline

25
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.020
here.

26
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.900
So you really want something here that's going to catch them at their attention and get them interested.

27
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.870
So what I have done here is putting in really a description of what I'm offering.

28
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.590
It's a complete digital marketing course.

29
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.040
And here I start to talk about some of the benefits 12 courses in one.

30
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.370
So immediately people can see OK well this is an all in one course and it's 12 and 1 so people are probably

31
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.610
thinking well that's great value for money.

32
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.130
This is interesting.

33
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.570
So for your headline I would recommend you either layering in a description of what the product is Plus

34
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.590
a benefit or just go straight for it benefit like attract new customers or get a new job or drive leads

35
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.060
or something like that.

36
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.780
It would be appropriate for my.

37
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.290
Obviously the benefit of your product or your service your app is going to be completely different.

38
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.380
But it is important to show that upfront.

39
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.820
Now after you have completed your headline the next step is to work on your text and this text appears

40
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.080
above the odd.

41
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.570
Here again it's a very similar concept.

42
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.460
You just want people to really understand the benefits of Wotcher offer and what are they going to be

43
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.180
able to achieve after taking your course using your product etc..

44
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.670
What does the future look like for them.

45
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.390
What I have put in here is a little bit of social proof as well.

46
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.450
So join 40000 students so an action word a little bit of social proof and get a complete education that

47
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.590
will say your business resume apart.

48
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.640
So I'm trying to paint a picture about what's going to happen once they buy my product.

49
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.050
Also I'm saying here get the first lesson free so it's not a big they don't have to make a buying decision

50
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.520
now.

51
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.450
All I'm trying to get them to do is really click through.

52
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.450
So I just need to show the benefits to get them to click through.

53
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.890
Now after you have worked on your tax there you can move down further and click Advanced Options and

54
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.680
see here the news feed length description.

55
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:58.230
So as my arm is being shown on the desktop news feed this will appear if I had chosen to show my ad

56
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.850
on the right hand side column or maybe inside Instagram this description here would not appear but it's

57
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.210
the same idea again.

58
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.020
You want to show the benefits.

59
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.090
Explain a little bit more about your product.

60
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.980
So I've explained really what's involved a little bit more.

61
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.750
You know 12 courses and one everything you need to grow business online fast get the first lesson free

62
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.050
so a reminder of that call to action again.

63
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:32.100
Now after you have set your headline and your text and the News Feed linked description you can also

64
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.210
then set the call to action button.

65
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.180
And this is what's appearing here.

66
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.510
Learn more.

67
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.490
Leave plenty of options to choose from.

68
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.020
And really the option that you will decide on it depends on the type of outcome that you're driving

69
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.680
people towards.

70
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.050

Watch more.

75
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.400
You can see there are a lot of options there for you to choose from.

76
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.770
So the the elements once again are the headline this is critical then the text above text below on the

77
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.450
call to action button.

78
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.390
Now I understand that it can be quite hard to come up with these ideas yourself how can you really sell

79
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:20.080
the benefits and not get bogged down in just selling how your product works or what the features are.

80
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.390
Now one great way to get text for your hour that you can do is copy and paste is to actually come into

81
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.520
Facebook itself and look at the ads that are coming up.

82
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:35.530
One of the benefits that they are using what are some of the languages that they are using so sign up

83
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.160
for free.

84
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.060
That's something great from this site that I could probably incorporate up to 90 percent cheaper.

85
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:49.390
So making a comparison to competitors where the best way to send or whatever so you can see that sign

86
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.970
up for free up to 90 percent cheaper where the best way to do X.

87
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.520
This is all language that you can use for your own.

88
00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.410
And what I would recommend you do that as you go through your news feed over time to start to save some

89
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.970
of the ads that you like and the language that you like.

90
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.210
Very simple to do.

91
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.750
They can save link.

92
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.810
Then after a while like I've done here you can have a database of a ton of ads to choose from on language

93
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:14.800
that you like.

94
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.570
So for example here is an Linked-In post that I thought was pretty good.

95
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:27.220
The language exceed your marketing goals that anybody could use that language exceed X get started and

96
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.130
attract new customers.

97
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:35.590
Raise Brown awareness drive leads success awaits all of this language no matter what you're offering

98
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.420
is language that you could use.

99
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.160
Just copy and paste this and put in the relevant information for yourself.

100
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:49.990
Now as well as getting ideas from your Facebook news feed you can also come across into Google and look

101
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.340
at what the advertisers on Google Adwords are using.

102
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.580
You're only trying to get inspiration here.

103
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.770
So what I would suggest you do is type B in your product name or something similar to that and see the

104
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.930
language the headlines the texts that competitors are using on a completely different platform.

105
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.570
But still there is still kind of trying to convince people to do the same things.

106
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.150
So let's have a look here.

107
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.170
Learn anywhere any time.

108
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.730
So key advantage for online learning 2017 shows it's up to date.

109
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.840
Now when rolling creates a sense of urgency.

110
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.470
53 percent of our graduates got a pay rise.

111
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:35.990
So a clear tangible result from people from taking this 88 percent are in managements are really going

112
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.600
with some statistics that's a great way to sell some benefits.

113
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.860
And looking down here you can see some other ones here as well.

114
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:49.790
It's going to be different for your product but this is just a great way that you can gather ideas.

115
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:56.950
So to recap once again the key areas that you should focus on are the headline The text on the call

116
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.180
to action button ID in that news feed link description if it's relevant.

117
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.840
Gather ideas from Facebook or Google AdWords.

118
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:10.250
And really it can be hard to know if this is really going to be the perfect copy.

119
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.000
But as we said you can test this as we go forward.

120
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.940
For now just get started with something and see the results.

121
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.740
So take a few minutes to go ahead and write a winning Facebook ad right now.
