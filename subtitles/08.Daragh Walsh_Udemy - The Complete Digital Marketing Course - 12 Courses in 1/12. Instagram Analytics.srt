1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,650
If you want to grow your own throughout the can then one of the best things that you can do is on a

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,910
weekly basis come in and review your Instagram analytics and to access your Instagram on links.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,280
Just click the little analytics icon beside that your account name.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,330
And this is going to bring you right into the analytics dashboard and it is fairly basic but this is

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,220
probably all of the information you really need in order to make decisions to grow.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,130
You can see the number of followers you've got.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,230
In the last seven days and the number of posts that you made and really this analytics information is

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,660
going to just be shown for the most part.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,460
On the last seven days you can see also the number of impressions.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,440
The number of it.

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,240
So the number of times your posts has been seen impressions the number reached the number of accounts

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,030
that it's been seen by the number of profile views.

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,770
And if you look at your profile the number of clicks on those call to action buttons on your underneath

14
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,060
your bio.

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,400
I need to get 100 followers before I can see my demographic information but that will be things like

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,260
the name or the Age and The Sex and the location of my followers.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,900
I can also see in terms of my posts all of them for the last year sorted by impressions.

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,580
And so this can be a great place to come in and look out and say OK well I've made six boys posts this

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,550
week which was the one that got the most impressions.

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,640
Maybe I can continue to make more content like that because that is getting a lot of impressions or

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,730
maybe even click in see one of the hashtags that I use maybe was responsible for that higher number

22
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,650
of impressions.

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,530
So always come in here and study and and try to understand why you did not post get so many impressions

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,430
and continued to make more content like that.

25
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,170
So you can continue to get more impressions now.

26
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,640
Below are normal posts that appear in our profile.

27
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,940
We can also see metrics for our stories.

28
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:06,660
Now this is not going to be shown for the last year but for the last 14 days but really sorted by impressions

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,800
once again and this is a great way to see again where one of those stories that are getting the most

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,190
amount of media impressions and that our audience are liking.

31
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,720
We can also see then the analytics for any promotions that we're doing.

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,500
And also down the bottom here which can be pretty helpful actually is just a definition of some of the

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,510
metrics that are showing up here.

34
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,070
So impressions just as a reminder are the total number of times that all of your posts have been seen.

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,880
And what is cool about that is especially in this analytics section is that it's the main metric for

36
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,550
posts and stories.

37
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,150
So if we click in here once again sort of by impressions and for stories it's impressions as well.

38
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:59,940
So what that allows you to do is compare like by like so poets with stories and you can really see OK

39
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,430
well are my posts or are my stories getting more impressions if your stories are getting more impressions

40
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,980
while then maybe continue to make more stories and continue to make more of the stories that are getting

41
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,850
the most amount impressions.

42
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,870
So the analytics or the inside section here is fairly basic but to be honest this is all you really

43
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,200
need to do.

44
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:26,070
And the main thing you want to find out is which is which type of content posts or stories that are

45
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:33,270
getting the most time impressions and which of those posts or stories are getting the most impressions

46
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,600
again.

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,350
So you're just drilling down into the most popular content.

48
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,390
You make more popular content with the right hashtags and you're just going to grow your visibility

49
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,960
and impressions on Instagram.

50
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,390
I think it's actually great the way it's so simple sometimes you can really be overwhelmed by all the

51
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,590
reports in say Facebook analytics or Google Analytics.

52
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:02,160
So it's quite a simple analytics dashboard but nonetheless it can be extremely helpful to guide you

53
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,190
towards growing your Instagram account.
