00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,670
Welcome to the course.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,500
My name is Dhara and I've helped Cozzens of students just like you grow their business and career in

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,710
this complete digital marketing course.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:16,260
Now in this course we're going to cover market research how to set up a Web site e-mail marketing copywriting

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,860
SBO YouTube marketing Facebook Marketing Twitter curagh Google ads Google Analytics Instagram marketing

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,970
Pinterest marketing linked in Facebook ads and app marketing.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,200
And I've designed this course to give you practical skills that you can use right away at the end of

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,070
each section is Anon's as an assignment so you can implement what you have learned.

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,100
Now if you want to grow your own business online from scratch then I would recommend you complete these

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,420
assignments in sequence because they really progress in a logical order starting with market research

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,000
setting up for Web sites and then driving traffic and sales.

12
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,250
If you want to grow a particular marketing channel.

13
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,800
Let's take for example YouTube for an existing business or do promote affiliate products.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:15,770
Then feel free to jump ahead to that section each section is designed to work as a stand alone course.

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,560
Now if you want to work as a freelance marketer then you can essentially sell each of the completed

16
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:30,870
assignments in the course as a service and you can even bundle up all of these services and sell them

17
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,560
as a package.

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,940
For example you could easily get declined to pay five hundred dollars to set up a Web site and install

19
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:46,620
Google Analytics for them and throw in Facebook ads and you could easily be getting in 2000 dollars

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,940
per client.

21
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,970
Now if you want to get a job in digital marketing then you don't need to complete the assignments that

22
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,690
are in the course but you can walk into an interview and confidently say you know I can do X Y and Z

23
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:08,150
for you and he might even be able to negotiate a better salary based on that conversation alone.

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,650
So welcome to the course.

25
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,610
Digital Marketing has allowed me to create wealth and freedom for myself.

26
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,010
So I'm really excited to share everything I learned to do in this course.

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,780
So let's get started.
