00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,070
In this video I'm going to show you how to add a cover image to your Facebook page.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,380
I don't even show you how to design one for free.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,440
Tonight a cover image to your Facebook page.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:20,490
You can click on this little button here in the cover image space and you can choose a photo or upload

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,470
a photo and you can even upload a video or a slide show in this space as well.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,320
But for this video we're just going to look at it uploading a photo.

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,760
So what are some of the best practices for using this space and getting the most out of it.

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,880
Well let's have a look at an example here on you Timmy Dotcom's Facebook page.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,210
They have used this in an interesting way.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:51,060
They have included a picture of their ideal customer or their customer really in action using their

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,170
product or service.

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,550
So to me is an online marketplace that sells online courses.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,400
And here you can see a picture of one of their students really using their marketplace.

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,820
You can see he's got the laptop.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,700
It looks like he's at home.

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,130
He's taking notes.

17
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,600
And so they are using this space to really identify with the customer.

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,530
So when I see that and come to their page I say hey that's kind of what I'm doing.

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,320
And then I can identify with that.

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,640
It speaks directly to the customer.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,960
Another way that you can use this cover image space.

22
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,290
For example if you were a local business like this one here which is a steakhouse in Dublin they have

23
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,620
taken a picture of the outside of their building and this is a great use of this space as well because

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,800
if I come to their Facebook page to find out if they're open a little bit more about them read the reviews

25
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,070
well then I get a clear picture of what it looks like from the street and that when I walk past it makes

26
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,870
it very easy for me to identify.

27
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,920
Yes that's the place I saw it online and that's the exact picture of it.

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,440
So I know I'm here or that's where I saw that review.

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,030
But the place that looks good.

30
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,060
So that's another interesting way to use this cover image space.

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,740
Now there's really unlimited possibilities for this.

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:15,330
And so if you want you can come in use the Facebook search bar search for a similar business to your

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,240
to yourself and check out how they are using them.

34
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,000
Now I do want to show you how to design your own cover image for free and to do that and you can come

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,900
into Kanva dot com.

36
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,130
It's essentially just like Photoshop but a lot simpler and completely free.

37
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,680
And the best thing about it is that they have templates for Facebook cover images so you can just log

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,840
in and then click on Facebook cover.

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,980
You can see it has the exact dimensions that we need.

40
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,570
So this really saves a couple of steps in the process.

41
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,550
So you can click into that and right now you can see that we have our blank canvas in those correct

42
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,260
pixel dimensions.

43
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,260
And then over here on the left hand side we have templates that we can actually use and drag and drop

44
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,290
into this blank canvas.

45
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,060
Now a lot of these are free and you can use those and just manipulate the text and the colors and the

46
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,930
images if you want.

47
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,950
And some of them do have some page image page images and or paid elements to them.

48
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,600
And that's OK because Kanva are providing a great service.

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,890
Obviously they need to make some money out of this.

50
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,060
And the cool thing is that if you see a template like this that has some paid elements to it it doesn't

51
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,930
mean you can't use it at all.

52
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,830
You can just go ahead and delete the paid elements so I can see here because it's got the Xs at the

53
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,680
back that this is a paid element.

54
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,690
So I can actually delete that.

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,790
And what I'm going to do is actually put my background in this and then delete the background here per

56
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,160
my own background that I've uploaded.

57
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:03,190
And actually I can see that this part of the image as well as the paid elements are actually going to

58
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:13,720
remove that and I'm going to replace that so I can come up in two elements shapes and I'm going to pop

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,770
this in here.

60
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,770
I'm going to

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,350
reposition this.

62
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:29,670
And you can see it gives you a lot of help to make things centered and I think that looks pretty good.

63
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:39,820
So once you have created a cover image that you like then you can just go ahead and click download and

64
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,960
save it as a ngi

65
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,280
and it can take a couple of seconds like this for it to download and it's going to move that to my desktop.

66
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,690
What I might do before I leave this is just click save.

67
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,520
So I have that for later.

68
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,970
And then they're going to come back to my Facebook page.

69
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:16,840
Click on Add a cover from a photo and actually I need to click upload upload a photo and there's my

70
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,370
design

71
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,600
I can just uploaded there.

72
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,360
And I think you'll agree that looks fantastic and we're really taking advantage of this prime real estate

73
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,190
on our Facebook page.

74
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:37,100
Now one final thing that you want to do in order to get more Web site traffic from your Facebook page

75
