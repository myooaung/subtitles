00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,160
A key part of setting up your Pinterest profile is to claim your Web site.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,790
And by doing this you're going to get a back link to your Web site.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,810
You're also going to appear higher in the Pinterest search results and you also get access to these

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:22,040
handy features and you're also going to see your Web site on your Pinterest account.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,320
So what you want to do is come into your settings come down to claim Web sites and they now you just

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,270
want to type in your domain name here.

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,700
And then you can click on the submit button.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,380
Once you do that you're going to see two options here in order to verify or claim your Web site.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,780
And essentially what is happening here is you want to put a small piece of code on your Web site that

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,680
sends a signal back to Pinterest and then Pinterest knows.

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,290
OK well if they have access to the back end of the site and they've added this code well then they must

12
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,470
have ownership over the size and then they can verify that.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,040
So there are two options here.

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,780
And if you're not at all technical what I would suggest you do is you can come to help Pinterest dot

15
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,610
com type bin and search for confirm your site and then you're going to see a little bit of a better

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,840
explanation of these two options here.

17
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:25,400
And also you can get instructions for a popular hosts so that could be for blue host Go Daddy.

18
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,920
It could be for web site builders like Shopify weebly Wake's etc. and even WordPress.

19
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,960
So what I'm going to show you had to do is how I verify this for my size.

20
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,490
I pick the ad hatred the mail time option.

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,470
And so what I need to do is copy this then come into the back end of my site.

22
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,890
I have a WordPress site.

23
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,600
And so I'm coming then to theme options.

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:04,420
And then to appearance theme options general settings and in my team here I have an option to put in

25
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,740
Hetter code and I just add that in there and paste that in.

26
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,510
I just did that again paste that in quick save changes.

27
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,870
Now as I said even if you have a WordPress site the layout might be slightly different depending on

28
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,340
the theme that you have.

29
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:29,740
So it's best to really look at the support guides either on Pinterest or for your web site builder so

30
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,640
you can get the exact step by step.

31
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,190
Now once you've got that done you just want to click next.

32
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,490
And then what Pinterest are going to do is they're going to really check that you on that site and they'll

33
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,370
let you know by email in the next 24 hours.

34
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,890
Now if we come to our profile page we can also see that our Web site has been added to the top of our

35
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,970
bio.

36
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,910
So this is really great because it'll help people to click through them and we can get more Web site

37
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,650
traffic.

38
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,860
So that is how you claim and verify ownership of your site.

39
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,350
Not only does it help you rank higher in the Pinterest search engine it also gives you access to a bunch

40
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:15,860
of additional tools and of course you get the link to your Web site at the top of your profile.
