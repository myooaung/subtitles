In this video you're going to learn how to accurately track the impact of individual marketing campaigns

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.890
using campaign tagging.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.920
Then why would we want to use this.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.370
Well we've seen in our source media report that we can look at the source and the medium of our traffic

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.330
for example that we have traffic from and coming from Google and then it came organically via these

6
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.630
search results.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.700
However it's much harder to see if an individual email or an individual tweet or Facebook posts really

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.190
had any impact.

9
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:45.450
And that is what campaign tagging allows us to do and to really create and capture that data and put

10
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.380
it into Google Analytics we need to use a tool called your URL builder so you can just type this into

11
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.010
google to find it.

12
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.470
And this is a free to from Google.

13
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.320
And essentially it helps us to put additional information on to the links that we might be sharing on

14
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.520
Facebook or in an email or on Twitter it contains this and additional information.

15
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.020
Also known as UTM tags which we can see here where we actually define the source and the medium on their

16
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.760
campaign name.

17
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:29.250
And then in our Google Analytics campaigns report this is where this information is going to show up.

18
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.730
So this is the campaign name.

19
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.830
And then in here we can see the source on the medium.

20
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:45.010
So to set these parameters and to make sure it shows up in these reports with a campaign name we need

21
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.720
to use this tool called a campaign builder.

22
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.620
So Ive already filled this site Ananda's data.

23
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.930
Walk me through an example of how you might use this.

24
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.080
So lets say my web site has example dot com.

25
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.270
Maybe I want to put a link in my monthly newsletter and see how much traffic and sales that results

26
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:12.670
in so I can just call the source newsletter medium email and I can just call the campaign named January

27
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.290
sale.

28
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.930
Now you can also put in a campaign term.

29
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.720
If you have particular keywords that you are using and you can type in something like Version 1 version

30
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.740
2 if you are sending two different emails or you were trying to different types of jobs those are required

31
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.370
but they are additional parameters that you can put in.

32
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.590
And once you fill out that information its going to generate a tag or a user like this just to show

33
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:53.180
you if I remove this that she can see the euro here and then if I out in the campaign name thats going

34
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.720
to show in the world.

35
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:04.200
So I want to copy this and then I want to paste this into my email that I am sending as or on to post

36
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:12.830
not sending on Facebook or Twitter etc. if I want to track the individual impacts of that campaign on

37
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.440
my traffic my sign ups my revenue etc..

38
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:24.410
So now that you know how to track marketing campaigns with the or builder maybe go ahead to the world

39
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:32.780
builder and just set up a your own with some parameters for a campaign or example campaign that you

40
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.580
might set up an.
