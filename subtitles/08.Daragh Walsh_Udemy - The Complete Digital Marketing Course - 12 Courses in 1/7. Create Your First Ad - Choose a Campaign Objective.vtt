00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.450
You are now ready to start creating your ad to launch the ads create to select to create ads from the

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.820
drop down in the upper right hand corner of your Facebook profile.

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.330
This is a good page to bookmark as you'll be using it every time that you create a new ad.

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.100
Perhaps you should even create a bookmarks folder in your browser like I've done here so that you can

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.330
easily access all of the important Facebook tools and links from one place and the first step to create

6
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.550
your ad is to choose your advertising objective.

7
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.310
So let's review the options that you have and at the end of this video.

8
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.400
You will have chosen the objective for you to create your campaign.

9
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.620
Now the first thing that you will notice is that these marketing objectives are broken down into three

10
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.620
columns.

11
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.510
Awareness consideration and conversion on these three columns here really matching with the marketing

12
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.310
funnel.

13
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.210
So at the top of the funnel you're trying to create awareness for your brand in the middle of the funnel.

14
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.130
You're not really want people to consider your offer to take an action like click through your website.

15
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.850
Engage with your posts or Facebook page download your view of video or give you their information so

16
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.570
you can generate a lead for your business and the final piece of the funnel which is the really bottom

17
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.930
of the funnel is your really encouraging people and driving them to convert on your Web site to make

18
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.460
a purchase to purchase a product on your e-commerce store or to visit your physical store.

19
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.400
So let's start over here with awareness so we can really understand in more detail this marketing objective.

20
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.010
First you have brand awareness and if you click on any of these marketing objectives you'll see them

21
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.390
below here that there is a better explanation of what it is and if this is a good campaign that will

22
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.460
match what your marketing objective.

23
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.070
So if your marketing objective is to reach more people who are likely to pay attention to your odds

24
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.030
and increase awareness about your brand and this is the type of od you would choose and very similar

25
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.720
to brand awareness there is a campaign objective where your objective is just reach where you want to

26
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.780
show you're on to the maximum amount of people.

27
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.730
So it's very similar except in the brand awareness campaign.

28
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.790
This will show the ad to people who are more likely to pay attention.

29
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.480
Awareness campaigns are the equivalent of a poster.

30
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.720
You need both stop an ad in a magazine or not on TV.

31
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.830
The intention here is not to get them to make a response to take action.

32
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.800
It's simply in order free for you to create awareness about your brand.

33
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.750
Now this type of marketing is very normal for big businesses like new like Coca-Cola.

34
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.130
And I would suggest this type of campaign is probably best left to them if you are a small or medium

35
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.200
sized business.

36
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.120
You should really focus your attention on the consideration on the conversion column because this is

37
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.140
going to get a more tangible result for your business.

38
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.570
So let us start by looking at the traffic marketing objective here and this is going to be ideal if

39
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.390
you want to send more people to a destination on or off Facebook.

40
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.630
In terms of engagement then this is going to be ideal for you if your objective is to get more people

41
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.610
to see or engage with your posts or page.

42
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.970
Engagement can include common shares likes events responses and offer clams.

43
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.200
So if you choose a subjective Facebook is really going to optimize so that you get more common shares

44
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.470
events responses etc..

45
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.750
So down here you can see that you can make that choice again between post engagement which is the same

46
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.750
as bous post or page likes or event responses.

47
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.660
So you can make that choice down here again.

48
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.980
Next stop we've got up in stoles and this is going to be ideal campaign for you if you want to send

49
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.970
people to a store where they can purchase your app now that can be the App Store for Apple or Google

50
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.210
Play and it can also be if you just want them to get Download FREE.

51
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.820
Up next up we've got video views and this is going to be ideal if you want people to watch your videos

52
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:24.800
and really where.

53
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.810
Raise awareness about your brand and that can be things like behind the scenes footage product launches

54
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.000
and customer stories and a good tip here is that if you do want to create videos it's probably best

55
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.720
keep those videos on 15 seconds or less because that is the type of video length that this is going

56
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.750
to get the most amount of views.

57
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.070
Finally down here we have the lead generation and this time the campaign is going to be perfect if your

58
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.380
objective is to collect leads.

59
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.350
So emails phone numbers from people interested in your business so you can contact them through phone

60
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:05.770
or email really do a callback on them or an email campaign so that finishes off consideration I think

61
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.040
a lot of interesting options there for you over here.

62
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.610
Then on the right hand side is the conversion column and as I said this is really focused on getting

63
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.290
people to actually make a purchase and generate actual dollars for your business.

64
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.600
So the first one here is conversions and this is an ideal objective for you if you want to get people

65
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:36.100
to take viable actions on your Web site or up such as adding their information payment information or

66
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.690
making a purchase.

67
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.190
One caveat is though if you want to run these campaigns you need to have the facts.

68
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:51.520
Facebook pixel or Facebook STK set up in your app so that you can track and measure these conversions

69
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:58.420
without the Facebook pics so Facebook cannot actually optimize for you to get conversions because they

70
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.730
don't have that information at the back and telling them really what is working.

71
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:11.630
After that how product catalogs sales and this automatically creates products from your product catalog.

72
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.880
This is ideal if you have a big e-commerce store and you want to generate a lot of ads very very quickly.

73
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:25.120
Finally there is store visits and this is an ideal objective for you if you want to really promote your

74
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.300
location to people who are nearby and get them to come in.

75
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.350
So as you can see there are a lot of different campaign types that suit a lot of different marketing

76
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.520
objectives.

77
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.830
If you're struggling in any way to understand what those ads are going look like in real life there

78
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:48.550
is one great resource and it's called the Facebook Ads guide or put a link to this in the resources

79
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.100
section of his lecture.

80
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.360
But for example if you were considering brand awareness or just even wanted to understand what that

81
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.430
looked like.

82
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.380
You can click in here brand awareness to see it is a photo you can see the type of art that it is.

83
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.370
You cannot click through on this.

84
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.380
Really the purpose is just to raise brand awareness in terms of clicks to Web sites.

85
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:15.790
Let's open this up here and you can see that there is a Facebook links which is the image plus a link

86
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.740
that can be click through and that is how the ad is going to look like.

87
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:27.160
You can see on desktop or mobile you can even see if you want to create a Clix Web site with a different

88
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.290
format hire that would look like.

89
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.780
So I think it can be helpful to understand that from the start before you start coming into the tool

90
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.540
to set that up for yourself.

91
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.790
I'm going to go ahead and select the marketing objective of getting traffic to a destination really

92
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:48.130
on Facebook and I'm just going to leave the campaign name as traffic for the moment.

93
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.620
And so I continue.

94
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.550
So now go ahead and select the objective for your campaign.

95
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.160
Following the exact same steps that we have just covered.
