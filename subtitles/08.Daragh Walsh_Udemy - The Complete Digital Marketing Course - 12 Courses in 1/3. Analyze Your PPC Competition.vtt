2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.680
called Spy food.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.800
Now this will tell you a ton of information like how much they're even spending on ad words per month.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.070
What are the key words that they're spending the most money on and what are their most profitable keywords.

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.520
And this is incredible information to know because you can really look at their strategy.

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.350
They've obviously spent a lot of money trying to figure this stuff.

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.390
And you can really take it in and apply it to your own business and that will cut and the learning curve

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.210
incredibly for you.

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.900
And also it just helps you become a lot more profitable quicker because you don't have to go through

10
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.860
all the mistakes actually you want to model the competition and this tool will give you that inside

11
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.800
information that they don't even reveal to themselves.

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.790
And I can show you how they get from this information.

13
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.100
It's really really smart.

14
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.010
So the first step and really only step to use this tool is to enter your competitors Web site to get

15
00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.880
started.

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.100
So you might be not clear on who your competitors are.

17
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.410
So what you want to do is come into Google and then type in your product name and you know the topic

18
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.770
that you want to appear at the search engines or rank 4.

19
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.760
And then up are going to pop the competitors in the ads here.

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.670
So these people are already spending money on google adwords.

21
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.000
That's why they're appearing here at the top of his search results and we can see it on the side.

22
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.760
So what you can do is just even take the top result to get started.

23
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.190
Copy that and then paste it into the tool.

24
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.860
Now this is where it gets really cool because we can see a monthly over me overview of this particular

25
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.780
domain.

26
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.310
So over here on the left hand side we can see the organic search.

27
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.310
So these are the terms that they are appearing in the search engines for organically without paying

28
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.600
for this is through their SEO and we can see that their ranking for 7000 keywords that brings them an

29
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.020
estimated estimate of monthly clicks of 50 guys and clicks on that is worth a value of them estimated

30
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.710
of 140000.

31
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:13.290
Now that is incredible to show because even if you're working in a studio you can show the value of

32
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.390
it to a different company that you start to work for you can show them to say look your competitors

33
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.650
or any of these keywords.

34
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.000
This is estimated what's of value to them for.

35
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.910
So that's really incredible to know when you can even come in and open up this report.

36
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.110
And that would add even logging in an absolutely free you can see the top of most valuable keywords

37
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.090
for them that they run for for free.

38
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.070
You can even see the positions of those and roughly Hamlet.

39
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.410
Much that is worth for them.

40
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.480
Now you do obviously have to log in or maybe sign up to see all the results.

41
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.750
But I still think this is incredible information to get for free.

42
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.040
It really is a remarkable tool.

43
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.210
Now that is kind of we get some information here about had their ranking in the search engines using

44
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.530
a CEO for free now over on the right hand side we have a really information about their paid search.

45
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.240
These are the keywords that they're actually paying to be at the top of the search results for it.

46
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.790
And the cool thing here is really interesting to know straight away is that they are only paying for

47
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.720
seven hundred keywords so you can look across and you can see why that's actually like almost exactly

48
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.950
10 percent.

49
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.970
And so these must be the most valuable keywords if they are paying for these.

50
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.320
These must be the most profitable for them to appear at the top of their search results for.

51
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:40.230
And if we open this up again we can see a preview of what those keywords are even how much it costs

52
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.220
per click the monthly costs that they spend on them so we can see the breakdown of the budget the monthly

53
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.980
searches their odd position the total number VADs cetera.

54
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.270
So even just coming in here and saying okay well I typed in digital marketing courses but they're also

55
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.760
paying to appear for Digital Marketing courses online digital marking certification curriculum developments.

56
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.420
So that's not something I would have thought of straight away.

57
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.030
But obviously you can see this reveals the most profitable Kieran's in this report.

58
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.440
So we can see that their estimated budget then is about five grand.

59
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:23.430
And then this scheme does help really formulate your strategy really quickly by just looking at competitors

60
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.280
scrolling down the page a little bit more.

61
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.230
We can see their competition in terms of organic and paid.

62
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.680
And again we can click into say all of these tools we're going to go a level deeper and really get the

63
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.740
same report for them as well.

64
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.500
So amazing amazing tool.

65
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.480
You can start with one competitor and figure out a whole lot of information about other competitors.

66
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.210
You see shared keywords etc..

67
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.210
Now you might be wondering how do they actually get all this information.

68
00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.520
Obviously this digital marketing Institute is not just going to hand over this information and say here's

69
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.790
our most profitable keywords and this is how much we spend and here's our exact strategy.

70
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.980
Just take it easy they're not going to do that.

71
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.990
So how does this to get the information.

72
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.880
Well it's really smart.

73
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.060
What they do.

74
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.650
If we open up the page keywords report is they actually take a screen shot of pretty much every page

75
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.840
on Google.

76
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.930
So if we come into the keyword we kicked down our view cached surp.

77
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:32.280
So the search results we can see that they've taken a screen shot and that in this screen shot they

78
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.520
see that this company is advertising here.

79
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.590
And then they scrape that data obviously put it into their database and they know that they're paying

80
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.220
for that keyword and the position that they're ranking et cetera.

81
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.840
So it's a release sophisticated and a pretty complex system that they set up.

82
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.190
But what it means really for you is that you can come into this tool really get an insight into your

83
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.690
competitors see how much they're spending.

84
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.240
See what keywords they're spending on see what the most profitable ones are.

85
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.430
It's a really amazing tool if you use it.

86
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.250
I guarantee you you're going to cut your learning curve in half in terms of forming your own outward

87
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.840
strategies and you're going to save a ton of money because you don't have to waste a lot of money figuring

88
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.810
I had it all works.

89
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.910
Just look at maybe two three five competitors you'll have a much clearer strategy before you even open

90
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:24.230
it.

91
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.240
Words can't.
