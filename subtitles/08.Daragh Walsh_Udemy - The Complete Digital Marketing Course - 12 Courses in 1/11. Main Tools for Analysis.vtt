00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.670
In this video you're going to learn how to properly use Google Analytics reports and use some of the

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.710
key features in those reports in order to manipulate the data.

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:19.420
So to run through this let us open up an overview report for our audience in here we can look at some

4
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.120
of the key features that you're going to see on almost every report and the first thing to look at is

5
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.260
the date range in the top right hand corner here.

6
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.960
Right now you can see that this is showing for the last 30 days and the dates that are selected and

7
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.210
shown in this report are highlighted in blue here.

8
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.630
You can change that if you want.

9
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.260
We could look at just yesterday last week or even the last seven days and just apply that and then this

10
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.680
report and any other report that we look at is going to be limited to that date range.

11
00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.000
So let's just go back and set the last 30 days and we can just say click apply or not.

12
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.480
And one thing to note about this is actually you can see today is not included and that is because today

13
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.470
is not yet over.

14
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.340
So there isn't a full dataset for them to include in that report.

15
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.370
You can also use the compare to feature to get more insights into your data.

16
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:30.000
So if I take this I can see that in this report I can look at the end compared to the previous period

17
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.510
so let's apply this and see how it changes the data below then we can see in orange.

18
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.430
This is the previous period and in blue now is the current period.

19
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.210
So we're getting a comparison in this chart in a visualization of the change and also down below here

20
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.030
if we look at our metrics really now it's comparing the previous period where the current pre-read to

21
00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.190
the previous period so we can see that this month we have 6.7 percent more users compared to the previous

22
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.370
period and it'll also as well as show increases in these metrics show you anywhere where there's been

23
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.380
a decrease.

24
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.250
So for example we're down 1.4 4 percent in average session durations the men's time people spend on

25
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.200
the side when they visit.

26
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.590
So it's very handy feature of the reports.

27
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.070
If you just want to get a quick analysis on how we're doing compared to last month and if you do want

28
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.010
to does the like and this comparison you can just de-selected and hit apply.

29
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.720
And what we're at the top.

30
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.940
We also have the option to add a segment and that gives us the option to add a subset of our data we

31
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.510
can build up that subset and really decide what that is going to be.

32
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.930
It could be from a particular marketing channel or pick a particular demographic or country.

33
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.580
Later on we'll be showing you how to set these up.

34
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.200
But there is that option to add these segments right at the top of every report.

35
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.760
They're moving on a little bit further down.

36
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.070
We're getting to see the line graph here.

37
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.380
And one thing to note is that this line graph is really showing in terms of number of users.

38
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.790
So we can see really this total figure here in the line graph representing the number of users.

39
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.010
We can change that if we want to look at any of the other metrics like say for example the balance raise

40
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.580
or let's have a look at the average session duration.

41
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.770
So it is important to note that this graph here really represents whatever metric is shown in this box

42
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.260
here.

43
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.940
So we can change that back to users any time we want or type anything in there if you want to find a

44
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.040
particular metric.

45
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.580
Now I'm looking across the line graph we can seem really day by day.

46
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.330
The number of users that were on the site so we can see Saturday 18th of November just over 2000.

47
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.680
We can see yesterday just over 9000.

48
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.200
So quite a range there and that's interesting to see on a daily basis.

49
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.010
We can also look at this graph on an hourly basis or even a weekly basis if you just want to get that

50
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.590
higher level of view.

51
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.710
Probably the most useful is just to leave it on a daily basis.

52
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.940
One cool thing about seeing it on a daily basis like this is that you can actually select one of the

53
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.710
days and you can also add a note in there so you can use this annotations feature to add a note and

54
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.280
maybe explain why there's been a peak in traffic like that and I've added up before he going to type

55
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.510
it in and click save.

56
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.580
Perhaps it's the start of a December sale.

57
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.070
Not really explains that spike in traffic and adding these little annotations can be very helpful if

58
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.800
you're looking back on your own reports you can't quite remember three months ago we had a big spike

59
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.090
in traffic and by making these little notes then you can really look at OK.

60
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.750
That really worked before.

61
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.340
Maybe I could do that again.

62
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.450
Adding these annotations is also very useful if you are working with colleagues and you want to share

63
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.400
that information for them or for clients or if someone is taking over your role.

64
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.220
At least they have a history and an explanation of these spikes or dips in traffic.

65
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.120
So the annotations feature is very useful and you can just add those in easily there underneath the

66
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.940
line graph.

67
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.710
So we've covered a lot here in the lyrics are the audience overview report.

68
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.040
We've touched on just the lay out of some of these metrics.

69
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.510
There is a graph here representing a comparison of new visitors versus returning visitors.

70
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.150
And down here as well if you want to change the information that's appearing in this table you can just

71
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:05.610
click on one of these links here and it's going to show you for example the browser was most popular

72
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.040
over the last 30 days.

73
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.970
We can see here it is chrome with 68 percent of the users.

74
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:20.370
So we'll go back now and we're actually going to dive into a more advanced report so we can really look

75
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.070
at how that is laid out also and some of the key features there.

76
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.580
So what come down to the location report.

77
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.530
You can see we still have our date range the option to arm those segments.

78
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.630
We have a graphical representation with that one metric here as well.

79
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:46.110
But really what we want to explain now is and this data table and how you can navigate and use this

80
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.330
and manipulate the data in here.

81
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.340
So firstly how is this table laid out.

82
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.450
Well it's very simple.

83
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.860
We have attributes of our users here like the countries that they're from.

84
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:06.420
These are going to be in the rows of the data table and in the columns of the data table we have metrics

85
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.460
related to those characteristics of our users.

86
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.280
So we can see here that our users from the US.

87
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:23.020
That's over 37000 people in the last 30 days representing 45 percent of our total users.

88
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.000
So it's very simple the way these are laid out.

89
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:34.650
We've got our roads which are characteristics of our users and the columns which are at the metrics

90
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.510
for those individual characteristics.

91
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:44.580
The language that Google Analytics likes to use is dimensions for these characteristics of our users

92
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.660
and metrics for the metrics themselves.

93
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:55.500
Now it's important to note that right now we can see that the primary characteristic of this report

94
00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:04.640
here is country but we can change that and look at this table based on another characteristic like City.

95
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:09.970
So we're now seeing the top cities of our users over the last 30 days.

96
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.080
And you can change that to continent as well.

97
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.450
You can also add in a secondary dimension if you want.

98
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:26.680
So we could look at for example the browser that was used in the top city which is chrome.

99
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.870
So the point is that you can add in secondary dimensions as well.

100
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:38.030
If you look at that drill down further into your data and if you want to remove those you can just click

101
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:44.000
that and it brings you back to that one primary dimension that you're looking at the data table and

102
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.990
the way this is laid out.

103
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:52.900
Right now it's sorted in terms of the top city and the users from that top city.

104
00:08:53.270 --> 00:09:01.310
If we wanted to change that we could look at the another column of data and really sort the table based

105
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.170
on balanced rate and not on number of users.

106
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:11.310
So right now we know that this table of data is sorted by users because the little down arrow where

107
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.940
we could change this to be balanced rate.

108
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.760
Now all of a sudden you can see that the table of data has changed and now we can see the cities with

109
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.920
the top bounce rates.

110
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.690
And if we want to extend this the rows in this data table we can go ahead and do that.

111
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.580
We can get a look at reading more and more roads here.

112
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.690
Show up at the top of these reports we also have the option to visualize some of the data before we

113
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.550
do this.

114
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:48.030
Just come back to look at our country and also look at our number of users.

115
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.020
And right now we have this little icon here means we were looking at the data table that's all we're

116
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.940
looking at now.

117
00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:02.760
We can also look at a pie chart and a breakdown of that sometimes very useful to look at that down.

118
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.690
We can also look at a bar chart.

119
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:15.040
We want to see that type of visualization and we can also see a comparison to the side average which

120
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:23.800
can be very useful and we can look at different metrics as well so if we want to look at say the average

121
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:33.040
session duration from each of these countries we can see that compared to the side average the US is

122
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.390
24 percent greater than the side average.

123
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:43.050
And we can look at some of those countries where people don't spend as much time on the site.

124
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:50.500
So now that you understand how to navigate ad the Google Analytics reports maybe a quick exercise that

125
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.160
you can do is just come in.

126
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:58.280
Change the date range compared to previous period so you can really see the changes that that makes

127
00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.080
And the reports.
