In this video you're going to learn how to respond to comments on your youtube videos in bulk and also

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.560
had to put some settings in place so you can reduce the common spam on your channel.

3
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.180
So there are two places where you can respond to comments underneath your on your videos and one is

4
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.760
right underneath your videos on the actual watch page.

5
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.590
So if you scroll down you can see the comments from viewers here.

6
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.920
You can just click reply to respond to them.

7
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.780
You can say it's great to hear your positive feedback.

8
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.980
You might often get questions that you can ask.

9
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.360
And oftentimes there are some very good questions some interesting questions that you might want to

10
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.840
move to the top of the comments so other people see them and you can do that by simply clicking on these

11
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.620
three dots on the side here they come in.

12
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.620
And then this comment will appear at the top of your comments section.

13
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.270
This is great when people scroll down just from watching the video.

14
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.720
If there's a great question here.

15
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.620
Positive feedback where something interesting can be good to pin that.

16
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.570
Or you might be getting a common question and you can just pin your answer to the top.

17
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.870
So that's a useful feature that pin feature apply to comments just simply give it a thumbs up and just

18
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.940
to show that you are paying attention to what people are saying and that you don't have to Rapides every

19
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.890
comment.

20
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.740
But it is good to reply to one or two comments just to show people that you are looking at what they

21
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.660
are saying.

22
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.870
And that encourages more people the Commons to ask questions.

23
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.400
And that's especially good if you ask people the Commons remember commenting again is a signal that

24
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.840
you YouTube will look at in terms of ranking Your videos are people engaging.

25
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.560
It's one of the signals that they will look at.

26
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.960
So responding underneath the video is a great way to do it.

27
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.290
However once you've got a number of different videos you can imagine it can be quite hard to respond

28
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.310
to them all.

29
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.060
So thankfully YouTube have a dashboard where you can respond to all comments and to access it you want

30
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:23.410
to click on your icon in the top right hand corner of the screen then click on creators studio and then

31
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.760
come down and click on community here and it's in this first dashboard Commons where you can really

32
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.270
respond.

33
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.070
The Commons you'll see and hear that there are the comments and the videos that they relate to.

34
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.070
You can give them a thumbs up or apply directly here.

35
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:50.440
You can also report spam or you can block a commenter if it is someone who's continually adding comments

36
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.870
that are on helpful or negative etc..

37
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.760
Now another great thing that you can do as well is responding to comments here is set up some rules

38
00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.950
to reduce comments.

39
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.450
So if you come down into community settings you can paste in some moderators to help put your comments

40
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.690
as well.

41
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.470
More importantly what I want to show you here is that you can block links.

42
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.880
This is a very handy feature and it definitely reduces the huge amount of spam on channels.

43
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.920
So really what it is is it puts a filter into place that any new comments will be held for review if

44
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.100
they have a hash tag or you are l in them.

45
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.740
So if you come down into your comments section held for review you're going to see really all the comments

46
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.400
here that have those links and you can then select them you're going to get something like this you

47
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.530
can tick tick tick and you can either report them as spam remove them or approve them.

48
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.260
So that is a very handy little setting to set up.

49
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.730
It can reduce a huge amount of comments on your channel and really keep that common section of your

50
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.840
videos a useful resource for people where it's not getting overrun where other people are promoting

51
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.400
their challenge or web sites.

52
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.820
It's actually a list of helpful questions or positive feedback or something that is useful to people

53
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.010
watching the videos.

54
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.190
So now it's your turn.

55
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.630
Come into the creators studio and under the community section and you can monitor those comments or

56
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.850
set up those settings to really reduce your current spam.
