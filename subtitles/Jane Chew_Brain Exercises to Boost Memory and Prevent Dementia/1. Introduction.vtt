00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.950
I believe all of you out here would agree with me that the brain is one of the most important parts

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.930
of the human body.

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:19.290
Keeping it in shape is extremely important for us, who hope to live long life healthily.

4
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:30.930
And one of the major concerns we have is when we age, our memory function will actually deteriorate

5
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.950
over time.

6
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:44.550
I find that my memory function is not as good after that, so especially after my delivery of my children.

7
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.460
Luckily, there are many ways to actually help to improve our memory.

8
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.980
One of the methods is called aerobic exercises.

9
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:04.110
Researchers has actually found that aerobic exercise is able to improve and boost memory function.

10
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.850
So what are the benefits of doing neuro exercises?

11
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.870
So one of the most important benefits would be it helps to improve the brain function.

12
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.410
It allows us to be able to take on more difficult tasks.

13
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:28.470
Our brain is actually able to analyze more complex situation, and it will actually help us towards

14
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.000
better problem solving.

15
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.340
And the second benefits would be it can actually delay Alzheimer's disease or dementia.

16
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.870
So this is age related brain disorder.

17
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.780
That is a better chance for us to prevent or to delay this problem.

18
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:59.700
So what anaerobic exercises, new aerobic exercises involve getting your brain out of your comfort zone

19
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.790
by exposing it to a new to new sensations or challenges that are out of the routine.

20
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.350
For example, if you are right handed, you try to write with your left hand.

21
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:28.140
This will actually expose your brain out of the regular routine, and it actually helps to improve your

22
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.390
memory or the brain function.

23
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.800
Now, what is the best time of doing aerobic exercises for an average person?

24
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.390
It is recommended to do more exercises two times a day.

25
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.120
So one in the morning and one in the evening before you go to bed.

26
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.150
So in the morning, what you can do is, you know, you can brush your teeth and by changing to a different

27
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.480
hand.

28
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.530
So this is a very good exercise to actually.

29
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.670
Utilize the exercises to activate your brain.

30
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.310
The other one is going to bed or before going to bed.

31
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:23.370
You when you take a shower, you can actually, you know, use a different temperature of water to take

32
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.090
your shower.

33
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.780
So it will also boost up your brain cells.

34
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.500
Actually, you can do new exercises anytime throughout the day.

35
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.280
It also depends on your lifestyle.

36
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.730
So, for example, if you are an office worker, you can do this exercise during your break.

37
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.110
During your lunch time, you can just sit down on your chair and do some simple hand movement exercises.

38
00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:01.260
And if you are a student, you can actually, you know, learn a foreign language to actually boost

39
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.150
your memory, boost your brain power.

40
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.500
And for seniors, it is also advisable to do about 3 to 5 times a day.

41
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:19.140
This will actually help to keep the mind the job and prevent or slow the progression of Alzheimer's

42
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.920
disease.

43
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.970
Here are some ideas for you to do neuro exercises.

44
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:33.480
The first one, you can actually blindfold your eyes and take the herbs or spice from your kitchen and

45
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.180
smell them and try to identify them.

46
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.390
So this is one way to activate your brain function.

47
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.520
The second one would be to use your non-dominant hand.

48
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.610
For example, you can try to use your non-dominant hand to comb your hair, to brush your teeth, or

49
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.200
to control the mouse.

50
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.440
So this will really help to boost up your brain functions.

51
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.230
Believe me.

52
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:16.820
You can also mute your TV and try to look at the subtitle and try to learn a foreign language from here.

53
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.030
Okay.

54
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.860
So other than that, what you can do is playing with online games, video games or even puzzles.

55
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.250
This will also help to boost your brain functions.

56
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.450
There are many types of neuro exercises that you can do.

57
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:44.020
Take a look at this chart for some ideas in this video, cause I will focus on ten movement exercises

58
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.210
that requires coordination from your brain.

59
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:56.260
So try to start the exercises with some warmup that I showed in the first video.

60
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:04.030
And then you can go through each of the short video, each of the exercises from the videos and see

61
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.700
how much you can cover in a day.

62
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.860
So the longer you do, the better.

63
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:15.130
But if not, just try for 10 to 15 minutes a day, and if you can do it two times a day, that would

64
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.910
be great.

65
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.190
I hope you will enjoy the course.
