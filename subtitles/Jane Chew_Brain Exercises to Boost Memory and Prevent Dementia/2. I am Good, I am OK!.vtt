00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.150
Hey, good day, everyone.

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.130
Today, I would like you to try out.

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.370
New hand movement that will actually connect your brain and your hands.

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:17.700
If you can move your hand according to this movement, that means you are exercising your brain as well.

5
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.060
So before we begin.

6
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.620
Give you some ideas about the sign that I'm using.

7
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.840
This one is what I call sign.

8
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.090
All right.

9
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.370
This had.

10
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.610
So let's.

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.940
Full time and.

12
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.310
Okay.

13
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.940
Okay.

14
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.860
Good.

15
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.540
Ooh.

16
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.850
Okay.

17
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.470
You can do it slower.

18
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.430
You can be faster if you.

19
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.070
You can do this movement faster.

20
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.230
If your mom gets out.

21
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.760
If you don't think you have enough, you can continue watching this session.

22
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.370
Now let's not with our more challenging work.

23
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.820
All right.

24
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.160
So let's start one hand with the good side and the other hand with the okay side.

25
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.430
And we are going to change it the other way around.

26
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.860
All right?

27
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.250
So this can change the good and this and change to.

28
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.910
Okay.

29
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.910
And then we are going to change it again.

30
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.880
Okay.

31
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.160
Okay.

32
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.300
This law.

33
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.350
So.

34
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.190
Some of you may find that at this juncture it is quite challenging for you.

35
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.350
It's okay.

36
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.540
Just practice to get it right.

37
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.390
Look.

38
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.710
And again, you can do it at a faster more.

39
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.690
Now let's get into an even more challenging task by adding a clap in between the hand movements.

40
00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.410
All right.

41
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.030
So let's begin with the hand.

42
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.750
This way.

43
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.700
Clap.

44
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.680
Change.

45
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.620
Change.

46
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.560
Change.

47
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.700
Change.

48
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.240
Change.

49
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:32.440
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

50
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.910
Change.

51
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.400
Change, Change.

52
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.190
Change.

53
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.240
Change, change.

54
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.460
Now try to do it faster.

55
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.910
I hope you will always tell yourself I am good.

56
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.210
I am okay.

57
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.880
Always start your day with positive affirmation.

58
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.610
I hope to see you in my next video.

59
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.240
I.
