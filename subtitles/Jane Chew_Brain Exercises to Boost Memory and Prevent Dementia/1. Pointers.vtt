00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:01.900
Hi.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.230
Good day.

3
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:09.670
Everyone has been No, our brain functions will actually deteriorate as we age.

4
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.660
But the good news is this can be reversed.

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.310
What you need to do is to give enough challenge to our brain on a daily basis.

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.480
So today, I would like to give you another challenge, another hand movement challenge for you to try

7
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.020
out.

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.490
I would call this exercise as pointless.

9
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.880
Okay, so before we begin, I'm going to use two things.

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.540
The first thing is what I call peaceful.

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.720
The second thing is what I call a point.

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.790
All right.

13
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.170
So we are going to, you know, turn one hand to pointer and the other hand to the peaceful sign, and

14
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.880
then we will alternate this hand movement by changing it to the other way around.

15
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.280
Okay.

16
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:06.090
So now I'm going to change my left hand to pointer and the right hand to peaceful sign.

17
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.210
And let's change again.

18
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.120
And let's change again.

19
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.800
You can do this exercise in four days.

20
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.990
You can.

21
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.890
Emergency.

22
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.000
I know.

23
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.830
You can actually.

24
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.000
I do some hand.

25
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.930
Because.

26
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.990
You might actually find that it is quite tiring to do this.

27
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.680
So with some light exercise, you actually have to relax your.

28
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.400
Are you ready for?

29
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.500
When more challenging past.

30
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.680
I'm going to add a split in between that and okay so let's.

31
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.710
These.

32
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.290
The faster you can get.

33
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.880
One of the facts about the brain is if you don't use it, you won't lose it.

34
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:18.850
We don't want to be in the situation in order to be grilled by our loved ones for the loss of our memory,

35
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.130
even though we are still alive.

36
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.670
I hope everyone will have a good day and I hope to see you in my next lesson.

37
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.240
