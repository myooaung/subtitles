00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.980
We are going to start to do some challenging head movement that will stimulate your brain.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.910
But before we start, let's do some warmup.

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.520
Well, what is important?

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.760
Our fingers can be very stiff.

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.810
And sometimes you may also feel numbness.

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.360
So it is actually good to activate your fingers, your hand, your joints, make it more flexible.

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.060
Before we start to stimulate our brain with all the exciting movement.

8
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.910
Okay, now let's start.

9
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.740
So the first exercise is by stretching one by one.

10
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.720
She?

11
00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.980
Yeah.

12
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.520
Let's do this later.

13
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.870
Post first.

14
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.550
Hold your hand this way.

15
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.270
All right.

16
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.370
So you are like a waiter and turning it around.

17
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.260
It, Chris, you'll come down to stretch your content.

18
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.410
And don't forget about time.

19
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.080
Let's change it to another hand.

20
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.690
So we get you to switch

21
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.900
and presto your fingers.

22
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.880
You can feel the stiffness on the joint.

23
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.980
Okay.

24
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.230
Now let's move on to another exercise.

25
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.970
Hold your fingers this way.

26
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.850
And this way.

27
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.930
Okay.

28
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.080
And we'll go this way.

29
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.140
We will find that this question is really Steve and also John here.

30
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.990
Grace, I don't get it down about three times.

31
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.490
Now let's look for another head.

32
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.460
Oh, see, we come up and this way.

33
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.170
All right, we'll go this way.

34
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.100
This assistance will really help to.

35
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.910
That's why I joined.

36
00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:02.220
Right now, you can just go to every type of exercise and just, ho, ho, ho.

37
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.230
Canada position.

38
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.610
These go the stats.

39
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.190
You know, comes together and the chemistry.

40
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.580
Okay.

41
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.630
Press presto.

42
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.650
Pump this way.

43
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.920
So fingers.

44
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.320
Message.

45
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.170
Change to another action.

46
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.480
We do not usually exercise our drawings, so most of us may find that our drawings have at least the

47
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.570
right to touch your fingers with your thumb.

48
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.420
Hold your phone up.

49
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.020
Open and close.

50
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.350
Open and close his eyes.

51
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.590
Because he can.

52
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:51.320
Fine.

53
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.150
Solve this on your own.

54
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.610
I think doing this for 2 minutes.

55
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.720
Very

56
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.280
good

57
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.180
press on the tip of each finger.

58
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.570
Yes.

59
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.840
So at the first show this.

60
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.210
Right.

61
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.530
Okay.

62
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.990
I think we have enough warm up.

63
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:50.100
But if you still find that your hand is still, you can continue doing some more warmup exercises.
