00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.260
Let's start the day by exercising our brain.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.130
Let's take your.

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.950
Hand your palm and move them into fist.

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:16.090
All right, so now we will have one hand with the thumb out and with the pinky, the other hand with

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.450
the pinky, fingers out this way on the same direction.

6
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.780
So now we are going to turn in this direction to the other side.

7
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.000
So now let's see this way.

8
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.440
Can you see the action?

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.640
And come back here.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.540
Go back.

11
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.900
Come.

12
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.680
Go back.

13
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.430
Come back.

14
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.270
Go back.

15
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.680
Go back.

16
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.120
Right.

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.100
You can try to do it as fast as you can.

18
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.950
I'm sure when you started doing it, it is kind of difficult, but over time your practice times you

19
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.310
will be able to master this as well as a clear control.
