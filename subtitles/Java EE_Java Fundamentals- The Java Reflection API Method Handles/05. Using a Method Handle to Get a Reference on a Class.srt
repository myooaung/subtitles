00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:05,100
Let us see the first pattern exposed by the MethodHandle

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,144
API to get a reference on a class object.

3
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:12,897
The entry point is the lookup object as we just saw.

4
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:14,348
On that lookup object,

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:19,953
we can just call the findClass method that takes a string as a parameter,

6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,187
which is the name of the class,

7
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:26,267
and this returns a reference on the Person class object.

8
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:27,402
This code, in fact,

9
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:32,810
works the same as the forName factory method from the class object.

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,934
It takes the name of a class as a string and returns the class object.

11
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:39,405
This is, of course,

12
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:49,000
particularly handy when you want to get a reference on the class and what you have is only the name of that class.
