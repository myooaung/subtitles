By the way, before wrapping up this live coding session,

2
00:00:05.173 --> 00:00:09.021
I just would like to fix little things here and there

3
00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:11.890
in the AbstractEntityManager class.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.502
We have a persist method here that is using a statement,

5
00:00:15.502 --> 00:00:18.675
and a statement is something that should be closed.

6
00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.671
So here, we really should call this statement.closeMethod,

7
00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:23.806
and, in fact,

8
00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:29.055
the right way of doing that is to use this try with resources pattern.

9
00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:32.403
We do not need to add anymore code than this one.

10
00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:37.572
And when exiting this try, this statement will be properly closed,

11
00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:40.645
and the same goes for the find class.

12
00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:43.257
Here, we have two elements that we need to close,

13
00:00:43.257 --> 00:00:45.731
the PreparedStatement and the resultSet.

14
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:50.077
So let me add this code here like that.

15
00:00:50.077 --> 00:01:00.000
Let me add some indentation, and in that way, our PreparedStatement and resultSet will be properly closed.
