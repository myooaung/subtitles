00:00:02.027 --> 00:00:04.527
Now let us continue, and for instance,

2
00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:09.215
invoke the getName method of our p2 object.

3
00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:11.374
We need another MethodHandle for that.

4
00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:14.111
And to get MethodHandles on methods,

5
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:18.597
we need to call the findVirtual method from the lookup object.

6
00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:22.956
The class on which this method is to be found is the Person class,

7
00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.999
the name of the method is getName,

8
00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.653
and the MethodType is the nameGetterMethodType.

9
00:00:30.653 --> 00:00:37.679
Let me create this MethodType same as previously, MethodType.methodType.

10
00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:40.745
This MethodType is a getter, so this time,

11
00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:46.408
the MethodType returns String.class and does not take any argument.

12
00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:50.432
So we do not need to add any further parameter to this method call.

13
00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:55.701
So this findVirtual method call will return another MethodHandle,

14
00:00:55.701 --> 00:01:03.092
let us call it nameGetter, and invoke nameGetter on our Person object.

15
00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:07.921
This should return String holding the name of that object.

16
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:13.380
Let us print out this name, and indeed James is returned by this method.

17
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.124
So this is how you can get a MethodHandle on a method

18
00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:19.033
that does not take any argument.

19
00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:23.969
Now if we want to do the contrary, create a MethodHandle on setName.

20
00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.500
This time, this is the nameSetter, and we are going to call this nameSetter.

21
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.000
MethodType is slightly different,

22
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but still created using the same factory method.

23
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.500
It does not return anything, so void.class,

24
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.000
and do not put Void with a capital V because it will not work.

25
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Take the string as a parameter,

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.500
and if we invoke this nameSetter on the Person2 object with the parameter Linda,

27
00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:02.000
for instance, and print out p2 again, we should see that we have changed the name from James to Linda.
