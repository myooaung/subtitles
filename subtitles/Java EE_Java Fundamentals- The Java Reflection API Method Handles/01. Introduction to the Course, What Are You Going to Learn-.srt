Hello, my name is Jose.

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:07,062
I am very happy to welcome you to this course,

3
00:00:07,062 --> 00:00:13,323
Java Fundamentals: The Java Reflection API and Method Handles,

4
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:18,091
and to this module, Introducing Java Reflection.

5
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:21,087
First of all, what is this course about?

6
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:26,355
Well, it is all about the Reflection API and method handles.

7
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:32,341
You may have already heard about the Reflection API since it has been

8
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:40,893
introduced in Java 1 back in the old days of 1995/1996 and has been used in

9
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:45,920
many applications and frameworks as we are going to see it.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,812
Method handles is a more recent addition to the JDK.

11
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:57,488
It has been introduced in Java 7 to fix several problems raised by the

12
00:00:57,488 --> 00:01:02,167
Reflection API that we'll be covering in this course.

13
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:08,164
The Reflection API is about reading and modifying the content of an

14
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:14,210
object at runtime without any prior knowledge of the structure or even

15
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,065
the class of that object at compile time.

16
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:19,237
In fact,

17
00:01:19,237 --> 00:01:25,001
the Reflection API is about discovering the content of an object

18
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,638
and the structure of its class at runtime,

19
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:32,482
which is very powerful functionality.

20
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:35,572
Why is this API so important?

21
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:37,796
Well, the reason is simple.

22
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:41,422
It's that most of the Java frameworks are using it.

23
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:47,211
Odds are that the Java application you are working on currently is using the

24
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:51,526
Reflection API through the Java frameworks it is built upon.

25
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:53,816
Let us just name a few.

26
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:59,102
Hibernate and EclipseLink, the two main object relational mapping tools,

27
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,402
are built on the Reflection API.

28
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:08,324
JAX-B and JSON-B to map your Java objects to XML or to JSON

29
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:11,949
are also built on the Reflection API.

30
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,364
Spring, and CDI, Guice,

31
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:21,821
the three main frameworks of dependency injection are heavily using Reflection.

32
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:30,016
JAX-RS for REST services, JAX-WS for web services are also built on top of that.

33
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,758
JUnit, TestNG, Mockito, ACID J,

34
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:40,898
all the main testing Java frameworks are also built on the Reflection API.

35
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:50,000
And believe me, this is just a short list. There are many, many more Java frameworks built on this API.
