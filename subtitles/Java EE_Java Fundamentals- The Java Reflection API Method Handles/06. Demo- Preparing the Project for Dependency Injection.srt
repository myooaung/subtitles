1
00:00:01,916 --> 00:00:05,490
Now is the time for the live coding part of this module.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,512
Let us see some code in action.

3
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:13,287
We are just going to create that BeanManager object that is going to

4
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:17,107
spot the write method to invoke to create the database connection

5
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:21,065
and to inject it in the EntityManager.

6
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:24,316
And then we will be able to run our EntityManager again,

7
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:29,088
but this time with a separate code for the writing and the

8
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:33,252
reading of the objects to the database and for the

9
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:36,494
connection to the database itself.

10
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:41,889
As we said in a previous module, we would like to fix the previous example,

11
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:43,412
the previous project,

12
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:47,955
by using composition instead of inheritance to make particular

13
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:52,587
EntityManagers for particular database connections.

14
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,164
So to do that,

15
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:57,848
I just copy/pasted the previous project from the previous

16
00:00:57,848 --> 00:01:01,267
module so that you have a clean project for the previous

17
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:05,003
module and a new project in that module.

18
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:08,738
We still have this DBLauncher class here that we

19
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:12,204
can run to run the H2 DB server.

20
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:13,772
And if you check the console,

21
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:17,117
the only thing you need to do is to make sure that you are

22
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:21,250
still pointing with the copy of the files the one that are in

23
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,098
db-files folder of this new project.

24
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:28,845
Test the Connection, Connect, and if you check the content of the table,

25
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:40,000
you can see that we still have the four instances of PERSON in our base. Let me disconnect and go back to the code.
