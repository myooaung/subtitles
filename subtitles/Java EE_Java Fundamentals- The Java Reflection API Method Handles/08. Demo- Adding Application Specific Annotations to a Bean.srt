1
00:00:01,789 --> 00:00:05,388
So now we need to add the getPrimaryKey method to this class,

2
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:10,713
so let us do that, create method, and the same for the getColumns method.

3
00:00:10,713 --> 00:00:13,967
Let us create this method.

4
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:19,567
If we want this code to compile, we need to create this type, so Ctrl+1.

5
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:22,473
This is going to be a class, so create a class,

6
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:27,344
putting it in the util package is fine, so let us do that.

7
00:00:27,344 --> 00:00:28,734
It should compile here.

8
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:33,350
And let us do the same for this ColumnField class in the same package.

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,881
This Metamodel is a Metamodel of Person, so let me just add this here.

10
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:41,835
Now we have a code that compiles.

11
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:45,053
What we need is a code that working, of course.

12
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:50,635
To find a primary key in a class, we need to add a special piece of code,

13
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,375
which is an annotation.

14
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,532
So let me just type this annotation.

15
00:00:55,532 --> 00:01:00,380
This annotation does not compile because we have not created it yet.

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,210
But once again,

17
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,840
we can ask Eclipse to help us in that by typing Ctrl+1 and

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,833
select Create annotation PrimaryKey.

19
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:14,425
We are going to put it in the reflection.annotation package.

20
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:15,846
Let us click Finish.

21
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:19,704
And you can see that an annotation is a very simple piece of code.

22
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:23,475
It is basically an interface with this special declaration,

23
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:27,619
this at symbol in front of the interface keyword.

24
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,087
Let us go back to the Person class, and let us to do the same.

25
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:34,516
This is a Column, and this is also a Column.

26
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:45,000
Let us create those annotations in the annotation package, and now our Person class is compiling properly.
