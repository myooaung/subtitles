1
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:07,233
Let us configure our project to be able to use this database server.

2
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:11,363
For that, we first need to open the properties of the project.

3
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:16,345
Click here and hit the Alt+Enter shortcut,

4
00:00:16,345 --> 00:00:20,687
select the Java Build Path here, go to the Libraries tab,

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,833
select the Classpath, click Add JARs there,

6
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:31,952
and then navigate to the lib folder and select the h2 .jar file.

7
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:38,105
Click OK, and this is going to add this JAR file as a dependency to this project.

8
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:44,750
This tab may look different if the version of Java you're using is pre Java 9,

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,639
that is, Java 8 and earlier, but basically,

10
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:49,388
the steps are the same.

11
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:54,569
What you need to do is to add this JAR as a dependency to your project.

12
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:56,869
Let us click Apply and Close.

13
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:02,702
And now we are going to create the DB package and the DBLauncher class

14
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:08,377
in that package and add a main method in that class.

15
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:13,575
And in this main method, all we need to do is just call Server,

16
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:18,851
which is the Server class from the H2 package,

17
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:19,546
.main.

18
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,190
We do not need to pass any argument.

19
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:28,806
It is going to throw exceptions, so let us throw them and add a message,

20
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:29,987
DB Launched.

21
00:01:29,987 --> 00:01:31,928
This class should compile.

22
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:34,950
If, for some reason, you cannot find the Server class,

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,323
it's probably because you did not put this h2 .jar

24
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:42,251
file as a dependency to your project.

25
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:43,945
Let us run this class.

26
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:45,574
There is a shortcut for that,

27
00:01:45,574 --> 00:01:50,062
and this is going to launch automatically the H2 console,

28
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:52,462
which is a web application.

29
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:54,188
If we switch back to Eclipse,

30
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:59,026
we can see that the database server has been properly launched.

31
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:05,721
Now what I would like to do is that this H2 server should store its data,

32
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:06,816
table, objects,

33
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:11,261
and the like in this directory here that I've created

34
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:13,653
in the project called db-files.

35
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:19,151
To do that, we need to check the path of this file.

36
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:25,527
So you can open the properties of this folder by hitting Alt+Enter.

37
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:28,541
It will open this panel, and from there,

38
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:32,079
you can just copy/paste this, close this,

39
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:41,424
go back to your navigator window, paste this directory in the JDBC URL box,

40
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:44,219
and then add the name of the file.

41
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,172
Let me call it db-Pluralsight.

42
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:49,856
Let me check the connection.

43
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:55,443
The connection is okay, so now we can connect to this database.

44
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:59,857
If I go back to Eclipse and refresh this folder by hitting F5,

45
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:06,163
I can see that the db-Pluralsight file has been created here.

46
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:10,297
Let me go back to the console, and from there,

47
00:03:10,297 --> 00:03:16,266
I can, for instance, create a table, create table Person with an id,

48
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:20,575
which is of type int and is a primary key,

49
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:27,276
and age of type int, and a name of type varchar of 40 chars,

50
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:28,488
for instance.

51
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:33,026
Let me execute this code and make this window a little wider.

52
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:37,623
Click here on this button, and this has created a table,

53
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:42,456
which I can open here, with the three columns,

54
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,399
ID, AGE, and NAME.

55
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:59,000
So with those very simple steps, we can create a DB server, an H2 DB server, and from the console, interact with it using SQL requests.
