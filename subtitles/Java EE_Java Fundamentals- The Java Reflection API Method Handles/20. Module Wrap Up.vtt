00:00:01.943 --> 00:00:05.318
And I think that we've reached the end of this module.

2
00:00:05.318 --> 00:00:07.392
Time to wrap it up.

3
00:00:07.392 --> 00:00:09.620
What did you learn in this module?

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.428
Well, you saw one of the most important applications of the Reflection API,

5
00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:20.660
which is the creation of object relational mappers.

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.470
Of course, the one you saw is a very, very simple object relational mapper,

7
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.616
but even the more complex ones are working using the same principles.

8
00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:34.232
You saw how to introspect an object,

9
00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:38.683
how to read its state internally without knowing it,

10
00:00:38.683 --> 00:00:44.715
and how to set the state to given values using the Reflection API.

11
00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:47.810
You saw how to store it in a database,

12
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.592
and this is really how the object relational mapping

13
00:00:52.592 --> 00:00:55.423
frameworks are working currently.

14
00:00:55.423 --> 00:00:59.570
Of course, they are doing things in a much more sophisticated way,

15
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.312
but the basic principles are there.

16
00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:07.563
And by the way, the other mappers, the XML mappers,

17
00:01:07.563 --> 00:01:11.428
the JSON mappers, are also working like that.

18
00:01:11.428 --> 00:01:13.429
And that's it for this module.

19
00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.198
Thank you for watching it.

20
00:01:15.198 --> 00:01:17.728
I hope you found it interesting.

21
00:01:17.728 --> 00:01:22.756
In the next module, you are going to see how to work with methods.

22
00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:28.356
So far, we have used the Reflection API to access the fields of object.

23
00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:33.076
The Reflection API also gives access to the methods of objects,

24
00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:38.610
and this is what we are going to see in the next module of this course.

25
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.000
I hope to meet you there. Thank you.
