00:00:01.653 --> 00:00:07.089
So let me get the metamodel, the PrimaryKey, the field of that PrimaryKey.

2
00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.172
Put these two in your local variable.

3
00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:11.694
This is the primaryKeyField.

4
00:00:11.694 --> 00:00:12.014
Fine.

5
00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:17.206
I need to check the name of the column corresponding to that field.

6
00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:20.939
So this is the primaryKeyColumnName.

7
00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.123
The metamodel knows the name of that column, getPrimaryKey and GetName.

8
00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:30.031
And I also need the type of that primaryKey.

9
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:33.277
I can get it from the field, primaryKeyField.getType,

10
00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:38.199
and this is the primaryKeyType.

11
00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.723
I have everything I need to know to query the resultSet

12
00:00:41.723 --> 00:00:44.685
for the value of this primary field.

13
00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:45.696
So first of all,

14
00:00:45.696 --> 00:00:49.685
we need to call resultSet.next to tell the resultSet to

15
00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:53.081
advance one step on the table of the results.

16
00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:55.977
This is going to throw some more exceptions.

17
00:00:55.977 --> 00:00:58.133
Our good friend, the SQL Exception,

18
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:02.939
has been added to this huge list of exceptions we are throwing.

19
00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:08.314
And now, if the primaryKeyType is equal to long.class,

20
00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:09.151
this time,

21
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:12.758
we are comparing this to the primitive type because we

22
00:01:12.758 --> 00:01:14.541
got this type from the metamodel.

23
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:19.270
So this type has not been wrapped to a Long.class.

24
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.272
Since this is long, we can get the result form the resultSet,

25
00:01:22.272 --> 00:01:26.912
which we need to be careful because we know that we have stored the

26
00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:31.037
column as an int in a SQL database and not as a long.

27
00:01:31.037 --> 00:01:34.625
So we need to call the getInt method from the resultSet,

28
00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:39.236
pass the primaryKeyColumnName, and put the result in a long,

29
00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:41.810
and this is the value of the primaryKey.

30
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.658
Now that we have the value of the primaryKey,

31
00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:50.575
we need to set this value to the right field of the object we just created.

32
00:01:50.575 --> 00:01:53.833
So most probably, this field is a private field,

33
00:01:53.833 --> 00:02:00.131
so we need to call setAccessible of true and then set the value on this

34
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:04.276
t object with the primaryKey that we just created.

35
00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:08.502
And this code is going to set the value of the primaryKey to the

36
00:02:08.502 --> 00:02:12.282
corresponding field of the object we are currently creating.

37
00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:22.000
Now if we want to handle other types of primaryKey, you need to add some code here to handle those particular types.
