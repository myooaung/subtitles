1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,005
Let us create this method.

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:05,800
It's a private method.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,432
Private T buildInstanceFrom takes a Class and the ResultSet.

4
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:13,359
We are going to need that class.

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,889
As usual, the Metamodel.of, pass the class as a parameter.

6
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:21,477
And the goal of this method is two-fold.

7
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:24,296
First, create an instance of that class,

8
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:25,072
and second,

9
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:30,728
populate all the fields of that class with the content of the resultSet.

10
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:34,770
So the first step is to create an instance of that class,

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,467
so clss, you can call newInsance here,

12
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:41,315
and put the result in a variable of type t.

13
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:46,378
But you see that this newInstance method has been deprecated.

14
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:51,453
Let us check the code, and you see that it has been deprecated since Java 9.

15
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:57,324
We are currently running Java 11, so we see this method as a deprecated method.

16
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:58,286
Let me close this.

17
00:00:58,286 --> 00:01:02,084
The right method to call, and even if you are running Java 8,

18
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:07,812
it's better to use this second pattern, is to get the constructor of the class,

19
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:12,218
the empty constructor, so we do not need to pass any parameter to this method,

20
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:14,960
and on that constructor, to call the newInstance method.

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,918
And this is going to create the same instance as the

22
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:21,457
newInstance from the class method.

23
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:26,785
This is going to throw many exceptions, the Instantiation,

24
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:30,737
IllegalAccess, IllegalArgument, InvocationTarget,

25
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:34,078
NoSuchMethod, Security, and that's it.

26
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,081
Now that we created this instance,

27
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:45,000
we need to populate the fields with the right value. And the first field we want to populate is, of course, the primaryKeyField.
