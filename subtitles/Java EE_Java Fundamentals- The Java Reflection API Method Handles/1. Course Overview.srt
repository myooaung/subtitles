Hello, my name is Jose.

2
00:00:06,411 --> 00:00:09,749
I'm a Java Champion and Java Rockstar.

3
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:15,267
I'm talking to you from Paris, and I'm very excited to present my new course,

4
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:20,887
Java Fundamentals: The Java Reflection API and Method Handles.

5
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:25,957
This course shows you how to discover the structure of classes at

6
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:29,786
runtime without knowing them at compile time.

7
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:33,507
You will learn how to create objects; how to set up their fields,

8
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:40,636
even private fields; how to invoke their methods; how to use annotations to add

9
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:45,360
metadata on class elements; and how to read them at runtime.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,296
Method handles are also covered for improved performances.

11
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:55,946
I organized this course around two very important real-life use cases.

12
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:56,328
First,

13
00:00:56,328 --> 00:01:01,537
you will create a simple object relational mapper on the model of Hibernate,

14
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:06,543
and second, a spring-like dependency injection framework.

15
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:10,497
Before you move on, be sure to be familiar with all these,

16
00:01:10,497 --> 00:01:13,793
the Java language, a little bit of lambdas,

17
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:18,329
and the basics of SQL databases and JDBC.

18
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,388
The Reflection API is not an easy topic.

19
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:22,919
It is very technical.

20
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:35,000
And I can't wait to see the awesome tools and applications you will be writing after following this course.
