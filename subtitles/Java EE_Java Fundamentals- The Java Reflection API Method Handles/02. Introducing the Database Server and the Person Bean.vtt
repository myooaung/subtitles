00:00:02.132 --> 00:00:03.028
First of all,

2
00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:09.115
let us see some technical details about saving objects to a database.

3
00:00:09.115 --> 00:00:10.664
We need a Person class,

4
00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:14.848
and we already have one because we created it in the previous module,

5
00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.213
and we also need a database.

6
00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:24.727
And since creating, configuring, installing a database is a tedious process,

7
00:00:24.727 --> 00:00:28.071
we are going to use a very simple database,

8
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:32.717
which is an in-memory database and that basically does

9
00:00:32.717 --> 00:00:36.043
not need any kind of configuration.

10
00:00:36.043 --> 00:00:37.941
It is the H2 database,

11
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:44.872
and we are going to be able to launch simple SQL queries on this database.

12
00:00:44.872 --> 00:00:49.940
We will also need a table to add instances of Person in,

13
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.720
and we are going to see all that in detail.

14
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.210
Here is, once again,

15
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.835
the Person class we are going to work on with two annotations,

16
00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:06.039
the PrimaryKey, which has been covered in the previous module,

17
00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:12.232
and the Column annotation on the name and on the age field.

18
00:01:12.232 --> 00:01:18.278
We are adding here a name attribute to this Column annotation to specify

19
00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:24.526
the name of the column we want to write those values in.

20
00:01:24.526 --> 00:01:28.499
This annotation attribute is something that we didn't see

21
00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:37.000
in the previous module and that we are going to cover in the demo part of this module.
