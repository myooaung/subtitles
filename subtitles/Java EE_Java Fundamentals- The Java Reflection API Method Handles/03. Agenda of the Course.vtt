00:00:01.898 --> 00:00:05.809
Let us quickly browse through the agenda of this course.

2
00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:09.895
There are two main things we need to cover,

3
00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:15.040
first, the API itself, how it works, and how it has been organized,

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.047
and then give examples.

5
00:00:18.047 --> 00:00:22.719
This course is application oriented in a way we are not

6
00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:26.977
going to cover all the methods and all the classes brought

7
00:00:26.977 --> 00:00:30.657
to the JDK by the Reflection API,

8
00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:36.788
but merely the minimum we need to create two small applications.

9
00:00:36.788 --> 00:00:41.040
We will thus cover everything you need to know and you need to

10
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.432
understand to be able to go further and to understand the rest

11
00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:48.057
that has not been covered in this course.

12
00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:52.695
The fact is that there are many methods in the classes of this API.

13
00:00:52.695 --> 00:00:56.503
Covering everything would be really tedious.

14
00:00:56.503 --> 00:01:03.555
So we will first introduce the API, the main concepts, and the main classes.

15
00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:06.995
And then we will jump into examples.

16
00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:14.011
The first one is a small and very naive object relational mapping application.

17
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:20.667
The same kind of things Hibernate is doing, but much, much, much more simple.

18
00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:25.589
And the second example will be a dependency injection framework.

19
00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:30.889
Once again, a very, very simplified version of the Spring framework.

20
00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.238
And then we will talk about performances.

21
00:01:34.238 --> 00:01:39.496
Performance hits is the main thing people are talking about when they are

22
00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:43.356
talking about the problems with the Reflection API.

23
00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:55.000
These problems have been identified and dealt with with method handles, and we will cover that point in detail.
