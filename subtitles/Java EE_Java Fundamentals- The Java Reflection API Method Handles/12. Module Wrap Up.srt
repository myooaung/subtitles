00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:04,180
Okay, now that's it for this module.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,600
Let us make a quick wrap up.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,276
So what did you learn in this module?

4
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:09,697
First,

5
00:00:09,697 --> 00:00:14,929
you learned how to add annotations to fields and how to

6
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:17,636
create your own custom annotations.

7
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:21,070
This is a very powerful tool of the JDK,

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,991
and you should be using it in your application if you need it.

9
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:31,568
Then you saw how to read and write fields using the Reflection API and how to

10
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:36,443
filter those fields using the annotations you have created.

11
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:39,038
Now that you saw how to create this metamodel,

12
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:42,845
how to use it to annotate your JavaBeans,

13
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:47,473
and how to use the Reflection API to get this information,

14
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:52,931
I think it is time to try to write those objects to a database.

15
00:00:52,931 --> 00:01:03,000
This is what you are going to see in the next module of this course, and I hope to meet you there in a minute.
