Hello, my name is Jose.

2
00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:07.536
I am very glad to welcome you back for the last module of

3
00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:09.972
this course about the Java Reflection API.

4
00:00:09.972 --> 00:00:14.677
We are going to talk about the performances of this

5
00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:17.173
API and about method handles,

6
00:00:17.173 --> 00:00:24.475
which is the solution to fix the performance issues introduced in Java 7.

7
00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:28.842
Let us quickly see the agenda of this last module.

8
00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:34.432
First, we are going to talk about the performances of the Reflection API.

9
00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:38.124
You may have heard many people talking about the

10
00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:40.944
performance issues of the Reflection API,

11
00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:44.231
and indeed, they do exist.

12
00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:48.643
So we are first going to explain where does it come from.

13
00:00:48.643 --> 00:00:54.226
Why is the Reflection API considered slow by so many people?

14
00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:57.985
And once we have identified those performance issues,

15
00:00:57.985 --> 00:01:03.083
we will be able to propose a solution to fix them.

16
00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:12.000
And this solution has a name. It is the MethodHandle API of this last module.
