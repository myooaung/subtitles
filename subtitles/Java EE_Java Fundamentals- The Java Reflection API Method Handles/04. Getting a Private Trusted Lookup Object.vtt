00:00:02.218 --> 00:00:06.889
First of all, let us see how to create this lookup object.

2
00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:12.103
We have a very simple pattern for that, MethodHandles.lookup.

3
00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:17.732
This is a factory method that will just return this lookup object.

4
00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:21.528
This lookup object carries all the security information,

5
00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:24.386
and it has two consequences.

6
00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:27.893
The first one is that if you have different threads

7
00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:32.504
running in your application with different security roles

8
00:00:32.504 --> 00:00:35.028
with different security context,

9
00:00:35.028 --> 00:00:39.830
this lookup object will be different for each thread.

10
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.966
And since it carries all the security information that will not be

11
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:49.124
checked again for all the rest of your processings.

12
00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:53.479
You should be aware that this lookup object should not

13
00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.086
be shared with some untrusted code.

14
00:00:57.086 --> 00:00:58.905
If you share it,

15
00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:04.006
this untrusted code will be able to access your objects using

16
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:13.000
Reflection with the security of somebody else. And of course, you want to avoid that.
