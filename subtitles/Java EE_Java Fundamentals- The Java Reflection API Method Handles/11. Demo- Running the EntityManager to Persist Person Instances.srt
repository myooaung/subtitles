1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:05,644
Before we run this code, let us go back to the H2 console.

2
00:00:05,644 --> 00:00:08,519
We can just click on this table.

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,463
It will generate the proper SQL query to check the content of this table,

4
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:17,194
execute this query, and check that.

5
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:20,695
Indeed, the table is empty.

6
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:27,091
Now we cannot have two instances of a server using this same data file,

7
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:31,969
so you need to disconnect the console from this file,

8
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,951
go back to the code here.

9
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:39,005
We are going to print out the different people that have been returned,

10
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:45,663
linda, james, susan, and john, james, susan,

11
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:50,064
and john, and I'm just going to add something here.

12
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:53,747
Put this in a variable.

13
00:00:53,747 --> 00:00:54,918
This is the id.

14
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:59,067
And while we set the value of the PrimaryKey in the statement,

15
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:03,400
we are also going to set it in the object itself.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,635
So from the metamodel PrimaryKey, get the field.

17
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:15,172
Let me create that method from here, return this.field.

18
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:19,652
This is the PrimaryKey field.

19
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:23,425
Let me make it accessible because most of the time,

20
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:29,472
it's going to be private, and call field.set on object t,

21
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:33,169
which is the person we are currently writing in the database,

22
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:39,116
to the value id, which is the PrimaryKey we just generated.

23
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:42,973
So if we go back to the main method,

24
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:48,471
here we are just writing the object before we write them to the

25
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:51,820
database then add the message Writing to DB,

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,013
write them to the database, and once this has been done,

27
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:59,849
we should see that the PrimaryKey have been seen in

28
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:01,733
the instances of the objects.

29
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:04,064
So let us run this code.

30
00:02:04,064 --> 00:02:04,631
And indeed,

31
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:08,901
you can see that the values have been set showing that the

32
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:13,622
objects have been properly written to the database,

33
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:20,241
which we can check again by connecting here and executing this request.

34
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:25,454
So this is a very basic way of creating an EntityManager able

35
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:29,702
to write instances of people in a database.

36
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:32,127
It is very basic, very naive,

37
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:44,000
but you can see that from that you can create much more complex systems, system like Hibernate and the like.
