00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:04.446
So now is the time to wrap up this module.

2
00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:07.133
What did you learn in this module?

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:10.991
Well, you saw how to access the elements of a class,

4
00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:16.362
whether we are talking about the class itself with its super classes

5
00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:21.043
and implemented interfaces or the content of a class,

6
00:00:21.043 --> 00:00:25.458
the fields, the methods, and the constructors,

7
00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:31.413
and the modifiers with this special pattern we can use to access that.

8
00:00:31.413 --> 00:00:37.907
You haven't seen really how to leverage the full power of the Reflection API,

9
00:00:37.907 --> 00:00:44.894
which is how to access the state of an object instance of a class,

10
00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:48.378
how to read it, and how to modify it.

11
00:00:48.378 --> 00:00:58.000
This is what we are going to do in the next module of this course, so I hope to see you there in a minute.
