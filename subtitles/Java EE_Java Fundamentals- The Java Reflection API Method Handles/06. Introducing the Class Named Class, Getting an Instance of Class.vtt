00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.870
So, yes, there is a class named Class,

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.697
and this is what we are going to cover first.

3
00:00:08.697 --> 00:00:12.423
We are going to see two things with this class named Class,

4
00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:12.875
first,

5
00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:17.902
how to get an instance of this class because we cannot

6
00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:21.662
create a class just by calling new class,

7
00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:24.909
for instance, this is not possible, and second,

8
00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.250
what we can do with it.

9
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.837
First, it is not possible to create yourself a class instance.

10
00:00:32.837 --> 00:00:35.951
In fact, there is a way to create class instances,

11
00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:39.264
a very particular way, very technical,

12
00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:42.129
which is sometimes used in certain frameworks.

13
00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.840
We are not going to cover this point.

14
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.973
This is outside of the scope of this course,

15
00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:52.620
and you do not usually need to do that in your applications.

16
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.976
So the question is, how is it possible to get a reference to a class instance?

17
00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:02.111
Well, there are several patterns to do that.

18
00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:08.271
The first one is querying an existing object for its class.

19
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:12.175
The second one is that when you know a class by its name,

20
00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:17.699
it is easy to get a reference on the corresponding class object.

21
00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:22.683
And a third one, when you get the name of a class at runtime only,

22
00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:27.319
that is your name that is not known at compile time,

23
00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:38.000
you can also get a reference on the corresponding class as long as this class is known from your application.
