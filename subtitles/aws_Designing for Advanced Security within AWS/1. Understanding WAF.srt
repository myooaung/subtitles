[Autogenerated] Hi.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,980
This is Craig Google lightly,

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:08,340
and welcome to protecting your account and applications.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,430
We're going to look into A W s web application,

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,570
firewall or Ralf and how you can use it to protect your web

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,140
applications from common web exploits.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:19,310
A.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,940
W s Shield managed distributed denial of service or DDOS protection,

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,360
including the differences between Standard and Advanced and AWS Guard Duty,

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,420
which provides intelligent threat detection and continuous monitoring

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,440
for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,230
AWS web application,

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,600
firewall or WAFT allows you to filter traffic with rules

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,070
based on any part of the web request.

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,830
You can use managed rules,

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,120
which are designed to protect against common threats and are

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,740
automatically updated as new issues emerge.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,240
You can use waft with cloudfront application load balancers or API gateway.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,940
There is no up front cost,

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,380
and you pay based on the number of rules you deploy and how

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,640
many requests your application receives.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,660
So what types of properties can do AWS web application

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,850
firewall used to filter you can filter by i p address or

24
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,810
country and other values in the request.

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:25,140
Like HTTP headers and body, you are I strings and length of request.

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,280
You can also detect any included SQL code and filter on that

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,050
to avoid SQL injection attacks as well as any scripts that

28
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,510
error present in the request,

29
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,450
which may indicate a cross site scripting attack for each rule,

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,600
you will specify an action to take based on whether the

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,250
request matches the statements in the rule.

32
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:51,190
You can allow the request to go through, block the request or count the request.

33
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,320
Counting is a good way to test if your rules are behaving as expected

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,270
and can be leveraged for limiting or denying access.

35
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,720
After a certain number of matching requests over a period of time,

36
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,610
let's take a look at the building blocks of laugh.

37
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,540
First, you have a rule.

38
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,740
This will contain one or more of the conditions we discussed earlier.

39
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,410
Next,

40
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,050
you can add one or more rules to a rule group to more

41
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,440
easily manage and sequence related rules.

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,840
If you have certain rejects patterns or I P addresses you need to re use,

43
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,360
those can also be placed in sets and used in rules.

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,040
Finally, you'll create a web A C L and add rules and rule groups.

45
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,180
The web A C L is what will actually be attached to a

46
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,260
resource like a cloudfront distribution.

47
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,640
API, gateway, API or application load balancer.

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,710
A W S maintains several managed rule sets that error

49
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,640
available for use at no additional charge.

50
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,830
You can simply add these to your web.

51
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,210
A C L AWS Marketplace has additional managed rule sets that error

52
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,960
maintained by third parties and contained waft rules that have been

53
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,810
configured for certain applications or software systems to cover things

54
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,040
like a WASP Top 10 vulnerabilities list.

55
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,540
You can go to marketplace, browse rules,

56
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,820
then subscribe to those you want to use.

57
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,040
You'll be charged a monthly subscription,

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,240
plus a per request amount based on your volume.

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,000
You can cancel it any time in your subscription will be

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,240
pro rated to what you actually used.

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,930
We're not going to get into the details of AWS firewall manager in this course,

62
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,650
but I wanted to mention that you can use it to centrally configure and

63
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,740
manage waft rules across counts and resource is which can be very

64
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:50,000
helpful if you're using A W s organizations. For more details, check out the documentation for AWS firewall manager
