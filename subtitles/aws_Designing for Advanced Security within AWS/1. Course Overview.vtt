designing for advanced Security within AWS.

I am a senior software consultant.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.040
Designing for security is essential, especially in the cloud.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.100
You want to keep things running smoothly and you don't want to be

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.040
the next company data loss story in the news.

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.020
In this course,

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.110
we're going to cover some best practices and key A W s services to help

10
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.250
keep your account secure and your applications protected.

11
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.650
If you're studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect professional exam,

12
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.740
you're in the right place.

13
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.690
Some of the major topics that we will cover include locking down your

14
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.040
accounts and users managing keys and certificates,

15
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.240
firewall protection and threat detection.

16
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.670
By the end of this course,

17
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.790
you will be able to secure your users accounts and applications

18
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.210
using robust and effective tools in a W s and have a solid

19
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.140
foundation for your exam preparations.

20
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.750
Before beginning the course, you should have a basic understanding of a W s.

21
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.730
