00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.670
[Autogenerated] Let's go to Amazon guard duty in the AWS web console

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.480
and generate some sample findings to see the kinds of things guard

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.420
duty can detect under Amazon guard duty.

4
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.640
Select, Get started, then enable guard duty.

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.740
Note that you can try out guard duty for 30 days under the free trial.

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.300
You can check this section to see how far along you are in your 30 day trial,

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.140
as well as the CloudTrail logs,

8
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.170
VPC flow logs and DNS logs that have been processed.

9
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.770
This helps give you an idea of how much data you'll be processing each

10
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.970
month so you can calculate the cost of guard duty.

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.540
Initially,

12
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.000
you won't have any findings because guard duty needs to establish a baseline

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.590
with a couple of weeks of normal activity in your account.

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.920
This will allow it to set up the machine learning models to detect any

15
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.040
anomalies that may happen and alert you of those events.

16
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.740
Let's go to guard duty settings and to generate some sample findings.

17
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.550
We can now go back to findings and see some examples of the

18
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.200
types of things that guard duty confined.

19
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.120
Note the different color coded icons indicating

20
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.940
severity you consort by severity type.

21
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.440
For example, all high severity findings, then add additional filter criteria.

22
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.340
Let's take a look at some of the sample findings.

23
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.380
For example,

24
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.480
here is an instance that is behaving in a manner that may

25
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.340
indicate it is being used to perform a DDOS attack.

26
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.870
Here's an instance that's receiving unauthorized attacks from a

27
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.140
certain type trying to guess the Rdp password.

28
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.460
Here's another potential ________ that's using Port 25

29
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.840
to communicate with a remote host.

30
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.170
Here's a recon finding where an instance is performing

31
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.340
outbound port scans against a remote host.

32
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.140
And here's an instance communicating with a known Bitcoin related I P address.

33
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.830
If you head over to lists,

34
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.640
you can customize guard duty with trusted I P lists

35
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.300
and threat lists under accounts.

36
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.540
If you're using AWS organizations,

37
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.500
you can add member accounts to your guard duty.

38
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.840
Monitoring guard duty is a very powerful tool to

39
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.970
easily leverage machine learning.

40
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.930
To establish baseline normal activity in your account and detect

41
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.400
anomalies to help you proactively respond to threats before they

42
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.750
escalate and affect your resource is congratulations.

43
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.760
You've seen how to make rules in laugh to protect your web applications as well

44
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.110
as how to leverage managed rules from the AWS marketplace.

45
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.330
We've discussed the protections you get from Shield Standard,

46
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.720
which is included with laugh as well as the additional features,

47
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.440
logging and support available when you subscribe to shield advanced.

48
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.170
Finally,

49
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.910
we reviewed the types of findings that guard duty can do provide as it monitors

50
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.400
and uses machine learning to detect anomalies in your account behavior and

51
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.070
allow you to detect and act on suspicious activity.

52
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.940
I hope you found this valuable and thank you for watching.

53
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.740
Be sure to continue working through the courses in this certification path,

54
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.000
and if you're studying for the exam, keep going, you can do it.
