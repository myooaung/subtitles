00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.001
(upbeat motivating music)

2
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.008
- [Instructor] Now it's time for a Challenge exercise,

3
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.002
and this one's going to be kind of fun

4
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.008
because this is actually an interview question

5
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:19.003
that I see asked a lot, especially for newer developers.

6
00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:22.001
You're going to be asked to implement a FizzBuzz

7
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.005
using a command liner runner.

8
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:25.009
Now FizzBuzz, again,

9
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.003
is one of those common interview questions,

10
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:31.001
but I'm going to explain to you the rules.

11
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.000
So, again, you'll use a CommandLineRunner interface

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.003
to implement this.

13
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:40.005
You are going to print all numbers between one and 100.

14
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:44.009
So start with one, the last number printed should be 100.

15
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:49.000
If the number is divisible by three, print Fizz

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.001
instead of the number.

17
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.008
If the number is divisible by five, print Buzz

18
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.004
instead of the number.

19
00:00:56.004 --> 00:01:01.007
Now, if the number is divisible by both, say 15,

20
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.004
then you print FizzBuzz.

21
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.005
And I've got a great solution for this,

22
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.000
but I want to see yours first, so dig in.
