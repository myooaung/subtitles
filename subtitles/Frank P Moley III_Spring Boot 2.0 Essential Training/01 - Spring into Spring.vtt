00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Frank] In many circles,

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:05.009
knowing Java means that you also know Spring.

3
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.001
Spring Boot has become the almost default way

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.005
to build Spring-based Java applications.

5
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:16.006
The rapid development and built-in operational onboarding

6
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:20.004
allow you to focus on your business and customers,

7
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.001
and not on building new applications

8
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.009
and wiring enterprise equipment.

9
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.002
Spring Boot, a project introduced in a tweet,

10
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.008
has become the most efficient, productive,

11
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.004
and powerful way to build applications

12
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.009
using Java for enterprises,

13
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.001
as well as in cloud native situations.

14
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:43.001
While there are many other frameworks on the market,

15
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:46.001
many of which have their own value statements,

16
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:51.000
nothing today tops Spring in popularity and effectiveness.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.009
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

18
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.009
I'm a software developer, architect,

19
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:58.008
technical manager, teacher, and ultimately student.

20
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:00.008
I have been involved in the Spring community

21
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:02.009
since the early days of the framework,

22
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.009
and continue to use it, speak about it,

23
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.008
and teach it to others.

24
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.005
So let's get ready for a journey

25
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.000
of the essential aspects of Spring Boot.
