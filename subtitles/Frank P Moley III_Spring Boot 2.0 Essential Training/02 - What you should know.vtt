00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.008
- [Instructor] In order to be successful in this course,

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:05.000
there are a few prerequisites.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.007
There's a baseline of knowledge,

4
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.007
as well as some software you will need to have

5
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.000
on your computer itself.

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.001
There were also be some options with the installations.

7
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.002
Please know that you don't have to do everything

8
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.007
the way I'm saying it.

9
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:20.007
This is primarily my workflow.

10
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:24.004
We're using the Spring framework for Java for this course.

11
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.009
While you can use other JVM languages

12
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.005
like Kotlin and Groovy, we will be focusing on Java.

13
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.008
Now you need to have a JDK installed on your computer.

14
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:40.000
I will be using JDK 11 as it is a long-term support version.

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.006
You can also use a different JDK as well

16
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:46.001
based upon the current Spring support for this course.

17
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.007
We will not be using any advanced language constructs.

18
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.009
However, do you know if you don't use JDK 11,

19
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:57.000
you may run into slight issues with changes in the JVM.

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.005
I expect you to have some intermediate level Java skills

21
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.008
so you don't get tripped up with the language itself.

22
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:06.002
Now we won't be doing anything too difficult

23
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:08.000
from a language perspective

24
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.004
but it's hard to learn a framework for a language

25
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.009
when you struggle with the language itself.

26
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.005
I do expect you to understand how to compile

27
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:20.005
a Java application while we will be using our IEs

28
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:21.005
for a lot of it,

29
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:24.000
it is important to understand what compilation

30
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.002
and packaging does in Java.

31
00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:28.004
You will also need to understand

32
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:33.007
how to run a Java application, specifically a package jar.

33
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:37.003
Now we will go through this, but it's a basic understanding

34
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:40.007
for building a Spring Boot application.

35
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:43.000
And finally, debugging is an important skill

36
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.004
for Java development.

37
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:47.004
If things don't work right on your first attempt,

38
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:51.001
debugging your running program should help you figure out

39
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.004
what may be wrong.

40
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:56.006
Now, this is a course on Spring Boot, and as such,

41
00:01:56.006 --> 00:02:00.008
you should have a little understanding about Spring itself.

42
00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:02.007
Now I will walk through the configurations

43
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:05.002
and implementations but you should have

44
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.000
that basic understanding.

45
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.001
I have several courses in the library

46
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.005
including learning Spring with Spring Boot

47
00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:13.008
and Spring framework in depth

48
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:17.007
that will give you a good background.

49
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:20.007
You should understand why Spring is such a value

50
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.003
for Java developers.

51
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:26.005
And I assume that since you are here, you already did that.

52
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:28.007
When you add that value to the speed

53
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:31.007
and ease of Spring Boot, you will get a holistic picture

54
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:35.002
of why this is a good framework to learn.

55
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:38.000
Now, you don't need to be an expert at Spring

56
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.006
to use it or to get value out of it from this course.

57
00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:46.004
For this course, we will use Apache Maven

58
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:48.006
to manage our dependencies.

59
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:51.008
With Spring, you can use Gradle if you want.

60
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:55.006
And in fact, that's what the Spring team itself uses.

61
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:58.004
But I find Maven to be easier to use

62
00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:01.004
especially in a learning environment.

63
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:04.008
So you will need to have Maven installed on your machine.

64
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:07.002
Now Apache gives you some great instructions

65
00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:09.007
on how to install Maven itself.

66
00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:12.007
So I'm going to leave that task to you.

67
00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:14.004
You will need to have an understanding

68
00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:16.009
of some basic Maven commands.

69
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.002
I have a course in the LinkedIn learning library

70
00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:21.000
called Introducing Maven

71
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.004
that will get you up to speed

72
00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:26.004
if you need some extra knowledge on Maven itself.

73
00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:27.008
And here's the link from a Apache

74
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:33.002
that you can use to install Maven on your operating system.

75
00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:36.001
We will be using Docker a few times in this course.

76
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:37.004
You have some options here

77
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:40.002
if you don't want to run Docker locally

78
00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:43.008
but I personally would suggest the Docker route.

79
00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:45.008
So you'll need to have Docker installed

80
00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:48.006
and Docker once again has some very good documentation

81
00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:52.008
on installation for various operating systems.

82
00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:56.003
You should understand some basic Docker commands.

83
00:03:56.003 --> 00:04:00.000
I will have scripts for you for Linux and BSD-based systems

84
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.008
but you'll need to get

85
00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:04.000
through the basics, especially in Windows.

86
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Now, for most of the uses of Docker,

87
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.005
you can choose to run the database locally or run it locally

88
00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:12.002
on your machine instead of using Docker.

89
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:13.008
That's your choice.

90
00:04:13.008 --> 00:04:16.001
But I often find it not worth the time

91
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:18.003
to install things locally.

92
00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:23.001
And I actually use Docker every day for this very purpose.

93
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:25.003
Now here's a link where you can find details

94
00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:27.009
of installing Docker.

95
00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.002
The final required piece of software you will need is an IDE

96
00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:34.003
or Integrated Development Environment.

97
00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:35.004
Now, first and foremost,

98
00:04:35.004 --> 00:04:39.009
it does not matter which IDE you use for this course.

99
00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:45.002
Most modern IDEs will work for everything in this course.

100
00:04:45.002 --> 00:04:46.008
The most important part

101
00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:50.009
is that you personally are comfortable with your IDE.

102
00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.004
Don't pick the one that I use just because I'm using it.

103
00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:56.009
That doesn't help you.

104
00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.007
You really need to understand how to use it well.

105
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.006
Understand how to use Maven integration

106
00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:04.008
understand how to run and debug Java applications.

107
00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:07.006
Again, it needs to fit you.

108
00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:10.001
Now I use IntelliJ Ultimate Edition

109
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:13.002
because for me, it's the most comfortable.

110
00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:15.003
I use the products in all languages

111
00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:17.004
that I code in again for comfort.

112
00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:20.000
And this is what I do every single day.

113
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.006
If I used a different IDE for this course,

114
00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:23.008
I would struggle through it

115
00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:26.000
and it would take away from the core of this course

116
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
which is not the IDE, but the framework.

117
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.004
So do not feel that you need to go buy an IDE

118
00:05:31.004 --> 00:05:34.002
for this course, just use what fits.

119
00:05:34.002 --> 00:05:37.003
They all will do the same thing.

120
00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:41.001
Now there's a couple pieces of helpful software that I use

121
00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:44.007
which is optional, but you may find useful.

122
00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:47.001
Now we'll use the command line, not only to interact

123
00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:50.001
with Docker, but also to execute a few commands.

124
00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:52.005
I do expect you to know how to use the command line

125
00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:54.006
for your operating system.

126
00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:56.003
While cURL works great,

127
00:05:56.003 --> 00:06:00.008
I use a tool called HTTPie that I find easier to use

128
00:06:00.008 --> 00:06:03.005
when making web requests from the command line.

129
00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:05.004
Look it up if you want to use it as well.

130
00:06:05.004 --> 00:06:09.001
Otherwise, you can do everything with cURL.

131
00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:13.000
I also use a plugin for Chrome called JSON Viewer.

132
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.005
I find it easier to read JSON that has been prettified.

133
00:06:16.005 --> 00:06:19.004
And this plugin does that for me.

134
00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.003
There are some options here as well

135
00:06:21.003 --> 00:06:23.005
but you may find value in it after digging

136
00:06:23.005 --> 00:06:26.003
through JSON manually a few times.

137
00:06:26.003 --> 00:06:27.001
Now, that's it.

138
00:06:27.001 --> 00:06:30.000
So let's get ready to jump into the course.
