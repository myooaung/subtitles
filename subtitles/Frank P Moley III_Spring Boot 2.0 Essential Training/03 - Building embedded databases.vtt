00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.008
- (instructor)Before we get too much further

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.009
into the weeds of spring data, and repositories,

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.006
we need to get a database wired into our application.

4
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.005
So first and foremost, let's walk through

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:15.000
the process of wiring and embedded database.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.003
So what I want you to do is to return to your ID

7
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:19.006
and open up our room web app,

8
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.006
and go to the pom file.

9
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.003
We're going to add a couple of dependencies here.

10
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.007
The first dependency that we are going to add

11
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:34.003
is spring, boot, starter data jpa.

12
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:37.008
And that's going to come from org dot spring framework boot,

13
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.007
and we don't need a version.

14
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.007
And the next element,

15
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.007
is we're going to actually do our database.

16
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:47.006
And this time we're going to use the h2 database.

17
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:49.005
This is a great embedded database,

18
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:54.008
and it's very SQL compliant for most operations.

19
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:55.007
Now,

20
00:00:55.007 --> 00:01:01.000
let's let Maven do its thing and important projects.

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.004
Now, what I want you to notice is in the bin folder

22
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:06.006
of the exercise files, I've got several files here for you.

23
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:10.001
Some of these are shell scripts for Linux-based systems

24
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.005
but there's two sql files.

25
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:13.007
And I want you to take those,

26
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:15.007
and I want you to copy them not move them,

27
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.005
make sure you're copying them.

28
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.005
And I want you to put those

29
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:25.001
into source main resources of this module.

30
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.005
These include two very specifically named files.

31
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:30.001
One is schema dot sql,

32
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.000
and that provides the schema for our embedded database.

33
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.008
The other one is data dot sql,

34
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:38.006
and this provides the data that will go

35
00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:40.000
into our embedded database.

36
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.005
So now that we have those files there,

37
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:45.002
we need to go add some properties.

38
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:48.000
So let's open up application.properties,

39
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.003
and source main resources.

40
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:52.000
And the first one that we want to do,

41
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.006
is we want to set logging level org, spring framework

42
00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:08.004
jdbc data source init scriptutils,

43
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:10.003
we want to set this equal to debug.

44
00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:11.003
Now,

45
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:13.002
the reason we're going to do this is so we can see output

46
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:16.004
that the database itself is actually being loaded,

47
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:18.002
when we start up our application.

48
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.000
Normally this isn't something you would do

49
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.005
in a production application.

50
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.008
The next thing that we're going to do is we're

51
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:28.003
going to set the spring console.

52
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:31.005
So spring h2 console enabled,

53
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:33.001
we're going to set that equal to true.

54
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.004
That's going to give us a web-based way of viewing

55
00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.009
the data that's in our database.

56
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.004
And the last thing that we're going to do is we're

57
00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:47.006
going to actually set a data source URL to be in memory.

58
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:49.008
And this is a pretty standard pattern.

59
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:54.003
So the driver URL is jdbc h2 mem

60
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:56.006
indicating that it's in memory test db.

61
00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:59.004
Now with that, we're ready to start our application.

62
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.006
So let's go ahead and do that.

63
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:13.008
We're going to select our room web application and run it.

64
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:15.003
Let's take a look here

65
00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:16.006
at the console output a little bit.

66
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:17.007
As we scroll up,

67
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:20.008
you'll see that there's a whole bunch of sql statements

68
00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:21.009
they got logged,

69
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.008
and these are actually the SQL statements

70
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:25.004
from our data file.

71
00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.007
If you scroll up, you'll see a couple more,

72
00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:33.002
and those are the DDL statements to create our tables.

73
00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:38.000
Now, before we finish up, let's go to a web browser,

74
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.009
in inner web browser, I want you to connect

75
00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:46.007
to local host 80 80/h2-console.

76
00:03:46.007 --> 00:03:50.004
And you'll see we get an embedded console.

77
00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:54.000
Now we need to change the driver to match what we put

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.002
into our properties file.

79
00:03:56.002 --> 00:04:01.004
So JDBC H2 mem test db,

80
00:04:01.004 --> 00:04:03.000
because we didn't specify a username,

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.005
and password we can leave those blank, go ahead and connect.

82
00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:09.009
And now if you go to the employee table,

83
00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:12.009
and you run just a simple select star,

84
00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:17.005
you'll see all of the data that existed in our data file.

85
00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:19.001
And the same thing will happen

86
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.003
if you go to the room table and run it

87
00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:24.000
you'll see all of our room data.

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.005
And that's all we need to do to get an embedded database up

89
00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:30.000
and running with spring boot.
