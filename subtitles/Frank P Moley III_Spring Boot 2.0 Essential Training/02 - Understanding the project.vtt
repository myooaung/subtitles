00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] So we haven't really

2
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:02.004
done much yet

3
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.006
other than generate a project.

4
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.007
So before we get too much deeper

5
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.007
let's spend a moment and talk about

6
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.003
what you get with the project

7
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:14.006
created by this spring initializr.

8
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:15.004
So what I'd like you to do

9
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.001
is to open up your ID

10
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.000
and we're going to open up

11
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.006
the booting web project

12
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:23.005
and let's start with our pom file.

13
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.001
So you'll see it in the pom file

14
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.005
we get many of the values

15
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.007
that we entered in the initializr

16
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.003
such as group ID and artifact ID

17
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:32.007
but you'll also notice

18
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:35.001
that we get a couple dependencies.

19
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.009
Now, the web dependence that we got

20
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.006
because we selected web

21
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.002
as a dependency

22
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:41.007
and it by default brings in

23
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.008
spring boot starter.

24
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.004
We also get a test dependency for free,

25
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.006
again that comes just because

26
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.007
we've chosen spring boot starter

27
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.005
via spring boot web.

28
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:53.003
So you're always

29
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.008
going to get tests as well.

30
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.009
Now with the starter web dependency

31
00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:59.008
we get an entire web framework

32
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.004
and configuration from just that

33
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:03.009
and we're going to go into more details

34
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.005
of that here in a bit

35
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:06.005
but in the short-term

36
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.005
let's go to source main Java

37
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:11.001
and open up our route package

38
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:12.000
and you'll see

39
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.002
that we got a class file.

40
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.006
So let's open up that class file

41
00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:16.005
and you'll see that

42
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:18.004
this is a class that's annotated

43
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:21.005
with at spring boot application.

44
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.005
This defines that this class

45
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:25.002
being the route package

46
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:28.004
for configuration via component scanning

47
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.000
as well as being configurations

48
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.004
that are defined within it.

49
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:34.002
Now, right now, we don't have any

50
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:35.009
but this is a configuration class

51
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.009
and we can put being configuration

52
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.008
in this class if we choose

53
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:42.005
you'll notice it also has a main method

54
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:44.002
and that's how spring actually starts

55
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:46.007
is by executing this main method

56
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:48.009
when it builds its jar file

57
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.008
which is ultimately what it builds

58
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:52.004
that jar file points

59
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:54.004
to this main method.

60
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:55.003
So now let's open up

61
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.003
the source main resources folder

62
00:01:57.003 --> 00:01:58.001
and you know that

63
00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.004
we put a static file in here

64
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.005
called index at HTML.

65
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:02.008
There also is a file

66
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:05.001
called application.properties.

67
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:06.000
Now, right now,

68
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.005
this is blank

69
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:08.004
but this is where

70
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:09.002
you can load

71
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:10.009
various configuration properties

72
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.007
for your application

73
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.003
that you want to be stored

74
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.002
within the application itself

75
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.007
as opposed to injected

76
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:19.009
via environment variables.

77
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.001
Now, we're going to dig more

78
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:22.006
into this file later

79
00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:23.004
but I want you to note

80
00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:24.003
that it could be more

81
00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:26.003
than just a properties file.

82
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:27.006
You can use YAML for instance,

83
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.004
instead of properties.

84
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:31.007
Now there's one of the things

85
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:32.006
that we got for free

86
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:35.002
and if you open up the test package

87
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:39.001
you'll see that there is a test for this

88
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:40.001
and it's annotated

89
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:42.007
with at spring boot test.

90
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:44.004
Now this test comes for free

91
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.006
again with the initializr,

92
00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:48.002
you'll notice that it is annotated

93
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:49.008
with at spring boot test

94
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:51.001
and that tells it

95
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:52.008
to load the configuration

96
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:55.003
as part of this test

97
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:56.008
and it includes one test

98
00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:58.008
and right now that test just ensures

99
00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:01.005
that the context itself loads

100
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:04.003
so that everything is wired in.

101
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:05.002
Now, there may be

102
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:06.005
a couple of their files here

103
00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:08.004
that came with it for free,

104
00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:09.007
such as some Maven files

105
00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:11.000
and some scripts.

106
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.004
We're not going to talk about those

107
00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:14.006
right now but they're there

108
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:15.007
if you need them,

109
00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:16.009
there's also a help file

110
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.002
that is very helpful

111
00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:19.002
if you need pointers

112
00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:21.004
as to where the documentation is

113
00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:23.005
and there's a get ignore file by default

114
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:25.006
because usually we're pushing this

115
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:27.000
into source control

116
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.008
and as a matter of fact,

117
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:29.003
that's how I do all of my code

118
00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:31.001
is I run it through source control

119
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:32.006
even if it's local

120
00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:34.003
so that I can keep versions of it

121
00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:35.001
while I'm going

122
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:37.003
and I highly encourage you to do that

123
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:39.001
so you can always step back in time

124
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:41.000
as you need to.
