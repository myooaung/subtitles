00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] Operational needs are critical

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.006
to maintaining system health

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.002
as well as responding to incidents when they occur.

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.000
Each application needs to provide details of its up status

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.005
as well as other metrics details,

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.008
and this is where Actuator comes into the picture.

7
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.000
We need to start with understanding what Actuator is

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.009
and what uses of it are.

9
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.009
Actuator itself provides insights

10
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.009
into your running applications.

11
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.001
It provides configuration settings

12
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.004
usually exposed through JMX for Java applications.

13
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.006
But they can also be exposed through the web.

14
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:41.001
Actuator allows you to monitor your running application

15
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.002
which in production is extremely important,

16
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.009
especially in dealing with a microservices architecture

17
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.003
where you have multiple components

18
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:51.004
that could be running at once.

19
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:54.009
Now, one of the main endpoints that you get with Actuator

20
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.004
is the health endpoint.

21
00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:02.001
It's a simple up/down status of the application itself.

22
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.003
It also could have an up/down status

23
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:09.001
of individual dependencies that the application relies on.

24
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.001
It's important to note

25
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:14.004
that the application's overall health status is only up

26
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:19.001
if all of the dependencies themselves are also up.

27
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.009
And this is a really great endpoint

28
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.003
especially in a Kubernetes world

29
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:26.003
where you're dealing with liveness and readiness checks.

30
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:29.002
Now there are several other endpoints within Actuator

31
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.001
that you get by just enabling it.

32
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:33.003
There's a beans endpoint

33
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:35.002
that gives you detailed information

34
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.007
about all of the beans within your Spring application.

35
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:40.003
There's an environment endpoint

36
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:43.002
that gives you all of the current environment variables

37
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.008
for your application.

38
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:47.000
There's an info endpoint

39
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.005
that allows you to put things like a git hash

40
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:53.009
or a common text into a value such that you can see it

41
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.006
from this endpoint on the web.

42
00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:59.000
And of course metrics, and you can expose metrics

43
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.007
in multiple ways through either JMX or the web

44
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:05.002
including detailed lists of those metrics.

45
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.000
Now there's a lot of other ones

46
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.004
and we're going to play with some of these

47
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:12.000
and see what is there in the next video.

48
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.006
Now there's a few other things to consider with Actuator

49
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:19.001
and those rely around security as well as customization.

50
00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:20.006
First of all, by default,

51
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:23.009
Actuator is relatively locked down and that's a good thing.

52
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.001
Most of this information can be great

53
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:28.005
for a bad actor to have.

54
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:30.006
But it also can be good for your operations team

55
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:35.001
so you have the ability to turn them on as you will.

56
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:36.004
One thing you need to make sure

57
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:39.007
is that your Actuator endpoints are not publicly available.

58
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:43.001
You need to block the mature load balancer or your gateway

59
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:45.008
or your edge so that they can't be seen

60
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:47.002
by the outside world.

61
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:49.006
And really you should restrict them internally

62
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:52.000
by using things like Spring Security

63
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.004
so that only authorized people can connect.

64
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:57.005
It's important to also only configure

65
00:02:57.005 --> 00:02:59.004
and turn on what you need.

66
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.007
You probably don't need the beans endpoint

67
00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:03.005
or the heap dump endpoint

68
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:05.007
when you're running your application in production

69
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:07.007
unless you're troubleshooting issues.

70
00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:10.007
And in those cases, you should only have certain people

71
00:03:10.007 --> 00:03:12.009
who know that they're there.

72
00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:15.009
Now, it is very customizable all the way down

73
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.009
to creating new endpoints.

74
00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.002
And those end points can be customized

75
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.005
with whatever data you want to show

76
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:24.000
in your running application.
