00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] There are many ways to start

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.006
a new Spring Boot project.

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.005
Most of the time I use a plugin

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.002
that's built into my IDE,

5
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:09.007
and Spring provides a plugin

6
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:13.001
for many IDEs in order to do this.

7
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.008
Now, this plugin ultimately is backed

8
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:17.005
by a web service that Spring provides.

9
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.009
That web service is also the backer

10
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.008
for a site that Spring maintains,

11
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:24.008
and this is by far the most common way

12
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:27.004
to start a new Spring Boot application

13
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:29.003
for those learning the framework.

14
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.001
So let's do just that.

15
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.003
The place that we will start is in our web browser,

16
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:40.008
and I want you to navigate to start.spring.io.

17
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:42.001
You will see that this will load

18
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.007
the Spring Initializr website.

19
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:47.000
This site will allow you to enter some details

20
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.004
about your application needs and generate a skeleton.

21
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:52.006
And we're going to do just that.

22
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.004
Now one thing to note is that this has changed

23
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:58.000
a few times over its life and will probably change again

24
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.006
between now and when you are watching it,

25
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.009
but the core functionality has never changed

26
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:04.008
since its introduction.

27
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.000
So the first thing that we're going to do is

28
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.006
we're going to select Maven project and Java as our language.

29
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.006
And I'm going to pick the latest version of Spring

30
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:15.008
that is not a snapshot, which in this case is 2.3.4.

31
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:18.005
Now, we're going to enter some project metadata.

32
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:19.009
So the first thing that I'm going to do is set

33
00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.001
a group of com.frankmoley.lil.sbet

34
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.001
for Spring Boot essential training.

35
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:29.003
And the artifact name

36
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.008
that I'm going to call this is booting-web.

37
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.006
If you scroll down here,

38
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:36.003
you'll see that there's a description and a package name.

39
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:38.008
And that package name becomes very important

40
00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:39.009
because you're going to see later

41
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.006
that an application class gets created there.

42
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.009
Now for packaging, we're going to select jar

43
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.005
and then Java 11 as our runtime.

44
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.003
Now we're going to come up here to dependencies

45
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:53.001
and we're only going to add one dependency for right now.

46
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.004
And that dependency that we are going to add is Web.

47
00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:56.006
So just type in web,

48
00:01:56.006 --> 00:02:01.004
it brings up Spring Web, select it, and now generate.

49
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:03.000
Now this is going to cause a zip

50
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.004
to be created and downloaded.

51
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:10.009
Now what I want you to do is to copy that zip file

52
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.004
to wherever your working directory is,

53
00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:14.006
whether you're working from the exercise files or wherever.

54
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:19.009
So I'm just going to do a cp from the downloads directory

55
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.001
and it will be called booting-web.zip.

56
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:26.008
And I'm going to copy that here to my local directory,

57
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:30.002
and then I'm going to unzip it.

58
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:35.003
And now I'm going to remove the file itself.

59
00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:39.003
Excellent, so now I can import this into my IDE.

60
00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:41.008
So I've got my IDE here.

61
00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:44.009
Let me go to my modules.

62
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:46.004
Let me select my modules,

63
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:55.007
and let me import this as a module.

64
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:59.007
We're going to select Maven as the import.

65
00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:02.005
And we will hit OK.

66
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:06.006
Okay, we will allow Maven to do its import,

67
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.001
and we're going to make this relatively simple.

68
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:10.008
We're going to open up this package

69
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:15.006
and go to source, main, resources.

70
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:16.007
And in the static directory,

71
00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:23.008
we're going to create a file called index.html.

72
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:28.008
And all we are going to do here is put an html tag

73
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:32.001
and a body tag,

74
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.005
and a h1 tag that says,

75
00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:41.004
"Hello LinkedIn Learning."

76
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:45.005
And now we will go to our main boot application

77
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:47.009
and run that application.

78
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.000
So we're just going to run the main method.

79
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Now we'll explain all of this in later videos,

80
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.004
so don't worry,

81
00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:56.003
but you will notice here that we have a message

82
00:03:56.003 --> 00:04:00.005
second to the bottom that says Tomcat started on port 8080.

83
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.003
So let's jump back to our web browser

84
00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:07.006
and let's go to localhost:8080,

85
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:09.004
and you'll see that we served the webpage

86
00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:11.001
from our application.

87
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.002
And that's as simple as you can get it.

88
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:14.006
We created a web application

89
00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:17.009
and started it up in a matter of minutes using Spring Boot,

90
00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.000
and the start.spring.io website.
