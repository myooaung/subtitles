00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] There's a construct from Spring Data

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.001
that we didn't discuss in either the web services

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.002
or the data conversations,

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:10.007
but if you are writing a lot of simple data web services,

5
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:12.006
they can prove to be really quick

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.009
at getting things up and operational.

7
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.009
This construct is called Spring Data REST Repositories.

8
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.006
Now we're not going to go too deep into them,

9
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:25.007
instead just showing them because they are worth seeing.

10
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.009
So I want you to navigate to your web application

11
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.002
and we're going to go to the room-web-app.

12
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.004
Let's open up the POM file

13
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.005
and let's add another dependency,

14
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:44.003
and this one is spring-boot-starter-data-rest

15
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.000
from org.springframework.boot.

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.004
We'll run Maven.

17
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:50.008
Now, once that is done,

18
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.007
let's go to Source Main, Resources,

19
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:57.009
and open up our application.properties file.

20
00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:59.000
We're going to put in a value here,

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.007
spring.data.rest.base-path,

22
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:06.000
and we're going to set it equal to api/rest.

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.009
This way we can differentiate between

24
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.006
the other web services that we've already created.

25
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:14.008
Lett's also go to Source Main, Java Config,

26
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:18.004
and let's go to our Security context,

27
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:26.007
and we will add api/rest/star.

28
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:27.007
Even though technically,

29
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:29.004
this would fall under the previous one,

30
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:30.009
I like to put them in there

31
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.000
just because I want to make sure that this is exposed.

32
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.007
Now, that's all we have to do.

33
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:42.000
Let's go ahead and start up this application.

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.004
We're going to go to a terminal

35
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:46.004
and I'm going to use my HTTP utility.

36
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:48.003
We're going to go to 8080,

37
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:52.004
and let's start by going to api/rooms.

38
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:54.009
You'll see that the rooms populate.

39
00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:02.003
However, we also can go to api/rest/rooms

40
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:04.006
and you will see we get a different representation

41
00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:05.006
of the data.

42
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:10.001
And this is using HATEOAS along with the REST repository.

43
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:11.009
Because we have repositories,

44
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.001
we automatically get this data service

45
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:19.008
that exposes raw data repositories as services.

46
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:23.008
And you'll see, we also can go to

47
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:28.000
staffMembers and we get the data there.

48
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.002
Now you may remember,

49
00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:32.002
this isn't what we called this in the actual raw API.

50
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:34.005
We just called it staff.

51
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:36.006
It's looking at the repository name

52
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:39.004
in order to generate that end point.

53
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.003
Now obviously, you can customize that,

54
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:43.001
as you can with all of Spring,

55
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:45.000
but this gives you just a very quick way

56
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.007
if all you're doing is writing some data services

57
00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:49.008
that you want to be able to expose

58
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:53.002
through a web service API without doing a lot of work.

59
00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:55.003
Of course, you are getting HATEOAS as well,

60
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:57.008
and some web developers really like to have that

61
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:00.000
if they're writing React components.
