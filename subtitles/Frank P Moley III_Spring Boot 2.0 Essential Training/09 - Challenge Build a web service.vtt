00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:07.001
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:07.009
- [Instructor] And this takes us

3
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.009
to our second challenge exercise of this course,

4
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.004
building a web service.

5
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.009
So some of the criteria here for building this web service.

6
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.002
You're going to build a web service for the staff elements

7
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:22.002
just like we did for the rooms

8
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:25.004
and that staff element service already exists for you

9
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.008
based on the glass challenge exercise.

10
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.003
You're going to use that existing service,

11
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:31.004
you're going to serve data.

12
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:32.008
That's all there is to it.

13
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:35.002
It's a simple method in the controller.

14
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.000
Have at it and I'll see you back here in a few.
