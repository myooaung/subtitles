00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.008
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.008
- [Narrator] This brings us to our first challenge

3
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.004
exercise for the course.

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.001
I'm going to have you build another webpage

5
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.000
for our application.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.006
You are going to be asked to build a simple webpage

7
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.008
for our hotel that shows the staff.

8
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.004
The staff view will be a way to see all staff,

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.007
their positions, and their employee number.

10
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.007
The view can be a simple table

11
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.009
or you can do more if you choose.

12
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.007
Once again we're going to create some mock data elements

13
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.001
like we did with rooms.

14
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:39.000
Eventually we're going to wire all of this into a database.

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.002
The elements for our staff will be employee number

16
00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:45.007
which should be a string representation of a GUID,

17
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:48.006
first name, last name and position

18
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:52.000
like housekeeping security, front desk, et cetera.

19
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.002
Take a look in the bin folder in the data that sequel file

20
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:58.004
and you will see what those elements need to be

21
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.000
for the position.
