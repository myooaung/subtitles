2
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.002
- [Instructor] Now it's time for another challenge exercise.

3
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:13.006
This time, building a repository.

4
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:15.003
So in order to build a repository,

5
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:18.000
there's a few things that I need you to do.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.009
So first of all,

7
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.006
build a repository for the employees or the staff.

8
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.005
I want you to wire it into the application.

9
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:29.000
So everywhere we were using the default mock data

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.004
I want you to now start using the database.

11
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.001
And I want you to take note of one thing specifically,

12
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.003
and that's the enumeration.

13
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.007
There's an annotation for it called @Enumerated

14
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.008
and you can use a string option

15
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.000
so that the enumeration actually gets stored

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.004
in the database.

17
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.001
Likewise, when it reads the enumeration from the database,

18
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:53.000
it will convert it into the Enum in Java.

19
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.008
And with that, you're on your own.

20
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:57.000
And I'll see you back with my solution.
