- [Instructor] Building web applications

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:04.009
is probably the most common use of Spring Boot,

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.004
at least at the very beginning.

4
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.008
And that's where we're going to start with our project

5
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.004
as we actually do some building.

6
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.007
Spring Boot's web applications are based on

7
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.001
the Spring MVC pattern.

8
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.009
Now Spring Boot provides default configurations

9
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.003
for Spring MVC.

10
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.001
The paradigm for Spring MVC is based on

11
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.009
the Model-View-Controller design pattern.

12
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.008
And when you bring a template engine into your project

13
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:34.003
you're also going to get all of the view resolvers needed

14
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:37.004
in order to move away from traditional JSP

15
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.009
and into more modern template engines.

16
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.006
You're also going to get some static file resolvers.

17
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:45.006
And we've already seen one of those in the way

18
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:50.007
that we did the index.HTML page in the last chapter.

19
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:54.003
But in addition to a traditional index.HTML,

20
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.002
you're also going to get access to CSS and JavaScript

21
00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:58.004
through the static folder.

22
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:01.001
And really anything that you put in the static folder

23
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.009
can be served statically.

24
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.006
So let's take a look at building

25
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:09.006
a web-based application with Spring Boot.

26
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.006
We're going to walk through building an application

27
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:13.002
in the next couple of videos.

28
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:14.006
So as such, I want to start

29
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:17.007
with some basic high-level steps.

30
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:21.005
First and foremost, you need a project to start with.

31
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:25.003
Then you need to define and create your view.

32
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:28.001
Oftentimes, views come from designers,

33
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.000
or at least wireframes, so many times

34
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that's where we also need to start.

35
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.007
Then you need to define the model or models

36
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:40.001
that will be used to serve your view.

37
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:44.001
Very seldom will you have a single object for a webpage.

38
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:47.009
Often you will reuse objects across different models,

39
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.001
so consider that in your design.

40
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.004
Finally, you need to add a controller.

41
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:56.009
And the controller will be used to wire the view

42
00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.000
and its model and serve it through the templating engine.
