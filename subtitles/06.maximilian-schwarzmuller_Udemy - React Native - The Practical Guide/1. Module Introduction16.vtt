00:02.480 --> 00:06.600
Welcome to this module, our application clearly is taking shape

00:06.800 --> 00:09.800
but right now we're not doing anything with that user input,

00:09.800 --> 00:13.510
we don't even care if the user enters something on the authentication screen,

00:13.550 --> 00:17.770
leave alone that we would validate it or do anything about that.

00:17.780 --> 00:20.180
So that's what we'll do in this module,

00:20.450 --> 00:28.460
to be precise, we'll have a look at how we can dynamically render text inputs and forms in react native

00:28.460 --> 00:29.060
apps,

00:29.260 --> 00:34.880
we'll then have a look at how we can handle the user input which means how we can get it, use it, validate it,

00:34.940 --> 00:41.390
all these things and also make sure that we only proceed if it's valid and we'll also have a look at

00:41.450 --> 00:46.940
the soft keyboard and how we can handle that correctly so that it disappears

00:46.940 --> 00:52.970
when we want it to disappear and so on. Let's have a look at all these features in this module.
