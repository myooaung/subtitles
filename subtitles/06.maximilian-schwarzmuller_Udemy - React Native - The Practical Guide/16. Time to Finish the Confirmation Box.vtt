00:02.310 --> 00:08.400
It's of course up to you how you want us styled as confirm text here or actually should not just be

00:08.400 --> 00:15.630
text it should be a view with the text in there which outputs our number and then a button to start

00:15.630 --> 00:21.780
the game and you can definitely pass the video at this point and come up with your own styling there

00:21.780 --> 00:23.050
your own layout.

00:23.100 --> 00:27.510
I have a certain layout in mind which certainly will differ from yours but there is no wrong or right

00:27.510 --> 00:32.430
decision here so definitely take this as another chance to come up with your own layout for this and

00:32.430 --> 00:36.990
a button that right now doesn't do anything but that is stare which would allow the user to start the

00:36.990 --> 00:42.520
game and after a short pause which you can use to pass the video I'll implement my solution to get rid

00:42.520 --> 00:45.370
with you.

00:45.420 --> 00:49.020
So here's how I think that this would look nice.

00:49.050 --> 00:55.640
I want to have a view so that I can set up a general container around that or actually maybe not a view.

00:55.650 --> 00:57.720
But why don't we use our card here.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.680
That sounds like a good idea.

00:59.730 --> 01:04.980
Now that card if we have a look at it doesn't have a margin and I want to have some spacing between

01:04.980 --> 01:07.950
that card at the top and my summary card.

01:08.070 --> 01:15.540
So therefore here I'll give this a separate style here in my style sheet in the start game screen.

01:15.540 --> 01:21.570
I'll name this summary container name as always is up to you and I want to have a margin to the top

01:21.570 --> 01:35.400
of let's say 20 some some nice spacing here and add this why I installed prob to the card here and in

01:35.400 --> 01:44.710
there I want to say you select it and then in a new line outputs the number in a in a nicely percent

01:44.710 --> 01:51.160
that way maybe the number and kind of a box with a separate border with rounded corners so that it's

01:51.310 --> 01:56.740
clearly visible or all the bigger than the average text and therefore here I'll add a view with a text

01:56.740 --> 02:04.070
in there and in that text I'll have to select that number but now that view and the text should get

02:04.620 --> 02:11.030
a special styling and since I plan on reusing that I'll actually grab it and outsource it into a new

02:11.030 --> 02:12.690
component and I'll name it.

02:12.800 --> 02:24.080
No container in this component I'll import react from react and import view and text from React Native

02:25.300 --> 02:33.850
and then half the number container component here export default number or container and of course we'll

02:34.090 --> 02:41.880
all need establishes here so let's set up a style sheet as well with style sheet creates down there

02:42.360 --> 02:49.320
and then in this component all returned is the new thing here with the selected number which now however

02:49.530 --> 02:55.140
has to be passed in and I expected to get to get it between the opening and closing tax of melon component

02:55.320 --> 02:57.800
with the help of props children.

02:57.870 --> 03:02.270
Now this container of course is something you can freely configure.

03:02.370 --> 03:11.590
I'll add just a container style container name here where I think a border with of two might look good.

03:11.650 --> 03:20.650
So a little bit of a broader wider border a border color where I actually want you as my primary color

03:20.680 --> 03:23.670
or my accent color will see which one looks better.

03:23.770 --> 03:33.400
So let's import colors from constants colors and for the border of color then use colors accent for

03:33.400 --> 03:39.670
now and see how that looks like some padding so that the number is not directly on the edges of that

03:39.670 --> 03:42.070
surrounding box.

03:42.080 --> 03:49.630
Doesn't sits directly next to the border a border radius of tend to have some rounded borders as I'm

03:49.630 --> 03:50.440
rounded corners.

03:50.440 --> 03:56.940
Excuse me by the way if you would want to target individual corners you could do so with border.

03:57.120 --> 04:06.780
Top left radio's top right radio's top end and top start also takes the user's settings regarding if

04:06.780 --> 04:13.980
it's a left right or right left language into account so you can target all single corners as well or

04:13.980 --> 04:22.820
set a radius for all corners with border radius and also add a little margin here margin vertical of

04:23.340 --> 04:32.120
of 10 maybe to have some spacing at the top at bottom around of this container here and all important

04:32.300 --> 04:40.340
centered text in there with a line item center and justify content center taking advantage of that flex

04:40.340 --> 04:48.740
box behavior and with that I also want to give the number itself so to text a certain style and that

04:48.740 --> 04:57.230
style is that I give the color also the text also debt X and color and I want to use a font size of

04:57.230 --> 05:04.280
22 to have to really stand out and later will also use a custom fund and then this review here gets

05:04.280 --> 05:13.830
the container style and the text here of course receives D No style with Def set up we can use the number

05:13.830 --> 05:19.740
of container into start game screen so there we simply add that import and what we're doing here is

05:19.740 --> 05:25.000
pretty normal that you have multiple components of which you compose your application.

05:25.160 --> 05:31.560
So now we can use the number container in the Star game screen component added here below this text

05:32.010 --> 05:38.160
and in the number container we get the content here with props children we output it with props children

05:38.220 --> 05:41.190
that means we have to pass it between the opening closing tax.

05:41.250 --> 05:44.370
So here we forward the selected number.

05:44.580 --> 05:48.710
Now that's just my suggestion for how we could style this but I like the style.

05:48.900 --> 05:54.630
And then for the moment I'll add a button here which is a self closing tag though the built in button

05:55.080 --> 06:02.890
with the title of start game all caps to make it really stand out and save this.

06:02.940 --> 06:08.820
And now if we choose a number here this is what we get and it doesn't look too ugly I'd say Still there

06:08.820 --> 06:15.060
are two things which I want to change this text here should be centered and this box with the number

06:15.330 --> 06:22.120
should not be as wide as the surrounding box but be only as wide as the number needs it to be.

06:22.860 --> 06:30.260
Now to make both work I'll go to my card which holds all the content here and with that I mean I go

06:30.260 --> 06:33.900
to the style in the start games screen which also use on the card.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.480
That's my summary container.

06:35.750 --> 06:45.400
And there we can align these items in there to be centered instead of using the default which would

06:45.400 --> 06:52.280
be stretch and now this is automatically centered and the box is only as wide as the number requires

06:52.280 --> 06:54.610
that to be.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.360
Now that doesn't look too shabby.

06:57.370 --> 07:03.160
One last thing which I just noticed is also that when we confirm an input I always once to a keyboard

07:03.190 --> 07:09.940
API to dismiss the keyboard so that as soon as we press confirm here we also close to keyboard.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.220
And now we have a nice output here.

07:12.220 --> 07:16.180
Now with that we have a solid base look I'd say we can pick a number.

07:16.180 --> 07:22.210
We're doing some rough validation to make sure that we have a valid number and the next step is that

07:22.210 --> 07:28.540
we make this start game back to work and we swap what we see on the screen here for our the game is

07:28.540 --> 07:34.540
running screen where the computer is now making guesses and we then make sure we give the user a chance

07:34.540 --> 07:37.850
of telling if the numbers should be greater or lower.

07:37.990 --> 07:41.770
And we then at some point are finished and show a game over a screen.
