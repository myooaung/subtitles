00:02.560 --> 00:05.290
Now that we're able to reset everything here

00:05.290 --> 00:10.710
once we created something, it would be nice if we could also fix find places to make sure that

00:10.750 --> 00:13.080
when we add a new place here,

00:13.180 --> 00:17.880
it also shows up here even if we have visited this page before.

00:17.950 --> 00:20.490
The reason why it's not showing up right now is that

00:20.500 --> 00:24.990
if we have a look at find place, we load the places in componentDidMount

00:25.060 --> 00:28.580
and as mentioned multiple times now, this is not executed

00:28.630 --> 00:31.970
if we visit this page, it wasn't destroyed in between,

00:32.110 --> 00:35.890
so we never load new pages, new places excuse me.

00:36.220 --> 00:38.050
Well the way to fix it is simple,

00:38.170 --> 00:44.500
we can use the same approach we just used in share place, we can listen to the will appear event here

00:45.190 --> 00:51.010
on the react native navigation and we already have everything set up to listen to navigator events.

00:51.010 --> 00:57.010
This method will be executed once one occurs and there I get my code from before with will appear,

00:57.010 --> 01:03.800
I just don't call props on start add place but this props on load places.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.270
Now I can remove componentDidMount and if I save this with this tiny change, so moving this into this

01:10.270 --> 01:17.990
will appear method or will appear lifecycle hook or event, just with this change if I now reload my app,

01:18.390 --> 01:23.590
let's find the places and you see we get a couple of places, the last one is FDS here.

01:23.770 --> 01:33.370
So now if I add a new place here, let's use this one with the plants here, now if I locate myself and

01:33.370 --> 01:37.730
say a new place with multiple exclamation marks so that we recognize it,

01:37.810 --> 01:48.300
if I now shared this place here and wait for this to finish, we see the new place here too. As a side note

01:48.310 --> 01:58.900
you can also pick an image here of course, do something, locate yourself, test, share the place and navigate

01:58.950 --> 02:05.010
away whilst this is loading and go back and go back here and you will also see it.

02:05.410 --> 02:12.140
So this is now working, now we're really reloading the places even if we did visit this page before,

02:12.140 --> 02:13.850
this is how simple it is.

02:13.900 --> 02:22.120
Now of course you could also use this to reset state of data loaded to show this button again and

02:22.440 --> 02:24.600
to always have that animation again,

02:24.610 --> 02:31.340
so you could say this set state and set

02:31.550 --> 02:34.720
what do we have here, places loaded

02:37.570 --> 02:39.430
to false.

02:39.490 --> 02:46.090
If you do this here, now you have a different behavior even, we can reload this page, find our places of

02:46.090 --> 02:53.400
course, create a new place and once it's finished, you can again press this button.

02:53.490 --> 02:57.910
This might be annoying though, you maybe don't always want to just go back to this state,

02:57.990 --> 03:00.720
so I will actually uncomment this

03:00.930 --> 03:02.510
but you can use it.
