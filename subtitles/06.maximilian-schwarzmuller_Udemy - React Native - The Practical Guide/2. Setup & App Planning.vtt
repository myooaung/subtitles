00:02.180 --> 00:07.730
Now to get started I again have teh app running on an android and an Iowa simulator.

00:07.730 --> 00:13.820
It's my default starting app and again attached you find debt starting Project which you can work with.

00:13.830 --> 00:16.820
You have to same starting setup as I do.

00:16.940 --> 00:24.060
For me it's Justin you React Native project created with Expo and this is the project will build upon.

00:24.200 --> 00:30.740
Now the important question of course is which kind of app do we build here what is the goal of this

00:30.740 --> 00:38.240
module in this module we're going to build an application where I want to have a little header at the

00:38.240 --> 00:48.380
top so a little bar at the top which simply displays the title which is guess a number because we'll

00:48.380 --> 00:54.620
build an application where you enter a number in the computer the app will try to guess it and therefore

00:54.620 --> 01:02.360
we'll have a starting screen where you have input for your number which the user of the app can enter

01:02.960 --> 01:12.010
and then of course will have two buttons basically a confirmed button here and a reset button here.

01:12.080 --> 01:18.770
So two buttons that allow us to control that input then a button to basically start the game.

01:18.770 --> 01:25.460
So once you chose a number which basically loads a different screen you could say which still has our

01:25.460 --> 01:33.240
title at the top but where now the computer will output I guess let's say 63 initially.

01:33.290 --> 01:38.720
So that's guests from the computer which you kind of output in a nice way here and then you have to

01:38.720 --> 01:46.370
tell whatever the actual number is lower or greater than what the computer a guest here.

01:46.370 --> 01:48.710
So you've got two buttons to control this.

01:48.740 --> 01:52.910
We want to show an alert if you give the user a wrong hint.

01:52.940 --> 01:58.280
So if your number is lower and you say greater then I want to show an alert where we say something like

01:58.310 --> 02:00.190
Don't cheat anything like that.

02:00.260 --> 02:05.660
So little check in there and one stick of Utah guessed the right number.

02:05.660 --> 02:12.980
So once the game is over basically we'll have a game over screen here where we say something like game

02:13.460 --> 02:19.760
over where I then went to output a image here maybe such around that image like I like it some some

02:19.760 --> 02:26.810
goal image a summit something like this and below that will output some info text like the computer

02:27.020 --> 02:31.820
guessed your number 15 in 10 guesses.

02:31.820 --> 02:39.440
So basically a summary and also a button to basically restart and play on you round with a new number.

02:39.440 --> 02:46.130
So the nice thing about this application is that was it of course isn't overly complex.

02:46.140 --> 02:52.220
There aren't tens of thousands of screens involved but while it's status the case we have a lot of different

02:52.220 --> 02:58.970
components which we also can style and layout we use the image we'll use our own custom funds and we

02:58.970 --> 03:05.960
have also quite a bit of business logic in there to control the guessing to check whether the correct

03:05.960 --> 03:12.800
number was guessed and so on so it's a really nice app a real nice second step which will make sure

03:12.800 --> 03:18.910
that all the basics are super clear and set after this module so that you are more than well-prepared

03:19.010 --> 03:22.730
for more advanced applications after this great application here.
