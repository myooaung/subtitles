WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:08.220
So now with that image added and now we're already working on the game over screen here.

00:08.230 --> 00:11.280
Let's find you in this text we see here at the bottom.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.640
Let's make it a little bit nicer a little bit more beautiful.

00:15.760 --> 00:21.400
And in addition before I do that I'll actually switch back from using the network image to the local

00:21.400 --> 00:24.850
image but that is of course totally up to you what you prefer there.

00:24.850 --> 00:29.890
So I want to work on a text here and instead of just having this kind of tabular text here which just

00:29.930 --> 00:32.560
would put some information in a boring way.

00:32.560 --> 00:37.460
Why don't we percenters in a while in a nicer wait in detail.

00:37.600 --> 00:43.030
I think it would be nicer if we had some human readable text here so a real sentence which we can read

00:43.400 --> 00:52.720
so dear we could say your phone needed and then here we have the number of rounds rounds to guest number.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.140
And that here will would enter the number.

00:55.240 --> 00:59.810
So the number of courses props user number and again can get rid of this line now.

00:59.950 --> 01:05.260
But I don't just want to output props used a number like this instead I want to highlighted I want to

01:05.260 --> 01:11.680
give it a special color that's different from the the opera color here and the same here for these the

01:11.690 --> 01:19.480
rounds so the props round number of value would be nice if Dad would also be colored differently now

01:19.480 --> 01:28.150
to color that differently we can actually wrap this into another text note here so you can have text

01:28.150 --> 01:32.920
notes text components inside of text instead of other text components.

01:32.920 --> 01:36.820
So that is possible just like that.

01:36.820 --> 01:38.970
Now that's really important to understand.

01:38.970 --> 01:45.790
You can nest text components into our text components and keep in mind that body text in the end is

01:45.790 --> 01:51.080
just a text component body text is a component that simply returns to build and text component.

01:51.160 --> 01:57.100
So anything we enter between body text is the same as if we would enter it between the built in text

01:57.100 --> 02:03.430
component components and therefore we can have nested text in there and we can theoretically also have

02:03.430 --> 02:08.800
nested views in there but there are some caveats to that and therefore if you don't absolutely have

02:08.800 --> 02:14.370
a strong reason for why you would need a view in there you shouldn't really nest views into text and

02:14.370 --> 02:20.020
the rally is a reason to do that text inside of text however can make a lot of sense because it allows

02:20.020 --> 02:25.310
you to style parts of a text differently than the rest of the text.

02:25.360 --> 02:32.970
So here for example I want to add style with style start highlight at the same year for the second text

02:33.210 --> 02:40.170
to well highlight this part of the text and now of course we can add highlight down there in our style

02:40.170 --> 02:48.510
sheet in the game over screen highlight and there for example give us a color where we use colors and

02:48.530 --> 02:55.010
for Dad we need to add to import where we import colors from constants colors and then maybe use our

02:55.010 --> 03:02.420
primary colored air so colors thought primary if we do that what you'll see is that now this is highlighted

03:03.440 --> 03:09.350
now all do something interesting if I temporarily go to the body text and I changed it to open Sands

03:09.350 --> 03:10.210
bold here.

03:10.490 --> 03:17.150
So I used the bold version you'll see that even that highlighted text is still bold might be a bit hard

03:17.150 --> 03:23.570
to see but this is actually bold and that is very interesting because earlier in the course I mentioned

03:23.870 --> 03:30.860
that your styles wouldn't inherit so that if you for example in the game over screen set a font family

03:30.860 --> 03:39.170
here on your screen style which is applied to the view that wraps everything dad font family would not

03:39.470 --> 03:42.970
be passed down to components nested inside of that view.

03:42.980 --> 03:48.490
So just because you set a style here on this view doesn't mean that all our views in there or all of

03:48.490 --> 03:54.080
the texts in there whatever it is get the same style the styles you apply to a component always are

03:54.080 --> 04:00.780
just applied to that component and not too nested components and yet it's different for the text.

04:00.780 --> 04:09.050
There is text here to highlight a text which has nested inside of the body text also gets this bold

04:09.260 --> 04:10.160
family.

04:10.250 --> 04:16.550
If we change it on the body text and that is simply important difference we act native has four text

04:16.580 --> 04:17.720
components.

04:17.720 --> 04:23.900
If you add style there the style is passed down to nested text components.

04:23.900 --> 04:29.750
That's one exception wrecked native has text instead of text receives the style to find on the outer

04:29.750 --> 04:37.610
text so any style you set up on the body text here is automatically received by the nested text components.

04:37.680 --> 04:43.800
There is one additional important behavior regarding the text component and react native and that is

04:43.800 --> 04:47.370
that it's not using flex box the view uses flex blocks.

04:47.370 --> 04:52.110
The text component of course doesn't and I mentioned this before that the view component uses flex box

04:52.320 --> 05:00.180
not text or Arrow components but text uses its own positioning system where it automatically wraps itself

05:00.210 --> 05:05.580
into a new line if it doesn't fit into one line and to demonstrate this.

05:05.580 --> 05:12.810
We could go here to the game over screen and wrap our entire textured bottom into another view so take

05:12.810 --> 05:21.180
that body text and added here into this view and there add a style of let's say name ID result text

05:21.210 --> 05:28.080
whatever you want to name this or result container to be more in line with the other style names.

05:28.170 --> 05:30.410
So result container is added to the view.

05:30.570 --> 05:38.300
And now if I add this year anywhere here in my style sheet and I give this a width of let's say 80 percent

05:38.550 --> 05:42.420
which makes sense so that the text has a bit more distance to the left and right.

05:42.480 --> 05:49.980
Or alternatively I add a margin horizontal of let's say 20 to have some spacing left and right around

05:49.980 --> 05:55.980
the container then you see the text is indeed wrapped into a new line and that's all the default behavior

05:55.980 --> 05:58.410
of the text component and react native.

05:58.410 --> 06:05.700
Not only does it parse stylus down to nested text it also has its own positioning system where its own

06:05.700 --> 06:10.950
layout system where text automatically wraps itself into a new line.

06:11.040 --> 06:16.830
If it doesn't fit in wanted the same line and that of course makes a lot of sense that typically is

06:17.070 --> 06:24.920
what you want on your text you want it to wrap in two new lines now with that I'll revert the setting

06:24.920 --> 06:25.880
on the body text.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.190
I'll actually not use open sensible there.

06:28.310 --> 06:34.530
I just use open sands but I wanted to show this style inheritance thing and all is of course in general.

06:34.580 --> 06:38.960
Let you know how text behaves regarding the way its layout.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.450
All that being said about the text were not done though.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.730
I don't think that looks that nice.

06:43.760 --> 06:49.860
Instead on the game over screen does highlight that text maybe should be bold so I'll use a font family

06:50.100 --> 06:55.400
of open sense bold here so that this really stands out and is easier to see.

06:55.670 --> 07:02.930
And in addition I'll actually also add a marginal recent low 30 year to have a bit more spacing left

07:02.930 --> 07:04.640
to right around the text.

07:04.640 --> 07:10.490
Now in addition I also want to make sure though that the text is centered so that if we have a line

07:10.490 --> 07:17.090
break it's all centered in the middle and we don't start on the left edge again and this cannot be achieved

07:17.090 --> 07:19.010
with a special styling property.

07:19.010 --> 07:21.760
You can add on text components and that's D.

07:21.790 --> 07:24.770
Text align property.

07:25.070 --> 07:29.210
The thing just as I don't want to use this on the highlighted text I want to use that on the overall

07:29.210 --> 07:34.990
body text and therefore we need to add a style here maybe result.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.460
Text is a fitting name here since this is our text overall.

07:38.660 --> 07:40.760
And then here we can just add result

07:44.450 --> 07:45.400
and on that result.

07:45.410 --> 07:49.150
Text set text align to center.

07:49.220 --> 07:56.570
However if I safeties it doesn't have an effect because our body text is not configured to tag style

07:56.630 --> 08:02.660
the style prop we might add to it into account in body text the only style is set to the text is to

08:02.660 --> 08:04.660
internally Define style.

08:04.670 --> 08:09.080
Now we learned how to change this however we simply pass a object here to style.

08:09.080 --> 08:16.170
Take all our custom style properties from this file and distribute them into this object and merged

08:16.170 --> 08:20.670
it with whatever we're getting on props style by using the spread operator.

08:20.670 --> 08:22.930
Here to end with Dad.

08:22.940 --> 08:28.370
Now if we save this we see that this is now nicely centered and this is certainly a bit nicer to read

08:28.550 --> 08:30.490
than it was before I'd say.

08:30.680 --> 08:37.070
Now with Dad we're almost done with styling this text the last thing I think looks nice here is that

08:37.070 --> 08:41.490
if on the result text we all the bump up the font size a little bit.

08:41.570 --> 08:47.990
So if we set font size here two to 20 maybe some really big and on the assault container.

08:47.990 --> 08:55.700
I also want to have a margin vertical of 15 maybe to have some spacing on top and bottom around the

08:55.700 --> 08:57.180
text as well.

08:57.320 --> 09:02.240
And now with that we have a game over screen which in my opinion doesn't look too bad and you'll learn

09:02.240 --> 09:07.520
a lot about how text works and how you can work with the text component and react native.
