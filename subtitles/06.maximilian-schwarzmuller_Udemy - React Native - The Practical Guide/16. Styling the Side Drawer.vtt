WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:04.140
So let's work on that side

00:04.190 --> 00:08.110
drawer, the side drawer has its own component, here

00:08.140 --> 00:13.180
the side drawer component, we get some basic styling for this container

00:13.490 --> 00:16.960
but now I want to style the side drawer item here.

00:17.090 --> 00:19.430
First of all it should be touchable,

00:19.430 --> 00:26.420
so I need to import touchable something and I'll use touchable opacity, I like that the most.

00:26.900 --> 00:35.280
So I'll add this as a component, touchable opacity and I'll actually wrap a view with it because a view can

00:35.280 --> 00:39.230
be styled, text has very limited styling capabilities,

00:39.970 --> 00:46.550
touchable opacity also closes this and let's move the text inside the view.

00:46.580 --> 00:54.110
Now as a text, I'll say sign out because it should allow the user to guess what, sign out

00:54.310 --> 00:59.190
and I want to use a fitting icon next to it. For that on the ionicons page,

00:59.200 --> 01:02.030
I'm going to search for one, search for log out,

01:03.610 --> 01:07.540
sign out here

01:08.300 --> 01:12.930
and let's use this one here, ios-log-out

01:16.420 --> 01:25.570
and you learned how to add an icon, we just import icon from react-native-vector-icons/ionicons

01:25.570 --> 01:28.540
because that's the font we imported

01:29.810 --> 01:31.560
and now I'm going to add this

01:31.610 --> 01:36.540
icon component here, set a name which is the name I just copied,

01:36.590 --> 01:45.700
set a size so I'm going to go with good old 30 pixels and set a color, maybe a dark gray-ish

01:45.710 --> 01:48.800
look with #bbb.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.980
Let's save that and let's view our result,

01:52.310 --> 01:55.520
here's the icon, looks the way I want it to look,

01:55.520 --> 02:03.970
could be a bit darker even so like maybe #aaa. So it looks good but it's not the same line as the text

02:04.000 --> 02:06.940
and overall, this doesn't look the way I want it to look.

02:07.030 --> 02:10.980
So we need to style this view which holds both icon and text,

02:11.320 --> 02:11.910
we want to 

02:11.970 --> 02:17.740
add icon and text the same line and the view uses flex box, so how could we do that?

02:18.890 --> 02:25.770
Well let's first of all create a new property in our stylesheet, I'll name it drawer item because it's

02:25.770 --> 02:31.860
for one item in the drawer and first of all, I'm going to set the flex direction to row because I want

02:31.860 --> 02:37.650
to have these two items next to each other, so I should change it from column which positions them above

02:37.650 --> 02:39.670
each other to row,

02:40.200 --> 02:42.400
let's now bind these to styles

02:43.310 --> 02:50.240
drawer item. With that if we save this and we go back, we immediately see that they're positioned next

02:50.240 --> 02:51.380
to each other,

02:51.380 --> 02:54.500
now vertical alignment would be nice,

02:54.500 --> 02:59.760
so since our main axis now is from left to right, we have to change to cross axis,

02:59.870 --> 03:08.600
so align items should be set to center, that will position them on the center vertically. Now

03:08.660 --> 03:11.960
some spacing would be nice too,

03:11.980 --> 03:15.630
so maybe we add justify content

03:16.630 --> 03:23.020
and set it to space around which leaves some space between the items. Here, they are spacing around but they're taking

03:23.020 --> 03:24.540
a little bit too much width

03:24.540 --> 03:26.350
for my taste,

03:26.380 --> 03:32.290
so maybe we stick to the default which is flex start and instead, we add some margin to the icon and

03:32.290 --> 03:34.170
the text.

03:34.250 --> 03:43.110
So I'm going to add a drawer item icon here and simply add margin right 10 pixels, let's assign the drawer

03:43.120 --> 03:47.320
item icon property here to the drawer,

03:47.390 --> 03:52.640
so let's add style here, styles drawer item

03:52.790 --> 03:56.170
icon, so this line here was added.

03:56.490 --> 03:58.700
Let's save this,

03:58.830 --> 04:00.620
now this looks good.

04:00.620 --> 04:08.470
Now on the drawer item, I also want to have some padding, maybe 10 in all directions so that it doesn't

04:08.470 --> 04:10.080
sit directly on the edge

04:10.750 --> 04:22.350
and then maybe some background so that we add a background color of let's say light gray, this looks

04:22.350 --> 04:23.090
pretty good.

04:24.910 --> 04:28.570
Now I just want to have a little bit more spacing to the top of the drawer

04:29.990 --> 04:32.330
but I also don't want to center it in the middle,

04:32.330 --> 04:40.250
so what I'll do is just increase the padding top of the drawer container to maybe 30 to push it down

04:40.460 --> 04:43.140
a little bit further,

04:43.400 --> 04:47.250
let's maybe go with 50, yeah

04:47.270 --> 04:47.990
that looks good.

04:48.110 --> 04:49.040
So now we can click this,

04:49.040 --> 04:50.640
we got our drawer here,

04:50.810 --> 04:52.820
also on Android it's looking good.

04:52.990 --> 04:59.180
So now we have that sign out button here in place which will come into effect later. With that, the drawer

04:59.180 --> 05:00.030
is finished,

05:00.080 --> 05:00.560
whew,

05:00.590 --> 05:01.890
was a lot of styling.

05:02.120 --> 05:07.990
Now let's see what we can do to adjust our styles for different platforms and dimensions.
