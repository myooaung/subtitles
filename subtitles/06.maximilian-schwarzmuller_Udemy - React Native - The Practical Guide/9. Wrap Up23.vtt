00:02.270 --> 00:08.150
So now we had a detailed look at the React Native debugging experience at the React Native debugger

00:08.150 --> 00:15.260
at the different tools you have for finding and fixing hours for analyzing your user interface or componentry

00:15.590 --> 00:17.420
and so on.

00:17.420 --> 00:24.530
Now there's one type of error which I mentioned which is these so-called unavoidable error for example

00:24.560 --> 00:30.440
that you're sending a network request and you can't guarantee that your users have a network connection

00:30.560 --> 00:37.430
or for example that the servers online will handle such errors later specifically when we do start sending

00:37.430 --> 00:42.380
network requests because there will simply have a better example for when we need that.

00:42.380 --> 00:48.320
And there you will learn how you can handle these unavoidable errors too with the knowledge you gained

00:48.320 --> 00:54.440
in this module you hopefully have a solid set of tools to build applications where you are able to find

00:54.440 --> 00:59.300
and fix errors because you will always encounter errors when you're writing code.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.770
There is no way around that.
