00:02.290 --> 00:06.240
That's it for this module and all the four does app now.

00:06.400 --> 00:11.740
You'll learn a lot about React Native in general how to work with components there and in this module

00:12.010 --> 00:18.960
you'll learn a lot about adjusting your user interface to different device sizes width and height.

00:19.030 --> 00:24.970
You'll learn how to dynamically calculate values if you need to based on the available width and height

00:25.510 --> 00:32.440
and you'll also learned how you can actually also make sure that you don't lock in your width or height

00:32.470 --> 00:40.000
when your app first renders but did you use state and use affect and dimensions add event listener to

00:40.000 --> 00:46.570
re-evaluate and recalculate your dimensions when your orientation changes for example which is of course

00:46.810 --> 00:49.000
a crucial feature.

00:49.090 --> 00:55.990
We also had a look at platform specific code for example by using platform specific files or in most

00:55.990 --> 01:03.640
cases by using the platform API which you can then use with platform select with if checks or with ternary

01:03.640 --> 01:09.780
expressions as we're doing it here to render different styles lay things out differently or render differentiates

01:09.860 --> 01:12.940
X code based on the platform you're running on.

01:12.940 --> 01:18.610
And with that you have all the tools you need to build applications with one code base where you still

01:18.610 --> 01:23.980
have a couple of if checks in there for different platforms or different sizes to have a project where

01:23.980 --> 01:29.590
you work in one project only in one code base but where you are still flexible enough to render different

01:29.590 --> 01:35.410
layouts different styles based on a device size and based on the platform you're targeting.
