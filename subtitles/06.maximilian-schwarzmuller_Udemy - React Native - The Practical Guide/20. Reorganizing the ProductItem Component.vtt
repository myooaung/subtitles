00:02.120 --> 00:08.560
Currently in our product item component here in the components folder the buttons are part of the component.

00:08.580 --> 00:10.660
So as the wrapping touchable component.

00:12.480 --> 00:18.990
We can't change the touchable component that much because while it belongs around our content here and

00:18.990 --> 00:25.200
that's also not a big problem because on the admin screen here I also want the items to be touchable

00:25.590 --> 00:30.210
but I want to go to my edit screen in that case.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.530
I also want to have two buttons one for editing and one for deleting.

00:33.540 --> 00:37.710
But of course the captions and the actions should be different.

00:38.370 --> 00:46.150
Now we could pass in this caption text here as props and rename the props we trigger when the buttons

00:46.150 --> 00:50.880
are pressed and a more generic ways that we could use it for viewing the details on the products overview

00:50.920 --> 00:59.500
screen and for editing or deleting on the user product screen there also is an alternative way of handling

00:59.500 --> 01:00.320
this.

01:00.370 --> 01:07.720
So for one when we press this component in general all renamed as to on select to have a more generic

01:07.720 --> 01:12.000
name that makes sense in a broader array of use cases.

01:12.770 --> 01:15.810
And I'll also change the way we receive these buttons here.

01:15.890 --> 01:22.310
I'll cut them from here and instead output props children here which is that special prop that refers

01:22.310 --> 01:29.560
to whatever we pass between the opening and closing tag off our own component now with that I can also

01:29.560 --> 01:32.540
get rid of the colors import here and off the button import.

01:32.830 --> 01:35.180
And now go to the places where we use the product item.

01:35.230 --> 01:38.010
That would be the products overview screen for example.

01:38.290 --> 01:44.100
There we now have to import the button component and make sure you import your colors.

01:44.110 --> 01:46.150
So import colors from

01:48.490 --> 01:57.630
constants colors and now go to your product item and change it from a self closing component to a component

01:57.630 --> 02:00.450
which you've close and open with your own.

02:00.450 --> 02:06.090
Well component techs in between these tags you can now re add these two buttons.

02:06.090 --> 02:13.680
And now of course don't use props on you detail and props on Add To Cart here but instead add your logic

02:13.680 --> 02:18.690
right here because now we're dynamically passing this in the product item component but therefore we're

02:18.690 --> 02:21.950
able to pass different buttons depending on where we use that product.

02:21.960 --> 02:26.970
Item component so now here I'll add a new handler

02:29.840 --> 02:39.030
select item handler for example which is just a function stored in a constant like this.

02:39.140 --> 02:42.280
And there I want to do what I previously did on view detail.

02:42.350 --> 02:48.440
I'll cut that and added here and I expect to get the idea and the title here as our argument so that

02:48.440 --> 02:52.350
I can forward I.D. and title here like this.

02:52.610 --> 02:59.860
And now select item handler is what I want to trigger here on on select remember that I renamed Disney

02:59.870 --> 03:03.590
a product item this touchable now fires just on select.

03:03.590 --> 03:09.770
So you'll need to rename this in the places where you use that component like here and then here I execute

03:09.770 --> 03:17.360
my select item handler here and forward item data dot item dot I.D. and item data dot item dot title

03:17.360 --> 03:23.690
here so that this data ends up in dysfunction I'm doing this because now I can use the same item handler

03:23.690 --> 03:31.760
here on this view Details button I can essentially just copy this anonymous function and added here

03:31.760 --> 03:34.560
to this on press handler of this button.

03:34.610 --> 03:37.970
So now we reuse debt and on Add To Cart.

03:38.060 --> 03:39.740
Well there we dispatched this.

03:39.890 --> 03:45.320
This now is removed here from the product item component because there we no longer have that prop.

03:45.320 --> 03:52.340
Instead it's now here this prop which takes this anonymous function which then in the end should dispatch

03:52.340 --> 03:53.510
this action.

03:53.900 --> 04:00.170
So now the main changes that I move the buttons out of the component of the product item component into

04:00.170 --> 04:05.930
the product overview screen component and that allows us to still do the same thing as before if I save

04:05.930 --> 04:11.330
that that should still work as before we can tap the item we can tap.

04:11.330 --> 04:15.420
View details we can tap to cart and that all works.

04:15.740 --> 04:18.890
But now we can alter customized isn't a user product screen.

04:19.250 --> 04:28.410
So there will all to copy these buttons and go over to the user product screen and in their import button

04:28.470 --> 04:36.870
from React Native import our colors constant because we'll need that for the buttons from Constance

04:37.320 --> 04:47.480
collars and then hear the product item instead of setting up this we need to parse our on select prop

04:47.480 --> 04:49.450
when the item in general is tapped.

04:49.550 --> 04:53.240
But now we also add opening and closing tax for our own custom component.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.380
And again add our buttons here.

04:55.490 --> 05:01.940
But instead of view details now I say edit and delete it for the moment.

05:02.060 --> 05:06.380
I can just remove all our logic because for the moment we have no logic for editing and deleting but

05:06.380 --> 05:08.630
that's something we can add later.

05:08.870 --> 05:13.630
And here for is elected staff for all just the empty function for the moment.

05:13.780 --> 05:19.690
This has the advantage that now we have our items as we had before here but in the admin section we

05:19.690 --> 05:21.430
now have added and delete.

05:21.550 --> 05:26.290
And this allows us to do different things by still reusing the product item component which is of course

05:26.290 --> 05:27.330
quite nice.
