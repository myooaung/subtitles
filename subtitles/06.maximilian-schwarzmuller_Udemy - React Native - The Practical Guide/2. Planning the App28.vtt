WEBVTT

00:02.060 --> 00:03.200
So let's plan.

00:03.200 --> 00:08.920
The app will build and we'll build a basic shopping app a basic online shop in an app.

00:08.930 --> 00:17.120
You could say so therefore in this application here will definitely need a bunch of products which can

00:17.120 --> 00:17.680
be listed.

00:17.710 --> 00:24.590
So we'll we'll have like a product overview screen where we see these cards with our products with an

00:24.680 --> 00:30.770
image with with the title and the price maybe something like this.

00:30.770 --> 00:37.930
And also a card or add to cart button and a Details button.

00:37.970 --> 00:42.440
So basically a button that allows us to go to a detail page and a button that allows us to add this

00:42.440 --> 00:43.730
to a cart.

00:43.760 --> 00:47.060
Because if you do tap this cart button here.

00:47.060 --> 00:53.900
So if you do select this card button then this is added to a card and you can reach that card with an

00:53.900 --> 00:56.360
action button here in in the action bar.

00:56.390 --> 01:01.300
So in the top header there I want to have such a well such a card.

01:01.570 --> 01:08.060
I can probably a bit nicer than what I drew here but this I can hear in the end allows us to go to a

01:08.060 --> 01:14.480
separate page there after a separate screen of this application where we of course then can also go

01:14.480 --> 01:23.240
back where we will see it like a total sum in in dollars here which our total card items add up to.

01:23.510 --> 01:26.910
And then a list of our items like a book.

01:26.930 --> 01:28.360
And what this cost.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.510
And something like this.

01:29.540 --> 01:33.140
So basically we see our card here we see a sum of that.

01:33.140 --> 01:35.580
And then we see the individual items.

01:35.630 --> 01:42.470
And of course I also want to have a button that allows me to order what's in the card and actually while

01:42.530 --> 01:46.070
that button should be not below this.

01:46.070 --> 01:47.530
So here will have a order button.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.890
Actually this should be here.

01:48.890 --> 01:53.450
So here I want to have one row where we have the total sum the next to the order button.

01:54.110 --> 01:55.310
So that's basically the goal.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.250
But you could place this wherever you want.

01:57.250 --> 02:02.930
Indian ones have a button that allows us to order whatever we have in the card and on each card item

02:02.930 --> 02:03.470
here.

02:03.470 --> 02:12.150
I also want to have like a like a trash I can hear which allows me to delete item from the card.

02:12.200 --> 02:22.300
So where this place says and order this I can over here will basically just delete an item from the

02:22.300 --> 02:23.410
card.

02:23.410 --> 02:24.220
So that's the idea.

02:24.220 --> 02:29.760
Of course if you add the same item multiple times to the card you should not add multiple rows for that.

02:29.830 --> 02:36.520
But instead here I also want to show like a like a quantity of the item which simply increases if we

02:36.520 --> 02:41.920
added more often to the card and which decreases if we delete it until all items are deleted in which

02:41.920 --> 02:44.080
case in high row would be deleted here.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.000
So that's how does card page will work.

02:46.000 --> 02:54.070
This is you overview page here of course therefore we can also tap the detail button or maybe the item

02:54.070 --> 02:56.950
in general so anywhere on the image or anything like that.

02:56.980 --> 03:00.250
And then we should be taken to a detail page.

03:00.250 --> 03:04.810
So that's another screen in this application where we of course also can go back.

03:04.810 --> 03:08.190
That's detail page of the icon where we should see the image.

03:08.260 --> 03:12.490
Well we should probably see like the title here in the header.

03:12.490 --> 03:23.710
So that would be the title of the item then below that we see like the surprise we see the description

03:24.190 --> 03:32.300
and we probably want to have a cue card button here as well where we can also add items to the card

03:32.310 --> 03:37.460
here so that's the flow regarding our products.

03:37.470 --> 03:38.630
We have here now.

03:38.640 --> 03:44.060
The important thing in his app will be that we can not just see products and shop them and add them

03:44.060 --> 03:50.010
to card and so on but of course that we can also view our orders and most importantly that we can also

03:50.130 --> 03:52.110
add new products.

03:52.110 --> 03:59.100
Hence here we need a draw and this draw will present us with a couple of options now.

03:59.120 --> 04:05.940
The first option of course is that we go to to our shops so to say that's this part here where we are

04:05.940 --> 04:07.770
on when the app starts.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.110
The second option should be our orders.

04:10.110 --> 04:17.340
And the third option should be like a like a manage products option where we can manage our own products

04:17.370 --> 04:19.920
which you want to offer to our users.

04:19.950 --> 04:22.810
So as I said shop is basically what we see already.

04:22.830 --> 04:31.500
Now if we tap on orders well then I want to be taken to a screen where we of course also can open that

04:31.500 --> 04:34.540
drawer because Dad will then allow us to go back.

04:34.590 --> 04:40.530
But on that screen we should see the orders where we basically have items where we kind of see like

04:40.960 --> 04:49.800
Doctor the some of that order the date and then also a button where we can tap on where we see more

04:49.800 --> 04:56.850
details and if we tap this button then we have this optional area which opens or closes and in there

04:56.860 --> 05:02.040
I basically want to see these the items of the order which is basically what we had in the cart.

05:02.040 --> 05:09.810
So we had two books in here with a price of 19 for example well then this would show up here in the

05:09.810 --> 05:11.590
detail area when we opened it.

05:11.610 --> 05:12.490
So that's the idea.

05:12.540 --> 05:13.230
And your orders.

05:13.230 --> 05:18.030
We can expand in order so that we don't just see the summit to date but we also see the card items be

05:18.030 --> 05:19.200
placed in there basically.

05:19.230 --> 05:23.720
So basically what we had here in the card that's showing up in the orders.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.380
That's the orders screen.

05:25.380 --> 05:33.480
We also have managed products and let's draw that here maybe managed products is another area off this

05:33.480 --> 05:40.620
app where we all have that menu button to open that door again so that we can reach the other parts

05:40.620 --> 05:47.130
of the app but here in the managed product screen where we have our own products.

05:47.280 --> 05:52.980
So the user products and in this app we won't add authentication yet but we'll add this later but here

05:53.340 --> 05:55.380
we have our own products here.

05:55.380 --> 06:01.290
The idea is again that we basically see a list of products which is pretty close to what we see here

06:01.350 --> 06:08.790
on the shop screen so that we have like our cards here with with an image with the title and the price

06:08.790 --> 06:11.980
maybe so we can reuse does list here probably.

06:12.510 --> 06:18.720
But of course the options we have on each product that differs instead of adding it to a cart and viewing

06:18.720 --> 06:22.400
the details we can delete it.

06:22.440 --> 06:28.710
That's one button and we can also edit it of course you can only added our own products but again we'll

06:28.710 --> 06:35.400
have no real user mapping here we can do this with some dummy user I.D. which we attach to each product

06:35.730 --> 06:37.470
but that's it for now.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.330
So we have to edit and delete button.

06:39.330 --> 06:41.920
Now in addition here in the header.

06:41.940 --> 06:47.640
So we need more space here in the header we'll all have a action button that allows us to add a new

06:47.640 --> 06:48.390
product.

06:48.390 --> 06:53.310
So basically that that should just be a little bit broader here to just to narrow.

06:53.340 --> 07:00.030
So we have this action button here and this action button here this plus button this should take us

07:00.030 --> 07:02.480
to a new page where we can add a new product.

07:02.490 --> 07:12.630
So this will take us to the added product page here where we can of course go back and they're we can

07:12.720 --> 07:19.720
add a new product and that allows us to add a title here with a text input and that text input can all

07:19.720 --> 07:23.650
to be below the title label and you can build this however you want.

07:23.670 --> 07:25.770
We should be able to add the price.

07:25.890 --> 07:32.390
We should be able to add this group chain here might be a multi line input here.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.530
We of course need to be able to add an image you are El as well.

07:36.570 --> 07:41.460
That's what we can add here and then we need a button here in the action bar a check mark button or

07:41.460 --> 07:46.440
anything like that which allows us to confirm this will not care too much about all that user input

07:46.440 --> 07:47.120
handling here.

07:47.130 --> 07:52.230
At this stage because we'll have a separate module where I dive into all the details there how you can

07:52.530 --> 07:57.330
do is an elegant way how you can add validation so here in December we'll keep this very basic will

07:57.330 --> 08:00.870
not check whether the user entered something correct or anything like that.

08:00.870 --> 08:02.350
We'll do that later in the course.

08:02.430 --> 08:07.470
Here we just gathered that basic input when this button here does check mark button here is pressed

08:07.830 --> 08:13.560
were taken back to this page and of course we use read X in our state management system to add a new

08:13.560 --> 08:20.100
product to the list of products which then also shows up here in our shop and what shows up here in

08:20.100 --> 08:23.280
our product list of course which we can administrate.

08:23.340 --> 08:24.420
So that's what we have here.

08:24.480 --> 08:32.100
Now if we tap added here if we select this edit button here then we're all taken to that same edit product

08:32.100 --> 08:40.410
page but of course now we have some pre populated values here repopulated with the product we loaded

08:40.770 --> 08:43.110
and there are certain fields which we can't edit.

08:43.110 --> 08:49.080
For example the price should not be editable because if the price would be editable then if we had it

08:49.080 --> 08:51.230
in the card already that would be a problem.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.390
So we'll not allow editing the price here.

08:54.390 --> 08:57.840
We will allow editing the title the description the image your elbow.

08:57.930 --> 09:00.210
So that's something which is possible.

09:00.210 --> 09:01.210
So that's the one difference.

09:01.260 --> 09:04.180
We have pretty populated fields and their price is not editable.

09:04.260 --> 09:09.840
If we pressed the checkmark in the edit mode and we can find out whether we're editing or not by the

09:09.840 --> 09:14.220
fact whether we received a product idea as a parameter for example.

09:14.220 --> 09:20.100
So once we're done editing we can press that checkmark icon and then we're all taken back and we simply

09:20.100 --> 09:23.660
save whatever we added that year back to our product.

09:23.670 --> 09:25.780
This is the app here.

09:25.890 --> 09:30.700
As I mentioned this will be a basis for the subsequent modules as well.

09:30.700 --> 09:38.100
There we will do it all to add HDP request authentication will do all that foreign validation here in

09:38.100 --> 09:40.020
a more elegant way and so on.

09:40.050 --> 09:46.110
But this module here now is a great practice for how to build such NAV for how to work with components

09:46.200 --> 09:51.240
style them how to add navigation because obviously we have a lot of navigation and this app and how

09:51.240 --> 09:54.940
to manage our state in this shopping app.

09:55.020 --> 09:59.850
As I mentioned in the last lecture you could skip this module but then you should definitely dive into

09:59.850 --> 10:05.100
the finished code so that you're able to follow along in the next modules but my recommendation of course

10:05.100 --> 10:10.840
is that you a ever tried is all on your own and of course your result will not be the same.

10:10.860 --> 10:16.230
I get so you should definitely also watch my videos thereafter to see how I did this and so that you

10:16.230 --> 10:18.360
have the same code basis to follow along.

10:18.360 --> 10:23.280
But this will be a great practice even if your result that first because there is no wrong or right

10:23.280 --> 10:28.890
approach necessarily or B Your other option of course is that you don't try it on your own and you just

10:28.890 --> 10:29.870
fall along.

10:29.970 --> 10:34.830
Also a valid option but I believe you'll get a bit more out of the chords if you do try it on your own

10:34.830 --> 10:35.490
first.

10:35.490 --> 10:40.080
But in the end do whatever you like in the next lecture will dive right into this and start building

10:40.080 --> 10:40.500
the Zapp.
