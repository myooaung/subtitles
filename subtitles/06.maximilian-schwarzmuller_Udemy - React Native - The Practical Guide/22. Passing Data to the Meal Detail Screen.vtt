00:02.710 --> 00:05.590
Now you know how we can go to the detail page of course.

00:05.620 --> 00:11.530
It's something we did before when we went from the categories page to the category meals page so we

00:11.530 --> 00:12.880
can use the same approach here.

00:12.910 --> 00:16.900
And of course feel free to pass the video at this point and do that on your own.

00:16.900 --> 00:24.540
That's absolutely something you can do here as a practice let's of course all do together though.

00:24.630 --> 00:32.550
So in the category meals screen when we select a meal on select meal dysfunction or should trigger because

00:32.550 --> 00:39.950
we're passing in dysfunction through on select meal to the meal item and there were binding it to on

00:39.950 --> 00:42.550
press on the touchable passage here.

00:42.570 --> 00:48.870
So dad should fire on select meal and therefore and category meals screen in dysfunction here we can

00:48.870 --> 00:54.870
navigate those inside to find as render meal function where I render my meal item inside of my component

00:54.900 --> 01:00.780
I have access to props and there since the category meal screen is our component we load with the help

01:00.780 --> 01:07.050
of navigation I can access the navigation property and the navigate method and you learned that there

01:07.050 --> 01:12.820
we can now pass and the root name where we want to go to and that would be meal detail.

01:12.900 --> 01:18.810
So the root name we set up in the meals navigator this name here this will load the meal detail page

01:19.590 --> 01:26.400
No we'll need to forward some data there and the data which I want to forward here of course is the

01:26.400 --> 01:32.850
idea of the selected meal so that we can then load the details off that meal on that meal detail page

01:32.850 --> 01:34.500
to render them there.

01:34.770 --> 01:44.520
So in the category meals screen here we can set up param parents here on our navigate object on the

01:44.520 --> 01:49.980
object we passed navigate and parents takes an object off key value Paris as you learned that's something

01:49.980 --> 01:56.730
we did before and here I want to forward my meal idea which I of course can get from an item data because

01:56.790 --> 02:03.330
item data item is a meal and every meal as you can see the model has an I.D. we're storing this here

02:04.320 --> 02:10.890
hence here of course we can say item data not item dot I.D. That's what I want to forward with dead

02:10.890 --> 02:16.650
we should go to the meal detail page and later we'll also be able to extract the I.D. off the meal we

02:16.650 --> 02:17.410
load it.

02:17.640 --> 02:26.760
So on the meal detail screen let's just see whether that works the meal idea is props navigation get

02:26.760 --> 02:34.470
param and now the name was meal I.D. That's the parent name I'd show is here for storing the param if

02:34.470 --> 02:39.090
you chose a different name here you need to choose a different name here or it use the same name there

02:39.090 --> 02:46.980
of course and now we can select the meal for that let's import all meals from the dummy data file in

02:46.980 --> 02:59.800
the data folder like this and now the selected meal here of course is meals find and then we run this

02:59.800 --> 03:05.770
function every meal there and that's the meal where the meal idea matches the meal idea we extract that

03:05.860 --> 03:14.200
up there that's our selected meal to prove that this works we can output it there select that meal dot

03:14.290 --> 03:21.250
title and of course I also want to set the title in the header and that's also something you learned

03:21.970 --> 03:28.460
you can do this by adding navigation options to this screen here navigation options and you'll learn

03:28.490 --> 03:35.090
that if you want to retrieve something dynamic you do this with the help of this special function your

03:35.690 --> 03:42.650
navigation data is what you get there dysfunction is called for you by react navigation as you learned

03:43.340 --> 03:52.050
and now in their we have to return our navigation object our navigation options object but before we

03:52.050 --> 03:58.470
return this we can use data we get from navigation data like our navigation prop which in turn allows

03:58.470 --> 04:09.340
us to get access to Perrin so we can use navigation data dot navigation get param to get our meal idea

04:09.340 --> 04:13.890
here as well and also retrieve our meal just as we're doing it up there in the component.

04:13.990 --> 04:19.630
Do the same down there for the navigation options and with the meal selected we can of course here set

04:19.630 --> 04:25.040
a header title to selected meal dot title and that's something we did before.

04:25.060 --> 04:30.650
This is how we can extract data here in our navigation options and use that dynamic data there.

04:30.790 --> 04:32.620
For example to set the header title

04:35.400 --> 04:37.830
with this out of the way let's see where it works.

04:37.920 --> 04:47.600
Maybe on Android let's go to light and lovely there we have all our recipes let's go to to sell it here

04:49.530 --> 04:54.690
and here it is here's our title we also seed here so this is all loaded.

04:54.690 --> 04:58.050
If you go to the Selman we instead see that.

04:58.050 --> 05:00.850
So this is all working as it should.

05:00.870 --> 05:02.350
Very nice to see.

05:02.370 --> 05:08.340
Now it's time to take the next step because for example we want to to mark a meal as a favorite and

05:08.340 --> 05:13.650
for this I want to have a star I can hear in the navigation which I can press.

05:13.650 --> 05:16.290
That's something we're missing yet and we haven't learned about yet.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.850
So it's a nice next step.
