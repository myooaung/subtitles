00:02.430 --> 00:09.040
So in the last lectures, we added functionality to pick a location manually or to locate ourselves upon

00:09.080 --> 00:10.270
a click,

00:10.310 --> 00:13.760
now of course it would be nice to also use that information

00:13.910 --> 00:19.030
when we finally submit our place we want to share, because right now we're always working in pick

00:19.030 --> 00:19.980
location,

00:20.090 --> 00:22.180
we're picking a location, everything is great

00:22.580 --> 00:27.580
but in share place we're not using that location, we're not getting access to it.

00:27.920 --> 00:34.730
So our goal has to be that we propagate the location that was picked to the outside world so that in

00:34.730 --> 00:42.380
share place, we can get it and we can store it just as we store the name the user entered, that we also

00:42.380 --> 00:44.240
store the location.

00:44.690 --> 00:48.790
So for this, I'll actually add a new control here,

00:49.060 --> 00:56.780
I'll name it location and it won't be input field, a text input but still there will be a value and

00:56.840 --> 01:02.870
the value should just be the location object I guess, so I'll set it to null initially,

01:02.870 --> 01:08.800
it will then be an object with latitude and longitude once we're done and I'll also set valid to false

01:08.830 --> 01:14.080
by default and I will turn it to true as soon as we got a location. Touch is not really needed and

01:14.090 --> 01:16.240
validation rules is also not needed here,

01:16.460 --> 01:24.080
so what I want to do is I want to get the location from pick location, so something like on location pick

01:24.170 --> 01:24.610
event

01:24.620 --> 01:29.570
we can listen to you which then allows us to execute a method where we get a location so that we

01:29.570 --> 01:32.410
can then set the value for our control.

01:34.340 --> 01:45.580
For this I'm going to add a new method in my share place class here, location picked handler, there I

01:45.580 --> 01:48.130
expect to get the location as an argument,

01:48.130 --> 01:51.340
we'll have to write the code for this to become true

01:51.670 --> 02:00.770
and then I can call this set state and we'll use the function form where we get the previous state, so

02:00.770 --> 02:07.650
that I can then set controls to previous state controls to use the old values

02:07.650 --> 02:15.490
first of all and we should wrap this in a returned object of course, so return an object where we have

02:15.490 --> 02:16.900
a controls property

02:20.780 --> 02:26.260
and then I also will set the location control we just added.

02:26.330 --> 02:33.320
So this control here which has just value and valid, I will set it to and I will set it to an object

02:33.320 --> 02:36.250
where value can be the location I get,

02:36.290 --> 02:42.020
let's assume that this is an object with a latitude and a longitude and valid is just set to true,

02:42.050 --> 02:46.640
as soon as we got a location, we treat it as true.

02:46.650 --> 02:53.050
Now all we now need to do is we need to make sure that pick image, pick location actually gives us

02:53.050 --> 02:54.490
this on location pick,

02:54.540 --> 03:00.060
so that there, we then bind the location picked handler and we get to this location.

03:00.090 --> 03:05.520
So on location pick is a prop we should execute as a method in pick location so that we actually

03:05.520 --> 03:07.110
execute this method.

03:07.500 --> 03:14.760
So in the pick location component, we obviously want to do that whenever a location is set and whenever

03:14.760 --> 03:21.150
we set a location, no matter if we do this by locating the user or by clicking on the map, pick location

03:21.150 --> 03:23.280
handler is called in the end,

03:23.280 --> 03:31.260
so what we can always do is we can always call this props on location pick and execute it here

03:31.590 --> 03:38.280
and we pass an object where we pass on the latitude which is coords latitude here and we pass on

03:38.280 --> 03:42.810
the longitude which is coords longitude.

03:42.980 --> 03:49.850
Now with that, we propagate this or we get this data out of the pick location component into the share place

03:49.850 --> 03:50.880
component.

03:51.440 --> 03:57.410
Now I also want to make sure that when we try to add a place, we can't do this if no location was picked,

03:57.410 --> 04:01.850
so on the button which we disable if the place name control is invalid,

04:01.910 --> 04:11.630
it is also disabled if either the place name is not valid or if not this state controls location is

04:11.630 --> 04:11.980
valid,

04:11.990 --> 04:13.480
so if valid here is false,

04:13.580 --> 04:18.290
I also want to disable that button, so that we can't submit before I picked the location.

04:18.380 --> 04:22.920
We can then also add this check here in the place add handler to be super safe,

04:22.940 --> 04:26.900
we can also remove it though and I will remove the other check here too which we don't really need

04:26.900 --> 04:27.790
anymore

04:28.010 --> 04:34.000
and I will call on add place and right now, we pass on the place name,

04:34.010 --> 04:37.210
now we also want to pass on the location.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.170
So I will pass a second argument,

04:39.200 --> 04:47.120
this state controls location value is what I also want to pass on. Now on add place of course in the end

04:47.120 --> 04:50.040
dispatches an action, the add place action

04:50.210 --> 04:52.690
and that only accepts a name right now,

04:53.030 --> 04:58.160
so I will change it here to also accept a location and pass on the location

04:58.340 --> 05:02.670
but of course that means that we need to change that action creator here.

05:02.750 --> 05:09.180
So let's go to store actions and into places and here add place now

05:09.210 --> 05:18.230
should also accept the location and pass on that location as an extra property in this created action.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.640
Now let's use that action in our store,

05:20.670 --> 05:26.180
so in the places reducer to be precise, there we store the name, we store our image,

05:26.180 --> 05:29.020
now let's also store the location.

05:29.060 --> 05:34.920
So here I will now store location equal to action location,

05:35.010 --> 05:39.200
that's this new property we just added to the action in our action creator,

05:39.230 --> 05:48.500
this one. So with that, we also store this, now make sure to save all files and let's see if that works.

05:48.510 --> 05:52.260
My Android device is connected to the react native debugging tools here,

05:52.560 --> 05:57.380
so let's see if we actually dispatch this successfully, let's quickly

05:57.870 --> 05:59.400
sudo log in here

05:59.970 --> 06:08.620
and then let's pick some place, scroll down, enter some cool name here

06:10.470 --> 06:13.230
and we can click share this place and now let's do that.

06:15.200 --> 06:22.720
And once I did this, add place is sent here, we see this action here and if we now inspect this a little

06:22.720 --> 06:27.880
bit more, we go to our state,

06:27.910 --> 06:29.330
we see that there indeed

06:29.500 --> 06:34.700
we do have a loation. I need to fix this but we do have a latitude and longitude

06:34.760 --> 06:36.160
and if I click somewhere else

06:39.960 --> 06:49.160
and share this place, we now see that there we get a second element with a different location.

06:52.020 --> 06:55.390
So sharing these places does indeed work,

06:56.490 --> 06:59.080
now one thing I definitely want to do is I want to fix this error,

06:59.100 --> 07:01.180
this should be location not loation

07:01.620 --> 07:09.180
but we're now successfully adding new places. Now with that, we can of course always view these places, if we

07:09.180 --> 07:11.380
find places we see them here

07:11.880 --> 07:18.620
but what we don't really see is the map, would be nice to also see the map on these screens.

07:18.810 --> 07:20.740
So that is what I want to do next.
