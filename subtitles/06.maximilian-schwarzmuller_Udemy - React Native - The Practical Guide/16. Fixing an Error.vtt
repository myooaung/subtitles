00:02.100 --> 00:05.890
So we get these wrong error of

00:05.980 --> 00:11.950
also getting the warning that we got no keys for the items and of always loading the first item.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.490
The reason for this is simple,

00:13.530 --> 00:20.750
in the past we added a key property to all the places in our redux store

00:20.980 --> 00:29.560
and now when I loaded the places, I do also have a unique key but I named it ID. The quickest fix probably

00:29.560 --> 00:31.900
is to just rename this to key,

00:31.930 --> 00:39.940
so from ID to key, the alternative would have been to visit all the components where we try to use that

00:39.940 --> 00:41.620
key and rename key to ID,

00:41.650 --> 00:46.330
so this one should be faster. With that if I now reload the whole application

00:48.650 --> 00:51.160
and I try to find my places again,

00:52.910 --> 00:54.880
there they are

00:55.010 --> 00:58.370
and now we really visit the place we click on,

00:58.370 --> 01:00.740
so that's looking much better now.

01:01.970 --> 01:07.250
Now if I delete the place, we get an error though, delete place is not defined and so on

01:07.490 --> 01:12.730
and also we haven't added any logic to delete a place on the server.

01:12.980 --> 01:14.810
We'll take care about this in a second,

01:14.960 --> 01:19.160
for now let's simply also test this on Android, so

01:19.370 --> 01:21.400
let's log in here too

01:21.650 --> 01:23.960
and let's also find the places here,

01:24.140 --> 01:26.980
there they are from the server.

01:27.050 --> 01:32.590
And we can view places, add it on our iPhone, on our Android device.

01:32.690 --> 01:33.740
So that's nice,

01:33.740 --> 01:37.100
now it's time to add a delete place functionality.
