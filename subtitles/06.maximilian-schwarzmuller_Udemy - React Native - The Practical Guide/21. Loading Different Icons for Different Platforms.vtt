In the last lecture we changed our custom button to respect the platform we're running on,

00:08.230 --> 00:17.050
now I want to make sure we're loading different icons and let's do that in our tab bar for example, so here

00:17.080 --> 00:24.310
in startMainTabs in the MainTabs folder in the screens folder. There we load some icons and we always

00:24.310 --> 00:30.440
load iOS icons except for the map where I chose that I liked the material one better.

00:30.490 --> 00:32.020
Now we don't need to do that anymore,

00:32.020 --> 00:36.420
we can always pick that one which is the right one for the given platform.

00:37.160 --> 00:45.370
To do that, I first of all will add another import here at the top, I'll import platform from react native

00:46.010 --> 00:51.320
and then we can simply add ternary expression here to determine what we want to load.

00:51.440 --> 00:58.770
I can reach out to platform OS and check if it's equal to Android let's say

00:59.270 --> 01:06.350
and if it is, then I want to use md-map for material design map which is the android style and otherwise

01:06.350 --> 01:10.180
for other platforms, I will use iOS map.

01:10.250 --> 01:16.490
The cool thing about icon is you can always just replace the prefix here, md and so on with the

01:16.490 --> 01:25.430
respective platform prefix or the styling prefix and the main icon name, like map here is always the same.

01:26.820 --> 01:31.170
So let's copy this ternary expression down to the second icon

01:31.530 --> 01:33.380
and therefore Android,

01:33.630 --> 01:36.650
I of course don't want to fetch iOS share alt,

01:36.690 --> 01:40.290
that should be my alternative, my else case instead, for Android

01:40.290 --> 01:42.890
I'll fetch md-share-alt

01:43.440 --> 01:49.330
and now the same for iOS menu down there, for Android

01:49.430 --> 01:53.860
I want to pick md-menu. Now with all that,

01:53.900 --> 01:55.360
let's save that,

01:55.520 --> 01:59.820
let's go back to our application and let's reload both apps

02:01.530 --> 02:10.770
and submit and now you indeed see different styles here, you see the manual looks relatively equal but

02:10.770 --> 02:15.420
on the map, you see it really well. On the share icon, not so much,

02:15.420 --> 02:23.540
we could go back and change ios-share-alt to ios-share to be closer to the well original ios-share

02:23.560 --> 02:29.970
icon and now if we reload iOS, we see a distinctively different share icon there too.

02:30.320 --> 02:34.000
So now we really get different icons for the different devices,

02:34.010 --> 02:36.800
now we've got one more icon here in the side menu,

02:36.810 --> 02:39.590
so let's also make sure we picked the right one here.

02:39.890 --> 02:43.320
For that let's go to the side drawer component we have,

02:43.580 --> 02:51.310
here it is and there where I include my icon, here name ios-log-out,

02:51.500 --> 03:00.020
well we probably want to resolve this dynamically too. So we can also wrap this with curly braces and

03:00.020 --> 03:09.530
import the platform in this file too from react native and then go down to our name and check platform

03:09.620 --> 03:13.030
OS, check if it's equal to Android

03:13.030 --> 03:21.150
and if it is, I want to use md-log-out otherwise I'll use ios-log-out and of course you could revert

03:21.170 --> 03:22.700
this and check for iOS,

03:22.730 --> 03:24.480
whichever one you want to prefer

03:24.560 --> 03:27.710
or you write a really long if statement.

03:27.710 --> 03:33.190
However if you want to see which values OS can get, here is an overview,

03:33.320 --> 03:40.620
in my IDE I can hold command and click on OS and you see it's iOS, Android, Mac OS, Windows or web

03:41.010 --> 03:47.300
but with you building a real native app, you're pretty certain we end up with iOS or Android.

03:47.720 --> 03:52.500
So now I got this added here and I should load different log out icons,

03:52.580 --> 03:58.830
now one other place where we got an icon though is the place detail where we got this trash bin here.

03:59.210 --> 04:06.590
Let's also import platform here in place detail and then let's add a ternary expression here too, I'll

04:06.590 --> 04:10.570
wrap this with curly braces and then check platform OS

04:10.580 --> 04:17.900
if it's equal to Android, in which case I want to use md-trash as an icon and only if that's not the

04:17.900 --> 04:22.850
case I'll use ios-trash and I'll also move this into a new line.

04:23.270 --> 04:25.850
So now we got this check in place detail too,

04:25.880 --> 04:27.550
we added this in the side drawer,

04:27.590 --> 04:35.270
let's save all files and move back and reload both apps to see if that looks differently.

04:35.270 --> 04:38.210
If we submit and we open the drawer in Android,

04:38.210 --> 04:45.860
this looks like a material design icon and certainly looks different than the iOS icon does.

04:45.860 --> 04:53.900
Now if we add a place to see how the trash bin looks like, let's add Munich again, share the place and

04:53.900 --> 04:55.660
click on find place,

04:55.760 --> 04:58.330
there we now see Munich,

04:58.590 --> 05:00.540
we got this trash bin here,

05:00.830 --> 05:03.930
now let's also create one on Android.

05:04.010 --> 05:13.550
So let's enter Munich here too, share the place and go there and open the place, that looks like a different

05:13.550 --> 05:15.340
trash bin to me too.

05:15.740 --> 05:19.000
So that's all working, we get different styles here too,

05:19.010 --> 05:20.830
that's really nice.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.290
Now with that, you saw how to use the platform API

05:24.410 --> 05:30.110
and you can use it anywhere you want not just for icons obviously, you can use it to do whatever you

05:30.110 --> 05:36.230
want, you can use in any if statement, you can render this view only on Android if you think that this would

05:36.230 --> 05:37.030
be a good idea, 

05:37.100 --> 05:39.660
if you need that in your app, do it. Platform

05:39.680 --> 05:47.750
OS is a great tool to really build different apps or the same app with some different features for different

05:47.750 --> 05:49.530
platforms.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.990
With that, let's see what else we can do for different platforms.
