00:02.100 --> 00:07.930
In this module will now build up on the practice app or on the shopping app we built in the last course

00:07.930 --> 00:08.860
module.

00:08.860 --> 00:14.770
So if you skipped the last course module which you can make sure you still download the finished code

00:14.770 --> 00:18.960
from there and you manually go through that code to understand what we're doing there.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.780
Also of course run the app on your emulators or real devices.

00:22.870 --> 00:27.190
So did you well again get a feeling for what's happening there and what we built there.

00:27.190 --> 00:31.800
Because in this module we'll take this app and will now work on the user input part.

00:31.840 --> 00:38.020
That means we'll work on the part where users can add products and where they need to enter their own

00:38.020 --> 00:45.070
data because whilst fetching data with the text input component is relatively straightforward as you

00:45.070 --> 00:46.260
will learn in this module.

00:46.270 --> 00:52.510
There is a bit more to it when it comes to validating that input configuring the text inputs correctly

00:52.510 --> 00:54.160
and using that user input.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.520
And these are all the things we'll have a detailed look at in this module.
