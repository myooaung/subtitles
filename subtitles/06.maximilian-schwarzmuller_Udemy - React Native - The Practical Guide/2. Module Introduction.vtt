Welcome to this module, let's dive into the basics of react native.

00:06.880 --> 00:12.440
The goal of this module to make sure that you understand which core building blocks make upper native

00:12.470 --> 00:19.240
app and how you build react native apps in general and thereafter we'll have many modules to dive deeper

00:19.240 --> 00:21.720
into certain aspects of that.

00:21.730 --> 00:27.520
So therefore in this module, we will have a look at the base components we can use to build a react

00:27.520 --> 00:33.560
native app and why we need these base components and how we can build our own components.

00:33.830 --> 00:40.300
Additionally, we'll also have a look at styling though only a brief look because there will be an entire

00:40.300 --> 00:46.540
module on styling and so on later in this course and we will also have a look at how we can run our

00:46.540 --> 00:49.030
application on a simulator,

00:49.060 --> 00:56.170
so a simulator provided by Xcode which is the development environment for iOS or Android Studio which

00:56.410 --> 00:58.600
is the same for Android as you might have guessed

00:58.920 --> 01:02.590
and how you can also run your application on the real device.

01:02.590 --> 01:04.000
So a lot of exciting things

01:04.030 --> 01:10.000
and whilst these are only three boxes, we'll spend quite some time on that because react native obviously

01:10.030 --> 01:12.050
offers a lot of functionalities

01:12.070 --> 01:14.070
it's worth diving into here.

01:14.140 --> 01:20.590
So with that, let's just start and let's create a new project and then explore the various features react

01:20.590 --> 01:21.650
native offers us.
