Welcome to this module. Now that we learned how to fetch a location, fetch an image and do all kinds

00:10.030 --> 00:11.520
of different things in the app,

00:11.740 --> 00:19.660
it's finally time to keep that data not only in our application but actually get it onto a server, so

00:19.660 --> 00:26.140
a server running in the Internet which not only allows us to fetch this even after our application restarted

00:26.530 --> 00:32.010
but also to share it with other users which we obviously want to do in our course project.

00:32.320 --> 00:39.580
To be precise in this module, we'll have a look at how this all work, so how we send http requests

00:39.580 --> 00:46.480
and what the idea behind this is, we'll then have a look at the fetch API which is provided by react

00:46.540 --> 00:54.010
native to do just that, send http requests and we'll have a look at how we handle the requests and responses

00:54.070 --> 01:00.670
and also since it's a kind of a special case or something, you just have to know how it works, we'll also

01:00.780 --> 01:04.720
have a look at how we actually upload our image.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.460
So let's do all that and let's

01:06.500 --> 01:11.950
first of all find out how it works before we then set everything up and get started sending requests.
