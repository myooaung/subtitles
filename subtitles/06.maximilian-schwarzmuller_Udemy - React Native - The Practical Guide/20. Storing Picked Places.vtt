00:02.370 --> 00:09.300
So to use the data we're getting back from the map screen we can go directly to the location picker

00:09.300 --> 00:15.080
a component because there I do have access to props navigation since a feed is in there from the new

00:15.080 --> 00:20.750
place screen so I can directly listen to changes in my perimeter stare and there.

00:20.750 --> 00:29.090
Let's say at the top of the component here where I set up my state I can also get my picked location

00:29.630 --> 00:36.440
with the help of props navigation get param and now extract the param I'm setting in the map screen

00:36.860 --> 00:42.810
so that pick location parallel I'm setting there that's what we can retrieve here.

00:42.850 --> 00:44.670
Now of course this will not always be set.

00:44.710 --> 00:51.130
For example if we go to the new place screen from our places list screen there in this navigation action

00:51.370 --> 00:56.460
I'm not setting any parallel so therefore of course this is not always available but in that case picked

00:56.460 --> 00:58.390
location will just be undefined.

00:58.420 --> 01:04.060
Now here I now would have a name clash because I have this picked location or dis picked location here

01:04.570 --> 01:06.940
and actually I kind of want to merge both together.

01:06.940 --> 01:17.390
So what I'll do here all renamed is to map picked location and then add you as a fact here to the location

01:17.390 --> 01:21.740
picker and the end check for whenever this changes.

01:21.740 --> 01:27.800
So you're all at use effect and in this effect here I want to trigger it where and when to run does

01:27.800 --> 01:34.250
effect whenever a map pick location changes and if I then do have a map pick location so if this is

01:34.250 --> 01:41.150
defined I'll call set picked location to use my internal state here and set this to the location that

01:41.150 --> 01:42.870
was picked on the map.

01:42.890 --> 01:47.720
So this is now an elegant way of storing the location we picked on the map and which we passed around

01:47.720 --> 01:52.280
with props in our internal location picker state here.

01:52.410 --> 01:57.690
Now we'll update the pick location to location picked on the map and therefore hopefully we see it in

01:57.690 --> 02:05.930
the preview if we go back there and open the map and then I'll pick a location here somewhere around

02:05.930 --> 02:09.180
this hospitals let's say and I click save.

02:09.350 --> 02:15.770
Indeed we see that here on this preview and the same should be the case on Android.

02:15.770 --> 02:21.170
And even if I fetch a user location first which is at the Googleplex if I then pick a location here

02:21.170 --> 02:23.120
somewhere in San Francisco to safety's

02:25.810 --> 02:28.370
this gets updated here and the preview as well.

02:28.540 --> 02:29.670
So that works.

02:29.670 --> 02:35.780
This is how we can pick places on the map and use them here in the preview and of course all of for

02:35.830 --> 02:38.620
kind of stored them here in the location picker.

02:38.620 --> 02:45.190
Now we all need to make sure we can pass the data from the location picker back to the new place screen

02:45.220 --> 02:47.820
because that's ultimately where we need stat data.
