The last lecture we outsourced the default text input into our own component which is simply there to

00:09.250 --> 00:14.350
apply some default styling with these two props and our own stylesheet.

00:14.530 --> 00:20.650
Now sometimes we want to use the default input but still override parts of the style,

00:21.070 --> 00:27.000
so let's say here and for that I'll reintroduce the input property in the auth screen,

00:27.010 --> 00:33.850
let's say we want to give this a default background color which differs from the background color we

00:33.850 --> 00:42.010
use anywhere else in the application. For this I'll set a background color property here, maybe to a light

00:42.080 --> 00:43.330
gray,

00:43.450 --> 00:49.090
therefore I want to override the default border color to a darker gray so that we can actually see a

00:49.090 --> 00:51.570
difference.

00:51.600 --> 01:01.820
So this is my set up here and now I can use my default input and add a style property to it, refer to styles

01:02.030 --> 01:03.750
input

01:03.890 --> 01:11.040
and now let's see what happens. If I now save this, our default styles are actually lost so the styles

01:11.070 --> 01:13.200
we set up in this component,

01:13.200 --> 01:18.870
the reason for this is that we use props here to distribute any other props we got and this will override

01:18.870 --> 01:26.040
our style prop we set up in here. Now to fix this, what we can do is we can move our style prop assignment

01:26.270 --> 01:29.320
after this code we redistribute all props.

01:29.460 --> 01:33.600
If we do that and we let our app reload, our default styling is back,

01:33.720 --> 01:34.910
also on Android

01:35.190 --> 01:40.100
but now our styles which we wanted to override aren't respected.

01:40.410 --> 01:43.920
So we somehow need to merge the styles we get from outside,

01:43.920 --> 01:50.340
so from the auth screen with our default styles and for that, we can use an alternative syntax here for the style

01:50.340 --> 01:57.450
attribute or property, you can pass an array instead of a style object. That array can then hold multiple

01:57.450 --> 02:01.830
style objects and they will overwrite each other by order,

02:02.040 --> 02:04.460
so the first element is our default styling

02:04.620 --> 02:12.020
and then I can reach out to props style to take any styles we define outside of here. If I now

02:12.090 --> 02:13.910
save this,

02:14.140 --> 02:15.340
now we get both,

02:15.340 --> 02:23.740
we get the default styling but we also got our custom styling so both is now merged and if we would

02:23.950 --> 02:30.750
reverse the order here, so if we would pass our default styling as a second element,

02:31.000 --> 02:37.090
then you see that we would actually end up with the wrong result because now we would override our custom

02:37.090 --> 02:38.830
styles from the auth screen,

02:39.010 --> 02:44.650
so we would override the border color we set up there, hence ending up with a border color which actually

02:44.660 --> 02:48.130
is the same as the background color we set on the custom styles,

02:48.190 --> 02:50.100
that's why we don't see a border here.

02:50.470 --> 02:51.860
So the order is important so

02:51.960 --> 02:54.280
let me quickly reverse this

02:54.610 --> 03:00.100
and then with that we now get a reusable component, a reusable text input component where we can

03:00.100 --> 03:03.250
pass in styles from outside.

03:03.250 --> 03:06.500
Now what if we would pass an array of styles from outside though,

03:06.850 --> 03:16.840
what if we would pass our input style here but pass it in an array and maybe then also pass some other style,

03:16.840 --> 03:22.990
here an inline style but you could also get that from a stylesheet where you set the border color

03:23.020 --> 03:26.970
maybe to red. If you save this,

03:27.080 --> 03:30.580
you see this works out of the box without issues,

03:30.590 --> 03:33.620
also on Android, just a bit slow in reloading there.

03:33.860 --> 03:35.240
So that's pretty cool,

03:35.360 --> 03:42.110
I'll revert this but now we got a really flexible way of styling our components and that is why putting

03:42.110 --> 03:49.550
them into custom components, putting these default elements into custom components is a great idea to set

03:49.550 --> 03:50.870
up some default styling.
