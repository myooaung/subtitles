00:02.290 --> 00:07.960
Now with the fundamentals about React Native out of the way it's time to dive deeper into what it takes

00:07.960 --> 00:13.370
to build real react native applications and which core building blocks you meet there.

00:13.380 --> 00:19.810
We'll dive into the heart of building React Native apps so the core things you've got to know and dead

00:19.810 --> 00:25.810
would be components that you know how to use the built in components where to learn more about them

00:25.810 --> 00:28.420
and which important components are built in.

00:28.420 --> 00:34.420
And of course that you also have a clear understanding of how you add your own components and how you

00:34.420 --> 00:39.910
use your own components and how you would build a more realistic app with that mixture of built in and

00:39.910 --> 00:46.750
custom components and since components alone don't really make up for such a great app they would look

00:46.750 --> 00:49.090
pretty bad pretty boring.

00:49.090 --> 00:54.370
Will all the dive into styling and lay outing in this module because that's a number a core building

00:54.370 --> 01:01.870
block that you need to master need to know to build back native apps you'll learn how to style components

01:01.870 --> 01:08.140
and we'll dive into some more exotic styles if you want to call it like this you will learn how to add

01:08.140 --> 01:10.950
custom funds and so on in this module.

01:11.110 --> 01:17.680
And I already had a closer look at health Lex box works in the basics module and will still of course

01:17.680 --> 01:22.350
also use it in this module so you get more practice with that as well.

01:22.360 --> 01:27.840
No actually there is a third core building block that you will typically work with when building React

01:27.850 --> 01:33.310
Native apps and that's the native API modules you can work with.

01:33.310 --> 01:42.850
So things like using maps the user location camera these are all important tools or features many mobile

01:42.850 --> 01:49.300
apps of course need and many React Native apps therefore need and I will cover this thoroughly in this

01:49.300 --> 01:55.420
course but at a later point of time simply because we need some more advanced knowledge to really work

01:55.420 --> 01:56.890
with these tools.

01:56.890 --> 02:01.960
So therefore in this module we'll have a look at components how to build our own components which important

02:01.960 --> 02:07.750
components are built in how to style them how to create nice layouts and in detail we'll build a number

02:07.750 --> 02:08.930
app in this module.

02:08.950 --> 02:15.160
Still not the most complex one in the world but definitely more complex than the previous app we built.

02:15.370 --> 02:21.760
We'll dive deeper into building and custom components will add images and custom funds and in general

02:21.760 --> 02:28.600
we'll dive deeper into styling and into adding layouts with Flex box and into well building a more realistic

02:28.600 --> 02:29.870
app that looks good.

02:29.890 --> 02:31.210
So let's get started.
