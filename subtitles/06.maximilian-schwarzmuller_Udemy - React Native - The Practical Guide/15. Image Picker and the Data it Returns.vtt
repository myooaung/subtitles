00:02.800 --> 00:04.710
So you saw how you can pick the image,

00:04.720 --> 00:10.870
now one important note about the format of the image we get. You saw we get this res object which

00:10.960 --> 00:18.510
seems to have a URI which holds a path to the image we picked but that's all nice and all right.

00:19.260 --> 00:22.150
We also get the image in a different format though,

00:22.320 --> 00:29.560
we also get it as a base64 encoded string which basically is a string representation of the image which

00:29.560 --> 00:33.210
you can for example use to also transfer it over the device, 

00:33.210 --> 00:34.480
stuff like that.

00:34.680 --> 00:40.350
You can also use the normal image but I will actually use this base64

00:40.350 --> 00:43.570
version, so the image as a string

00:43.660 --> 00:45.380
to in the next module

00:45.390 --> 00:52.210
send it to some server so that we can store it on a server and not just on our local device where

00:52.290 --> 00:56.550
of course everything will be lost whenever our application relaunches.

00:56.550 --> 01:03.270
So therefore in on image picked, I will not only pass the URI but also another property which

01:03.270 --> 01:08.650
I'll name base64 where I extract res.data.

01:08.860 --> 01:15.570
Data is a property provided by this res object which will store or which will hold the image as base

01:15.570 --> 01:17.040
64 data,

01:17.290 --> 01:20.320
that is something I will use in the next lecture.

01:20.620 --> 01:26.800
If you don't need this however, you can turn it off by going to the configuration of the image picker

01:27.250 --> 01:30.100
and setting no data to true,

01:30.100 --> 01:35.260
this will improve the performance a little bit because converting the image to base64 takes a little

01:35.260 --> 01:38.310
bit of time and therefore, this can save performance

01:38.320 --> 01:44.680
but I will not use this here because I will actually take advantage of base64 to transfer it to my

01:44.680 --> 01:45.150
server as I

01:45.190 --> 01:46.100
just explained.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.940
Just wanted to make you aware of this,

01:47.950 --> 01:50.480
you can turn it off and you can use it, whatever you need,

01:50.650 --> 01:51.580
we will use it.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.630
With that let's conclude this module.
