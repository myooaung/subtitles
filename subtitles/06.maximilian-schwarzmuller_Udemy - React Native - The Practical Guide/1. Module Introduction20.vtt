We're nearing the end of this course, we're almost done,

00:05.820 --> 00:12.240
we're almost at the point of time where we're going to finish up our app and deploy it. Before doing

00:12.240 --> 00:12.960
that though,

00:13.170 --> 00:15.110
I want to polish it a bit.

00:15.210 --> 00:17.340
Now what does polishing include?

00:17.550 --> 00:20.810
I'm not talking about adding an app icon or stuff like that,

00:20.820 --> 00:25.850
we'll do this in the deployment section, so where you learn how to publish your app, instead

00:25.940 --> 00:32.310
here I want to have a look at our app and see what we can improve, some tiny things where I say this

00:32.310 --> 00:34.720
is not working in the best possible way

00:34.830 --> 00:37.010
or not working as I want it to work.

00:37.230 --> 00:40.040
So let's have a look at our application and thereafter

00:40.050 --> 00:41.490
let's fix these things.
