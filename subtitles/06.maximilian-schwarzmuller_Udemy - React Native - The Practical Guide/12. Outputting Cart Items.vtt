WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:04.450
Onto the card items.

00:04.730 --> 00:08.030
Now again I will create a separate component for each card.

00:08.030 --> 00:09.240
Item on one output here.

00:09.260 --> 00:15.200
I could do it in here but again it will be a a bit of a longer component and I don't want to blow this

00:15.200 --> 00:19.500
fall with it and I will actually also use it in a no place later.

00:19.610 --> 00:23.930
Which might sound strange given that we only have one card screen but you'll see what else we can use

00:23.930 --> 00:25.750
a card item later.

00:25.760 --> 00:30.890
So for that let's go back in the components folder and there in the shop folder maybe and add a card

00:30.920 --> 00:33.680
item j as file next to the product item.

00:33.710 --> 00:37.480
Now of course we have a normal react component in there so you know the game hold.

00:37.490 --> 00:38.850
Those are created.

00:39.080 --> 00:44.630
We import react from react and then here since this is the component that should output something we'll

00:44.630 --> 00:50.170
import a bunch of components from React Native the core primitives which with which we built the UI.

00:50.300 --> 00:57.990
I'll need a view I'll need a text I'll need a style sheet here for sure and then I'll again add my constant

00:57.990 --> 01:06.210
to your card item which receives props and then in the end here return some J as X code I will add my

01:06.210 --> 01:09.340
styles object here with style sheet.

01:09.480 --> 01:16.050
Create and I will export this as a default card item.

01:16.170 --> 01:21.540
Now the J has X code which should be returned here of course is always up to you but I will have a view

01:21.540 --> 01:28.070
here and in that view I want to output the quantity and the title of course.

01:28.290 --> 01:34.080
Also the total amount for discard item in case we added more than 1 then this is not just the price

01:34.080 --> 01:39.780
of a single item but of course price times quantity and I actually all went of a button that allows

01:39.780 --> 01:41.730
me to delete this item from the cart.

01:41.730 --> 01:43.460
A trash icon.

01:44.070 --> 01:53.180
So in the end I'll have a row here with a text and this text will have the quantity and the title so

01:53.420 --> 02:02.850
there I will have the quantity and the title and actually D should be a style differently so I'll wrap

02:02.850 --> 02:09.540
the quantity here into a separate text note and do the same for the titles so that I have two separate

02:10.650 --> 02:21.600
text notes here in the end and then after this text LOC here there should be a view to group to operate

02:21.600 --> 02:28.060
elements together and never piece of text which is the total amount for this item here.

02:28.110 --> 02:35.280
So amount and next to that a button or actually not a button but actually a principle icon.

02:35.280 --> 02:40.740
So we'll build my own touchable thing with touchable opacity and of course you could again do that platform

02:40.740 --> 02:46.650
differentiation for a ripple effect but I'll go with opacity on both platforms here and I will import

02:47.370 --> 02:54.090
icon Akins from Expo vector icons which we already added early on because I want to have just the I

02:54.090 --> 02:55.110
can here which we can press.

02:55.110 --> 03:00.480
So here I want to have touchable opacity and wrap that around an icon which we can add with they all

03:00.470 --> 03:07.040
icons as you added earlier in this course with this as a component here and then simply use a name which

03:07.100 --> 03:13.340
should actually differ by platform because the name is the icon identifier.

03:13.340 --> 03:19.190
And there we can check platform OS and if Dad is Android then the icon it should be used will have a

03:19.190 --> 03:29.670
name of MDA trash and Album wise it'll be IOW trash which renders a nice trash bin icon and we can also

03:29.670 --> 03:37.410
give this icon a size of let's say 20 free which again should would look quite nice and a color and

03:37.410 --> 03:43.890
here I'll actually use red because it's removing this item so it should have like a warning colour I'd

03:43.890 --> 03:52.490
say touchable opacity when pressed should do something and it should forward to press event to the component

03:52.490 --> 03:54.520
that uses the card item component.

03:54.520 --> 04:00.460
So I expect to get a on remove prop this name as always is up to you which holds a function that isn't

04:00.460 --> 04:11.170
the end executed then and we can all add a style here very simple style where I point Ed delete button

04:11.170 --> 04:14.360
for example and that's a style declaration we can add thereafter.

04:14.380 --> 04:17.120
Speaking of styles there are of course more styles to add.

04:17.260 --> 04:22.420
For example on the topmost view here I'll give it as a card item style.

04:22.420 --> 04:25.390
This text here Dan will receive US style

04:27.910 --> 04:29.410
of item data.

04:29.410 --> 04:37.060
Maybe this text with the quantity can receive a style which we can name styles not quantity again.

04:37.060 --> 04:40.720
All these style identifiers as always are totally up to you.

04:41.020 --> 04:43.600
Here on the title I have a title style.

04:44.970 --> 04:53.970
And then here on this view I'll add a style of item data again so I'll reuse this style because I won't

04:53.970 --> 05:05.760
have the same set up here and this amount here will also get a style of amount so a bunch of styles

05:05.760 --> 05:06.420
to add.

05:06.420 --> 05:09.230
Let's go down to the style sheet in there.

05:09.450 --> 05:13.640
Add the card item which is our root stall.

05:13.970 --> 05:16.620
Then item data and quantity.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.500
So item data

05:20.780 --> 05:21.890
quantity.

05:23.500 --> 05:33.140
Then the title here and the amount and last but not least that delete button.

05:33.140 --> 05:38.490
So that's also something we have to add here now in the delete button.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.100
That's simple.

05:39.100 --> 05:46.930
I'll just add a margin to the left of 20 to have some spacing between the icon and the text that sits

05:46.930 --> 05:47.470
next to it.

05:48.750 --> 05:52.070
And with that let's go to the card item there.

05:52.110 --> 05:57.010
I want to have a padding of 10 a background color of white.

05:57.010 --> 06:01.930
I'll not use my card look here I'll not add a shadow here you could do that but I prefer a different

06:01.930 --> 06:02.420
look.

06:02.560 --> 06:06.700
Important as flex direction rose so that all the items in that view.

06:06.700 --> 06:13.330
So this text and this view are sitting next to each other in one and the same row justify content should

06:13.330 --> 06:21.720
be space between so that all empty spaces between these two blocks of content and are all at a margin

06:22.380 --> 06:24.660
in horizontal direction of 20.

06:24.880 --> 06:29.250
So there's some spacing to the left and to the right around my card items.

06:29.880 --> 06:36.000
Now item data that's the style we're repeating around quantity and title and amount and the delete button

06:36.630 --> 06:46.360
item data should have flex direction road to make sure the items in there are positioned in a row and

06:46.360 --> 06:55.370
I'll set a line items here to Center two central content vertically now for the quantity year I want

06:55.370 --> 07:05.440
to set a font family of open dash sense by the way we can actually all use a view here instead of a

07:05.440 --> 07:10.220
text around these two text notes because I'm not setting any texture specific styles here.

07:10.360 --> 07:15.430
So let's take a view instead but with that back to the quantity we can give is a fun family of open

07:15.430 --> 07:22.240
sense a color of maybe this dark grayish color which we used before or for prices.

07:22.240 --> 07:27.820
Now for the quantity and a font size of 16 maybe.

07:27.820 --> 07:35.740
And then here for the title I'll set a font family of open Sands bold to make that bold gift is a font

07:35.740 --> 07:43.760
size of 16 to though and on the amount here I'll do the exact same thing.

07:46.090 --> 07:52.960
Therefore of course we could also emerged as into one and the same style maybe named as main text or

07:52.960 --> 07:53.820
anything like that.

07:53.830 --> 08:00.010
Get rid of the amount since we have the exact same style definitions and now use the main text here

08:00.010 --> 08:02.350
instead of title and here instead of amount

08:05.070 --> 08:05.710
OK.

08:05.730 --> 08:06.840
This is a card item.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.900
Now let's use it in the card screen.

08:08.970 --> 08:11.040
With the help of a flat list there.

08:11.280 --> 08:16.080
Because right now we're not outputting any items there on the card screen.

08:16.380 --> 08:19.740
So this view here can be replaced with flat list.

08:19.740 --> 08:27.080
Now and the data we sit there should be an array of card items and that's just what we have here.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.030
The card items constant.

08:29.150 --> 08:31.700
So let's use this here.

08:31.700 --> 08:32.240
Now here.

08:32.240 --> 08:37.550
I'll also add a key extractor and here you definitely need to add it to let React Native know where

08:37.550 --> 08:43.100
your key can be found because every item in here in the ends of this format and does has neither a key

08:43.190 --> 08:48.650
nor an I.D. property but we know that product I.D. can be used as a key because this will be unique

08:48.650 --> 08:49.910
for every item.

08:49.910 --> 08:54.920
So here I point at item dot product I.D. in the end.

08:54.920 --> 09:00.030
And now for a render item I want to use this card item we just added.

09:00.140 --> 09:10.400
So here we need to import card item from the components folder the shop folder and they are a card item

09:11.060 --> 09:17.850
and then use this card item component down there in our render function where we get our item data in

09:17.850 --> 09:26.040
the end and where we then return or a card item like this now on the card item we need to pass in some

09:26.040 --> 09:28.240
data right in the card item.

09:28.250 --> 09:34.350
Right now I have dummy place holders of course here I expect to get my quantity let's say on the prop

09:34.350 --> 09:42.080
named quantity I expect to get my title on maybe a prop named title and the amount on a prop named amount

09:42.090 --> 09:47.640
and there I will call to fixed to to make sure that we always have two decimal places there and we also

09:47.660 --> 09:49.910
have to on remove prop which we expect right.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.830
So we got quantity tidal amount and on remove.

09:53.830 --> 10:01.780
So back in the card screen that's what we have to add the quantity is of course item data dot item dot

10:01.780 --> 10:06.740
quantity because a single item here is of course such item.

10:06.940 --> 10:15.180
Therefore we'll have a quantity keep and besides the quantity we have to pass in the title the amount

10:15.330 --> 10:16.930
and on remove.

10:17.010 --> 10:22.860
So title is of course item data dot item dot product title.

10:22.890 --> 10:30.810
That's the name I chose there for amount we can pass in item data dot item dot if we have a look at

10:30.810 --> 10:38.550
how we define our data that would be the sum that's the sum the amount for one item no matter how much

10:38.790 --> 10:42.840
quantity we have in there or respecting quantity we have actually.

10:43.110 --> 10:49.770
And then last but not least for on remove we should point at a function and at the moment we have no

10:49.770 --> 10:50.600
logic for this.

10:50.640 --> 10:57.370
So I'll just point at an empty function this is now a card item as I want to render it let's give this

10:57.400 --> 11:07.540
a try let's add to red shirts and a blue carpet go to the cart and now I got text strings must be rendered

11:07.540 --> 11:14.940
within a text component and it's pointing at card item line 14.

11:14.950 --> 11:17.290
So let's have a look at that.

11:17.380 --> 11:23.590
Yeah it's this year of which my idea you automatically edit does whitespace I want to have you're after

11:23.650 --> 11:26.270
my quantity I indeed want to have that here.

11:26.440 --> 11:32.810
So I will just add one extra whitespace here before I close my text now with Dad let's try this again.

11:32.830 --> 11:35.530
2 Red Shirts 1 blue carpet.

11:35.580 --> 11:36.920
See the amount here.

11:36.950 --> 11:38.470
See the title here.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.990
See the sum this of course also adds up to this total sum.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.730
Now it's time to make this delete button work.
