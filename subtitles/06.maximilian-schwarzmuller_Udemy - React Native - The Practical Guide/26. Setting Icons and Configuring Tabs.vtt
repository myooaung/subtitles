00:02.270 --> 00:05.450
So how can we assign icons here.

00:05.450 --> 00:09.580
How can we then also make sure that we use the color.

00:09.590 --> 00:10.990
We want to use.

00:11.090 --> 00:12.760
Let's start with the color.

00:12.760 --> 00:17.920
Before we add the icons just like the create stack navigate navigator function.

00:18.020 --> 00:20.290
Create bottom tab navigator.

00:20.290 --> 00:25.250
All it takes a second argument first argument is your configuration object where you configured a different

00:25.280 --> 00:27.370
tabs and the screens they point at.

00:27.410 --> 00:33.600
Second argument is also an object where you can configure the navigator in general.

00:33.610 --> 00:35.290
And there you have a couple of settings.

00:35.330 --> 00:40.120
Again official docs are the place to go to learn about every single setting here.

00:40.310 --> 00:45.340
One of the more important settings here are did tab bar options.

00:45.380 --> 00:52.970
This is another object and in there you can in detail control how the tab bar appears how it's styled.

00:53.090 --> 00:59.180
You can set up a inactive tint color which is the colored tap has which is currently well not active.

00:59.180 --> 01:03.160
You can set up an active tint color and that's what we actually need here.

01:03.170 --> 01:08.600
You can set up an active background color in an inactive background Khalid color as well of course to

01:08.600 --> 01:11.720
also change the background of the taps here if you want to.

01:11.930 --> 01:16.540
And therefore you have a lot of possibilities to really fine tuned as to your requirements.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.000
And here also the act of tint color because that's all I need here.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.910
But of course feel free to play around with that and change background colors as well and change our

01:25.910 --> 01:32.330
settings and I'll set my active tint color to a value for my color is constant which I import here.

01:32.330 --> 01:35.390
I'll set it to colors accent color.

01:35.410 --> 01:37.300
You haven't used it before but now I'll use it.

01:37.370 --> 01:42.290
And that's this orange color which we now have to show for it this is how easy we change to color.

01:42.290 --> 01:45.900
The active tap has no that's one thing.

01:46.110 --> 01:50.280
Please also note that this of course doesn't add icon.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.020
And how would it.

01:51.030 --> 01:57.300
We're not saying anything about the icon you want to add now for adding the icon the straightforward

01:57.480 --> 02:01.860
pattern I think is that you go to your root conflict here.

02:01.860 --> 02:07.710
So to the conflict where you map screens to your taps and you use the longer form where you at the screen

02:07.710 --> 02:12.000
property and where you then also add navigation options.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.370
By the way you could also do this directly in the component of course by adding navigation options just

02:17.400 --> 02:19.700
as we did it before.

02:19.710 --> 02:25.080
However since meals here actually is a navigator the only place of adding navigation options to that

02:25.110 --> 02:26.560
is of course here.

02:26.700 --> 02:31.330
Or also here on create stack navigator.

02:31.560 --> 02:37.290
There you could all just set up a navigation options key here on the second argument on this object

02:37.320 --> 02:42.390
you pass as a second argument to create stack navigator where you configured the overall navigator to

02:42.390 --> 02:48.180
give this navigator itself some navigation options because the navigation options we assign to the meals

02:48.180 --> 02:54.060
navigator so to the stack navigator are now two options which are taken into account by the tab Navigator

02:54.270 --> 03:00.810
which uses this meals Navigator as a nested navigator and the navigation objects we can set here include

03:01.140 --> 03:10.680
a tap bar I can we can add tap or I can here and tap our I can actually is a function it's not a single

03:10.770 --> 03:18.900
I Can you point it but instead this is a function it's a function dad receives some tab information

03:18.990 --> 03:23.300
you could say whips should go here.

03:23.330 --> 03:28.490
That's the argument we get automatically because this function of course will be called by react navigation

03:28.970 --> 03:34.340
and tap our Ike and this function here has to return the icon which you want to render for this tap.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.720
So in this case for the meals tab

03:39.680 --> 03:46.360
that means that I need to be able to use icons here and for this we can import ionic guns or any other

03:46.370 --> 03:50.680
I can set you one I will use from at Expo vector icons.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.440
Again feel free to install this package.

03:52.450 --> 03:57.400
Normally it should be installed automatically when working with Expo but you can simply run npm install

03:57.400 --> 04:03.040
dash dash save at Expo slash vector dash icons to be sure that you have it installed and you can use

04:03.100 --> 04:07.980
any icon said you want but I always use day on weekends throughout this course I'll stick to them.

04:08.230 --> 04:12.340
With that you can use ionic pins as a component as you learned early on of course.

04:12.340 --> 04:18.580
So here we can just return ionic pins like this to render an ionic an icon and you can now use any I

04:18.580 --> 04:20.090
can name you want here.

04:20.170 --> 04:24.090
And here I want to use Iowa's restaurant which is simply I can.

04:24.100 --> 04:29.090
I found in the list of icons.

04:29.320 --> 04:32.750
This list here which I also showed earlier there.

04:32.870 --> 04:37.320
It does Iowa's restaurant icon which I picked which I now use which I point at here.

04:37.450 --> 04:40.120
This is the icon I want to render.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.610
I'll give it a size of 25.

04:42.610 --> 04:43.990
You can experiment with that.

04:43.990 --> 04:46.890
What I found 25 to look quite decent here.

04:46.900 --> 04:50.200
Indie Tap Bar and a color and that's not important.

04:50.350 --> 04:57.610
Off tap info dot tint color because the color we set here of course should be our tint color.

04:57.610 --> 04:58.810
We set up here.

04:58.810 --> 05:01.980
Now of course we could hardly notice two color acts and color here.

05:01.990 --> 05:06.030
But if we then change it down there we have to remember that we all to change it up there.

05:06.040 --> 05:11.440
The good thing is and that's why this is a function that react navigation calls this function for us

05:11.440 --> 05:17.830
and gives us some vital information about how our tap bar is configured in that tap info object and

05:17.830 --> 05:23.350
that for example includes the 10 color we did set up so that we can dynamically retrieve this here for

05:23.350 --> 05:29.440
coloring the icon so that if we change the color down there for the Tap Bar it's automatically reflected

05:29.470 --> 05:30.910
in our icons up there.

05:30.940 --> 05:35.810
So it's a little convenience we have here which we can use here.

05:35.810 --> 05:42.740
So with that I'm rendering this I can for the meals and for the favorites we can now use a similar approach.

05:42.770 --> 05:48.200
Use that longer form where we set up the screen here and then add navigation options here which will

05:48.200 --> 05:52.400
be merged with any navigation options we set up on favorites screen.

05:52.430 --> 05:57.400
But please note that of course you could absolutely also setup the navigation option options here in

05:57.400 --> 06:00.920
the favorites screen component they offer but to keep it all in one place.

06:00.980 --> 06:03.620
I'll do it in my navigation set up here instead.

06:03.620 --> 06:06.150
So these are my navigation options for this screen.

06:06.170 --> 06:11.420
Justice for this navigator the meals navigator we can of course set up navigation options for a screen.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.280
That's what we did float the entire module after all.

06:14.330 --> 06:19.880
And there I want to do essentially the same so I'll just copy that added here to this navigation options

06:19.940 --> 06:25.790
object and the only thing that difference here is the I Can I want to use here it's Iowa's star instead

06:25.790 --> 06:30.130
of Iowa's restaurant.

06:30.290 --> 06:36.170
And with that if we save this I actually get an error because since I now use J as X and here we need

06:36.170 --> 06:42.230
to import to react of course that's how react works because J is X behind the scenes is transformed

06:42.260 --> 06:48.510
to react create element as you know and therefore now after adding the react import.

06:48.530 --> 06:54.680
Here in the meals navigator J.S. file this works and now we have icons which automatically take our

06:54.680 --> 06:58.180
tint color and that's how easy you can add icons.

06:58.270 --> 07:03.740
Now besides setting the I can you might want to set the label as well and you'll see that by default

07:03.860 --> 07:10.580
label meals and favorites is simply the identifier we assigned here when we set up our tab navigation

07:10.610 --> 07:12.050
meals and favorites.

07:12.050 --> 07:17.540
Now often that makes sense but in case you want to have a different label then in the navigation options

07:17.630 --> 07:20.780
of your screen you load here into this tab.

07:20.780 --> 07:28.910
You can set up a tab bar label property and in their website that is just a string where you could have

07:28.910 --> 07:34.310
favorites with an exclamation mark if you set this you'll see that now you have favorites with an exclamation

07:34.310 --> 07:37.040
mark here instead of just favorites as before.

07:37.040 --> 07:42.500
So you can overwrite this default label which is assumed which normally is your identifier.

07:42.500 --> 07:47.510
If you want a different one you can overwrite it and of course there are more options you can set and

07:47.510 --> 07:52.700
attach to find a link to the official docs for this navigator where you can learn all about the options

07:52.700 --> 08:00.740
you can set up on navigator itself but then also on the navigation options of child screen's so off

08:00.740 --> 08:04.850
nested screens or nested navigators inside of the tab Navigator.

08:04.850 --> 08:05.870
So what we're setting up here.
