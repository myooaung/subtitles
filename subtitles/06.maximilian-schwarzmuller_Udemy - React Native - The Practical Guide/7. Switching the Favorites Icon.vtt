00:02.510 --> 00:05.000
Let's start by changing that star.

00:05.020 --> 00:08.580
I can based on whether this currently is a favorite or not.

00:08.600 --> 00:14.390
I want to have debt filled star only if it is a favorite and an empty star if it's not.

00:14.390 --> 00:19.040
So in the end and the meal detailed screen we need to swap that I can which were rendering here based

00:19.040 --> 00:25.270
on the favorite status of this meal we loaded here no again.

00:25.350 --> 00:32.040
Problem here is we can find out whether that meal is a favorite or not in a very easy way in the component

00:32.040 --> 00:34.910
function but not really in the navigation options.

00:34.920 --> 00:42.010
So again we'll need parents to communicate between these two but overall that's not too difficult.

00:43.620 --> 00:49.830
What I want to do here is I want to get my favorite meals with the help of use selector in the meal

00:49.830 --> 00:56.260
detailed screen component function with the above state and then state thought meals dad favorite meals

00:56.270 --> 01:01.020
so I want to get all my favorite meals and now I simply want to check if Dad meal is part of the favorite

01:01.020 --> 01:01.380
meals

01:04.190 --> 01:12.410
and actually we can if refined isn't even named as current meal is favorite and into selector not just

01:12.410 --> 01:18.830
return to favorite meals but add a bit more logic in there and simply add a check where we call some

01:18.950 --> 01:23.300
which is all the built in method which returns true if the condition which we're about to specify is

01:23.300 --> 01:30.170
true for at least one item in that array and there I check for every meal that's in there if the meal

01:30.320 --> 01:41.090
idea is equal to the meal I.D. I retrieve here and hence I have to swap swap lines.

01:41.260 --> 01:46.570
So here I get the meal idea ofthe meal where we're loading on the detailed screen and then I check my

01:46.570 --> 01:54.290
favorite meals if that lady is part of them which would mean that this meal is part of our favorites.

01:54.320 --> 01:59.600
So with that we have this current meal is favorite information now we need to pass it to the navigation

01:59.630 --> 02:07.010
options and again we can do this with use of fact maybe down there justice before provide a function

02:07.010 --> 02:15.020
here and an array of dependencies in the function here I'll set props navigation set pyramids to merge

02:15.050 --> 02:21.620
more data into my parents and that is maybe the is fav PARAM NAME IS UP TO YOU which holds the current

02:21.620 --> 02:27.740
meal is favorite value so that value which we just arrived and now a dependency of that function of

02:27.740 --> 02:33.710
that use a fact call I mean is of course current Miller's favorite when dad changes I want to forward

02:33.710 --> 02:41.170
the new information to the parents and they offered to the header otherwise does affect shouldn't rerun.

02:41.240 --> 02:48.740
So now back in the navigation options we can retrieve that information here is favorite can be retrieved

02:48.740 --> 02:54.960
from navigation data dot navigation with the help of get param and there I named.

02:54.980 --> 02:58.640
This is FAF here it is.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.360
So that's the name by which you can retrieve it.

03:01.370 --> 03:06.080
Now we have to is favorite information in the header and we can now use this to render a different I

03:06.080 --> 03:06.610
can here.

03:06.620 --> 03:12.260
So instead of always rendering Iowa's star I'll have a dynamic expression here and I'll check if his

03:12.260 --> 03:13.610
favorite is true.

03:13.610 --> 03:17.440
If it is then I want to use Iowa's star which is this field star.

03:17.810 --> 03:18.500
If it's not.

03:18.620 --> 03:22.220
I'll render Iowa's star outline.

03:22.220 --> 03:23.570
Dad will be an empty star.

03:24.730 --> 03:28.960
With that we hopefully have a set up that works as expected.

03:29.020 --> 03:30.400
I go to the spaghetti.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.760
Now it is a sad empty star if I click this.

03:32.770 --> 03:35.640
It's a film star and it's part of the favorites.

03:35.650 --> 03:41.020
If I didn't go to the detail screen here you see takes a bit until the stars followed here as well we'll

03:41.020 --> 03:47.590
have to fix this fire now click it here and we go back to meals there it all is updated and that's the

03:47.590 --> 03:53.660
magic of redux it updates one part of the application if something related changes in another part.

03:53.740 --> 03:58.570
That's exactly how it should behave here so that generally works.

03:58.570 --> 04:05.890
The only thing that wasn't too beautiful is that this star here initially is empty and only gets filled

04:05.890 --> 04:08.640
out after this is loaded so we can fix that.

04:08.650 --> 04:15.760
But other than that this is working as it should now to fix it is initially empty star again.

04:15.880 --> 04:16.950
We can use a workaround.

04:16.990 --> 04:21.400
I explained earlier for that initial header data.

04:21.550 --> 04:24.040
We don't want to wait for the first render to finish.

04:24.040 --> 04:29.140
Instead we should pass this initial data into this component when we navigate to it.

04:30.090 --> 04:35.910
Hence it's time for the meal list again where we have this navigation action to all move forward.

04:35.910 --> 04:43.170
This is fav ki already so does ki which I tried to extract here and the meal details screen down there

04:44.040 --> 04:50.580
get param is fast I want to pass the current value when we load this component when we load this screen

04:50.790 --> 04:55.680
here from inside the meal list which is the component which triggers that navigation to meal detail

04:56.390 --> 04:57.540
and of course the error.

04:57.690 --> 05:03.390
Item data item is a single meal but that doesn't hold information about whether that's part of our favorites

05:03.390 --> 05:04.070
or not.

05:04.180 --> 05:08.460
But of course we can find out whether that's the case or not in the meal list.

05:08.460 --> 05:14.360
We can also tap into the redux store not just from the screen components.

05:14.370 --> 05:22.260
So here I can also use as selector from react redux like this and then in my component here I can get

05:22.260 --> 05:31.560
my favorite meals with the help of U.S. selector where I get my state and then return state of meals

05:31.560 --> 05:34.150
stored favorite meals to get all my favorite meals.

05:34.260 --> 05:39.240
And now when we render a single meal item we can use that to find out whoever dad meal item as part

05:39.240 --> 05:41.070
of our favorites by the way.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.710
You can't use your selector in there.

05:43.770 --> 05:49.680
That would not be a valid usage because you must use react hooks only on the root level of your component

05:49.680 --> 05:53.950
function not in nested functions or nested if blocks or anything like that.

05:53.970 --> 05:56.370
So using use selector in here is not allowed.

05:57.430 --> 06:03.500
But we can use our favorite meals in there of course and therefore here we can find out whether this

06:03.830 --> 06:12.890
is a favorite by simply checking the favorite meals and looking for the meal where its ideas matches

06:12.890 --> 06:14.020
to item data.

06:14.090 --> 06:14.840
Item not ideas.

06:14.870 --> 06:20.990
So the idea of the meal we're currently rendering therefore is favorite will hold the item we found

06:20.990 --> 06:21.320
there.

06:21.350 --> 06:27.290
Alternatively we use some here which has a built in JavaScript method that will return true if any item

06:27.290 --> 06:29.930
and favorite meals matches this condition.

06:29.930 --> 06:35.570
So if his favorite is true we notice item is a favorite and therefore we can use is favorite as a value

06:35.570 --> 06:40.300
for his fav which we pass as an initial param to the meal detail screen.

06:40.460 --> 06:44.930
And now it is flickering star which initially is empty should be gone.

06:44.930 --> 06:50.630
Now if I market is as a favorite here in a leaf doesn't it come back it's filled out right from the

06:50.630 --> 06:51.550
start.

06:51.590 --> 06:56.660
Also on the favorite screen of course so that's that.

06:56.730 --> 06:58.830
This is how we can work with favorites.

06:58.830 --> 07:03.660
Let's now make sure we show some dummy text here on the favorite screen in case we got no data to display

07:03.680 --> 07:05.400
otherwise and thereafter.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.960
Let's take care about our filters.
