00:02.270 --> 00:08.540
Over this module you learned a lot about the react native basics, you learned how to react native app

00:08.570 --> 00:15.800
is created, how you can eject it and how you can run it on both real iOS or Android devices or their

00:15.800 --> 00:18.210
respective simulators as we do here.

00:18.590 --> 00:25.190
You learned how to use the basic components like this text input, a button, how to create lists and use images,

00:25.520 --> 00:32.900
how to use a modal on the image and also well close that or manage your state with it and how to do

00:32.900 --> 00:37.330
that to work and look nice on both Android and iOS,

00:37.410 --> 00:40.100
though we haven't had a too close look at styling yet,

00:40.130 --> 00:42.470
we'll do this later in the course.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.700
The basics should be set,

00:43.700 --> 00:47.510
now you should have a feeling for how you approach react native apps.

00:47.570 --> 00:53.400
You also probably saw that it's not like ionic or anything like that if you worked with that,

00:53.630 --> 01:00.560
you don't have the full suite of pre-styled components you throw in, you have some basic building

01:00.560 --> 01:01.040
blocks

01:01.040 --> 01:02.460
just like on the web

01:02.570 --> 01:09.170
and then it's up to you to apply styling and to make sure that the app looks and feels the way you want

01:09.200 --> 01:10.580
to look and feel

01:10.700 --> 01:14.290
but more of that again in the styling section.

01:14.330 --> 01:20.030
Now I want to move on and I want to move on into a field that's extremely important too, how you may use

01:20.030 --> 01:25.970
redux in your react native app because obviously redux is important in many react apps and it's no

01:25.970 --> 01:27.590
different for react native.

01:27.590 --> 01:30.820
So let's have a look at this in the next course module.
