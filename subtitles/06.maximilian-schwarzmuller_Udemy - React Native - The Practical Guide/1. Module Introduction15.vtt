00:02.210 --> 00:03.920
Welcome to this module.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.750
Now as always, we covered a lot in this course

00:06.890 --> 00:14.720
but one thing we haven't really had a closer look is how we style our react native application. For sure,

00:14.750 --> 00:20.320
we use some styling thus far but our app is far from being finished,

00:20.450 --> 00:27.440
some content is missing but the content we have also lacks some styling and we haven't talked about how

00:27.440 --> 00:30.880
you style apps differently for different platforms,

00:30.890 --> 00:37.200
so for iOS and Android, we haven't had at look at how you react to orientation changes.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.390
All these things, we haven't covered them,

00:39.500 --> 00:47.450
so time to do so in this module, to be precise we'll dive into styling components and elements the right

00:47.450 --> 00:47.830
way,

00:47.840 --> 00:53.120
this is the first thing we'll do, we'll not just talk about styling though, we'll also fill our app with

00:53.120 --> 00:53.900
more life,

00:53.960 --> 00:58.650
so we'll for example add some inputs to the authentication screen and so on.

00:58.670 --> 01:03.980
And of course we'll style all of that so that by the end of the module, we really have a nice looking

01:04.040 --> 01:08.470
application with all the features we can build thus far.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.020
You will also learn how to handle different platforms,

01:12.020 --> 01:17.630
so how to style your app differently or use different icons depending on whether you're running on iOS

01:17.630 --> 01:18.840
or Android,

01:18.950 --> 01:23.090
we'll also have a look at how we handle different devices or orientations,

01:23.090 --> 01:28.230
so not operating systems but what about different devices with different sizes

01:28.250 --> 01:34.970
or if you have a given device but you rotate it, how can you adjust your styling upon such events, how

01:34.970 --> 01:42.440
can you write styles that behave as good as possible and most importantly, which tools do you have to

01:42.440 --> 01:44.050
do all these things?

01:44.150 --> 01:51.510
And finally super important too, how may we add animations to our react native applications?

01:51.650 --> 01:55.700
Because obviously, some animations can really improve our application,

01:55.790 --> 02:01.010
they can give the user a better feeling, showing what he just did, give instant feedback,

02:01.010 --> 02:02.750
so super important.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.870
These are all the things we're going to cover, quite a lot,

02:05.900 --> 02:07.370
so let's dive into it.
