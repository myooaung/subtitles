00:02.070 --> 00:07.410
So in the places list screen I went to output well list of places unsurprisingly.

00:07.550 --> 00:09.780
And for Dad you know one component from React Native.

00:09.780 --> 00:14.010
We can import and that's the flat list flat list of course is perfect for outputting.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.620
Well a list.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.570
So here I will return flat list now.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.890
And I want to get access to my places.

00:21.930 --> 00:23.970
These are stored in a redux so we can.

00:23.970 --> 00:30.960
Or with the help of redux so we can import react redux here or to be precise from that package we import.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.740
Use selector because now in our component we can use that to get access to data stored in redux.

00:37.740 --> 00:41.630
So here I want to get access to my places with the help of use selector.

00:41.640 --> 00:47.190
That's a breeze we pass in that function which receives our redux store our redux state which is stored

00:47.190 --> 00:53.490
in the stored air and there I want to get access to the places slice in here I use places because an

00:53.490 --> 00:59.880
app J.S. I use places as identifier here that takes us to the slice managed with the places reducer

01:00.240 --> 01:02.880
and in that reducer we have another place is key.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.870
So in the end here I want to access state that places or places and with that we know which kind of

01:09.870 --> 01:12.660
data we want to feed into the flat list.

01:12.660 --> 01:19.800
Now again I will also add a key extractor here to tell David flat list where to find a unique idea for

01:19.800 --> 01:23.480
every item and for me that's in the ideas property of every place.

01:23.490 --> 01:29.820
And of course we need to add render item so that we get our item data data and then output a component

01:29.820 --> 01:32.920
for every item which we want to output.

01:33.060 --> 01:38.730
Now for that I'll actually create a brand new component in the components folder and that's the place

01:38.790 --> 01:47.910
item J.S. file now to save some time I attached my place item JS fall to this lecture and you can just

01:48.180 --> 01:53.040
replace yours or the content of yours with mine but I'll of course walk you through what I'm doing in

01:53.040 --> 01:53.790
there.

01:53.910 --> 01:59.520
This is a basic component as we all to build it multiple times throughout this course I just have my

01:59.520 --> 02:05.460
own component here which is able to output a image because we'll need that later which then has a view

02:05.520 --> 02:09.240
with two pieces of text that will sit next to this image.

02:09.270 --> 02:15.930
Thanks to the styling which I applied on data their output the title and the address of that place of

02:15.930 --> 02:21.900
course that's information we don't have yet but will add this throughout this module and we have a touchable

02:21.900 --> 02:27.720
opacity component around this sort of we can press every place and when we do press it we trigger a

02:27.720 --> 02:31.400
function that we expect to get on the on select prop.

02:31.440 --> 02:36.990
Now in my styling here I set this up such dead the image and this text blocks it next to each other

02:36.990 --> 02:43.230
in a row here with Flex direction row the image images then the rounded image.

02:43.230 --> 02:49.860
So it's around image as a circle with a full back background colour in case we have no image yet which

02:49.860 --> 02:56.310
you of course all can change too for example disgraced colour then we have the info container which

02:56.310 --> 03:01.590
is the container holding the two pieces of text which now are organised in a column above each other

03:02.010 --> 03:07.290
and then we have the title which is a little bit bigger than the address and there I actually also want

03:07.290 --> 03:14.210
to use black as a text colour that's the setup I'll use here and that's the place item which we can

03:14.210 --> 03:17.330
now import into the places list screen.

03:17.330 --> 03:27.850
So there we can import place item from components place item and output this year in render items.

03:27.850 --> 03:34.780
So there I want to output place item as a self closing component and now place item this new component

03:34.780 --> 03:40.630
needs some input data we need to pass an on select prop which points at a function that should be executed

03:40.630 --> 03:47.560
when we tap an icon we need to pass on the image prop a title prop and address prop so for props which

03:47.560 --> 03:53.730
need to be provided let's do that here for the image we got no image yet.

03:53.740 --> 03:59.500
So here I'll just pass in null for the moment for the title we can do that of course we can point at

03:59.590 --> 04:06.010
item data dot item dot title because a single item is just the item following our place model and that

04:06.010 --> 04:13.100
of course has a title prop so we can safely access that for the address we don't have that yet so I'll

04:13.100 --> 04:14.470
set this to no.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.260
And 4 on select.

04:16.280 --> 04:18.440
Well we can of course set this there.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.940
I want to go to a new page.

04:19.970 --> 04:25.070
After all so we can do this with an anonymous inline function here or with a named function stored in

04:25.070 --> 04:26.750
a separate constant whatever you want.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.300
I'll do it in line.

04:28.610 --> 04:35.440
And there I can use props navigation dot navigate and go to the place detailed screen with the place

04:35.450 --> 04:40.580
detail identifier which of course in my navigator is this identifier here

04:43.380 --> 04:43.950
and there.

04:43.980 --> 04:50.610
I also want to pass some extra data some param so I'll pass a second argument here to navigate and there

04:50.610 --> 04:52.860
are two pieces of information when I pass.

04:52.860 --> 04:57.680
That's the place title and that of course is item data dot item dot title.

04:57.750 --> 05:01.770
So the exact same thing I'm feeding into the title prop here.

05:01.770 --> 05:06.650
And that's also the place I.D. which is item data dot item dot I.D..

05:06.720 --> 05:08.890
We have that I.D. also already.

05:08.910 --> 05:14.640
So that's already something we're generating when we add a new place with Dad we have a place item which

05:14.640 --> 05:19.800
takes us to the place detailed screen and since we already have some basic skeleton in that screen.

05:19.950 --> 05:21.890
We should be able to see that.

05:21.960 --> 05:28.170
One thing I will add to the place details screen however is my navigation options configuration where

05:28.170 --> 05:34.950
I need that dynamic function which then returns a configuration object because dear I want to set the

05:34.950 --> 05:41.040
header title based on the parents I'm getting because in a place Listerine I'm passing in a place title

05:41.040 --> 05:47.070
and place I.D. parameter to this new screen place title is what I want to extract and set here in my

05:47.070 --> 05:47.890
header.

05:47.940 --> 05:56.040
So there I can set the header title to native nav data dot navigation dot get param place title so that

05:56.070 --> 06:02.910
we have this title in the header and now with that let's give it a try let's save everything and add

06:02.910 --> 06:11.230
a new place a test click safe place we're taken back we're seeing that here if a tap and we go to the

06:11.230 --> 06:18.100
detail screen where we see that in the header that's all to give it a try on Android with a test safeties

06:18.700 --> 06:26.070
click on it and that all works so that's the basic flow for this but one thing we still haven't done

06:26.070 --> 06:30.300
of course is use some native functionality.

06:30.570 --> 06:34.710
So now it's really time that we do that and I want to start with the camera.
