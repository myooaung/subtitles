00:02.110 --> 00:07.570
Now for that I will install one extra package in this project with NPM installed Ashutosh safe and that's

00:07.570 --> 00:09.390
redux thunk.

00:09.400 --> 00:15.430
That's a so-called redux middleware which we can call which allows us to change our action creators

00:15.520 --> 00:21.690
here in the actions folder such that we can actually do asynchronous stuff there that we can handle

00:21.700 --> 00:28.620
side effects there so that we can for example send HDP requests in such a action creator and only ones

00:28.620 --> 00:30.580
that HDP requests is done.

00:30.580 --> 00:35.080
We're actually dispatching an action to the redux store because that's important.

00:35.080 --> 00:41.500
Your read ex flow in general needs to be synchronous so you can't wait for some action to complete before

00:41.500 --> 00:48.480
you update your state with redux thunk that changes your reducer still needs to be synchronous.

00:48.550 --> 00:54.970
So no async code must be in here but your action creator can now be asynchronous.

00:54.970 --> 01:00.460
This means that you now can send the request as part of your action creator and only once you're done

01:00.460 --> 01:06.820
with that you actually dispatch the action to the reducer and you'll see this in practice and a second

01:06.820 --> 01:11.260
for example here in create product which is the thing I want to start with.

01:11.410 --> 01:18.760
However to use this new feature we have to enable redux thunk and we do this in the app chars file there

01:18.820 --> 01:19.660
from redux.

01:19.660 --> 01:27.780
You need to import apply middleware and in addition you need to import a new thing and that's redux.

01:27.780 --> 01:33.060
Thank you can names however you want from redux thunk again.

01:33.060 --> 01:37.620
This can be named however you want because we're using the default export of that package.

01:37.620 --> 01:43.440
Now you use that in creates the word there you can parse a second argument and there you should call

01:43.440 --> 01:49.550
apply middleware as a function and to that function pass redux thunk.

01:49.560 --> 01:55.500
This will now basically an able that package which in turn allows us to well do this different thing

01:55.500 --> 02:00.870
in the action creator I was referring to and that different thing is now what will have a look at next.
