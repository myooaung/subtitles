00:02.520 --> 00:08.550
Before we continue with the bill or publishing process and therefore get it to the app stores let's

00:08.550 --> 00:10.300
continue configuring this.

00:10.300 --> 00:15.330
Number one there are some blanks here like the description which is missing which you could add by adding

00:15.330 --> 00:16.440
a description.

00:16.440 --> 00:21.540
Key here with some text and that would be the description that shows up here.

00:21.660 --> 00:24.640
Important that's not a description that shows up in the app stores.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.950
That's really just a description that shows up here and you can learn more about the description all

00:28.950 --> 00:34.200
the arrow keys you can set here in this page.

00:34.230 --> 00:37.110
There are a lot of settings you can set after all.

00:37.110 --> 00:42.780
Now what I'm interested in right now is the icon and splash screen part because that's the icon.

00:42.780 --> 00:44.610
People will see on the home screen.

00:44.610 --> 00:49.920
Of course not yet because right now we're not publishing the apps to the App Store but that will change

00:50.700 --> 00:51.670
and the splash screen.

00:51.690 --> 00:54.140
Well that's what users see when our app loads.

00:54.330 --> 00:58.620
And both are things you typically want to customize.

00:58.680 --> 01:05.810
Now Expo gives you an icon and a splash screen out of the box but both as well just an empty place holder.

01:05.820 --> 01:06.120
Right.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.720
So that's not too amazing.

01:08.730 --> 01:12.590
Instead we want to provide our own icon an own splash screen image here.

01:12.600 --> 01:17.850
Now you're really flexible regarding what you provide here but in general it's a good idea to provide

01:17.850 --> 01:22.840
an icon indeed 1024 by 1024 resolution.

01:22.890 --> 01:30.720
So ask where I can as a input and for the splash screen you can build a splash screen as described in

01:30.720 --> 01:35.550
the official docs where you can learn more about how you could build such a splash screen how you could

01:35.550 --> 01:38.520
structure it and so on.

01:38.520 --> 01:45.600
Now I prepared something for you which you can use to now follow along which you should not use for

01:45.660 --> 01:51.930
real deployment because well these assets are just for this course not for you to use in your app which

01:51.930 --> 01:57.870
you plan to deploy advert it had hatched you find the icons zip file.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.270
Now if you unzip this in there you'll find a place as PMG file which you can of course drag and drop

02:04.270 --> 02:05.500
into the assets folder.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.840
You can also delete the icon BGP and chief all there if you want.

02:08.890 --> 02:15.460
You can also delete the splash pin she filed because in this attached folder you'll also find this splash

02:15.580 --> 02:19.720
icon and chief all what you can of course there for all the drag and drop in here.

02:19.720 --> 02:24.030
Now these are just some icons I created which we can use now.

02:24.280 --> 02:29.590
And back in the app Chase and file we now can point at the custom icons important you should provide.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.720
Pinkie falls as I'm doing it here.

02:31.720 --> 02:38.170
So now 40 I can we can point that assets places PMG and for the splash we can point that assets splash

02:38.260 --> 02:46.840
underscore I can PMG now as a background color dear we can use a dark black color like hex code 1 7

02:46.840 --> 02:47.940
1 7 1 7.

02:48.010 --> 02:55.180
This should be a tax code color like this and resize mode here it can be set to contain or cover cover

02:55.180 --> 03:00.610
will basically stretch the I can to take you full available width and height contain will keep the icon

03:00.610 --> 03:06.190
size center it and have that background color behind the icon.

03:06.190 --> 03:10.090
Now if we do that we can already see the result of this.

03:10.240 --> 03:18.730
If we just NPM start this sort of server as we did many times in this course or exposed start and we

03:18.730 --> 03:26.010
then launched as on an emulator Android or IOW again as I'm doing it here now this launches it there.

03:26.200 --> 03:31.510
And now you see does this de splash screen already taken a new one with the image in there which is

03:31.520 --> 03:35.920
our big but that's on purpose so that we can clearly see it and the background color which is slightly

03:35.920 --> 03:40.180
different so that you all have a chance of seeing that of course you could pick the same color to have

03:40.180 --> 03:42.480
a seamless splash screen here.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.510
So that's working and let's wait for that to finish.

03:45.710 --> 03:50.160
And here's the app running and now you see your icon here as well.

03:50.170 --> 03:55.240
If you go into the tasks which are you see it's not looking that great with the background but that's

03:55.240 --> 03:56.720
something we can improve.

03:56.740 --> 04:02.740
But here is the icon in general that is working we see both the splash screen and the icon and I guess

04:02.770 --> 04:05.610
it would be the same now as you can tell.

04:05.610 --> 04:08.230
The icon doesn't look that great on Android though.

04:08.250 --> 04:13.260
The reason for data is that Android depending on the wording of Android you're running on your device

04:13.650 --> 04:20.310
uses different icons newer more recent versions of Android use these so-called adaptive icons which

04:20.310 --> 04:25.980
already has rounded icons where you have your icon in the middle and then some background color or a

04:25.980 --> 04:28.060
background image even behind them.

04:28.110 --> 04:30.900
Older versions would use Square icons.

04:30.900 --> 04:38.930
Now you can cater for this by providing a more detailed configuration for Android and also for ISIS

04:39.000 --> 04:45.770
if you want instead of having this general icon key here you can setup platform specific settings and

04:45.770 --> 04:48.800
it's all the something you learn in your official box of course.

04:48.870 --> 04:55.380
There you can find information on how you may configure icon in Splash.

04:55.380 --> 05:01.150
That's nice but then also how you may configure IAW in a specific way.

05:01.260 --> 05:07.310
And there you can set up icon specific for eyewear as if you would want to use this.

05:07.480 --> 05:13.710
Of course the same is true for the splash screen so you can basically add an hour's notice to your configuration.

05:13.720 --> 05:21.910
We already have that here even and in there you could also add an icon and then also a splash configuration

05:21.910 --> 05:27.450
which looks exactly or which would look exactly like the route configuration we have here.

05:27.520 --> 05:33.730
But now you could basically override these general root level settings and have a specific icon for

05:33.730 --> 05:36.170
eyes and a specific splash screen for eyes.

05:36.190 --> 05:41.620
So that's something you could do and the same is true for Android and you of course find that as well

05:41.620 --> 05:42.820
in the official box.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.050
You can add an android key here to your app Jason fall and then this holds all.

05:49.060 --> 05:55.780
So to say there you can also set up by icon and a splash configuration just as I explained it for us.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.900
And now these settings would be taken for Android.

05:59.140 --> 06:04.120
I w since it doesn't have specific settings in my example here would still use the general settings

06:04.120 --> 06:05.190
up there.

06:05.200 --> 06:10.690
Now the interesting thing is for Android you can not just set a specific icon splash screen you can

06:10.780 --> 06:18.580
also set an adaptive icon here with the adaptive icon configuration that's not available for IAW because

06:18.580 --> 06:21.820
adaptive icons are exclusive to Android.

06:21.820 --> 06:29.450
Adaptive icon takes javascript object so to say as a configuration value not a string.

06:29.680 --> 06:35.950
And this object can have free keys a foreground image a background color or a background image.

06:35.950 --> 06:40.960
Now you have either a background color or a background image but you always should have a foreground

06:40.960 --> 06:41.850
image.

06:41.890 --> 06:46.780
Now here we can add for ground image.

06:46.780 --> 06:53.410
So this key here and background color which should be a six digit hex code as you can see.

06:53.520 --> 06:59.590
And let's quickly do that here and now we can set the background color to let's say that 1 7 1 7 1 7

06:59.590 --> 07:04.750
code and the foreground image can now be set to our icon though for this I would recommend that you

07:04.750 --> 07:07.900
use a specific icon which you all defined attached here.

07:08.020 --> 07:16.990
The places adaptive PNC file which you can drag and drop into your assets folder and that place is adaptive

07:17.410 --> 07:23.800
PNC file can now be used here as a foreground image so we can point that assets and then place a stash

07:23.830 --> 07:25.630
adaptive top PMG.

07:25.690 --> 07:30.550
Now this icon the places adaptive icon is transparent.

07:30.550 --> 07:34.990
It's still as de I can but it has a transparent background unlike the average icon.

07:34.990 --> 07:39.640
And dad will therefore allow Android to place it in front of this background color or background image

07:39.640 --> 07:43.650
you provided and automatically round the corners for you and so on.

07:43.660 --> 07:51.400
So if we now save this and a display of for rebuilds and to be safe that it really takes us into account

07:51.430 --> 07:53.910
all restart my exposed server here.

07:54.040 --> 08:00.370
If we now launched this on Android and for data also close the expo client here

08:03.390 --> 08:05.490
and then rerun this on Android.

08:05.490 --> 08:08.990
We should see that once it is restarted.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.540
We now have a nicer icon which looks a bit better.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.060
So let's wait for that to launch.

08:14.070 --> 08:19.560
Does it still these flash string as we said up before I also did not set Android specific splash screen

08:19.560 --> 08:21.700
which we of course could but here it didn't.

08:21.720 --> 08:25.810
So we of course got the same splash screen as earlier in this module.

08:26.110 --> 08:31.440
And if you now have a look at the icon you might unfortunately still see the old one the new one will

08:31.440 --> 08:37.320
be taken into account though once we built the Zap as a standalone app and distributed to the app stores

08:38.100 --> 08:43.110
in general the recommendation is that for Android you do set such a adaptive I can because you cover

08:43.110 --> 08:49.470
more android workings which well doesn't hurt of course setting such a general icon is also not a bad

08:49.470 --> 08:50.040
idea.

08:50.070 --> 08:54.780
And of course you can either use one of the same icon for both eyes and Android or you set specific

08:54.810 --> 09:01.110
icons for eyes and for Android as mentioned for Android possibly the adaptive icon if you want to learn

09:01.110 --> 09:06.180
more about the process of creating and managing icons and splash strings attached you find your official

09:06.180 --> 09:11.160
export docs which dive deeply into the different options you have there and what you should consider.
