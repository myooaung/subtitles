00:02.620 --> 00:07.780
Let's deploy our Android app and for that, you can always search for Android publish app to find an

00:07.780 --> 00:11.400
article on the official developer docs of Android.

00:11.450 --> 00:17.590
There, you find detailed instructions on how to release your app, how you prepare your app for release,

00:17.590 --> 00:19.100
we already did this though

00:19.360 --> 00:22.380
and then how you publish it.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.870
Now here I want to publish it through Google Play

00:25.870 --> 00:30.780
and for that, we can visit Google Play. On the top right,

00:30.780 --> 00:33.110
you can open the play console,

00:33.210 --> 00:37.800
now if you click there the first time, you need to sign up as a Google Developer, you need to accept their

00:37.800 --> 00:41.390
agreements and you need to pay a one time registration fee,

00:41.400 --> 00:44.620
it's not very high though, it's only $25 and only one time.

00:44.700 --> 00:51.030
This is essentially there to avoid having a lot of bots spam everything here here a lot of people who

00:51.030 --> 00:54.060
don't really want to create a serious app.

00:54.390 --> 00:56.960
So once you did this, you can log in

00:57.140 --> 01:01.360
and once you did sign in, you can create a new application.

01:01.440 --> 01:07.540
Now here choose the default language and give it an awesome name like awesome places, create

01:07.650 --> 01:12.060
and here you can now fill out a lot of metadata about this application.

01:12.850 --> 01:19.780
Add images for the preview in the Google Play Store and so on, contact details about yourself

01:19.890 --> 01:22.940
but for us interesting is app releases.

01:23.130 --> 01:25.580
There you now add your APKs,

01:25.760 --> 01:29.650
so let's click on manage production and create a release,

01:29.670 --> 01:33.410
you can now also use Google Play app sign as additional security layer

01:36.590 --> 01:43.670
and thereafter you can upload your APK here, the APK which was generated. Let's browse files and you'll

01:43.670 --> 01:46.320
find that APK in the Android folder app

01:48.800 --> 01:59.630
and there build and outputs APK, app release APK. Simply click open and now it will be uploaded

01:59.780 --> 02:03.980
to the play store console and is processed and checked

02:04.190 --> 02:09.580
and you see, now here it was accepted and that is the first important step.

02:10.070 --> 02:17.020
Now what you need to do is with that added here, you have to go back to store listing and all the other

02:17.020 --> 02:20.850
fields which are marked with an exclamation mark and complete them,

02:21.050 --> 02:24.020
You always get hints about what's missing and what you need to do,

02:24.020 --> 02:26.080
these are all steps you can do on your own,

02:26.180 --> 02:28.330
this is the last thing that's in your way.

02:28.340 --> 02:36.020
Make sure to prepare an appealing product page for this app, so upload nice images, nice text and so

02:36.020 --> 02:36.650
on

02:36.680 --> 02:40.710
and once you did this, you're good to go and publish your Android app.
