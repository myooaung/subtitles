00:02.740 --> 00:06.070
I don't want to dive too deeply into connecting our inputs,

00:06.070 --> 00:12.130
we'll do that in another module but I want to connect place input so that we can actually generate

00:12.130 --> 00:14.730
new places. To do that,

00:14.770 --> 00:20.020
we need to manage the value of place input here in this component,

00:20.440 --> 00:27.700
so what I'll do is I'll add a state property to this component and there, I'll add a place name property

00:27.700 --> 00:36.310
which is an empty string by default. Now I want to connect this to the place we enter here in place input,

00:36.510 --> 00:39.650
we have a look at the place input component, there

00:39.660 --> 00:46.200
we obviously have an onChangeText handler but we handled the entire state of the place name internally

00:46.200 --> 00:47.050
here.

00:47.460 --> 00:52.830
Now what I want to do is I also want to pass it to the outside world so that I get the latest

00:52.930 --> 00:54.810
value there too,

00:55.380 --> 01:00.720
so what we can simply do is we can remove the placeNameChangedHandler, we can remove the internal

01:00.720 --> 01:04.550
state, we could convert this to a functional component,

01:04.680 --> 01:06.440
so why don't we do that,

01:06.460 --> 01:14.670
let's turn it to place input which gets props and then just returns some jsx,

01:14.930 --> 01:21.950
so let's just return some jsx and adjust the export name,

01:22.270 --> 01:25.950
so this is how quickly you can turn this into a functional component.

01:26.350 --> 01:33.890
And now we connect value to this props place name, so we expect to get this from outside and here

01:33.930 --> 01:40.900
this is connected to this props onChangeText so that we can listen on this prop from outside

01:40.950 --> 01:45.450
too and the value will be forwarded automatically.

01:45.490 --> 01:54.790
Now in the share place component where we have the place name, we can go to place input and set place name

01:54.820 --> 01:57.580
equal to this state

01:57.580 --> 01:58.640
place name,

01:58.780 --> 02:09.960
so the state property we just added and then add a new method here, placeNameChangedHandler maybe

02:10.350 --> 02:17.330
where we get the value and where we then simply store this, where we set this set state

02:20.370 --> 02:28.130
and set the place name there to the value and the placeNameChangedHandler is what we connect to the

02:28.140 --> 02:30.550
OnChanged,

02:30.660 --> 02:31.330
onChange

02:31.330 --> 02:40.390
I guess it was, onChangeText. So onChangeText should be connected to this new handler,

02:40.440 --> 02:45.740
so the placeNameChangedHandler, lets also distribute this over multiple lines.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.240
This is now the setup for the place input,

02:48.270 --> 02:53.060
now we also get the placeAddedHandler where we want to dispatch the action, here

02:53.120 --> 03:01.440
I now first of all want to check if this state place name, if we trim it, if its unequal to an empty

03:01.440 --> 03:02.300
string,

03:02.520 --> 03:04.550
only in this case we want to dispatch it

03:04.680 --> 03:10.430
otherwise we won't do anything because otherwise, it's an invalid value.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.840
So now the missing piece is to connect this button,

03:12.910 --> 03:20.080
so let's add onPress here and let's connect it to this.placeAddedHandler.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.250
Let's save all of that and let's go back to the application and reload it

03:24.660 --> 03:26.790
and I get an error,

03:27.300 --> 03:33.490
Let's have a look at place input, this props of course is wrong,

03:33.570 --> 03:38.520
it's a functional component should be just props, we get it as an argument here.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.880
So let's save this and let's reload the application,

03:41.890 --> 03:44.130
now let's submit and go to share place

03:44.530 --> 03:52.820
and now if I enter test here and I click share the place, I get an error because in placeAddedHandler,

03:53.180 --> 03:56.070
we still expect the place name, that's no longer the case

03:56.070 --> 03:58.370
though, we get no meaningful argument here,

03:58.470 --> 04:00.270
none that we need at least.

04:00.470 --> 04:06.140
Instead what we want to dispatch here is this state place name, that is where we now manage the place

04:06.140 --> 04:06.670
name,

04:06.950 --> 04:10.770
so let's adjust this function in the share place component.

04:11.120 --> 04:17.630
And now with that, if we reload the application and also reload it on Android,

04:17.630 --> 04:20.700
now if I share a place here,

04:22.180 --> 04:27.090
now we get the place here again. So we can share multiple places and we can still go there,

04:27.130 --> 04:28.360
that still works

04:28.370 --> 04:30.020
as before.

04:30.080 --> 04:34.770
So with that, the share place component is finished for the moment at least.
