WEBVTT

00:02.390 --> 00:05.610
So step by step we're making progress.

00:05.660 --> 00:08.150
What we're not able to do is enter a number.

00:08.150 --> 00:14.090
Well I guess technically we can enter a number if we kind of find the input field here it is but it's

00:14.090 --> 00:17.920
not much fun to search for it would be nicer if you could see it wouldn't it.

00:18.680 --> 00:22.270
So therefore let's style that input field.

00:22.280 --> 00:30.470
That text input field here a little bit and just as before actually I went to do that in a separate

00:30.470 --> 00:31.260
component.

00:31.310 --> 00:40.520
So in the components folder I'll add my own input J.S. file and in there has always import react from

00:40.520 --> 00:46.580
react and then import text input from React Native.

00:46.580 --> 00:51.970
And here I'll actually not need the view because we'll just have to text input here in style and configured

00:51.970 --> 00:59.880
it in there and then have the input constant here which is our functional component which we in the

00:59.880 --> 01:01.980
end all the export of course.

01:02.280 --> 01:08.550
And while one thing we'll need for sure is the style sheet because that should now be styled here so

01:08.550 --> 01:13.710
that we have one default input Look we could reuse in this application if we needed multiple inputs

01:13.710 --> 01:15.120
in different places.

01:15.120 --> 01:20.130
And that's really the mindset you have to get into to create reusable components so that you don't have

01:20.130 --> 01:26.460
to copy code around or repeat yourself but that you can easily share your components and easily create

01:26.460 --> 01:32.700
the apps you want from your set of building blocks you create on your own in the end.

01:32.700 --> 01:41.650
So here are my styles object with style sheet create like that looks good and now in that component

01:41.710 --> 01:44.230
I want to return a text input.

01:44.230 --> 01:46.990
So this built in text input.

01:46.990 --> 01:49.830
Now of course my idea is that we can style it from in here.

01:49.870 --> 01:58.180
So let's assign a style from in there but just as with the card it would be nice if we could also set

01:58.180 --> 02:05.200
some styling from outside like a special with or special border or anything like that to enable that

02:05.380 --> 02:08.050
again all pass object here to style.

02:08.050 --> 02:14.470
And for one take all my style set up in my styles object and they are let's say in an input property

02:14.470 --> 02:23.970
which we have yet to add and in addition also add all styles we are getting from props style so that

02:23.970 --> 02:30.060
we could set styles from outside as well and now down there in histology we can add the input style

02:30.060 --> 02:37.180
to well assign them styles to the input so yeah we could give us a height of let's say 30 which should

02:37.180 --> 02:43.420
be a height that looks relatively good and to see something I also want to add a border at the bottom.

02:43.450 --> 02:49.120
You could also add a border around the entire input with border color and border with and so on.

02:49.310 --> 02:54.970
But I like that look where we only have a border below the input but that's of course totally subjective

02:55.060 --> 02:59.120
and something you can set up according to your personal preferences.

02:59.250 --> 03:06.160
A border at the bottom only can be set with border bottom color and there I'll go with grey and no pre-built

03:06.160 --> 03:16.110
color which we can use with that shortcut and give this border bottom also with here off one add a margin

03:16.110 --> 03:22.680
vertical of 10 to have some spacing around the input at least to the top and bottom.

03:22.890 --> 03:26.380
And now is that the base styling for this text.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.170
Input is done.

03:28.170 --> 03:36.660
Now let's use that in the game screen so in there I want to import my own input from the components

03:36.660 --> 03:39.890
folder input like that.

03:40.930 --> 03:46.690
And replace this text input here with my own input which in the end wraps this built in text input of

03:46.690 --> 03:47.440
course.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.510
So use my own input.

03:48.510 --> 03:52.300
Get rid of the text input input up there which we don't need anymore.

03:52.600 --> 03:59.370
And now if we save this we see it a little bit but it's very very small you can barely see it here.

03:59.410 --> 04:04.600
ISIS and it gets bigger as you type though which is certainly not what we want of course.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.590
We're of course not done.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.290
Instead to style the width.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.950
I'll go to the start game screen.

04:10.980 --> 04:14.460
So do the place where we use the input and set up the styling here.

04:14.460 --> 04:19.200
Because for me it makes sense that we have some general styles which we always want in the input component

04:19.380 --> 04:24.720
something like the height or the border but some specific styles like how big should it be so how broad

04:24.720 --> 04:25.230
should it be.

04:25.350 --> 04:28.480
That's something you want to set up in the place where you actually use it.

04:28.650 --> 04:36.150
And therefore here I'll add this input property in the start game screen styles you'd object and maybe

04:36.150 --> 04:42.360
use a width of 50 pixels here that should look good and assign dad to my custom input here with the

04:42.450 --> 04:43.760
style prop.

04:43.830 --> 04:51.840
So there we can now point at Styles start input with dead it will be having that with at all times and

04:51.840 --> 04:55.380
if we type there we don't make that broader anymore.

04:55.380 --> 05:00.040
Instead we can then simply scroll automatically in that input.

05:00.150 --> 05:05.760
Now for this specific input for this specific layout here it would also be nice if the text would be

05:05.760 --> 05:06.500
centered.

05:06.600 --> 05:12.330
I think for most inputs you want debt default behavior of writing from left to right and starting on

05:12.330 --> 05:13.220
the left edge.

05:13.260 --> 05:20.480
But here are things some center text would be nice and therefore in Star game screen where I want to

05:20.480 --> 05:23.550
have is centering here on this input.

05:23.660 --> 05:30.470
We can also add the text align property and set this to center and now it is will center does text here

05:30.470 --> 05:32.330
in the middle as we type.

05:32.330 --> 05:35.830
And that's really nice for just entering a numbered in like this.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.260
Speaking of that right now we can enter anything in there.

05:40.550 --> 05:45.980
So we certainly need to configure it as input and for Dad if I go to the input component where we use

05:45.980 --> 05:52.250
the text input there is a lot of stuff we can configure there and actually the best resource is always

05:52.250 --> 05:59.030
of course is the official documentation there in the API docs if you go there and you search for the

05:59.030 --> 06:05.990
text input you'll find not only an explanation but you'll also find all the props you can set there

06:06.320 --> 06:09.230
and you can set things like Is it multi line or not.

06:09.230 --> 06:11.100
How long may the text be.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.730
You can also set up leaseholder text.

06:13.730 --> 06:18.700
You can set auto correction and all that fun stuff.

06:18.770 --> 06:25.670
So definitely check these stocks to find these specific property you might need for your use case.

06:25.730 --> 06:31.970
I want to be able to set these props but I want to be able to set them from the place where they use

06:31.970 --> 06:37.640
my custom input so not from in here because Dad would make sure that we use the same configuration for

06:37.730 --> 06:40.150
all inputs we might have in our app.

06:40.430 --> 06:46.550
I want to have more flexibility and just set up some base styling in here and configure the input in

06:46.550 --> 06:51.440
the place where we then use it instead of in the core wrapper component.

06:51.440 --> 06:57.140
The cool thing is react and that's not react native that's just react and normal JavaScript has a syntax

06:57.140 --> 06:58.200
for that.

06:58.460 --> 07:05.920
You can take your props your getting and spread them on your component like this.

07:05.920 --> 07:11.110
The syntax might look a bit strange but what did in the end does is it takes all the props you have

07:11.140 --> 07:19.120
all the props you set here and basically adds them to your component as props.

07:19.150 --> 07:23.600
Now if you thereafter define our props like style and you already got a style here.

07:23.650 --> 07:26.020
This style will override the style you've got here.

07:26.040 --> 07:31.210
That's actually what I want because if I set a style prop on my own input from outside I definitely

07:31.210 --> 07:37.450
want to override it with this style prop and add this styling which is set up down there to this text

07:37.450 --> 07:38.200
input.

07:38.200 --> 07:43.630
But if you set our props outside of this component so on my custom component then they will be added

07:43.630 --> 07:49.010
to the text input and that allows us to add all the props we can add on the text input.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.120
Also on our input so on our own component.

07:52.120 --> 08:03.400
So here where we use input we can now not only add the style but we can also add blur on submit for

08:03.400 --> 08:09.670
example to make sure that when we pressed the submit button there we lose focus and we close to soft

08:09.670 --> 08:16.430
keyboard we can set auto capitalize to non which is one of the allowed values there.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.040
If you check the docks you can set it to non sentences words and so on.

08:20.050 --> 08:24.610
So I don't want to have capitalization turned on here because we'll just enter number but also because

08:24.610 --> 08:30.610
I want to show you different configurations you can set I'll set auto correct here to falls so that

08:30.610 --> 08:35.050
we're not auto correcting the user input and very important here.

08:35.080 --> 08:41.000
I'll set the keyboard type to numeric so that the user has to enter a number here.

08:41.320 --> 08:47.590
I'll set the max length here to 2 so that you may only enter two digits and not a very long number because

08:47.620 --> 08:53.890
this game here is just one of the restrictions I have here is that this game only works with a two digit

08:53.890 --> 08:57.140
number with all of that setup.

08:57.140 --> 09:02.990
Now if you go back and I toggle my soft keyboard you see you get the number of keyboard here and you

09:02.990 --> 09:09.180
can only enter two digits there and not more than that which is of course exactly what I want.

09:09.260 --> 09:14.170
In addition here on Android we see this if you click the confirmed button this will close it.

09:14.180 --> 09:21.140
That's thanks to that later on submit thing on RSA such a button doesn't exist here so there will actually

09:21.140 --> 09:25.730
have to find a different solution for closing this if you tap somewhere else for example because right

09:25.760 --> 09:27.150
now that's not happening.

09:27.320 --> 09:32.090
But the good thing is we now have a keyboard we can see and a keyboard where we can enter numbers.

09:32.090 --> 09:37.910
One thing I want to change though is that right now I can also enter a decimal separator here.

09:37.910 --> 09:44.420
Now to get rid of that you can change the keyboard type to number pad and to see all the way double

09:44.420 --> 09:49.650
keyboard types as always you official box are the place to go they're 40 text input you can dive into

09:49.650 --> 09:54.650
a keyboard type and find out what you can set what works on all platforms and what you could set if

09:54.650 --> 09:59.480
you would have a check that checks on which platform you are running to code which we have learned about

09:59.480 --> 09:59.990
yet.

10:00.230 --> 10:03.200
Number pad is supported on both platforms though.

10:03.350 --> 10:08.380
And if you set this you now have the input where you can't enter a decimal place here.

10:08.390 --> 10:13.990
If you type in your you can't do it on our OS on Android you unfortunately cans though.

10:14.090 --> 10:16.490
So there will always have to find a different fix.
