WEBVTT

00:02.150 --> 00:06.950
Now with our accustomed funds added We are now able to use them in our application.

00:06.950 --> 00:12.740
And I want to use him in all places where we display some texts like here with use elected.

00:13.130 --> 00:17.410
Here the opponents guests and then also on the summary page.

00:17.410 --> 00:24.010
Ted will also be a goal here in this application and in addition to that when a game is over.

00:24.020 --> 00:30.770
Not only do I want to use our custom font here on this game a web page but I also want to show an image

00:30.830 --> 00:32.460
a game over image here.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.830
So that's the next thing I want to work on.

00:34.850 --> 00:42.770
First step is to replace this text here with the body text to use to fund so import body text from the

00:42.770 --> 00:49.970
components folder and there from body text and then replace all these text components here with body

00:49.970 --> 00:54.200
text simply so that when a game is over we use our custom fund.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.450
That's the goal here.

00:55.730 --> 00:57.950
But that's as I just said only one thing.

00:57.950 --> 01:03.200
The main thing which should happen here is that we also have an image here.

01:03.260 --> 01:11.360
So let's say we have our game is over tidal actually so let's use the title text here maybe now to think

01:11.360 --> 01:12.350
about it.

01:12.530 --> 01:16.460
Title text instead of body text but debt below this title.

01:16.460 --> 01:19.830
So below the game is over we show an image.

01:19.880 --> 01:27.740
So here I want to use some component which actually allows us to display an image and react native has

01:27.800 --> 01:36.470
such a component it has an image component we can use image here as a normal component in our J as X

01:36.470 --> 01:43.490
code just like that it's a self closing component an image has one important prop and that is the source

01:43.490 --> 01:51.170
prop and the source prob as the name suggests has to be set to point at an image and now there are two

01:51.170 --> 01:58.430
kinds of images you can use local images which you ship as part of your app so which you include in

01:58.430 --> 02:05.600
your source code in your app bundle in the end or network images and we'll have a look at both.

02:05.610 --> 02:14.280
Now let's start with a local image and for that attached you find these success PMG file which you can

02:14.280 --> 02:17.000
drag into your assets folder.

02:17.370 --> 02:23.430
So not in the funds folder there but just into assets or you create an image as sub folder if you want

02:23.430 --> 02:24.240
to.

02:24.270 --> 02:25.150
Doesn't really matter.

02:25.170 --> 02:31.290
I'll have a chest here and assets of this success PNC file and this is the file which I want to use

02:31.290 --> 02:31.550
here.

02:31.560 --> 02:39.480
So the image I want to render here now for Dad to render this image here.

02:39.660 --> 02:46.040
We use a special syntax which might look strange the first time you're seeing it you used this require

02:46.050 --> 02:52.440
function which is built into JavaScript or which is supported by react native in JavaScript let's say

02:53.010 --> 02:57.840
where you pass a string as an argument and this is the string pointing at the image and this should

02:57.840 --> 02:59.240
be a relative path.

02:59.250 --> 03:04.530
So here since we're in the screen's folder we have to go up one level then into the assets folder and

03:04.530 --> 03:07.450
then here we can point at success stored PMG.

03:07.470 --> 03:09.090
Just like that.

03:09.150 --> 03:14.490
Now this tells react native that we want to use this image here and behind the scenes it allows react

03:14.490 --> 03:20.190
native to effectively Lotus and also to have a look at the image and for example determine its width

03:20.430 --> 03:21.340
and height.

03:21.360 --> 03:28.830
That's why we use this strange require syntax and we have to load local images like this.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.280
Now with that to see the result.

03:32.410 --> 03:39.400
All tweak the app chars fall temporarily to make sure we always display the game over screen there simply

03:39.400 --> 03:46.060
so that I don't always have to go through the entire screen just to verify that it updated that it changed

03:46.660 --> 03:53.590
so the game over screen is what I'll temporarily use as my main content here right from the start and

03:53.590 --> 03:57.850
I'll simply pass in some dummy numbers for round number and user number.

03:57.880 --> 04:04.390
Again I'm only doing this so if we start with the game over screen here and see what this gives us and

04:04.480 --> 04:10.730
while we can see what this gives us it gives us a full screen image in the end a really large image.

04:10.780 --> 04:14.140
The reason for that is that the image I gave you is pretty large.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.590
This success page you fall is not a small file.

04:17.710 --> 04:22.040
It's a pretty big image regarding the pixels it's width and its height.

04:22.210 --> 04:29.320
And as I said when you use require like this the good thing is that react native has a look at the image

04:29.320 --> 04:34.020
file determine its width and height and uses the same width and height here which means we rendered

04:34.020 --> 04:41.050
this huge image here on the application and while the downside simply is that this now no longer fits

04:41.050 --> 04:45.450
on the screen or occupies the entire screen because it's a too large file.

04:45.550 --> 04:50.440
If we had a smaller image this would not be a problem that it would just occupy a part of the screen.

04:50.440 --> 04:54.160
But since it's a large image it occupies the entire screen.
