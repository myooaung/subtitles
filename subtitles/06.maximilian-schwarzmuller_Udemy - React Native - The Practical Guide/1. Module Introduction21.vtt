00:02.500 --> 00:08.410
You did it, you learned a lot about react native, you had a very thorough introduction to it and we built

00:08.410 --> 00:15.430
a really nice application throughout the course. Time to not only do this in our development environment but

00:15.430 --> 00:20.430
to also learn how to finish our app up and how to publish it. In this module,

00:20.430 --> 00:26.350
I will walk you through all the steps you need to execute to get your app into ios App Store, the

00:26.350 --> 00:29.600
Apple App Store or the Android play store

00:29.960 --> 00:34.810
and I will not only cover that, we'll also have a look at other things. To be precise,

00:34.810 --> 00:41.010
we'll have a look at how we can add app icons and a splash screen to our application,

00:41.140 --> 00:46.150
you will then also learn how to configure your app for production and build it for production,

00:46.150 --> 00:47.500
so for deployment

00:47.500 --> 00:52.410
and then as I mentioned, I show you how to deploy it for iOS and for Android.

00:52.540 --> 00:53.860
Let's dive into that.
