00:02.110 --> 00:04.450
How can we make sure that we can pick a place.

00:04.870 --> 00:10.900
Well on map view in your map screen you can add on press handler and this fires whenever you tap somewhere

00:10.900 --> 00:11.580
on the map.

00:11.680 --> 00:16.690
And with that I don't mean taps when you scroll but when you tap there without scrolling so if you really

00:16.690 --> 00:23.130
want to select something this will then fire and distill for a can be bound to a function which I define

00:23.170 --> 00:27.010
in here which should kind of store to select the place.

00:27.010 --> 00:33.940
So here I'll have my SELECT LOCATION handler function which gets an event object and that's what I bind

00:33.940 --> 00:36.260
to on press here.

00:36.260 --> 00:42.440
Now we can look into this event to get a feeling for what's inside there which kind of data we get.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.300
So let me save this and let's test it.

00:44.330 --> 00:52.550
Let's go to the map and then once it is loaded simply tap somewhere on the map like here.

00:52.550 --> 00:58.450
If we now go back does the output I get in there you see it's quite a big object.

00:58.700 --> 01:02.280
In the end we get a bunch of data in there which we don't really need.

01:02.510 --> 01:04.700
It's this synthetic event here.

01:04.850 --> 01:10.880
What we do have what's interesting is it is native event property which is yet another object which

01:10.880 --> 01:15.170
has a coordinate property which is yet another object which has a latitude and longitude.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.090
That's what we're interested in Indian right.

01:17.090 --> 01:18.520
That's what we want to find out.

01:18.530 --> 01:19.700
That's the coordinate pair.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.000
We want to get.

01:21.020 --> 01:24.640
So this is the place he coordinates the user tapped on.

01:24.650 --> 01:30.850
This is what I want to store here and it would be nice for a start to add a marker in that place.

01:30.860 --> 01:34.430
So did we mark that place on the map for that.

01:34.420 --> 01:42.260
Of course we can use state to save that selected place and in the component then initialized is up here

01:43.100 --> 01:48.170
and have our selected location and set to selected

01:50.500 --> 01:58.870
location with the help of use state initially it's empty we have no selected location initially and

01:58.870 --> 02:01.200
then we can create a marker here.

02:01.270 --> 02:08.170
If we do have one for that we can import a marker component from native maps by adding some named imports

02:08.170 --> 02:14.590
here besides this default import we have that we can import marker from HREOC native maps as Assam blast

02:14.590 --> 02:20.530
at and we can rendered as marker by adding it between the opening and closing tax of map view which

02:20.530 --> 02:21.470
we now need.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.780
So we can add a marker here.

02:23.870 --> 02:27.090
Now this marker needs some configuration.

02:27.170 --> 02:32.840
Otherwise we act native maps doesn't know where to show it can add a title for example picked the location

02:33.230 --> 02:40.560
but more importantly you can add a coordinate prop here and dad expects to get an object with a latitude

02:40.590 --> 02:53.260
and longitude in there so here I'll add a new variable marker coordinates let's say and if I have a

02:53.320 --> 03:00.190
selected location and that's the state I'm managing up there if I do have that then I want to set marker

03:00.190 --> 03:05.050
coordinates equal to an object where you need to have a latitude named latitude.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.070
So it's not let.

03:06.070 --> 03:10.890
It needs to be latitude because the marker component will look for a property named latitude.

03:12.100 --> 03:15.390
And that can be the selected location.

03:16.710 --> 03:17.860
Dot.

03:17.970 --> 03:22.970
Let let's say it's up to us how we then safeties we're not doing it right now but later we'll save it

03:22.970 --> 03:28.100
such that we have a let prop there and long etude which needs to be named like this which can hold the

03:28.100 --> 03:31.150
value stored in selected location dot LNG.

03:31.370 --> 03:36.560
Now Mark coordinates is conditionally set and here we can now check if market conditions does exist

03:36.890 --> 03:44.100
and if it does we use this shortcut to also output a marker here now marker coordinates is also what

03:44.100 --> 03:45.900
we can feed into here.

03:45.900 --> 03:49.890
And please note this is coordinate not coordinates it's just coordinate.

03:49.890 --> 03:56.260
At this point our marker coordinates and now we just have to make sure that we eventually set deliver

03:56.250 --> 03:57.420
a selected location.

03:57.620 --> 04:01.740
And of course I want to do this here in my select location handler there.

04:01.820 --> 04:08.330
I want to call set select location to set my state pass the object in there and set my state to object

04:08.330 --> 04:16.450
with a lat key because I'm trying to extract let down their of event dot native event as you saw and

04:16.490 --> 04:22.580
in there that was this coordinate property which has a latitude property and then LNG which I'm also

04:22.580 --> 04:31.520
extracting down there should be set to event the native event coordinates dot longitude and with this

04:31.520 --> 04:35.480
code we should be able to view a marker on the map so let's give it a try.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.900
Let's go to ISIS.

04:36.950 --> 04:38.240
Load the map there

04:41.190 --> 04:47.640
and pick some place and we see a marker at the place where I click the same on Android hopefully let's

04:47.640 --> 04:53.480
give it a try there open the map and indeed there.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.720
If I tap somewhere

04:58.440 --> 05:01.380
I also do place my marker there.

05:01.410 --> 05:05.290
So this is how we can work with markers and how we can select places.

05:05.340 --> 05:06.820
It's all nice.

05:06.810 --> 05:12.090
Now ultimately I want to be able to kind of click a safe button up there which doesn't exist yet which

05:12.090 --> 05:19.750
then closes this map and passes the selected location back to my new place screen in the end.

05:19.750 --> 05:24.940
Right which I do have here as well I want to go back to that screen and of course kind of save my selected

05:24.950 --> 05:25.500
location.
