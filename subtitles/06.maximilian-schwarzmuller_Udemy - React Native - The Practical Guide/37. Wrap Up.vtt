00:02.420 --> 00:08.930
Now with all of that in this module you learned a lot about how to build real apps with React Native.

00:08.930 --> 00:11.780
Learned a lot about the building components.

00:11.780 --> 00:16.370
You'll learn a lot about styling and how to lay things out in the way you want and how to style things

00:16.370 --> 00:17.300
in the way you want.

00:17.300 --> 00:24.290
Also how styling differs between some components for example that four text components styling does

00:24.320 --> 00:26.320
cascade to a certain extent.

00:26.390 --> 00:31.970
So styles are inherited in nested styles there something we're taking advantage of in the game over

00:31.970 --> 00:39.770
screen here but dad on all other components like the view styles that you apply to it really only apply

00:39.770 --> 00:45.880
to that view and do not cascade are not shared with any nested child use.

00:45.890 --> 00:52.010
You also learned how you can share common stylings for example with custom components like our body

00:52.010 --> 00:58.100
text which sets up our general fund family so that we can use body text instead of the built in text

00:58.130 --> 01:00.480
if we want text with that font family.

01:00.590 --> 01:04.190
Of course that's a concept you can use for any shared styling you want.

01:04.310 --> 01:09.980
Like we're also doing it for the card kind of where we have a pre styled view to give us this nice car

01:10.010 --> 01:12.140
look with a little bit of a shadow.

01:12.140 --> 01:17.450
You also learn how you can set up some theming with Constance which you can import into different files

01:17.870 --> 01:23.990
both for colors here or also if you needed it for textiles or for any other style you want to share

01:23.990 --> 01:29.630
across components so that you don't have to rewrite it all the times especially useful for cases where

01:29.630 --> 01:33.120
you don't want to or where you can't create separate components.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.070
As we're doing it for the font family for example.

01:36.250 --> 01:40.820
So if that's not possible which in case of the colors would have been difficult because we need colors

01:40.820 --> 01:47.690
and all kinds of places then such shared styles or shared constants are a great way.

01:47.690 --> 01:53.420
And in general I hope you get a feeling for how you compose user interfaces with built in components

01:53.450 --> 01:58.820
and with your own custom components that then build up on the built in components and how you can therefore

01:58.820 --> 02:02.120
build nice react native applications.

02:02.140 --> 02:07.390
We had a look at some core components and therefore I also want to give you a quick summary regarding

02:07.390 --> 02:09.710
what you learned about these components here.

02:09.760 --> 02:15.080
Probably the most important component is the view which is a container which you wrap around average

02:15.100 --> 02:21.180
components to then lay those components out or to add certain container styles like shadows borders

02:21.190 --> 02:24.760
background color things like that pretty much.

02:24.760 --> 02:29.870
Equally important is the text component which you use for well outputting text.

02:29.950 --> 02:36.130
You can also nest text into text where some style is even shared and you can in general control how

02:36.130 --> 02:41.980
text should be output if it should wrap itself which is the default or if it should only output one

02:41.980 --> 02:43.070
or two lines.

02:43.210 --> 02:49.450
And that's where the text component really helps you output that valuable information to your users.

02:49.450 --> 02:53.860
Now sometimes you don't just want to output information but also fetch information and for this the

02:53.860 --> 02:55.930
text input can be helpful.

02:55.930 --> 03:00.760
Now we'll dive deeper into fetching user input later in the course but you already got a first look

03:00.760 --> 03:05.290
at how you can style it and how you can configure it and how you can make sure you're getting the right

03:05.320 --> 03:11.210
input and you're validating the input and you're really only working with the input you need now speaking

03:11.210 --> 03:14.230
of user input the button of course also is a crucial component.

03:14.330 --> 03:19.070
Be that the built in button or your own button which you can build with detachable components which

03:19.130 --> 03:20.960
also are super important.

03:20.960 --> 03:26.660
And in cases where you need to output lists of data you learned about flat list and about scroll view

03:26.750 --> 03:32.270
where the main difference is that flat list is optimized for very long lists or lists where you don't

03:32.270 --> 03:35.790
really know how long they will be but they potentially are very long.

03:35.930 --> 03:42.470
Whereas scroll view is great for any other scroll content which isn't infinitely long where you certainly

03:42.470 --> 03:48.410
will go beyond the boundaries of the screen but it won't be too much extra content because if all that

03:48.410 --> 03:54.110
extra content is rendered without it being used without it being visible to the user then you're wasting

03:54.110 --> 03:54.860
performance.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.710
And that's where flat list comes in.

03:56.780 --> 03:59.980
Because that only renders what the user can really see.

04:00.020 --> 04:05.330
Speaking of what the user can see in this module you also learned how to add your own custom funds and

04:05.330 --> 04:08.770
sometimes you don't need a fun but image while you also learned how to do that.

04:08.900 --> 04:14.580
How to include both a local or network images and how you can style these images to look good.

04:14.600 --> 04:20.240
Speaking of styling for this we're using the style sheet which is not a component but class or an object

04:20.240 --> 04:22.130
provided by React Native.

04:22.130 --> 04:28.190
And the advantage of using this style sheet is not only that you'll get your styles out of the j as

04:28.190 --> 04:35.090
X code which you want to keep relatively lean and short and concise but dad you also get automatic validation

04:35.180 --> 04:41.110
of your styles and React Native tells you when you're using a style incorrectly and dead in the future.

04:41.150 --> 04:47.860
You might also get additional performance optimizations and with that can only encourage you to keep

04:47.860 --> 04:48.810
the section mind.

04:48.820 --> 04:55.540
Maybe go through it a second time and use it as a basis for your further course progress where we will

04:55.540 --> 05:01.570
use all these components we work with where we will write more styles where we will build more complex

05:01.570 --> 05:07.330
user interfaces and where you really will need these fundamentals you learned in the second and in this

05:07.330 --> 05:11.080
course module to then build amazing rack native applications.

05:11.080 --> 05:11.890
So let's move on.
