00:02.460 --> 00:07.820
With that in this module we covered a lot of the things or we practiced a lot of the things you already

00:07.890 --> 00:08.910
learned about.

00:08.910 --> 00:12.060
There wasn't dead much new knowledge.

00:12.060 --> 00:13.380
The icons here in the drawer.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.970
That's something we haven't done before.

00:14.970 --> 00:20.610
But in general most of the things you saw here are things we already covered earlier.

00:20.610 --> 00:22.380
But that was the idea of this module.

00:22.410 --> 00:27.870
I hope you saw it as as a good practice to practice the things you learned.

00:27.960 --> 00:33.360
I hope you also try this on your own first or at least I would recommend that you still go ahead and

00:33.360 --> 00:34.220
try it on your own.

00:34.230 --> 00:39.810
Even if you now follow the long that you rebuilt this from scratch on your own so that you really practice

00:39.810 --> 00:46.130
all the things that are important here navigation creating components managing data with redux.

00:46.140 --> 00:53.040
So did your well-prepared for the next module where we will now dive into details like for example managing

00:53.040 --> 00:58.470
the user input here in a more elegant way and adding validation thereafter will also make sure that

00:58.470 --> 01:04.440
we save data on a server that we save our products there in our orders and thereafter will even add

01:04.500 --> 01:08.380
authentication to make sure that we work with users in this application.

01:08.970 --> 01:10.760
So with that let's move on.
