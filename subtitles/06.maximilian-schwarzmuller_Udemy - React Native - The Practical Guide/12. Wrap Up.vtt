00:02.410 --> 00:05.090
So in this module you learned how to setup redux.

00:05.090 --> 00:09.600
And as I mentioned at the beginning it's not a redux from the ground up module.

00:09.600 --> 00:14.530
I expect that you do have some general knowledge of redux and this was more of a refresher but you'll

00:14.530 --> 00:20.770
learn how to implement redux in a React Native application as you'll see it's not too difficult especially

00:20.770 --> 00:27.640
when working with hooks and you also learned how you for example can then use redux data also in your

00:27.640 --> 00:34.550
navigation options with this set parents trick which isn't really a trick but really the way to do it.

00:34.930 --> 00:40.480
And in general you'll learned how to wire up your application to the central store how to dispatch actions

00:40.960 --> 00:46.720
how to add a reducer and how to add logic to it so that when we change something in one part of the

00:46.720 --> 00:50.370
app it can also be used and reflect it in a different part.

00:50.380 --> 00:55.170
And that's what this global stage management with solutions like redux is all about.

00:55.230 --> 01:00.370
Now even if you would to use a different approach than redux if you would build some state management

01:00.370 --> 01:06.820
solution with react hoax only which is a bit more advanced the general way of reasoning about this would

01:06.820 --> 01:12.450
be the same the way you pass data between your component and the navigation options would be the same.

01:12.460 --> 01:17.020
So that's something which you'll need in basically any bigger app you'll build.

01:17.020 --> 01:22.270
And it's also something we'll continue using throughout this course we'll also need state management

01:22.270 --> 01:27.430
there in our apps and hence this hopefully is helpful to you.

01:27.430 --> 01:31.240
And with that we're well-prepared to move on and continue building apps.
