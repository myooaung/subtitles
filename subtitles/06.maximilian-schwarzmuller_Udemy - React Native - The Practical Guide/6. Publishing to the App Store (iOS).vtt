00:02.520 --> 00:09.540
We published our app for Android, let's now do the same for iOS and for that, you need an Apple developer

00:09.540 --> 00:10.120
account.

00:10.120 --> 00:15.120
You can simply log in with your Apple ID and password and then you'll be prompted to basically turn this

00:15.120 --> 00:18.210
into a developer account, accept their agreements and so on

00:18.290 --> 00:25.440
and important, for this now, for publishing an app, you need a paid account which comes at an annual fee

00:25.440 --> 00:27.110
of $99.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.420
So it's more expensive than Android,

00:29.460 --> 00:33.570
unsurprisingly I guess but you need this if you want to publish your app,

00:33.600 --> 00:34.990
there's no way around that.

00:35.790 --> 00:38.670
Now to publish an app, you need to go to iTunes Connect,

00:38.700 --> 00:43.530
you can easily search for it, iTunes Connect and unfortunately this is in German and I found

00:43.560 --> 00:44.860
no way to turn to English

00:44.910 --> 00:47.520
but I can tell you the first item here is called my apps,

00:47.520 --> 00:53.250
so we click on my apps and there, you can add a new app with the plus,

00:53.420 --> 01:00.140
then choose new app and there enter a name like awesome places.

01:02.380 --> 01:06.650
Choose a platform which is ios, primary language like English,

01:06.860 --> 01:08.100
a bundle ID

01:08.420 --> 01:15.430
and here we don't find the ID of our app. So we should go to the developer portal and register a new

01:15.430 --> 01:16.080
ID.

01:17.230 --> 01:22.420
You should be taken to the certificates identifiers profile page and click there on identifiers app

01:22.480 --> 01:27.030
IDs and click on plus.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.120
Now here you first of all have to enter an app ID description,

01:30.160 --> 01:32.350
awesome places, whatever you like,

01:32.410 --> 01:36.420
then you define an explicit app ID and that should be the app ID

01:36.520 --> 01:37.800
you have in Xcode,

01:37.990 --> 01:41.710
so here the bundle identifier. I'm going to copy that,

01:41.740 --> 01:48.440
here you see that they also recommend the style we're using, then you could check which services your app

01:48.440 --> 01:54.560
is about to use, none of these services apply to us here

01:54.940 --> 02:02.070
so now we can simply click continue and then simply register this app ID.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.140
So we're done,

02:04.240 --> 02:09.170
once you did register it, it may take a little while until you see it here,

02:09.200 --> 02:18.640
so reload the page, maybe wait a short time, create a new app and then it should show up here.

02:18.650 --> 02:19.910
So again let's fill this out,

02:19.910 --> 02:20.720
let's give it a name,

02:20.720 --> 02:26.740
ios, primary language, here you can give it a unique ID that only you see,

02:29.310 --> 02:32.080
basically for your invoices and so on

02:32.160 --> 02:38.310
and then you click create and I already get this from another course so let me rename this and now create

02:38.310 --> 02:39.890
this.

02:39.910 --> 02:46.090
So now we're on this page where we, just as for Google Play, can fill this out, paste a url to

02:46.090 --> 02:53.770
our privacy terms and so on, all of that. Now for us important, you can click on this here in preparation.

02:54.810 --> 02:59.770
Once you clicked here, you can again add some images and so on

03:00.050 --> 03:01.990
but you now also should add

03:01.990 --> 03:06.520
your build and as it says here, you should use Xcode for this. To upload your app,

03:06.530 --> 03:11.080
you need to go to product here in the menu again and click archive,

03:11.890 --> 03:19.070
this will essentially package your app for the ios or the Apple App Store.

03:19.280 --> 03:25.880
Once you're done, this archives explorer here opens and there you can validate it or simply upload to the

03:25.880 --> 03:26.740
App Store,

03:26.860 --> 03:29.160
so now it's checking everything here,

03:31.960 --> 03:37.710
you can leave this as it is, you can automatically manage signing which is very convenient and click

03:37.710 --> 03:38.810
next

03:39.050 --> 03:43.890
and here I'm getting a warning that I have a distribution certificate but no private key installed.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.770
You might not even have a distribution certificate

03:47.040 --> 03:53.550
and we get this in these certificates account here where we previously added our app ID, click on certificates

03:53.550 --> 03:55.770
here, click on a plus

03:55.980 --> 04:04.960
and now we want to have a production certificate, an app store and ad hoc certificate. Click continue after

04:04.960 --> 04:06.170
you selected this and

04:06.220 --> 04:08.950
now you need to create a CSR file.

04:08.950 --> 04:11.620
Now you can follow the instructions you see here,

04:11.620 --> 04:19.660
we should open the key chain access tool and then go to keychain access, certificate assistant, request

04:19.660 --> 04:22.640
a certificate from a certificate authority,

04:22.840 --> 04:25.000
enter your email address here,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.930
leave the CA email address field empty and save,

04:28.940 --> 04:33.620
choose save to disk here and click continue.

04:33.670 --> 04:42.170
Now this gives you a file which you should simply save, click done and then continue on the developer page

04:42.740 --> 04:44.180
and choose that file,

04:45.220 --> 04:47.020
so here I uploaded that file I created,

04:47.020 --> 04:48.940
click continue

04:48.960 --> 04:53.540
and now you can download that certificate and place it somewhere secure, like on desktop

04:53.550 --> 05:01.250
as I will do here but of course save it somewhere else, somewhere where it's secure and you're done. Now

05:01.290 --> 05:02.770
back in Xcode,

05:03.700 --> 05:11.640
you can go to preferences and manage certificates and click on create next to ios distribution

05:11.640 --> 05:13.190
if you don't have that yet.

05:13.290 --> 05:19.130
Once you created your distribution profile there, you can try again,

05:19.130 --> 05:25.840
go back to this archives manager, upload to App Store and go through all the steps

05:25.880 --> 05:27.820
we already went through again.

05:28.160 --> 05:34.540
So next, next you might be prompted to enter your key store password

05:35.870 --> 05:43.970
which often is your or typically is your Mac OS password and once you did this, you can click upload and

05:43.970 --> 05:46.720
now it will upload your app to the App Store.

05:46.730 --> 05:53.330
Now all these steps and more documentation can of course be found in the links at the end of this module

05:53.360 --> 05:59.210
to the official docs where you can dive deeper, troubleshoot things which might not work for you or read

05:59.210 --> 06:01.840
more about this whole process.

06:01.880 --> 06:08.180
Now this uploading process can take quite a while, so don't worry if it takes a bit longer,

06:08.210 --> 06:09.940
now the upload finished for me

06:10.160 --> 06:19.130
and with that, we can close that archive explorer. Go back to iTunes Connect and if we now refresh this

06:19.130 --> 06:24.170
page or simply go back and forth and after a while, you will see build,

06:24.230 --> 06:29.990
it can take a couple of minutes but it will be there and you then can fill out the rest, prepare everything

06:30.290 --> 06:32.960
and submit your app for review.
