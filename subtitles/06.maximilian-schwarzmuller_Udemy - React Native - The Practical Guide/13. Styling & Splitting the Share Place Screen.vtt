00:02.350 --> 00:10.570
So were you successful? Let's split up share place into multiple components and let's also outsource

00:10.570 --> 00:16.290
this input into the place input component and rewrite that. I want to start with that so

00:16.300 --> 00:24.430
I'm going to grab default input here and go to my place input component and there in the view, going

00:24.430 --> 00:28.690
to replace all of that with default input. 

00:28.690 --> 00:34.450
Now I actually also don't need the wrapping view anymore so we can get rid of that and we can get rid of

00:34.450 --> 00:35.620
the styling here

00:36.420 --> 00:44.090
because we only have the input we return here in this component so we can return it inline, default input.

00:44.130 --> 00:51.270
Now it's a place input so we can leave the placeholder hardcoded in here, it makes sense I guess, we

00:51.270 --> 00:57.660
don't need the place submit handler anymore because we don't have a button where we submit the place, we

00:57.660 --> 01:03.960
need the place name changed handler, we want to connect this eventually, we don't need that, that was just for demo

01:03.960 --> 01:04.840
purposes.

01:04.950 --> 01:09.960
We need the place name of course, we want to bind this so we want to set up two-way binding in here

01:10.320 --> 01:13.290
and of course we need to import our default input.

01:13.290 --> 01:17.100
So let's do that first, let's import default input here

01:17.220 --> 01:24.700
from, now we just need to go up one level, then into UI then into default input and import it from there.

01:24.870 --> 01:31.990
Now our default input is set up in a way to distribute all props over the default text input component,

01:32.580 --> 01:35.270
so we can easily add two-way binding here,

01:35.700 --> 01:40.470
all we have to do is we have to set value to this state

01:40.470 --> 01:46.680
place name, like that and register the change handler,

01:46.680 --> 01:59.340
so register on change text and set it equal to this place name changed handler, like that, let's distribute this

01:59.370 --> 02:03.620
over multiple lines and that would be the outsourced component.

02:03.930 --> 02:09.960
Now let's import place input into our share place screen here,

02:09.960 --> 02:15.900
I'm removing the default import, default input import because we don't need it here anymore,

02:16.080 --> 02:19.110
instead we now import place input from

02:19.390 --> 02:23.970
and now I just go into components, place input, place input.

02:25.160 --> 02:34.730
Let's now grab that and let's go down there and enter place input like this, if we now save this, we should

02:34.730 --> 02:38.640
have the same look as before, just reloading to be saved, to

02:38.640 --> 02:40.430
be sure that this is the case,

02:40.760 --> 02:45.100
same look as before. We can type in there so that's all working without errors,

02:45.110 --> 02:46.220
so that's looking good,

02:46.400 --> 02:50.520
just got an error regarding missing on press but that doesn't matter here.

02:50.990 --> 02:53.560
So with that, we get this solved,

02:53.570 --> 03:00.760
now let's also create components for picking an image and then also for picking a spot on a map.

03:00.830 --> 03:10.110
So I'll go to my components folder and I'll add a pick image component, name it PickImage.js,

03:10.130 --> 03:16.530
it's going to be a class based one because I plan on handling events in here, for example

03:16.530 --> 03:17.830
the click on the button,

03:17.960 --> 03:27.760
so I'm importing react and component from react here, we'll also need some components from react native

03:27.760 --> 03:28.580
of course,

03:28.600 --> 03:31.040
so react native is what we can import here.

03:32.170 --> 03:41.530
And then as always, I'll create a class, I'll name it pick image, it will extend my component here of

03:41.530 --> 03:42.910
course,

03:42.910 --> 03:53.690
I will then export pick image as a default and in the extended component, we need a render method where I return some

03:53.830 --> 03:54.800
jsx.

03:54.930 --> 04:00.450
Now the jsx we return of course is the jsx we have in the share place component, here

04:00.550 --> 04:04.230
it's that view which wraps the image and the button below it,

04:04.510 --> 04:11.580
so I'm going to cut this from here and put it into pick image here into the return statement.

04:12.560 --> 04:17.710
Now like this we would get an error because we have adjacent jsx elements,

04:17.840 --> 04:23.540
this could easily be fixed by wrapping both with a view which is just an invisible element we can always

04:23.540 --> 04:29.510
use for styling or structuring reasons. Now we need to import some things from react native namely the

04:29.520 --> 04:39.730
view, the image and the button and also stylesheet because we should of course also implement the style

04:39.730 --> 04:42.270
sheet which is responsible for this view.

04:42.760 --> 04:51.860
So here, I'll go to share place and copy all the styles here, the styles component and put it into pick

04:51.860 --> 05:00.600
image below the class definition and there, I will need the button style, the placeholder style and the

05:00.600 --> 05:02.110
preview image style,

05:02.340 --> 05:06.240
so that means I can get rid of the container but I need the other three styles

05:07.120 --> 05:13.690
and now with that, we got our finished pick image set up, the button won't do much right now but we'll

05:13.690 --> 05:18.510
fix this in the future when we actually make the image pickable.

05:18.530 --> 05:25.400
So here to not get this on press warning any more, we can simply add some arrow function where we say

05:25.580 --> 05:28.350
pick image but of course this won't do anything right now

05:29.400 --> 05:35.700
but with the pick image component now finished, we can go back to the share place screen and now import

05:35.760 --> 05:36.940
that component here.

05:38.820 --> 05:42.030
So import pick image from

05:42.030 --> 05:47.270
and now let's again go to the components folder, to the pick image folder and to the pick image file

05:47.670 --> 05:52.920
and let's use pick image in the place where we previously had the other component, the components we

05:52.920 --> 05:54.150
used before.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.870
It's a self-closing element

05:55.890 --> 05:58.050
and right now we don't need to add anything here,

05:58.110 --> 06:04.180
we'll later certainly add something to get the image which was picked, to get that information

06:04.410 --> 06:07.630
but for now we can just throw this in here.

06:07.820 --> 06:15.480
Let's now also add a view for the map, so I'll add a second component here in the components folder,

06:15.700 --> 06:23.270
I'll name it pick location, add a PickLocation.js file in there. I'm going to copy the pick image file

06:23.270 --> 06:28.800
because a lot of it is similar but later, it will be very different once we add a map.

06:28.820 --> 06:33.800
So I got pick location here, rename this to pick location, the class name

06:33.810 --> 06:40.950
both here in the class declaration as well as in the export and then in there, we of course have

06:40.960 --> 06:42.510
different jsx.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.660
We have a look at share place,

06:44.670 --> 06:48.950
this is the jsx code I want to put into my pick location component,

06:49.170 --> 06:55.350
so let's cut it from there and let's replace the part in the wrapping view which is only there to prevent

06:55.380 --> 06:58.570
the error with adjacent jsx elements,

06:58.890 --> 07:06.240
let's paste in our placeholder, now here I'm using a text component so you should also import text from

07:06.330 --> 07:15.570
react native, we use placeholder and button here so we can remove the preview image style.

07:15.590 --> 07:20.530
Now we can use the pick location component in the share place component,

07:20.800 --> 07:28.200
let's simply add it here at the top to imports, we import pick location from

07:30.950 --> 07:35.220
let's simply go to pick location pick location

07:36.270 --> 07:40.650
and let's render pick location here.

07:42.210 --> 07:47.940
Now one thing we also should do is the image which I'm importing here, I don't need it here,

07:48.090 --> 07:50.890
I need it in the pick image component,

07:51.210 --> 07:53.030
so let me remove it from here

07:53.240 --> 07:55.710
and let's go back to pick image.

07:55.890 --> 07:58.290
Here we referenced the image placeholder,

07:58.440 --> 08:06.340
so we should of course also import it here, so we import image placeholder from

08:06.360 --> 08:12.190
and now let's simply move to the assets folder and then pick this beautiful place.

08:12.260 --> 08:15.480
Make sure to save all files and let's have a look at the application now,

08:15.490 --> 08:23.000
we submit and go to share place and it's now totally messed up.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.040
Now why is that?

08:25.320 --> 08:29.680
Because we added extra views in both pick image and pick location,

08:29.840 --> 08:32.750
these views which we added for wrapping them,

08:32.790 --> 08:40.700
they are invisible but of course they now are the child elements of our flex element surrounding everything,

08:40.800 --> 08:46.740
so our container in share place and therefore, the styling which previously looked nice now doesn't

08:46.740 --> 08:47.890
look nice anymore.

08:49.580 --> 08:51.260
Now to make it look nice again,

08:51.290 --> 09:00.020
let's go to pick image for example and let's add a container style here and let's add width 100%

09:00.020 --> 09:00.830
here,

09:00.920 --> 09:05.530
keep in mind, that still will be inside flex box which takes flex one

09:05.570 --> 09:10.100
so now we just have to set up the width of this container to not shrink unnecessarily

09:11.280 --> 09:14.730
and also since this view also of course uses flex box,

09:14.730 --> 09:17.940
let's set align items to center here too.

09:18.270 --> 09:25.450
Now we can use this container prop here on the wrapping view to set style equal to styles

09:25.530 --> 09:26.730
container here.

09:26.950 --> 09:34.170
Now if we save this and we reload this application to be sure it really renders it correctly,

09:34.180 --> 09:35.720
this now looks better,

09:35.720 --> 09:37.710
now let's do the same for the map.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.760
Let's copy the container style here,

09:39.790 --> 09:48.310
go to pick location and add this here in our stylesheet, add it to this view now, so reach up to styles

09:48.310 --> 09:49.570
container,

09:49.570 --> 09:54.520
now if you restructure all that and save it, you should have a nice looking application again.

09:54.620 --> 09:57.370
Let's reload Android to view it there too,

09:57.370 --> 09:58.890
so this looks good again.

09:59.410 --> 10:02.200
So with that, we got a set up with which I want to work,

10:02.200 --> 10:06.160
we now also outsource everything from share place,

10:06.280 --> 10:07.600
so that's looking good and

10:07.630 --> 10:10.110
we have a leaner component here now.

10:10.180 --> 10:13.670
Now we'll add the logic later,

10:14.080 --> 10:18.940
for now, I just wanted to add one piece of logic, we'll do that in the next lecture, connect the place

10:18.940 --> 10:26.740
input to actually store what the user entered so that we can add places again and thereafter, also work

10:26.740 --> 10:28.180
on the other components.

10:28.180 --> 10:28.900
One more thing,

10:28.930 --> 10:30.680
let's go to pick location,

10:30.790 --> 10:36.400
let's also add on press with some dummy function here to get rid of that warning

10:36.430 --> 10:37.880
for the moment,

10:38.020 --> 10:41.940
so here we can say pick location.

10:41.950 --> 10:48.000
So with that, let's make sure we connect our place input to the share place in the next lecture.
