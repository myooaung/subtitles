00:02.630 --> 00:04.080
So we covered animations and 

00:04.130 --> 00:07.790
as I mentioned, definitely dive into the official documentation

00:07.820 --> 00:13.850
if you want to dive deeper and run more complex animations. There are more functions, alternatives to

00:13.850 --> 00:20.560
timing where you don't specify a timing but get realistic animation over a time

00:20.570 --> 00:22.060
you can define,

00:22.280 --> 00:28.970
you also learn more about how to run animations in parallel for example and way more.

00:28.970 --> 00:35.090
You also learn about some gotchas, so that there are some values or some styles which you can't really

00:35.090 --> 00:35.600
animate,

00:35.600 --> 00:41.210
you can learn more about the native driver and native driver is exactly what limits your ability to

00:41.220 --> 00:42.320
animate certain things,

00:42.320 --> 00:49.820
so there you see that you can only animate non-layout properties like transform and opacity, so flex

00:49.820 --> 00:54.710
elements or position properties are not animatable when using the native driver but you should use that

00:54.710 --> 00:59.630
whenever possible to get a good performance and so on.

00:59.630 --> 01:05.840
So this is a good place to dive deeper if you want to learn more about animations

01:06.110 --> 01:12.290
but you should have a solid grasp of the core idea of this automatically managed value and how to use

01:12.290 --> 01:14.830
that value to change the style over time,

01:14.870 --> 01:19.030
you should have all that and with that, let's now conclude this module.
