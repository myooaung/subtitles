00:02.440 --> 00:07.480
Let's start with the icons because if we have a look at our application right now, this is the ios

00:07.530 --> 00:10.150
icon and here on Android,

00:10.330 --> 00:13.420
well we got this default Android robot.

00:13.420 --> 00:15.910
So this is not really a nice icon,

00:16.150 --> 00:19.090
adding icons thankfully is relatively simple though.

00:19.330 --> 00:24.340
Attached to this video, you will find a couple of image files which we'll use

00:24.710 --> 00:30.530
and let's start by creating an android icon. For that you need Android studio

00:30.610 --> 00:36.980
and there, you should go into your app folder in your open project, so open your project with the android

00:36.980 --> 00:37.510
studio as

00:37.510 --> 00:39.000
we did it before in this course,

00:39.010 --> 00:44.680
navigate into that Android folder and open that Android folder in your project, so this folder here, open

00:44.810 --> 00:50.870
it with Android studio and in there, you'll have this app folder, the same you can add it from in here

00:51.700 --> 00:58.300
but here in Android studio, we get some extra tools. Go to the source folder and then there in the main

00:58.300 --> 01:01.660
folder, there is this res folder for resources.

01:01.660 --> 01:08.620
Here you see a couple of folders which actually hold the launcher icon you're seeing, this robot. Replacing

01:08.620 --> 01:12.070
this is the goal and there is a convenient way of doing that,

01:12.160 --> 01:20.680
you can just right click on this folder and then click on new and then on image asset. There you can

01:20.680 --> 01:27.380
create a launcher icon with this convenient helper, so you can basically leave all the defaults,

01:27.460 --> 01:31.230
definitely leave the name so that the other launcher icon is overridden,

01:31.450 --> 01:38.500
that's the name linked in your manifest file, I'll come back to that and leave all the settings as I said.

01:38.530 --> 01:44.580
Now what you have to do and can do is you have to pick your image, here under source asset.

01:44.710 --> 01:49.540
Choose one of this, it could just be some text you enter here but I'll pick an image and then use the

01:49.540 --> 01:52.470
image I attached to this video,

01:53.360 --> 01:58.930
to be precise use the app icon one, without any other extension just appicon.png and open

01:58.930 --> 01:59.480
it.

01:59.900 --> 02:04.280
Then you see a preview and this tool will automatically generate a couple of icons that look good on

02:04.280 --> 02:09.130
different devices and on different Android versions, so really convenient.

02:09.140 --> 02:16.900
Now here my project actually doesn't target API 26 or higher, so I can also just use the legacy only approach

02:16.910 --> 02:22.100
but if you're targeting API 26 or higher, then definitely go with adaptive than legacy,

02:22.190 --> 02:25.960
if you use legacy only, then you still leave the name as it is.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.750
We pick an image and you use the same image as before and it will then still give you these images here,

02:33.810 --> 02:40.230
these previews, then we can click next and override the existing icon and click finish.

02:41.410 --> 02:47.910
With that we have now our icon as the app icon and we can see this if we reinstall our app,

02:47.950 --> 02:50.770
so let's uninstall the older version here

02:52.100 --> 02:57.000
and let's thereafter in our projects just run npm run Android.

02:57.010 --> 03:03.320
This will now rebuild the application and of course include this new icon and it will then install this

03:03.350 --> 03:06.910
application on the Android device.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.700
Once it's done, it'll here looks as it always does

03:09.780 --> 03:16.580
but if we open this app drawer, here we can see our icon and we can of course also add it to the home

03:16.580 --> 03:17.070
screen,

03:17.100 --> 03:19.290
so that looks much better now.

03:21.160 --> 03:28.170
How about ios? There we of course can also add an icon, we do this with Xcode

03:29.220 --> 03:35.130
and of course here the important part is as with all the iOS related things, the iOS app related things,

03:35.520 --> 03:38.850
you can't do that on a Windows machine unfortunately.

03:38.940 --> 03:47.100
Now here in Xcode, what you do is you simply go to this image XC assets file here and click on app

03:47.190 --> 03:53.790
icon and there you now got a couple of slots where you should drop in icons and I prepared all these

03:53.930 --> 03:54.710
icons for you,

03:54.710 --> 03:58.060
you can see you have a 2x and a 3x variant of most of them

03:58.120 --> 04:01.830
and one 1024 point version.

04:02.070 --> 04:06.290
Now you can simply drag your icons into the respective slots now,

04:06.300 --> 04:09.850
so here's the 20 by 2 and 20 by 3 version

04:10.110 --> 04:13.770
and I'm going to do this for all the slots you see here,

04:13.770 --> 04:17.550
that is why I provided all these different icons sizes for you.

04:22.510 --> 04:28.770
With that, that's already it, I've finished this set up, this is all we needed to do here.

04:28.900 --> 04:33.530
I can now go to my iOS app and also uninstall that

04:33.700 --> 04:41.170
and in our project i can now run ios so npm run ios to rebuild that and include the new icon and

04:41.170 --> 04:46.850
then it will install this here and it will install it with our new icon we assigned.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.370
So let's wait for that,

04:50.450 --> 04:52.270
here we are, you can already see it,

04:52.460 --> 04:54.200
here's our nice

04:54.200 --> 04:56.490
lovely icon. Now

04:56.510 --> 05:02.590
one thing that is missing is a nice splash screen. We can see it if we kill this process and start the

05:02.670 --> 05:06.290
app and we don't even have a splash screen for Android.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.340
So in the next lecture, let's add a nice splash screens.
