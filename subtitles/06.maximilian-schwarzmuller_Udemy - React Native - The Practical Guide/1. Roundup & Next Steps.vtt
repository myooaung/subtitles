00:02.540 --> 00:03.460
Great job.

00:03.500 --> 00:04.060
You did it.

00:04.070 --> 00:10.070
You completed this course and therefore you learned a lot about risk native and how to build React Native

00:10.070 --> 00:16.730
apps with React Native and its core components and its core features but also with many important third

00:16.730 --> 00:21.950
party packages like rate navigation like maps or the camera.

00:21.980 --> 00:26.960
So all these native modules which you can integrate and you'll learn that all with the help of Expo

00:26.960 --> 00:30.920
an amazing tool that makes building React Native apps so much easier.

00:31.040 --> 00:37.550
But I also showed you how you can build apps without Expo how you can turn your expo app into a non

00:37.550 --> 00:44.300
Expo app and dead even when using Expo and getting this easier development flow that you still get a

00:44.300 --> 00:49.790
normal react native app in the end which you can deploy as a standalone app to both the Apple App Store

00:49.790 --> 00:51.040
and the Google Play store.

00:51.500 --> 00:56.870
So therefore you now get all the tools you needs to continue your journey as a react native developer

00:57.310 --> 01:02.780
and you are well-prepared to dive into React Native jobs to build our projects build your own project

01:02.810 --> 01:05.390
and of course because that's always important.

01:05.390 --> 01:11.390
Keep on practicing and that would be my recommendation in general if we have a look at the next steps

01:11.390 --> 01:17.360
you could and you probably should take if you want to continue with React Native then the most important

01:17.360 --> 01:24.140
step as always in life and as always in programming is that you continue practicing This course gives

01:24.140 --> 01:30.470
you very solid fundamentals and the core foundation you need to be a React Native developer but you

01:30.560 --> 01:38.840
always need to keep on practicing build dummy projects build simplified clones of popular apps and therefore

01:38.840 --> 01:44.660
practice all the things you learned you will encounter problems and challenges along the way in solving

01:44.660 --> 01:50.840
these on your own with the help of Google and stack overflow and the official docs and so on that will

01:50.840 --> 01:57.730
make you a real and a better React Native developer now already kind of mentioned it also dive into

01:57.730 --> 02:04.690
those official docs be that there React Native docs the expo docs the docs if a specific third party

02:04.690 --> 02:11.710
package you're using and also exploring samples many third party packages give you examples of how you

02:11.710 --> 02:17.410
may use them in which different ways you could work with the package and you will also find plenty of

02:17.650 --> 02:24.810
demo projects on github for example by people who built dummy or Real Apps with React Native so definitely

02:24.810 --> 02:31.060
always explore those to get ideas on how you could build a react native app with that and in addition

02:31.120 --> 02:36.610
also explore other packages you could be using alternatives to the packages I used in the course maybe

02:36.850 --> 02:42.310
because that again will broaden your horizons give you more tools and a deeper understanding of how

02:42.310 --> 02:44.430
all these things work together.

02:44.770 --> 02:50.410
Now last but not least it's important to stay updated because like everything in development React Native

02:50.410 --> 02:57.330
keeps on moving it's a moving target we see new features maybe some features are deprecated maybe there's

02:57.370 --> 03:02.800
a new package out there that does something in it easier or better way than you used to do it so different

03:02.800 --> 03:08.230
Keep your eyes open checked you official React Native blog check the expo blog if you're using that

03:08.500 --> 03:15.190
check do you change log or check the GitHub repo of the React Native project to stay updated about changes

03:15.190 --> 03:21.760
that might help you in future projects or that might require you to adjust your code of course as it

03:21.760 --> 03:22.500
did in the past.

03:22.510 --> 03:28.420
I'll keep this course updated as well and I'll inform you about important changes but not every change

03:28.420 --> 03:34.060
that happens is the react native ecosystem affects this course so therefore you definitely also need

03:34.060 --> 03:40.150
to stay updated on your own well and with that you get everything you need you're well prepared to become

03:40.150 --> 03:42.870
a React Native developer and I wish you all the best.

03:42.940 --> 03:48.820
I hope this course was helpful to you I hope you got a lot out of it and I'd love to see you and our

03:48.820 --> 03:49.780
courses as well.
