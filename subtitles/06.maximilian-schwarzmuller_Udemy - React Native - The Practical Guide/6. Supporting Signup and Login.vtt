00:02.320 --> 00:11.010
So right now we always use this sign up action here and we don't really respect the choice of the user

00:11.020 --> 00:16.630
on our form, we always trigger on login and that always leads

00:16.630 --> 00:18.830
basically to our sign up method.

00:19.030 --> 00:24.340
Now first of all, I rename the prop here which is totally optional but I want it to be a bit clearer

00:24.340 --> 00:25.490
from its name,

00:26.450 --> 00:32.530
on login will now be on try auth because that's essentially what we dispatch here too,

00:32.780 --> 00:35.800
so I will also rename that in my login handler

00:38.780 --> 00:45.450
which I'll therefore also rename to my auth handler.

00:45.490 --> 00:51.010
That means we also need to change it in our or on our button where we trigger this,

00:51.010 --> 00:54.750
so here, on Press this auth handler is now correct

00:55.300 --> 01:01.860
and as a next step, I want to make sure that we actually can do both sign up or sign in.

01:01.870 --> 01:09.460
So I actually pass a second argument here which can be a string, sign up or maybe sign in or login or

01:09.460 --> 01:10.570
whatever you want.

01:12.220 --> 01:15.220
Now actually, we already get that information here,

01:15.460 --> 01:19.050
remember that in our state, we have this auth mode,

01:19.240 --> 01:26.800
well that's just what I want to forward here. So I will forward this state auth mode as a second argument

01:27.010 --> 01:33.630
to on try auth, it of course means that we need to adjust the code at the bottom of this file where we

01:33.630 --> 01:40.740
map dispatch to props, we no longer only get auth data, we also get the auth mode here and

01:40.740 --> 01:45.430
we should forward that auth mode to try auth too.

01:45.540 --> 01:52.790
Now we can go to the auth action creator and there, we now also receive, here it is, not just the

01:52.790 --> 01:55.690
auth data but also the auth mode.

01:56.020 --> 01:58.760
And now I can simply check inside this function

01:58.860 --> 02:00.080
what we want to do,

02:00.340 --> 02:04.590
I'll see if auth mode is equal to login,

02:04.860 --> 02:09.270
in this case I want to dispatch some login action which we don't have yet

02:09.270 --> 02:12.740
otherwise I'll try it with a sign up,

02:13.080 --> 02:16.260
so I will dispatch this, what we already got.

02:17.570 --> 02:24.950
With this if I save this code and we reload this auth screen and we stay in the login mode in which we

02:25.010 --> 02:29.800
are by default and I enter the email we already got and I hit submit,

02:29.840 --> 02:37.070
nothing happens because now we dispatch no action in the end, we reach try auth but there we entered this block

02:37.100 --> 02:40.970
and the first part of it and there, nothing happens.

02:40.970 --> 02:46.530
So let's implement the sign in logic in the next lecture and then add it here.
