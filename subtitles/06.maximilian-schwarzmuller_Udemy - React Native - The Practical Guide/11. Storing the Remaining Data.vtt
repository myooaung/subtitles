00:02.050 --> 00:06.850
So we added our own API endpoints to store the image, to upload the image,

00:06.850 --> 00:11.380
let's now comment the other fetch requests back in

00:11.380 --> 00:12.730
and let's send it

00:12.850 --> 00:19.780
when we got the image url which we'll get in the parsed response of this upload request here.

00:19.810 --> 00:25.420
So parsed response which we previously logged to the console will hold an image url property

00:25.810 --> 00:30.310
and it's this url that I also want to store in my firebase database,

00:30.670 --> 00:36.190
so in this then block, I will return this fetch request.

00:36.220 --> 00:42.010
Now you can return a promise in the then block and then chain another then call to this then call,

00:42.010 --> 00:49.190
so this is why it's really convenient to return a promise here which we do, I store the place data here,

00:49.270 --> 00:54.240
the place data is this object but the place data misses the image of course.

00:54.490 --> 01:01.990
So what I'll do is I'll not create the place data up here but I'll create it down here and I will also add

01:02.050 --> 01:06.580
another property image where I access parsed response,

01:06.850 --> 01:13.600
so parseRes.imageUrl, that's the property we're generating on the backend. This is the data we

01:13.620 --> 01:15.490
then store and with this,

01:15.490 --> 01:21.530
we can now chain all these calls to that promise here to know if that then also succeed.

01:21.530 --> 01:28.540
So now what we have is a chain where we first of all upload the image and if that succeeds, we continue

01:28.540 --> 01:34.750
and then we also store the rest of the data on the server, including a link to that stored image. And

01:34.750 --> 01:38.050
once we're done here, then we really got everything stored,

01:38.080 --> 01:42.260
we got the image on the server and we are done.

01:42.310 --> 01:48.330
Now let's test this one more time before we then think about how we would actually present an error

01:48.370 --> 01:54.970
to the user and maybe more important even, how we show the user that something is happening because

01:54.970 --> 02:00.800
right now, the user can spam the share place button because we don't disable it or anything like that.

02:00.910 --> 02:02.350
So let's do this as a next step,

02:02.350 --> 02:07.330
first of all let's save the changed file and reload our react native application

02:07.330 --> 02:13.480
and then let's try this again. I'm logging in here or maybe let's do this on Android,

02:13.500 --> 02:14.980
why don't we do that here

02:15.010 --> 02:17.240
to see that that also works here.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.660
So I reloaded Android,

02:19.850 --> 02:21.930
then I will log in on Android

02:26.090 --> 02:29.240
and here, I now want to pick an image.

02:29.270 --> 02:31.450
There we have to use the camera,

02:31.740 --> 02:34.590
yeah let's shoot this beautiful image here,

02:35.080 --> 02:37.670
I then also want to locate myself

02:37.700 --> 02:38.910
so I'm doing that here,

02:39.750 --> 02:43.170
testing from Android is what we're doing here

02:43.560 --> 02:46.730
and with that, I can share the place

02:46.770 --> 02:48.220
so let's do this.

02:48.220 --> 02:50.250
And now here, we also don't get any feedback

02:50.250 --> 02:55.910
so again this is something we need to improve but should only be a matter of time,

02:55.920 --> 03:01.510
this is also not connected to our react native debugging tool, so we don't see it here either.

03:01.560 --> 03:09.390
We can see once it's done on firebase of course, in the database tab here under all places, there a

03:09.390 --> 03:14.110
new place with an image should get added once it's done, it already is done.

03:14.190 --> 03:17.770
So let's now grab that image url here,

03:17.850 --> 03:22.310
notice this is testing from Android so this is what we just did, paste it into a new tab

03:22.320 --> 03:24.000
and here is the image,

03:24.000 --> 03:24.650
awesome.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.100
So with that, we see it works on both devices,

03:27.150 --> 03:29.790
we also then use it and store it on firebase.

03:29.790 --> 03:31.650
This is all working,

03:31.650 --> 03:36.000
now let's make sure that we also show some feedback to the user.
