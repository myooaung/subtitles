00:02.200 --> 00:08.410
So regarding the spacing on the image picker component I'll simply add a little bit of margin bottom

00:08.410 --> 00:15.160
here of 15 to add a spacing between this image picker component and everything else in the form but

00:15.160 --> 00:21.520
the more important thing of course is that we kind of passed his picked image on to our our place our

00:21.520 --> 00:25.870
new place screen right because that's where we need to image in the end I don't just need it here as

00:25.870 --> 00:28.370
a preview I also needed in that our screen.

00:28.600 --> 00:33.910
Well for Dad we can go to our take image handler and when we set this as a preview of course we can

00:34.000 --> 00:41.590
also reach out to our props and assume that we get a let's say on image taken prop which should point

00:41.620 --> 00:48.760
at a function which we define in the new place screen which we can now execute and to that function

00:48.780 --> 00:54.700
I forward my image you are I as well so I don't just thought it here internally to have a preview.

00:54.700 --> 01:01.730
I also forwarded to debt to the parent component so to say and that should be on image taken.

01:01.920 --> 01:08.250
So all we need to do for this to work is we need to go to the new place screen and add this on image

01:08.250 --> 01:10.350
taken prop here on the image picker.

01:10.410 --> 01:14.510
And now this should point at a function which is executed by the image picker.

01:14.550 --> 01:16.410
Once we did pick our image.

01:16.680 --> 01:22.950
So of course here I also want to store that value so I'll add another state here and that's the image

01:23.820 --> 01:27.300
value or just image and set image.

01:27.390 --> 01:38.540
Maybe these selected image and set selected Image Name is up to you which initially is now lower simply

01:38.540 --> 01:40.280
undefined like this.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.470
And now we can add a new function for this.

01:42.470 --> 01:50.240
The image taken handler here which receives the image payoff in the end right.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.990
That's what we forward from the image picture of when we call this function.

01:54.230 --> 02:01.370
And here we then set the selected image to the image path we're getting as our argument and the image

02:01.370 --> 02:06.800
taken handler is now what we pass into the image picture here with the help of the on image taken prop.

02:06.920 --> 02:14.140
And this is how we communicate between the image picker and the new place screen when we now click these

02:14.140 --> 02:20.850
safe button and therefore the safe place handler gets executed when we dispatched his ad place action.

02:20.860 --> 02:24.010
I now want to forward the selected image.

02:24.100 --> 02:32.380
So this state constant here of course for that we need to tweak the ad plays action creator a bit right

02:32.380 --> 02:38.740
now it only expects a title it should not always expect to image and also ad does here to our place

02:38.740 --> 02:40.950
data and in the reducer.

02:40.990 --> 02:47.430
I now want to add the image to the place which is getting created but important right now our play small

02:47.440 --> 02:48.370
expects no image.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.150
So it's time to change that as well.

02:50.170 --> 02:57.220
Ad image you are LDA or maybe image you are I to be precise because it's local and then have this image

02:57.250 --> 03:06.490
you are I said equal to image you or I were getting here and now with this adjusted back in the places

03:06.490 --> 03:15.640
reducer we now get this extra image data in our action and we need to pass this on to the new place

03:15.640 --> 03:21.670
constructor so here action plays state DOT image is what I want to forward.

03:21.670 --> 03:28.750
So that's the new argument added to the place constructor and action place data image of course refers

03:28.750 --> 03:35.840
to the image we're setting here in our action object so that the image is actually getting added to

03:35.840 --> 03:37.160
the place which is created.

03:37.280 --> 03:42.920
And with that into place list screen where we output the place item we can now feed some data into the

03:42.920 --> 03:50.360
image and that would be item data dot item dot image you are L image you are L because item data dot

03:50.420 --> 03:56.750
item refers to a single place which is created as defined in our place model and there we have image

03:56.780 --> 04:03.090
you are I and therefore of course here it should be image you are I not you are L but that's the important.

04:03.220 --> 04:05.200
It's not just image it's image you or I.

04:05.230 --> 04:12.740
Because here we're referring to a place object following our place model if we now save that and have

04:12.740 --> 04:13.410
a look.

04:13.580 --> 04:19.250
This should actually work and should allow us to add images which we also see in our place list.

04:19.340 --> 04:30.680
So here if I click take image and I take this dummy image here like this crop this and then also add

04:30.980 --> 04:34.700
a title here and click safe place.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.710
This doesn't look too bad we see our image here.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.770
Now one thing is important to understand.

04:40.880 --> 04:47.240
Thus far we're only storing this image in the default path we get out of the box which is this temporary

04:47.240 --> 04:52.160
path and that's of course not where we want to have it stored because as I mentioned this will be cleared

04:52.160 --> 04:57.050
periodically and therefore eventually we'll lose our image which of course is not the goal here.
