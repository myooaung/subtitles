So what's different compared to the web?

00:05.340 --> 00:09.660
Well if you compare the web with a native app, in the web we have a url,

00:09.720 --> 00:16.260
we have a url like /users at the end of our domain and then, we have a tool like react router

00:16.260 --> 00:22.710
which parses this and which loads the appropriate container or component of our react app which should

00:22.710 --> 00:25.920
handle this route. Now in a native app,

00:25.950 --> 00:33.450
we obviously don't navigate around with urls, instead we might have tabs or we have a stack based

00:33.570 --> 00:39.420
navigation where we can tap a button, we're taken to the next page and then we get this back button to

00:39.420 --> 00:40.530
go back.

00:40.770 --> 00:47.390
These are typical navigation solutions or approaches in native apps and

00:47.680 --> 00:55.420
and in the end, we still want to load a page though, we still want to load some react component but we won't

00:55.420 --> 00:56.250
to use react

00:56.260 --> 01:04.310
router, we're not handling urls. So let's dive into possible solutions for this issue or for this

01:04.320 --> 01:10.350
case that we can't use our web solution and let's find out how these solutions then work.
