So in the last lectures we saw how to run the application on Android devices or an Android simulator,

00:07.480 --> 00:13.710
now I want to do the same for iOS and here, these steps only work on a Mac,

00:13.810 --> 00:20.100
you can't build for iOS on a Windows machine, you can't even run them on a simulator there.

00:20.260 --> 00:23.320
So sorry if you've got Windows, no chance to do that,

00:23.340 --> 00:29.110
if you get a Mac though, you need to install Xcode which is Apple's development environment for iOS

00:29.110 --> 00:29.810
apps.

00:29.830 --> 00:36.490
We won't use Xcode to write our code but just like Android Studio, we can use it to well basically

00:36.490 --> 00:41.680
launch a simulator, though even that would happen automatically here but we'll later also need it

00:41.710 --> 00:43.250
and I'll come back to when we need it.

00:43.330 --> 00:49.530
So make sure to install Xcode and launch it at least once to accept any license agreement it throws

00:49.540 --> 00:50.860
at you.

00:50.890 --> 00:54.580
Once you did all of that, you can simply run npm run ios,

00:54.580 --> 01:01.780
so it's a bit easier and for Android, not much else needed and there it automatically will build it for

01:02.300 --> 01:06.280
iOS now for Xcode, it launched my simulator here

01:06.280 --> 01:13.250
too so let's wait for this to finish booting up and once it did finish boot up, it will just finish the

01:13.280 --> 01:19.310
compilation here over in the terminal where we ran the command. And as a side note, all these commands

01:19.370 --> 01:21.550
are commands you don't have to keep going,

01:21.550 --> 01:23.880
they don't start a process which keeps on,

01:23.990 --> 01:25.760
they just are one time commands,

01:25.790 --> 01:30.650
building the project and shipping it, it's this terminal window here on the left which you need to keep

01:30.650 --> 01:37.220
running which in the end will always redeploy updated versions of your project and that is the case no

01:37.220 --> 01:41.320
matter if you're building for Android or iOS or whatever you are doing.

01:41.540 --> 01:43.320
So let's wait for this to finish

01:44.140 --> 01:49.540
and once it did finish, it also starts the app here, again it builds it which can take a bit longer

01:49.540 --> 01:56.510
the first time it does that but thereafter, we'll see our application run here on the iPhone simulator,

01:56.590 --> 02:01.740
you don't even need the iPhone for that. But we will still also run it on an iPhone,

02:01.840 --> 02:09.330
so for that let me simply close the simulator by killing the process, by quitting from it.

02:09.550 --> 02:13.950
In the next video, I will show you how to run your project on an iPhone.
