00:02.190 --> 00:07.460
Now you learn how you can add funds to an application and attached you find a zip file with the funds

00:07.470 --> 00:10.000
I want to add for Dad and the assets folder.

00:10.020 --> 00:16.290
I'll add a new fonts folder and then it's the open Sands bold and regular TDM file which is in the zip

00:16.290 --> 00:19.350
file you find attached that I want to add here.

00:19.470 --> 00:22.670
Now adding the files alone won't do much as you of course know.

00:22.710 --> 00:27.690
Instead we have to load these fonts and we do that in the app jazz file which is our starting file that

00:27.690 --> 00:31.070
starts the entire app in there.

00:31.170 --> 00:36.660
We need to import everything as fund from Expo dash fund.

00:36.660 --> 00:43.320
And this might not be available in your project yet so therefore you might want to run npm install dash

00:43.320 --> 00:45.010
dash save Expo fund.

00:45.030 --> 00:52.530
To be sure debt at Subway level to install that package and with that installed you can import fund

00:52.620 --> 00:54.750
from there like that.

00:54.750 --> 01:02.910
And I also want to import the app loading component from Expo that's the component that will prolong

01:02.910 --> 01:09.000
these splash screen when the app starts until our fonts are loaded so that we only see something on

01:09.000 --> 01:14.670
the screen when all our assets and in this case these are the funds are really away lable and are really

01:14.700 --> 01:22.950
there now with that with these imports added We can add a function here outside of our component function

01:23.250 --> 01:25.130
which I'll name fetch funds.

01:25.310 --> 01:30.180
And this is a function which will in the end use fund.

01:30.600 --> 01:39.190
So what I'm importing here load async and then we pass an object where we describe the data we want

01:39.190 --> 01:47.110
to load and that's the open sans font which I'll register under open since we add this by requiring

01:47.110 --> 01:57.890
this from dot slash assets funds open sends not bold but regular CTF and then in addition we have open

01:57.890 --> 02:05.470
dash sans dash bold that's the other font I want to register by requiring it from assets funds open

02:05.470 --> 02:08.210
sense bold ETF like this.

02:08.440 --> 02:14.320
Now we need to return this because load async returns a promise and I want to return this in my fetch

02:14.320 --> 02:20.410
funds function because with this we can use it to with the app loading component and that's a pattern

02:20.410 --> 02:22.430
you'll learn about early in the course.

02:22.450 --> 02:23.970
So the case is brand new to you.

02:24.010 --> 02:28.040
Make sure you go through the average sections of this course first.

02:28.060 --> 02:34.840
So now we can use fetch funds with app loading and we do this inside of our app component in there.

02:34.840 --> 02:41.680
I will manage some state and I do this with the help of the U.S. State hook which we import from react

02:42.610 --> 02:51.760
and I'll named as state fund loaded and set front loaded and call U.S. state and initially that's false

02:51.790 --> 02:54.260
because initially default hasn't been loaded.

02:54.400 --> 03:00.100
And then here we can check if the fund has not been loaded which initially is the case then I want to

03:00.100 --> 03:07.270
return the app loading component instead of my normal app content because in the app loading component

03:07.600 --> 03:14.600
we can at the start async property and point at fetch funds which kicks off this fund fetching function.

03:14.860 --> 03:21.430
And once this is done the function we pass to unfinished will be called and in dysfunctional simply

03:21.430 --> 03:29.240
set fund loaded to true like this so this makes sure that we simply keep the splash screen open until

03:29.240 --> 03:35.600
our fonts are loaded and this will be rendered until we review it loaded our funds sent there after

03:35.840 --> 03:42.590
will instead load discontent now with that we're making sure that we're importing our funds and that

03:42.590 --> 03:45.870
we can start using them and we'll need them throughout this module.

03:45.980 --> 03:52.280
With that it's now time to get started with actually adding what we all came for the navigation.
