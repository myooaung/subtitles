Let's reduce the image size and for that, we can use a feature react native image picker provides us with, we

00:08.510 --> 00:11.890
can tell it to provide us smaller images.

00:12.200 --> 00:18.280
So let's go to share place or to be precise here to the pick image component,

00:18.300 --> 00:25.340
so in components, to pick image. Here we use the image picker and show image picker has this options

00:25.340 --> 00:26.500
object.

00:26.510 --> 00:33.040
Now I informed you about that no data option if you don't need the base64 version, you can also pass

00:33.320 --> 00:36.610
a max height and width property here

00:36.770 --> 00:41.720
and this does just what it sounds like, it restricts the maximum height or width of the photos you're

00:41.720 --> 00:42.770
grabbing.

00:42.770 --> 00:52.700
So here we could say the maximum width in pixels should be let's say 800 and the maximum height could be

00:53.000 --> 00:59.390
let's say 600, whatever you want, you can of course fine tune this to the needs of your application.

00:59.390 --> 01:04.750
Now if we do this, let's save this code and let's reload this

01:04.910 --> 01:07.950
ios application and pick an image again

01:08.820 --> 01:11.310
and let's use this image here.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.220
Now it looks good still,

01:13.440 --> 01:18.840
let's also locate ourselves and try this, share the place

01:21.680 --> 01:26.740
and now this went much faster because now the image we uploaded was much smaller,

01:26.780 --> 01:32.760
we can confirm this on firebase storage if we visit all our places here and yes, we can see another

01:32.780 --> 01:33.500
issue here,

01:33.500 --> 01:35.910
we'll dive into this later too.

01:35.990 --> 01:39.960
We can already see that of all the images we got here,

01:40.280 --> 01:46.790
that's the one I uploaded just a few seconds ago here and you see unlike the other images,

01:46.790 --> 01:51.810
this one only has a couple of kilobytes instead of megabytes.

01:51.830 --> 01:55.970
Of course you could shrink this even more if you restrict max height and width even more,

01:55.970 --> 02:00.350
so you can reduce these numbers again to create an even smaller image.

02:00.350 --> 02:01.400
So this is already huge,

02:01.400 --> 02:04.070
we decreased the size of all of that.

02:04.220 --> 02:11.230
The next thing is that I want to clear this page and I want to navigate to find place.

02:11.270 --> 02:14.430
Now let's work on these steps in the next lecture.
