00:02.300 --> 00:10.210
With our firebase function updated, let's now use it in our places actions file where we do send a request

00:10.210 --> 00:11.140
to it.

00:11.150 --> 00:15.120
Now there we don't need to attach our token with the auth query parameter,

00:15.230 --> 00:19.210
we do have a token though but we need to set some extra header so

00:19.220 --> 00:23.450
let's add the headers object here

00:23.740 --> 00:30.130
and let's add an authorization header, casing shouldn't matter but I'll write it with an uppercase character

00:30.130 --> 00:30.990
at the beginning

00:32.000 --> 00:41.770
and the value will be bearer, an empty space and then the token. And with this, we should actually send

00:41.770 --> 00:46.190
the token to this backend. Now we catch any errors here

00:46.910 --> 00:52.960
but thereafter we continue and we continue by sending another fetch request to the firebase database,

00:53.120 --> 00:55.640
well there we also need to add our token

00:55.640 --> 00:56.940
otherwise this will fail so

00:56.990 --> 01:05.950
let's add the token here too. With that we have an add place function that also should work.

01:06.210 --> 01:08.090
Let's reload the app and let's try it out,

01:08.100 --> 01:13.810
let's create a new user or sign user in to be precise,

01:14.130 --> 01:16.190
let's go to share place,

01:16.260 --> 01:18.220
now let's pick an image here,

01:21.120 --> 01:24.290
maybe this one, locate ourselves

01:27.140 --> 01:33.100
and give it a fitting name and share the place and keep in mind this can take a little while here

01:33.140 --> 01:40.130
since we're again uploading a rather big image with a rather bad internet connection here on the simulator.

01:42.610 --> 01:45.020
And I actually do get an error here,

01:45.020 --> 01:47.080
token is not defined,

01:47.940 --> 01:51.410
do you know why we get this?

01:51.600 --> 01:56.250
We get this because our function code, the cloud function code is correct

01:56.310 --> 02:03.660
but here in our places action creator for adding a place, we get the token here after auth get token and

02:03.660 --> 02:11.280
there we return fetch and we send the request to our cloud function and then we're done with this then block.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.580
We send the next request to the database in a

02:13.590 --> 02:16.370
totally different then block, here

02:16.500 --> 02:19.710
this token variable doesn't exist,

02:19.890 --> 02:23.780
it's only this argument we get here in this function.

02:24.150 --> 02:29.900
So to use it in the other then block too, we can simply create a new variable

02:29.900 --> 02:31.800
here right at the start,

02:32.190 --> 02:34.970
maybe name it auth token to avoid confusion

02:37.520 --> 02:44.020
and then set auth token equal to token here

02:44.220 --> 02:52.740
once we got it and then pass auth token here as a token to our authorization header and then also use

02:52.800 --> 02:59.730
auth token in the second fetch request here, instead of token and this will now be generally available.

02:59.740 --> 03:01.350
Now let's try this on Android

03:01.350 --> 03:02.820
in the meantime,

03:02.820 --> 03:07.620
so there I can of course login with the same credentials because it's the same backend so accounts

03:07.620 --> 03:12.190
are shared across device of course.

03:12.190 --> 03:17.270
Now let's share a place, let's pick an image, take a photo,

03:17.350 --> 03:20.110
this one here,

03:20.330 --> 03:22.140
let's pick a location here,

03:22.400 --> 03:23.600
let's enter some name,

03:23.600 --> 03:26.310
testing this token thing

03:27.320 --> 03:31.270
and let's share this place and it should have succeeded

03:31.290 --> 03:38.120
since we don't get an error here. Let's now check this on our firebase database,

03:42.340 --> 03:49.000
testing this token thing, here we got it, here we got an image link, let's also test this for completeness

03:49.060 --> 03:50.300
sake,

03:50.360 --> 03:51.820
there's our image.

03:51.820 --> 03:53.670
So this is all working,

03:53.830 --> 04:00.980
now we successfully get the token, store the token then use the token to then authenticate ourselves.

04:01.060 --> 04:09.400
So it looks pretty finished but now the real work starts because what happens if the user is inactive

04:09.430 --> 04:15.670
and comes back to our app, how long is this token valid, how can we automatically log the user in,

04:15.670 --> 04:18.800
how can we store the token across app

04:18.940 --> 04:22.730
relaunches? All these things because right now,

04:22.840 --> 04:27.360
ok if I close the app like this and reopen it, I'm back to this page

04:27.460 --> 04:31.080
but what if I actually dismiss the task and reload the app,

04:31.180 --> 04:36.410
then we're back to the auth screen and wouldn't it be better to automatically log the user in at this point?

04:36.430 --> 04:38.720
These are all things we'll cover next.
