WEBVTT

00:02.420 --> 00:07.190
We want to dispatch this action on the filters screen of course because that is where we do is set all

00:07.190 --> 00:08.870
these filters.

00:08.980 --> 00:14.980
Right now we manage them here in internal state and dead will stay this way because we definitely need

00:15.430 --> 00:17.490
our filters there.

00:17.680 --> 00:21.610
But now of course I want to dispatch an action when the save button is pressed.

00:21.610 --> 00:26.210
Thankfully I already have a connection to the header set up with use of fact and set perms.

00:26.530 --> 00:31.020
So all we have to do is replace console log here with this patch.

00:31.180 --> 00:39.280
Now of course to use this patch we first of all need to import the use dispatch hook here from react

00:39.330 --> 00:41.350
read acts like this.

00:41.350 --> 00:46.490
And now we can use that hook here to get access to the dispatch function.

00:46.910 --> 00:51.530
So cons to dispatch equals use dispatch executed as a function.

00:51.530 --> 00:57.070
And now we can call dispatch here to dispatch an action.

00:57.070 --> 01:01.700
Therefore we all do by the way need to add dispatch as a dependency but react redux we'll make sure

01:01.700 --> 01:02.910
that this never changes.

01:02.990 --> 01:06.110
So this won't ever trigger a re render.

01:06.290 --> 01:07.950
Still we have to added.

01:08.120 --> 01:23.720
So that's dispatch now important we also need to import my action creator from store actions meals and

01:23.720 --> 01:25.730
of course I'm talking about the set filters.

01:25.730 --> 01:33.870
Action creator because I need to call that here to create a action I pass to dispatch down there and

01:33.960 --> 01:40.170
set filters once this applied filters object which I'm forward and there I have gluten free lactose

01:40.170 --> 01:47.550
free vegan and that should be just vegetarian important because the key is you set up here have to be

01:47.550 --> 01:52.380
the keys you're looking for in your reducer otherwise this will not work important.

01:52.380 --> 01:55.110
So really make sure those are equal.

01:55.110 --> 01:58.820
Otherwise this logic will not work.

01:58.840 --> 02:03.370
So now we're dispatching this whenever the safe button is pressed and does hopefully should adjust our

02:03.370 --> 02:09.220
filtered meals and that should then be reflected on the category meals screen because there were retrieving

02:09.220 --> 02:12.010
the filtered meals let's give it a try.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.340
Let's save this.

02:13.750 --> 02:17.590
And for example this burger probably not vegan.

02:18.010 --> 02:29.120
So let's go to filters turn vegan on safeties and I get an error can find variable actions thrown by

02:29.120 --> 02:30.010
the meals reducer.

02:30.020 --> 02:35.710
So let's have a look at that yeah it's not actions.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.020
Course it's action.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.230
That's the name of the argument.

02:39.230 --> 02:40.610
So that should be action.

02:40.610 --> 02:42.120
Minor mistake.

02:42.140 --> 02:43.150
Trust just a typo.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.660
Let's give it another try.

02:44.690 --> 02:46.220
Go back to filters.

02:46.220 --> 02:52.070
Turn on vegan safeties and now go to meals hamburgers.

02:52.090 --> 02:58.710
Now I'm not seeing them here which is good because that means it's filtered out my spaghetti with tomato

02:58.710 --> 03:04.310
sauce that's still there because obviously that is vegan at these desserts without the cheese.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.680
So that's there in German the schnitzel is gone.

03:07.670 --> 03:10.050
Quick and easy to sell it a stare which makes sense.

03:10.050 --> 03:12.060
Let's all to try no filter.

03:12.060 --> 03:13.110
Gluten free.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.030
Now the spaghetti should be gone for sure.

03:15.030 --> 03:16.350
So let's have a look.

03:16.350 --> 03:18.150
Yep they're gone.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.140
Salad is still there.

03:19.140 --> 03:20.030
Spaghetti are gone.

03:20.040 --> 03:24.240
So this logic seems to work now important.

03:24.450 --> 03:32.040
If I disable gluten free and therefore I see my spaghetti again if I add them as a favorite and then

03:32.070 --> 03:41.160
I add this filter again of course under meals they're gone under favorites I see them because that's

03:41.160 --> 03:46.860
the logic we set up that favorites doesn't take data from our filtered meals but just cares about whether

03:46.860 --> 03:48.090
it's a favorite or not.

03:48.210 --> 03:53.370
You could of course change just logic but here the logic is what it is and only the meals and the categories

03:53.370 --> 03:57.980
here are filtered out according to the filters you set up here.

03:58.200 --> 04:04.650
That would be nice to have a nice little fallback message here if we have no data because of our filters

04:05.130 --> 04:06.840
and therefore in the category meals screen.

04:06.840 --> 04:17.310
I also want to check here if displayed meals length is zero which means I have no meals to display and

04:17.310 --> 04:25.780
then I want to return a View here with my default text in there actually and that means we need to import

04:25.780 --> 04:26.170
both.

04:26.170 --> 04:34.980
We need to import a view and will also need a style sheet from React Native and import.

04:35.070 --> 04:45.400
The default text component from components default text and then add a style here.

04:45.790 --> 04:46.570
Styles

04:50.270 --> 04:56.200
not content and the default text we display could be no meals found.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.310
Maybe check your filters.

04:59.310 --> 05:05.630
Just a hint that maybe your filters are disabling the recipes you should see here.

05:05.640 --> 05:13.120
Now let's just add that styles constant here where we create a new style sheet there.

05:13.160 --> 05:20.390
I want to set up that content key where I use flex 1 and then again Center the content horizontally

05:20.390 --> 05:26.640
and vertically with the help of these flex box properties like that.

05:28.100 --> 05:32.570
If we now give this a try and maybe test us on Android just to mix things up even though it's a bit

05:32.570 --> 05:43.440
slower I can go to my folders there set gluten free go back to my meals Italian therefore does it's

05:43.440 --> 05:49.470
not there so I get this message on the other end quick and easy there I do have a meal and hence I don't

05:49.470 --> 05:53.320
get this message and therefore this doesn't look too bad.

05:53.400 --> 06:00.140
And of course that's all to try disabling this filter again and go back.

06:00.160 --> 06:05.980
Here are the spaghetti so that is not all working and this is how we can manage our state with redux.
