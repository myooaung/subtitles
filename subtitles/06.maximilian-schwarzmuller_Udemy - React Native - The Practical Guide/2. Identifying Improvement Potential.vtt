00:02.650 --> 00:04.010
So here is our app

00:04.030 --> 00:09.470
and let's first of all log in and see how we like it and what we could do.

00:09.530 --> 00:12.820
Now I like the login process, that's all working fine,

00:12.850 --> 00:22.990
so let me submit this. Now one thing I don't necessarily like is that if I find places here, I got none

00:22.990 --> 00:24.140
right now

00:24.400 --> 00:31.470
but now that I did visit this page here, if I click on share place and I add a new place,

00:31.480 --> 00:33.530
so let's take a photo from the library,

00:33.550 --> 00:34.900
yes I want to do that,

00:36.620 --> 00:44.170
this one and locate myself, once I share this place, for one

00:44.170 --> 00:45.630
this loading time here,

00:45.670 --> 00:46.710
it's really long

00:46.720 --> 00:51.970
and yes I said that this is the case because the internet connection isn't that great here and the image

00:51.970 --> 00:58.590
is rather big but still I'd like to change something about this, so we'll have a look at this.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.920
Additionally we'll see one issue once this is finished,

01:01.960 --> 01:05.200
so let's wait for this to finish.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.380
It did finish,

01:06.400 --> 01:12.690
now one thing I really like to change is for one, I'd like to reset this screen here once it's done,

01:12.730 --> 01:15.920
we could also throw an alert to let the user know that it's done

01:16.150 --> 01:22.200
but I'd like to reset the screen and I'd like to automatically go to find places then. Additionally on

01:22.210 --> 01:27.250
find places, we won't see the place we just added and we got no reload

01:27.260 --> 01:29.610
button, no refresh button here.

01:29.650 --> 01:37.360
The reason why we don't see it is because on our find places screen here, we load the places when the

01:37.360 --> 01:38.800
component mounts,

01:38.800 --> 01:45.220
now that happens when we first visit this tab. If we go to the different tab, the component isn't destroyed

01:45.250 --> 01:47.080
though, it's still in memory

01:47.080 --> 01:54.430
so if we go back, componentDidMount isn't executed again. So therefore we never load the new places,

01:54.490 --> 02:00.520
so it would be nice if we would do that, if we would load new places whenever we visit this screen so that

02:00.520 --> 02:03.250
we really can provide a good user experience here.

02:04.300 --> 02:10.720
So these already are a couple of things, decrease the image size before uploading it, so that the upload

02:10.720 --> 02:16.400
is a bit faster because we don't need to ship these high res photos to our page,

02:16.540 --> 02:22.750
make sure that we reset this screen once we're done and that we navigate to find place and then on find

02:22.750 --> 02:29.650
place, we actually always load our places even if we have already visited this page before.

02:29.950 --> 02:34.830
So let's dive into all these topics and let's start with the image size.
