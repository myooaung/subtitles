00:02.280 --> 00:07.850
Welcome to this module. In this module it's now time to really take advantage of the fact that we're

00:07.850 --> 00:09.880
running on a phone.

00:09.890 --> 00:16.550
Thus far we already did this of course, we used a lot of features that make up native apps but what more

00:16.640 --> 00:25.370
native like could we do than use maps, the user location, the camera, pick an image from the image gallery,

00:25.370 --> 00:28.790
these are the things we'll have a look at in this module.

00:29.110 --> 00:36.350
Now this might sound super big and it is super important but thankfully, it's actually also super easy

00:36.350 --> 00:37.690
to do all these things,

00:37.820 --> 00:42.670
you will learn this, you will learn how to add these functionalities and then of course how to use the data

00:42.680 --> 00:47.710
you get out of that. Precisely we'll have a look at two major things in this module,

00:47.810 --> 00:54.410
we'll have a look at react native maps, a third party library which adds Google maps or Apple maps

00:54.470 --> 00:59.390
support to our application because that's not baked into react native

00:59.390 --> 01:04.340
and we'll have a look at how we can use the camera and the image gallery and therefore essentially pick

01:04.430 --> 01:05.510
an image.

01:05.510 --> 01:07.410
So that's what we're about to do,

01:07.430 --> 01:08.690
let's dive into it,

01:08.750 --> 01:11.680
let's start with some maps and the user location.
