No further to fall back here on the favorites screen it of course matters to us whether we have favorites

00:09.150 --> 00:15.570
or not so we can render a fullback here in a very simple way by not rendering the meal list.

00:15.570 --> 00:22.620
If fav meals if this array is empty so all we need to do here in the favorites stream component is we

00:22.620 --> 00:27.900
can check if fast meals length is equal to zero let's say.

00:27.900 --> 00:33.060
Which means we have no favorite meals or that contrary happened is apt.

00:33.060 --> 00:38.610
But if for some reason fav meals is is fall sick which is what this check.

00:38.610 --> 00:40.190
So if it's not set.

00:40.500 --> 00:45.780
If either of these two things is true then I will not return my meal list but a view with let's say

00:45.780 --> 00:55.510
a text in there where I say no favorite meals found start adding some.

00:55.790 --> 01:03.500
And let's actually be clear about the casing here so that's the text I could render as a fallback.

01:03.510 --> 01:07.610
Now important since I use view and text we need to import this.

01:07.680 --> 01:12.140
So view and text from React Native should be imported here.

01:12.150 --> 01:20.490
Otherwise we'll get an error and now we can add some styling here with let's say styles OP's style start

01:23.930 --> 01:29.450
content or whatever you want to name it import styles sheet from React Native Dale for and now let's

01:29.510 --> 01:35.230
add a style sheet here right before the export styles with style sheet.

01:35.240 --> 01:44.510
Create and in their ads this content key we're referring to with flax 1 and then just as we did it before

01:44.540 --> 01:52.490
justify content center and a line item center to center all content vertically and horizontally.

01:52.490 --> 01:58.300
So this is to contact a content style property which I apply to this view.

01:58.340 --> 02:00.200
With this we showed his text.

02:00.230 --> 02:05.180
Now of course instead of using text we could actually all use our default text.

02:05.180 --> 02:12.470
Now that I think about it that's what we have it for the default text which uses our font from components

02:12.710 --> 02:13.780
default text.

02:14.330 --> 02:19.730
So let's use default text here instead of the built in text component to have our default fund.

02:19.730 --> 02:24.170
And now if we say it is what we have is this text here.

02:24.170 --> 02:25.730
If we have no favorites.

02:25.910 --> 02:28.180
As soon as we start adding some.

02:28.250 --> 02:34.790
So if we add these two items here as favorites for example we'll of course see those and only if we

02:34.790 --> 02:38.660
remove both here we'll see the fallback text again.

02:38.690 --> 02:40.400
So Dad works like a charm.
