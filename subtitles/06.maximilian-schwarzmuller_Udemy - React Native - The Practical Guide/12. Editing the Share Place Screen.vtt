00:02.280 --> 00:07.420
Over the last lectures you learned a lot about styling and we applied all that knowledge to create a nice

00:07.420 --> 00:14.500
looking auth screen. Now I'll move a bit faster over the next lectures to also add some styling to find place,

00:14.500 --> 00:21.760
share place and then also to the place we click on once we are able to find places and I want to start

00:22.060 --> 00:28.840
in the share place view here. There we have input and we have the add button and it doesn't look super pretty,

00:29.590 --> 00:35.700
we'll eventually add functionality to take an image here and to add a position on a map,

00:35.740 --> 00:42.490
so I already want to lay out the view for that, I want to have a box that represents the placeholder for

00:42.490 --> 00:43.040
the image

00:43.060 --> 00:50.830
we will preview here, a box which represents the spot on the map I want to show and also of course still

00:50.830 --> 00:54.980
this input line and below all of that, the add button.

00:55.030 --> 00:58.700
Now these are all things we can build with flexbox and and the tools you learned

00:58.750 --> 01:03.130
so let's start. For that, let's go to the shareplace component here,

01:03.130 --> 01:07.780
right now we only got the place input component which is a nice start but not all we need,

01:08.170 --> 01:16.480
instead I want to have an image picker, a map picker and then the place input component and then the

01:16.480 --> 01:18.010
submit button below

01:18.010 --> 01:25.720
all of that. That also means that the button which is included in the place input component here and which

01:25.720 --> 01:29.840
right now is strictly tied to this text input,

01:29.950 --> 01:37.360
it shouldn't be in there anymore because our overall form or the amount of data we gather grows and

01:37.360 --> 01:41.200
it's not all part of the place input component,

01:41.200 --> 01:44.110
so we'll eventually have to rebuild that too,

01:44.440 --> 01:51.190
so back to the share place component therefore. I'll just lay it out in this one component and then we

01:51.190 --> 01:54.090
can split it out into subcomponents,

01:54.490 --> 01:58.340
so we probably need a view and a text that looks good,

01:58.480 --> 02:05.200
we'll also need a text input and I want to have a button in here too, the default built-in button here.

02:05.230 --> 02:07.900
Now with that, we got this wrapping view,

02:07.960 --> 02:09.530
that makes sense

02:09.550 --> 02:19.460
and I want to have some text at the bottom where I say share a place with us, something like this, below that

02:19.500 --> 02:20.540
text,

02:20.550 --> 02:27.780
I want to have a view that actually serves as a placeholder, just renders some rectangle for example

02:27.990 --> 02:35.970
where we will eventually have the image preview to show the user which image he picked, below that we

02:35.970 --> 02:42.120
want to have a button where we can say, whoops, where we add a title, that's how we use the built-in button where

02:42.120 --> 02:53.510
we can say pick image and then I'll basically repeat this pattern here to also have a map we output here,

02:53.590 --> 02:59.300
though this will be an interactive map later where the user can pick it's position or a button which

02:59.300 --> 03:04.270
says locate me if the user doesn't want to pick a position here but wants to locate himself

03:04.790 --> 03:13.800
and then below that, I want to have a text input where I have a placeholder where we can say place name,

03:13.810 --> 03:20.780
so that the user can enter some name for the place, below that again, one other button where we have share the

03:20.780 --> 03:26.790
place, something like that. That looks like a nice set up but I'm going to get rid of the place input

03:26.790 --> 03:29.220
component for that because I don't need it here,

03:29.460 --> 03:35.410
that also of course means I can remove the import up here.

03:35.430 --> 03:39.120
So with that, let's save all of that and let's have a look at it,

03:39.300 --> 03:44.750
to turn on hot reloading, it loads automatically and I get an error, image preview,

03:44.930 --> 03:46.350
this doesn't work like that,

03:46.410 --> 03:50.970
small mistake, text always has to be wrapped by a text element,

03:51.030 --> 03:54.430
you can't put it directly into a view as I just tried.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.310
So that's also why I left the error in,

03:56.430 --> 04:00.110
that's really important to know and something you can easily mess up.

04:00.180 --> 04:04.500
So I put the text into text components and restructure the code,

04:04.500 --> 04:05.880
now let's try this again,

04:05.880 --> 04:09.000
let's open the app again on Android, it entirely crashed,

04:09.180 --> 04:11.760
the whole simulator is down,

04:11.760 --> 04:14.960
so let's stick to iOS for now.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.950
Here on share place, we see the elements and it all looks horrible,

04:18.960 --> 04:21.670
now let me bring the Android simulator back up.

04:22.020 --> 04:26.070
So Android's back up again, let me enter share a place here too,

04:26.070 --> 04:27.140
this is how it looks here,

04:27.150 --> 04:29.050
not that pretty,

04:29.160 --> 04:36.180
so let's improve the style of that. And for that first of all, let me turn these views here, these placeholders

04:36.210 --> 04:37.480
into placeholders,

04:37.500 --> 04:44.030
this will eventually be exchanged later in the app for now but for now let's use them like that.

04:44.190 --> 04:54.370
So I'll add my styles const here and use stylesheet create to create some styles and I'll just name

04:54.370 --> 05:04.690
it placeholder and there, I want to have a border of let's say one, excuse me, border width of one, border color

05:05.990 --> 05:11.310
of black and a background color of

05:11.560 --> 05:14.510
this light gray.

05:14.650 --> 05:19.810
And now I'm going to assign this to the view here around my image preview text and around the map text,

05:20.400 --> 05:26.420
there I'll add the style property and reach out to styles placeholder.

05:26.550 --> 05:28.220
So let me save that

05:28.380 --> 05:30.330
and now here we got our placeholders.

05:30.390 --> 05:32.790
Now the placeholder should be a bit bigger

05:32.820 --> 05:36.130
so I'm also going to add some width and height,

05:36.180 --> 05:45.950
so the width here actually should be around 80% and I'll add a height of around 150 pixels so that

05:45.950 --> 05:48.800
we can see something, like this.

05:48.870 --> 05:56.350
Now we already see we're getting a little bit of problems here with the space, so it's probably worth

05:56.770 --> 05:58.990
throwing this into a scroll view,

06:02.460 --> 06:08.430
so let me also import that here, the scroll view

06:08.640 --> 06:13.400
and let's use scroll view instead of view to wrap the entire page.

06:13.440 --> 06:20.950
So we do that, then we obviously can scroll this to ensure that we can reach all the content in here.

06:20.970 --> 06:27.630
Now what would be nice would be to also still have some centering, some horizontal centering here to

06:27.630 --> 06:28.650
start with,

06:29.010 --> 06:32.990
so let's create this container property here again,

06:33.390 --> 06:40.500
let's set flex to want to take all available space and keep in mind, main axis is from top to bottom

06:40.500 --> 06:41.300
by default

06:41.340 --> 06:45.940
so we want to center on the cross axis from left to right horizontally, 

06:46.110 --> 06:50.970
so we will set a line items to target the cross axis to center.

06:50.970 --> 06:56.580
Let me assign this container to the scroll view which is also interesting to see if that also works

06:56.580 --> 06:57.670
on the scroll view,

06:57.750 --> 07:03.420
so let's reach out to styles container, save this, we get an error here.

07:03.420 --> 07:05.930
Now the error makes sense if you think about it,

07:06.150 --> 07:12.540
you're trying to use a flex property on a scroll view, now flex is all about distributing some limited space,

07:12.900 --> 07:13.860
in a scroll view,

07:13.890 --> 07:20.310
you've got infinite space but you could also argue that even with a scroll view, you always just see what's

07:20.400 --> 07:21.500
on your screen right,

07:21.510 --> 07:27.660
you've got limited space in that sense and you can use flex box properties on scroll view,

07:27.750 --> 07:31.290
you just need to set this content container style prop.

07:31.710 --> 07:36.180
So let's add content container style here

07:37.180 --> 07:40.320
and set this to styles container,

07:40.630 --> 07:43.260
let's remove our other style assignment here.

07:44.480 --> 07:49.660
Now save that, reload your app and let's go to share place again

07:49.910 --> 07:54.410
and now you get the vertical, the horizontal center here,

07:54.440 --> 07:56.610
the same on Android.

07:56.640 --> 08:02.600
Now with that it looks nice and we can scroll on iOS but on Android, it's broken.

08:02.610 --> 08:09.030
Now workaround that is that we nest a view inside scroll view here,

08:13.530 --> 08:19.960
like this and add style styles container to that.

08:20.290 --> 08:25.460
Now if we do that and remove that container style here from outside,

08:25.610 --> 08:28.860
now we got a working scroll view on android again

08:29.210 --> 08:33.010
and on iOS and we got everything centered,

08:33.200 --> 08:35.380
so now this is working as it should here.

08:36.260 --> 08:39.950
So now let's turn our heads towards making this look a bit nicer,

08:40.190 --> 08:43.130
let's change the styling of this text here at the top,

08:43.370 --> 08:49.510
let's also add some margin around these buttons so that they don't sit directly below there, placeholders

08:49.820 --> 08:54.840
and the bottom button also has some spacing to the bottom and let's fix that input.

08:54.860 --> 09:00.650
Now let's start with the input because we already got one, so we can import our own input component,

09:00.710 --> 09:07.850
the one we created here, our default input from and now we just have to go to the components folder

09:07.870 --> 09:10.240
UI and use the default input,

09:10.310 --> 09:13.160
that's the great thing about creating these reusable components,

09:13.160 --> 09:15.510
we can, well easily reuse them.

09:15.800 --> 09:21.050
So we just use the default input instead of text input, drop in the placeholder

09:21.050 --> 09:26.990
and if we go back, we already got this, looks much nicer and I also like the style that it spans the full

09:26.990 --> 09:29.970
width due to it having width 100%,

09:30.020 --> 09:32.270
so I might even leave it like that.

09:32.270 --> 09:37.160
Now to give the buttons some margin around them,

09:37.160 --> 09:40.270
I will simply wrap them with a view,

09:40.400 --> 09:44.980
so I'll add a view because we can't style the buttons directly,

09:45.710 --> 09:54.130
I'll add a view around them and on that, I want to add some styling, so I'll name this button and add some

09:54.130 --> 10:02.030
margin, maybe of 8, something like that and add this to the view which wraps the button,

10:02.070 --> 10:06.510
so there I'll add style and reach out to styles button.

10:07.490 --> 10:10.130
Let me save this and have a look at it, yeah

10:10.160 --> 10:11.610
that looks much nicer,

10:11.780 --> 10:15.140
let's now use that setup around all buttons here.

10:15.200 --> 10:18.890
So using it on this locate me button here

10:19.640 --> 10:21.080
and also on the

10:24.900 --> 10:31.780
submit button down there or the share place button I should say. Let's save all of that and now this looks

10:31.780 --> 10:32.200
nicer,

10:32.200 --> 10:34.300
now we got a little bit more spacing here.

10:34.690 --> 10:41.080
Let's also use our main text and the heading here on this well, heading at the top,

10:41.350 --> 10:44.250
so for that, we need to import both components,

10:44.380 --> 10:48.240
so let's import main text from

10:48.240 --> 10:55.860
and here I go into the components folder, UI main text main text again and then let's also import

10:55.950 --> 11:06.360
our heading text from and now also let's go into components UI and there, it's heading text heading text.

11:06.390 --> 11:13.080
So again, reusing these components we already built and now we can simply exchange text here with main

11:13.080 --> 11:22.110
text and then also inside there, use our heading text component to wrap the actual text with it so that

11:22.110 --> 11:25.380
it receives both styles, heading text and our main text,

11:25.540 --> 11:32.550
let me restructure this over multiple lines. If we now save this, we got our default main text here,

11:32.760 --> 11:34.970
so that's really nice, it's really beautiful,

11:35.070 --> 11:36.900
that's really, so that's really nice,

11:36.900 --> 11:38.280
I like the look of this.

11:38.340 --> 11:44.880
And yeah, the gray boxes, they don't add too much to the layout but keep in mind these, will be replaced

11:45.090 --> 11:49.400
with a real image and a real map where you can pick a place,

11:49.410 --> 11:53.100
so this is going to become nicer and look nicer.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.000
It just doesn't look like this right now

11:55.080 --> 11:57.210
but we'll work on that later in the course,

11:57.210 --> 12:00.270
for now let's maybe at least use our static image

12:00.270 --> 12:08.520
we have, the beautiful place here as a background by default so that we don't have that gray box here.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.680
So for that, let's also import image here

12:17.360 --> 12:19.350
and use that instead of image

12:21.720 --> 12:28.930
preview, so here I'm going to use image. And now we need to import the image as we learned it,

12:29.080 --> 12:35.030
so I'm importing image placeholder from

12:35.220 --> 12:40.890
and now I just go into the assets folder and pick the beautiful place.jpeg file

12:41.040 --> 12:47.380
and the image placeholder is now what I assign as a source on this image here,

12:48.170 --> 12:50.120
like this.

12:50.180 --> 12:54.590
Now if we save this, it's a bit big, isn't it?

12:54.600 --> 12:58.940
So what we should do of course is set a width and height on the image here,

12:59.250 --> 13:05.410
so I'll add a style and bind it to styles preview image,

13:05.610 --> 13:08.640
we need to create that property in our stylesheet now.

13:08.880 --> 13:18.750
So then there, I'll add preview image and set the width to 100% and the height to 100% of

13:18.750 --> 13:22.350
the wrapping container which is our view,

13:22.350 --> 13:25.560
the box we created, so this looks much nicer now.

13:25.980 --> 13:28.170
So the buttons won't do anything but this looks nicer.

13:28.170 --> 13:33.720
The map will get added eventually, we can enter a place name though we're not ready to pick up what the

13:33.720 --> 13:35.170
user entered here,

13:35.580 --> 13:38.550
so these will all be things we'll have to work on in the future

13:38.610 --> 13:42.170
but we now got a nice share place set up.

13:42.180 --> 13:45.030
Now here's a challenge for you,

13:45.030 --> 13:47.190
split it up into multiple components

13:47.190 --> 13:53.940
now, new components you have to create so that you for example have a component for the image preview

13:53.940 --> 14:02.730
and the picker button, one component for both probably makes sense and also try to hook up these inputs

14:02.730 --> 14:03.480
here,

14:03.720 --> 14:10.680
we previously had hooked it up in the place input component which we're not using anymore but here,

14:10.680 --> 14:15.090
you can see how such a connection process with two-way binding could look like.

14:15.240 --> 14:24.540
So make sure to also do this and feel free to basically take the input here and put it into the old

14:24.720 --> 14:29.790
place input component we have, just remove the button from there because we don't need it here anymore

14:30.180 --> 14:31.980
and change this component

14:32.010 --> 14:37.060
however it is needed to change to enable two-way binding in there.

14:37.060 --> 14:42.230
Now that's just a challenge, I'll of course also do it together with you in the next lecture.
