Now in rare cases you also might want to switch way more than just some styles and a component and therefore

00:10.580 --> 00:16.750
in your component file you would have a lot of if checks a lot of platform selects.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.370
In such cases you can all do work with multiple files.

00:20.480 --> 00:30.110
You can create a main button dot Android J.S. file and another main button dot Io s dot J.S. file and

00:30.110 --> 00:39.050
then react native will automatically load the android component here for Android and RW for Iowa's important

00:39.050 --> 00:44.660
though in the places where you use your button you shouldn't adjust your imports.

00:44.720 --> 00:47.320
So here are my IDE automatically adjusted this.

00:47.360 --> 00:52.550
You should still import main button as if the file would be named Main button Dot.

00:52.550 --> 01:00.800
J.S. don't import from thought Android or dot os import from just main button so make sure you have

01:00.800 --> 01:06.500
all these imports fixed because React Native will automatically renamed us behind the scenes and loads

01:06.530 --> 01:10.130
the correct file based on the platform you're running on.

01:10.130 --> 01:16.520
And now here I can copy my code into the IRS file and obviously get rid of all platform checks.

01:16.520 --> 01:22.610
Now get rid of this surrounding view which I only needed to clip my ripple effect which I won't have

01:22.610 --> 01:29.230
when I was get rid of the button component and always use touchable opacity because we're well on I

01:29.240 --> 01:31.180
w we don't have the ripple effect there.

01:31.190 --> 01:36.380
We don't need to import imported we don't need the platform API and now we have a button that will look

01:36.470 --> 01:40.220
and feel the way it should look and feel on ISIS.

01:40.220 --> 01:45.400
We also don't need that class anymore and on Android we do the same.

01:45.440 --> 01:52.400
We still need touchable opacity because we still need to check the android worsen and render touchable

01:52.400 --> 01:54.290
opacity if it's too low.

01:54.560 --> 02:00.080
But we don't need to check for Android anymore because we obviously always run on Android thanks to

02:00.080 --> 02:04.330
our file ending and the rest stale for all to should be fine.

02:04.430 --> 02:10.660
Now here we don't really need dad split into two files because we didn't have too much separate logic.

02:10.730 --> 02:16.790
But if you had very complex components with a lot of different styles and layout for the different platforms

02:17.090 --> 02:21.550
then splitting it into a platform specific files might be the best thing to do.

02:22.630 --> 02:27.930
Now with that I'll actually restart that to make sure that all these changes are picked up correctly.

02:28.960 --> 02:38.090
And then run this on Android and I was and also dismiss the running apps there and restart them to make

02:38.090 --> 02:45.080
sure that they are re reloaded correctly and you should then see your application run correctly on both

02:45.080 --> 02:53.860
platforms again with the platform specific styles so here with the ripple effect on Android for example

02:54.160 --> 03:01.120
and the opacity effect on us thanks to our separate files and you can use that separate file system

03:01.240 --> 03:08.620
on any component file or any fall in general any javascript file there if you have got Android and Dot

03:08.640 --> 03:15.460
I w and of course these names have to be correct dot Android dot Chase and Dot I w J.S. then D files

03:15.460 --> 03:22.090
will be loaded for different platforms your app is running on Ustad if you have a lot of different logic

03:22.090 --> 03:27.790
in the files and you would have a lot of if checks in there a lot of platform select in there and data

03:27.790 --> 03:30.640
for you have cleaner code by having different files.
