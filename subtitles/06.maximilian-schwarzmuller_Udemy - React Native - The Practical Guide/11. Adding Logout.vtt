WEBVTT

00:02.250 --> 00:04.270
Now to log out.

00:04.290 --> 00:07.130
We need a new action which we can dispatch.

00:07.260 --> 00:15.010
So in the off file in the actions folder I will add a new action creator doesn't really matter where

00:15.010 --> 00:23.230
you added I added down there and I export it and name it log out which all sounds like a fitting name

00:23.230 --> 00:23.650
to me.

00:26.350 --> 00:31.210
I expect no arguments there and I need a action identifier for logging out though.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.400
So here we can export

00:36.280 --> 00:43.100
contest log out with the log out string and now you stand down there.

00:43.270 --> 00:48.510
And in this action creator which is a normal action creator where I don't need to send any age TTP request

00:48.520 --> 00:54.460
or anything like that I just dispatched his log out action the end where I create this log of action

00:54.460 --> 00:57.360
object.

00:57.410 --> 01:04.160
Now we can use that and I want to be able to log out with the help of the site draw in the site draw.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.780
I want to have this log out button.

01:06.860 --> 01:10.230
That means that we need to do something which we haven't done before.

01:10.460 --> 01:13.220
We need to add a new button to decide draw.

01:13.370 --> 01:21.030
Thus far we only have the automatically created buttons but adding your own content isn't too hard.

01:21.060 --> 01:25.100
For Dad let's go to the shop navigator file where we set up the draw.

01:25.110 --> 01:28.770
Here it is and then here.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.280
Besides my content options you can also add a content component here.

01:36.290 --> 01:42.320
This allows you to add your own content for decider or instead of the default content.

01:42.320 --> 01:46.910
Now this takes a function which receives props because in the end this is a react component which you

01:46.910 --> 01:53.740
add here so it gets props and it has returns turns J.S. X and therefore you need to make sure you're

01:53.750 --> 01:58.870
importing react from react and we'll all need a couple of other imports.

01:58.960 --> 02:02.770
We also need to import something from React Native and that should be the safe area.

02:02.770 --> 02:13.720
View and I also want to import the button from HREOC native In addition from react navigation we need

02:13.720 --> 02:20.240
to import the draw items and all the various native again.

02:20.310 --> 02:28.940
I also need to view the ways that import it let's go down to our newly added content component.

02:28.940 --> 02:36.970
And here we can now return a View with a style of selects one you can of course all had a style sheet.

02:36.970 --> 02:42.400
I'll just add inline styling and by the way this component could of course also reside in a separate

02:42.400 --> 02:49.690
file it doesn't have to be created on the fly in this file now in this view I want to have a safe area

02:49.690 --> 03:02.920
view and there make sure you add force inset equal to top always horizontal never and this just controls

03:02.920 --> 03:13.110
how it is is laid out and in that safe area view you should now add to draw items an important pass

03:13.110 --> 03:18.240
props to those because these are the default draw items which are rendered and that should still be

03:18.240 --> 03:19.100
the case.

03:19.190 --> 03:24.840
And in order for them to be configured correctly you need to pass and props which is in the yet passed

03:24.840 --> 03:28.800
and by react navigation and holds all your draw or consequence on.

03:29.040 --> 03:33.390
And now you can add your own extra draw item here and that will be this button.

03:33.390 --> 03:41.200
The default rack native button where I say log out where I want to add a color off let's say colors

03:41.830 --> 03:45.640
dot primary and wear on press.

03:45.640 --> 03:52.000
I now want to dispatch this logout action and now we'll have a huge problem here.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.360
How can we dispatched us from here.

03:54.390 --> 03:56.910
Now first of all if you saved this you should be seeing this.

03:56.910 --> 04:00.130
So here if you expand the draw here's the logout button.

04:00.150 --> 04:01.470
Right so this works.

04:01.470 --> 04:05.170
And of course you can style in position is whoever you want.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.420
And by the way just double check.

04:08.420 --> 04:11.530
We can also see this on Android if we do log in there

04:16.210 --> 04:17.320
here in the drawer.

04:17.320 --> 04:25.830
We also have to log out button by the way we might want to add a little bit more padding on the top

04:27.790 --> 04:29.700
but how can we dispatch everything.

04:29.740 --> 04:32.230
And I will add some extra padding here.

04:34.050 --> 04:34.980
Of 20

04:38.300 --> 04:43.820
because my safe area of you were X but it does barely leave more spacing than I need.

04:43.820 --> 04:50.730
So in order to have some extra spacing a little bit of padding can't hurt.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.110
I think that's better.

04:52.260 --> 04:58.880
But again how can we now make sure that we can dispatch an action year well this is a react component

04:58.890 --> 04:59.800
right.

04:59.910 --> 05:03.560
So in the end we can simply use dispatch here.

05:05.810 --> 05:13.250
So we can import use dispatch here from react redux.

05:13.270 --> 05:19.390
So what we did before and used it in here because you can use this hook in any component and this is

05:19.390 --> 05:27.800
just a component so in here before we return J is X I can get access to my dispatch function with use

05:27.800 --> 05:34.980
dispatch and therefore now here when we press this button we can call dispatch and dispatch our off

05:35.000 --> 05:38.810
action for dad of course you just need to make sure you are importing it.

05:38.810 --> 05:49.340
So import everything as of actions from the store folder the actions folder do all file and now use

05:49.340 --> 05:57.350
all the actions to create dead action here all the action stored log out whips log out like this and

05:57.360 --> 06:02.420
this should dispatch to log all the action now besides that I also want to navigate away so we can all

06:02.420 --> 06:11.190
to call props navigation dot navigate that will be available here and go back to the off screen here.

06:11.190 --> 06:17.070
So basically to this off screen here and the switch navigator our draw is part of the shop navigator

06:17.250 --> 06:21.480
so we can all go to the off screen from there.

06:21.530 --> 06:27.040
Now when we dispatch logout I want to make sure that in the reducer we're also doing something.

06:27.230 --> 06:30.840
We have our logout action creator here.

06:30.920 --> 06:37.070
So in the reducer and you offered user I wanted a new case to log out case for Dad you should make sure

06:37.070 --> 06:39.500
you are importing the logout identifier.

06:39.920 --> 06:44.370
And of course here it's very simple I return my initial state which in the ads means that the token

06:44.370 --> 06:49.540
is reset and the user I.D. is reset and now let's give this a try.

06:49.540 --> 06:55.180
If I go back here and I now click log out I am back on the off screen.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.350
So that works.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.180
Let's also give it a try on Android

07:01.100 --> 07:03.070
I click on log out here.

07:03.310 --> 07:04.430
We're back.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.970
So this is working.

07:06.250 --> 07:14.200
We're almost there with that but we also should be locked out automatically if the token expired because

07:14.200 --> 07:15.820
it has an expiration date.

07:15.820 --> 07:18.220
And right now we have no automatic expiry.
