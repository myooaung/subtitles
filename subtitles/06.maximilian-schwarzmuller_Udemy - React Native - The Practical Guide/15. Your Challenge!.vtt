00:02.330 --> 00:04.660
So we worked a lot on share place,

00:04.700 --> 00:10.390
now I'm actually happy with the look of find place here, feel free to of course fine tune this to your needs

00:10.400 --> 00:14.800
but I'm happy with it as I am with this preview here.

00:14.870 --> 00:20.000
Now later, we'll also display a map here but we haven't got this functionality yet so I'll leave it as

00:20.000 --> 00:21.430
it is for now.

00:21.500 --> 00:27.620
Instead the last thing I want to style is the side drawer, it would be nice to move this element a little bit further

00:27.620 --> 00:30.060
down, add an icon next to it,

00:30.080 --> 00:32.090
change the overall style.

00:32.300 --> 00:35.380
The question also is what do I want to render in there anyways?

00:35.600 --> 00:37.470
I want to render a log out button,

00:37.550 --> 00:43.130
we haven't added authentication yet but later, once the user is able to sign in, the button here should

00:43.130 --> 00:48.260
allow him to sign out. So styling that is the last thing

00:48.380 --> 00:51.990
and again, take this as a challenge, style a

00:52.100 --> 00:55.400
logout entry here, whichever look you want,

00:55.400 --> 00:56.160
feel free to use an

00:56.180 --> 00:56.880
icon,

00:56.900 --> 01:03.620
we already added icon so you can just search for a fitting ionicon and use it and change the side drawer to

01:03.620 --> 01:06.780
look in the way you want it to look. In the next lecture,

01:06.830 --> 01:08.050
we'll do this together.
