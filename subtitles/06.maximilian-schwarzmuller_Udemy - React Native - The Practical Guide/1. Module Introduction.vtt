It's now time to leave our local device at least to a certain extent because whilst of course we will

00:07.910 --> 00:14.510
work a lot instead of our apps or we as a user not all data needs to be saved on the device and right

00:14.540 --> 00:16.880
now we're not saving any data anywhere.

00:16.880 --> 00:23.150
To be honest we're saving everything in memory which means that when we for example add or edit a product

00:23.150 --> 00:29.600
in this dummy app we build thus far it's lost whenever the app restarts it would be better to save such

00:29.600 --> 00:37.070
data on a server in the Web instead of just on the device in memory because Deadwood persist app restarts.

00:37.070 --> 00:40.610
We can simply load data from there when the app starts.

00:40.610 --> 00:46.730
And in addition for most apps for example for a shop app like we're building it you all to want to share

00:46.730 --> 00:50.990
data across different users across different app installations.

00:50.990 --> 00:57.590
So if I add a product our users should also be able to view it in Dafur we definitely need to store

00:57.590 --> 01:01.340
data in a server so we can all operate on the same data.
