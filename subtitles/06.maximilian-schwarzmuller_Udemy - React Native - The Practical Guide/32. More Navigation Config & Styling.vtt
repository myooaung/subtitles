00:02.230 --> 00:09.790
So I want to start with some fund fine tuning in my taps here in the header and all of the text here

00:09.970 --> 00:15.940
in all my recipes I want to make sure that everywhere I'm using the right font my own custom once and

00:15.940 --> 00:19.930
especially here in the header in the taps we're not really insuring this yet.

00:20.050 --> 00:22.970
Of course it's relatively easy to ensure that though.

00:22.990 --> 00:31.040
Let's start with the header the header is generally styled like the background color with our default

00:31.040 --> 00:34.200
navigation options which we always set up on the stack navigator right.

00:34.210 --> 00:40.640
Do you devil navigation options here allow us to well style the header and for example give the header

00:40.640 --> 00:43.390
in general a style and add a background color.

00:43.470 --> 00:50.750
Now important to recognize here is that header style really only targets the blocks Dee background so

00:50.750 --> 00:59.540
to say so the container in which the action items to back button and does title sits the title itself

00:59.660 --> 01:02.390
can be targeted with header style.

01:02.390 --> 01:08.420
But of course we get an alternative to that besides header style where we can style that header container.

01:08.420 --> 01:14.300
We also got a header titled style and that unsurprisingly targets the text component in which our header

01:14.300 --> 01:20.420
title is presented and there are we can style it like we can Style Text elements and react native for

01:20.420 --> 01:23.960
example by adding a font family of open sense.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.280
Again I'm using the non bold versions that it can quickly see the difference.

01:27.320 --> 01:35.560
This clearly is not bold anymore I guess it's pretty clear to see especially here on on OS and now if

01:35.560 --> 01:40.240
I set this to bolt I ensure that I use this right style on both.

01:40.240 --> 01:46.280
I was an android now for The Back text here by the way.

01:46.540 --> 01:53.380
We can also overwrite that default which is the default system fund by setting the header back title

01:53.380 --> 01:53.930
style.

01:53.950 --> 01:59.110
That's a separate setting we can set up here and there we can also set the font family to let's say

01:59.140 --> 02:01.350
open sense not not the bold version.

02:01.360 --> 02:07.600
I don't want to have that in a bold style but I want to have it in my own font and this should now be

02:07.600 --> 02:13.470
open sense here and use my own fund on Android of course this does not have an effect because there

02:13.470 --> 02:17.170
we have no back text so that's one thing.

02:17.190 --> 02:24.660
That's the header for the tabs it's pretty similar there we can go to our tab navigator we're creating

02:24.660 --> 02:25.940
like the material bottom tab.

02:25.950 --> 02:26.700
Navigator.

02:26.880 --> 02:33.390
And this of course has our taps screen contact and then this second object where we configure the navigator

02:33.390 --> 02:34.440
itself.

02:34.440 --> 02:38.880
And as always and react navigation it's the second object where we can control the general look and

02:38.880 --> 02:44.270
feel of the Navigator specific things like in the case of the tab navigator the tab.

02:44.280 --> 02:52.280
I can color the bar colored tint color or although the label's style and indeed here on the tap are

02:52.280 --> 02:56.330
options for the bottom tab navigator.

02:56.330 --> 02:59.000
We can add a label style.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.010
And again this targets to the text component which holds our label.

03:03.140 --> 03:09.230
We can add a fun family here of open Sands bold so that we can clearly see the difference if it is reloads.

03:09.230 --> 03:12.800
Now it is clearly a simple text that actually this doesn't look too bad.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.510
So I think we can keep this.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.920
But of course you could also set it to just open sense if you want a thinner version.

03:19.010 --> 03:22.320
But now I'd use our own font now for Android.

03:22.320 --> 03:29.600
Here the material bottom tab navigator also has some configuration options but actually it doesn't have

03:29.720 --> 03:31.910
a label style.

03:31.910 --> 03:38.690
What you can do there instead is on these separate tabs your loadings on the navigation options off

03:38.690 --> 03:47.170
the taps your loading where you're also setting the tap or icon and so on there we can add tab bar label

03:47.170 --> 03:54.160
here where we could set a label like meals multiple explanation marks to overwrite what we use as a

03:54.160 --> 03:54.540
label.

03:54.550 --> 04:00.490
Now both on ISIS and also on Android and that can actually be a string like this but you can also set

04:00.490 --> 04:07.450
this to a react component to a text component namely and then in there you can set up your label meals

04:07.720 --> 04:11.490
but of course now here you can add style and add any styles you want.

04:11.500 --> 04:16.120
So a little bit of a workaround since there is no other built in way of styling this 40 material bottom

04:16.120 --> 04:19.060
taps navigator but better to nothing.

04:19.060 --> 04:25.060
So here we can now is that font family to open sans bold and if we do that we of course all to have

04:25.060 --> 04:29.950
to make sure we now import the text component from react native because otherwise we can't use it down

04:29.950 --> 04:30.240
there

04:35.760 --> 04:40.980
and now is that we also get this on our eyes of course because we're sharing the config we'll fix this

04:40.980 --> 04:45.780
in a second but now does is how we can set up our own style there as well but of course we now lost

04:45.810 --> 04:52.820
the colour which is the downside of setting this manually here and since we only need this work around

04:52.820 --> 04:59.930
here for Android for the material bottom taps the easiest fix is to use the platform API and only set

04:59.930 --> 05:04.760
does tap our label to this text component for on Android because only then we need this work around

05:04.760 --> 05:11.330
to set the font family so I'll check if we're on Android and if that's the case I'll return a text component

05:11.330 --> 05:18.650
here otherwise I'll just return the text meals and then the advantage of just returning a text here

05:18.650 --> 05:24.710
simply is that our other settings which set the tint colour and the label style and so on will kick

05:24.710 --> 05:30.920
in and will not be overwritten if we set our own text component will disable all that default feature.

05:30.920 --> 05:34.700
All these equal features which are built into the bottom tab Navigator.

05:34.700 --> 05:39.200
The problem with the material bottom tab navigator is that it simply doesn't have all these full features

05:39.200 --> 05:39.800
built in.

05:39.860 --> 05:44.690
So there we need to override this but we only need to do this for Android on the other hand.

05:44.780 --> 05:48.290
Now we can copy that and do the exact same thing of course.

05:48.290 --> 05:57.530
Year 4 favourites render favourites as a text on ISIS and of course also in the text component for Android.

05:57.590 --> 06:03.860
And with that we now should have a style that works and this looks good on ISIS there.

06:03.920 --> 06:09.740
We basically didn't change anything and on Android there we now also have our own custom funds.

06:09.740 --> 06:12.520
So it's a little bit of a work around which is required here.

06:12.520 --> 06:19.130
Unfortunately when working with the bottom taps navigator but also not too hard to implement.

06:19.130 --> 06:24.290
And with that we're making sure that we're using our own custom font everywhere in the navigation related

06:24.800 --> 06:25.850
features of our app.
