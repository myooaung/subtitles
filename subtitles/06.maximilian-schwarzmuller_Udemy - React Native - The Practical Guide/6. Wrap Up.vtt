00:02.120 --> 00:06.150
In this module, you learned a lot about debugging your react native apps

00:06.190 --> 00:12.480
and that's super important because especially since it runs on a phone, it can be hard to work with it,

00:12.520 --> 00:19.640
you can't look into it as much as you can look into a web application. With the tools taught in this

00:19.720 --> 00:23.740
module here, especially with react native debugger,

00:23.740 --> 00:31.210
you've got powerful debugging capabilities though. You can look into your source code and place breakpoints,

00:31.960 --> 00:36.190
you can console log for some quick debugging,

00:36.370 --> 00:43.030
you can have a look at your component hierarchy here to dive into your components and into the props

00:43.030 --> 00:47.100
they have, the state they have and even change their styling on the fly

00:47.430 --> 00:49.670
and you can have a look at your redux state.

00:49.870 --> 00:54.580
So you got a lot of tools to really find that error that's blocking you.
