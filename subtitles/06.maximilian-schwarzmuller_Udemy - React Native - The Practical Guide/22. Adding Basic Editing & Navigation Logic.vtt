00:02.360 --> 00:08.330
So let's make sure we can go to the edit product screen and for that of course I first of all will fill

00:08.330 --> 00:17.550
it with some life by importing react from react and then also by importing some things from React Native.

00:17.850 --> 00:24.960
And these thumb things for the moment will include the view and the text and also a style sheet which

00:24.960 --> 00:26.610
will net need later.

00:26.670 --> 00:34.980
And then here we have the added product screen where I will get props and need to return some J is X.

00:34.980 --> 00:45.420
I set up my style's object here with style sheet with style sheet create like that and then we can export

00:45.450 --> 00:49.310
the edit product screen as the default.

00:49.390 --> 00:55.030
Now here in the component itself for the moment just to see that this works we can output a view with

00:55.030 --> 01:01.990
a text in there where we say that added product screen and later of course will output more helpful

01:01.990 --> 01:07.210
things here and now to go there again we need to register it isn't a navigator.

01:07.270 --> 01:12.120
It's part of the admin navigator so let's import this screen.

01:13.150 --> 01:18.940
Import the added product screen from screens.

01:18.940 --> 01:29.060
User added product screen and then added here to the admin navigator maybe with added product as an

01:29.060 --> 01:32.330
identifier point at the edit product screen.

01:32.330 --> 01:37.250
Now we should be able to generally move there but of course we now need to trigger a navigation action

01:37.250 --> 01:42.320
to reach it and that's something I want to do from inside the user product screen when we select this

01:42.560 --> 01:46.060
or when we press edit then I want to do the same thing.

01:46.220 --> 01:50.040
So I'll again create a function here so that I don't duplicate my code.

01:50.240 --> 02:00.170
Select product or added product handler maybe this is a function where I expect to get the idea I want

02:00.200 --> 02:01.420
to head.

02:01.460 --> 02:11.630
EDIT So the idea of the product I want to edit and here I want to use props navigation navigate 2D added

02:11.780 --> 02:17.900
product screen so to the screen with this identifier which I of course have because that's the identifier

02:17.930 --> 02:19.330
I just registered here.

02:21.370 --> 02:24.580
And I want to forward the product idea here.

02:25.730 --> 02:30.150
So the idea I get as an argument here in the function is forwarded as a routing parameter.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.960
Now edit product handler is the function it should be executed here.

02:33.980 --> 02:40.850
When we clicked the edit button there I forward item data dot item dot I.D. and I do the same here in

02:40.850 --> 02:42.790
this on select handler of course.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.400
If we have a look at this we go back here.

02:48.510 --> 02:53.630
Admin Click Here The edit product screen all defect like the edit button.

02:53.640 --> 03:00.030
So that's working now to add new products I want to go to the same screen but without passing in an

03:00.080 --> 03:05.730
I.D. and that will allow us to then find out whether we're an added or add mode on that edit product

03:05.730 --> 03:08.940
screen by checking whether we have an idea or not.

03:08.940 --> 03:16.560
So to go to that ad product screen we can add a action item so an item to the header bar here in the

03:16.560 --> 03:24.280
user product screen and that should be on the on the right sole at header right here.

03:25.290 --> 03:32.530
This isn't the end just what we set up here is all a copy that using header buttons but the identifier

03:32.530 --> 03:40.840
here could be ad and the icon should be M.D. create and I w create two FTD I can get signals that we're

03:40.840 --> 03:47.260
about to create something and also here I don't toggle the Traore but instead I call navigate and go

03:47.260 --> 03:53.650
to edit product and now as I mentioned important without passing any parameters here because we're adding

03:53.650 --> 03:57.910
a new product we will certainly not pass in any existing idea.

03:58.970 --> 04:06.070
And with that added for example on Android to mix things up on the admin screen we can now press this

04:06.430 --> 04:09.540
action or I can to go the discrete.

04:09.710 --> 04:14.540
Now of course here the header is missing and we'll fix this but before we do so there is something else

04:14.540 --> 04:19.120
I want to fix the coffee mug is actually cut off here on us.

04:19.130 --> 04:25.220
You see that the G is a little bit cut off and in addition to that you might have noticed earlier that

04:25.220 --> 04:30.680
when I had items on the card and I removed them like that earlier I had a minus here.

04:31.380 --> 04:37.490
Let's fix both things for a coffee mug or for text being cut off.

04:37.490 --> 04:46.400
The reason is simple in the product item component to your we assigned a height to our different elements

04:46.400 --> 04:48.420
like the image has 60 percent height.

04:48.550 --> 04:56.090
The details at 15 let's give those 17 and Dale for deduct two percentage points from the actions so

04:56.080 --> 05:00.440
that the title has a little bit more space and does make sure that the coffee mugs stare.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.540
That was a simple fix.

05:02.540 --> 05:05.560
Now for the card.

05:05.570 --> 05:07.910
The problem simply is dead.

05:07.910 --> 05:12.950
Behind the scenes when working with floating point numbers javascript doesn't have the precision you

05:12.950 --> 05:14.630
would maybe want to have.

05:14.630 --> 05:16.800
And that's just how javascript works.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.910
And therefore if you add two items and then remove them both you can actually end up with a value that

05:21.920 --> 05:29.580
at some decimal place is in 0 and what you can do to fix it isn't a card screen is here when you output

05:29.580 --> 05:39.550
the amount with Q fixed you can actually use math which is built into javascript round and wrap this

05:39.610 --> 05:47.830
to fixed value here a multiplier with one hundred and there after the vide does by one hundred.

05:47.850 --> 05:50.580
This will ensure that you never end up with this minus again.

05:50.610 --> 05:56.420
This has to do with how javascript internally handles these floating point numbers.

05:56.440 --> 06:06.210
So now if we again add a couple of items here and add them to the cart this generally looks good.

06:06.210 --> 06:07.700
So our logic still works.

06:07.710 --> 06:13.170
But now if we remove items here we should always end up with a series like this never with a minus in

06:13.170 --> 06:13.740
front of it.

06:13.800 --> 06:20.070
So that's just a tiny improvement regarding how we output this with this visual tweaks out of the way.

06:20.070 --> 06:25.470
Let's go back to the user products and make sure that now that we can reach the added and add screen

06:25.470 --> 06:27.480
which is wanted the same screen of course.

06:27.480 --> 06:34.940
We also do show some inputs there and we load some data for a product that should be edited if appropriate.
