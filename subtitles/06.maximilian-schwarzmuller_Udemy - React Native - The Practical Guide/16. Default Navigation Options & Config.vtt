00:02.270 --> 00:07.770
Repeating ourselves over and over again and setting the same detailed look over and over again is really

00:07.770 --> 00:10.530
annoying and definitely not what you want.

00:10.550 --> 00:17.960
Well thus far we always work with navigation options which we set up right next to our components.

00:18.020 --> 00:24.040
Now you don't need to do that for settings default settings which you repeat over and over again.

00:24.200 --> 00:29.740
It's actually remove this setting here from the category meal screen and only keep the header title

00:29.740 --> 00:34.820
there because the header title of course depends on this screen and changes with the different values

00:34.820 --> 00:36.310
we get in the screen.

00:36.380 --> 00:41.990
Let's therefore remove the platform import and the colors constant import add the same on categories

00:42.080 --> 00:43.390
screen there.

00:43.400 --> 00:48.530
I will cut this so that they can still use it but I will also remove it therefore from this screen and

00:48.530 --> 00:54.140
only keep the header title leader which is specific to this screen and not the default for all screens

00:54.440 --> 00:59.500
so I'll keep that here and I can therefore also get rid of the platform import and the colors content

00:59.540 --> 01:00.710
import here as well.

01:00.740 --> 01:06.870
And now let's go to the meals navigator because besides setting up navigation options right next year

01:06.870 --> 01:12.290
your components which is the right place for any options that are specific to that component you can

01:12.290 --> 01:15.050
also set up options here directly on the navigator.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.830
You got two different places where you can set them up.

01:18.170 --> 01:23.110
One place is when you're using this more complex screen configuration here.

01:23.150 --> 01:29.120
When you map a screen to your identifiers besides setting up the screen what you want to load with just

01:29.120 --> 01:32.390
a must have value you have here.

01:32.450 --> 01:39.530
You can also add navigation options here and set up some navigation options for these screens here.

01:39.530 --> 01:44.810
So there we could also at the header style the header tint color and now we just need to add the platform

01:44.810 --> 01:45.470
and the colors.

01:45.470 --> 01:46.160
Import here.

01:46.250 --> 01:47.490
So let's quickly do that.

01:48.050 --> 01:52.430
Let's import platform from react.

01:52.460 --> 02:03.940
Native here and let's also import colors from constants colors and if we do that what you'll see is

02:03.940 --> 02:11.020
that on the categories screen we have no color because I only set this coloring here on the category

02:11.020 --> 02:15.290
meals but if we go to that screen therefore we have that coloring.

02:15.300 --> 02:21.060
So we have that same look we had before and now of course we could do the same here for the categories

02:21.120 --> 02:22.230
screen.

02:22.230 --> 02:29.430
So there we can also now turn this into object hence add the navigation options and add the exact same

02:29.490 --> 02:34.760
options so this same object here for this screen.

02:34.830 --> 02:39.740
Now if we do that we also have to color back on the categories screen now.

02:39.870 --> 02:46.350
The small advantage compared to the previous solution of setting this up in each component file instead

02:46.380 --> 02:50.400
we now at least have all the configuration and one at the same file.

02:50.400 --> 02:56.220
Still we're repeating ourselves so it's nice that you can set this up here and for example this would

02:56.220 --> 03:03.330
be a good alternative to setting up our statically set header title for a categories screen meal categories

03:03.810 --> 03:09.300
so we could set this up here instead of into component because it's static anyways doesn't really matter

03:09.330 --> 03:10.630
where we set this up.

03:10.920 --> 03:16.500
But besides such a use case does isn't really an improvement because we still repeat ourselves.

03:16.620 --> 03:23.550
So I'll again cut this from here and instead we can now take advantage of a second argument you can

03:23.550 --> 03:25.820
pass to create stack Navigator.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.430
The first argument is object with your screens.

03:29.430 --> 03:32.990
The second argument allows you to configure that navigator.

03:33.060 --> 03:38.880
We haven't set up any configuration dairy yet and of course in the official box or as I get it here

03:38.880 --> 03:43.710
by my T you'll find a list of all the settings you can set up there.

03:43.710 --> 03:50.070
One important thing you can configure here are the default navigation options and as the name implies

03:50.310 --> 03:55.330
this allows you to set up options that apply to every screen.

03:55.440 --> 04:04.830
Now this takes object with your navigation options but now these options will be applied to every screen

04:05.070 --> 04:10.750
in this navigator so to all three screens here so that you don't have to repeat yourself.

04:10.770 --> 04:14.940
So now if we do that you'll see that color header here.

04:14.940 --> 04:18.920
Also here and all on the detailed screen if you go there.

04:18.960 --> 04:25.200
So now this is of course how you want to set up repeating configurations like the general style which

04:25.200 --> 04:27.900
typically doesn't change from screen to screen.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.710
If it does change that's fine.

04:29.760 --> 04:35.940
You can set it up on a per component basis or here in the screen conflict as I showed you but if it

04:35.940 --> 04:40.170
doesn't change you can use default navigation options here.

04:40.200 --> 04:48.720
Now of course this also brings up another question How are the settings set up here or here merged with

04:48.720 --> 04:51.440
the settings here or instead of a component.

04:51.720 --> 04:57.630
And the rule is very simple there default navigation options get merged with your specific navigation

04:57.630 --> 05:05.100
options set up here or here in the component and the specific options always win.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.830
If you have one and the same key of the same name.

05:07.830 --> 05:15.690
So if I would set up a default header title here like a screen which is of course very generic then

05:15.690 --> 05:18.060
you would still see meal categories here.

05:18.060 --> 05:24.930
Italian here but on the detailed screen where I said no specific header title you would see a screen

05:25.740 --> 05:28.800
so your default navigation options are overwritten.

05:28.860 --> 05:33.510
Now if you set up navigation options here when you configure the screen and instead of the component

05:33.990 --> 05:39.630
they act on the same level and the settings here on the screen level actually win.

05:39.630 --> 05:46.080
So if I said header title to meal categories with multiple exclamation marks here you see that here

05:46.260 --> 05:53.070
on the categories screen and the title you set up in the categories screen component does not win might

05:53.070 --> 05:55.790
be a bit counter-intuitive but this is how it is.

05:55.830 --> 06:03.280
So if you setup navigation options with the same title or with the same names here in the screen context

06:03.370 --> 06:09.340
then the screen context wins but no matter where you set it up it always wins against the default navigation

06:09.340 --> 06:09.840
options.

06:09.910 --> 06:16.640
If you use the same title so therefore here also get rid of the navigation options on my categories

06:16.640 --> 06:17.040
screen.

06:17.060 --> 06:21.590
I don't need that here I'm happy with setting this up directing the screen component but you could set

06:21.590 --> 06:22.720
it up in both places.

06:22.910 --> 06:29.090
It's important that you always remember that default options are overwritten though now besides the

06:29.090 --> 06:35.000
default navigation options in this second object which you pass to create stack navigator you can also

06:35.000 --> 06:36.210
configure other things.

06:36.260 --> 06:41.690
If you had control and space you should see a list here or alternatively consult the official box of

06:41.690 --> 06:42.610
course.

06:42.650 --> 06:50.060
Now typically the defaults are just fine but there for example you can set up the mode and you could

06:50.060 --> 06:56.150
set this to modal default as card if you set this you'll get a mode like transition for loading on your

06:56.150 --> 07:01.310
screen which means the screen slides in from the bottom instead of using the normal animation on Android

07:01.310 --> 07:04.220
you don't see a difference but on ISIS you will.

07:04.340 --> 07:10.070
That's just one thing you can change here to change the default animation in case you want a modal transition

07:10.070 --> 07:17.850
instead of the normal push pop animation here you can also change the initial root name by default I

07:17.850 --> 07:22.510
mentioned it would be the first key value pair but if you don't want to start on the categories screen.

07:22.590 --> 07:27.810
But for some reason on the meal detailed screen you could simply point at meal detail here instead of

07:27.810 --> 07:32.340
categories which you don't need to set up because it's a default and you would start on that screen

07:32.460 --> 07:33.510
as your starting screen.

07:33.510 --> 07:38.530
Of course you can't go back now because it's your initial screen the only screen the stack therefore.

07:38.580 --> 07:40.400
So going back won't work.

07:41.950 --> 07:47.380
Now again I'll reset this two categories and you don't need to add this because this is the default

07:47.380 --> 07:47.980
anyways.

07:48.040 --> 07:51.590
It uses the first key value pair by default.

07:51.600 --> 07:56.580
So with that we had a brief look at some options you can configure and most importantly add navigation

07:56.580 --> 08:01.860
options and default navigation options which is super important to build nice looking and efficient

08:01.860 --> 08:09.150
applications without repeating yourselves over and over again which you of course don't want.

08:09.170 --> 08:15.350
Speaking of efficiency there is one other thing you want to do when working with react navigation or

08:15.350 --> 08:15.980
you wonder.

08:16.010 --> 08:26.010
Consider and that is that you installed one extra package which is react native screens which an expo

08:26.010 --> 08:27.660
apps should be included by default.

08:27.690 --> 08:35.850
But still it doesn't hurt to explicitly install it which allows you to actually ensure that under the

08:35.850 --> 08:45.320
hood react navigation uses native optimized screen components provided by Android.

08:45.350 --> 08:51.510
I was on Android it uses D the fragment in case you're into Android people up a bit and on ayahuasca

08:51.510 --> 08:57.220
it uses the UI view controller and that simply improves performance a little bit more.

08:57.300 --> 09:03.830
Here in this simple app you won't feel it but it's a good practice to use this special package or D

09:03.870 --> 09:05.310
special screens.

09:05.580 --> 09:12.240
Now to use that you should go to a place that runs before you render your first screen which is to capture

09:12.240 --> 09:21.500
us following in our case here and there you can now import use screens from React Native screen.

09:21.510 --> 09:27.570
So from this package you just installed and simply called at after your imports before you do anything

09:27.570 --> 09:27.750
else.

09:27.750 --> 09:34.380
So before you render any jazz ex code this will simply behind the scenes unlock these screens and you

09:34.380 --> 09:38.790
won't see a difference in his app but it's a little bit more performance so it is something I would

09:38.790 --> 09:42.180
recommend doing especially in larger applications.

09:42.210 --> 09:45.190
Again here you don't really see a difference.

09:45.390 --> 09:48.450
But behind the scenes does this now a bit more efficient.
