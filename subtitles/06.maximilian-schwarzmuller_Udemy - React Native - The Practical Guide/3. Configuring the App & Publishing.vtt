WEBVTT

00:02.340 --> 00:06.700
What I got here is this application we build earlier in the course with the native device features with

00:06.700 --> 00:08.640
the camera maps and so on.

00:08.650 --> 00:10.950
This is the app I want to deploy.

00:11.140 --> 00:16.800
And this is now how we can configure it to be deployed in the managed export workflow.

00:16.810 --> 00:18.060
As I mentioned.

00:18.130 --> 00:19.720
So what can we do.

00:19.810 --> 00:24.910
Now we should have a look at the app Chase and file because that's the file or we can generally configure

00:25.150 --> 00:28.280
this app for deployment and for publishing it.

00:28.420 --> 00:34.690
And I want to walk you through some of the core settings you can make here and you should make here

00:35.380 --> 00:40.030
though let me all the points you add do you official docs the official Expo docs where you also have

00:40.030 --> 00:45.550
a full article about configuring the app Jason file you will find this article attached or a link to

00:45.550 --> 00:51.250
it attached to this lecture and there you learn all about the possible settings you can sit up there

00:51.490 --> 00:55.270
and what they mean what they do and to where you would need them for.

00:55.290 --> 01:01.510
So there's a lot you can configure but for a basic deployment most of these things don't matter.

01:01.540 --> 01:09.060
So what we have here for example is the name of our project and there I will use great places.

01:09.130 --> 01:14.320
This is also the name that will show up on the home screen when you built this app as a standalone app.

01:14.350 --> 01:17.710
And I'll go back to what a standalone app is in a second.

01:17.710 --> 01:24.340
Now here we also can add a slug and that should be like this in the U or L format so that this could

01:24.340 --> 01:30.130
be part of a U R L and you'll see where disk becomes important in a second as well.

01:30.130 --> 01:31.750
The same for our privacy public.

01:31.750 --> 01:37.450
We can leave this here at Public for the moment but again does this something which I'll explain in

01:37.450 --> 01:39.780
more details in a second.

01:39.790 --> 01:47.560
The SDK works here simply identifies the SDK version of the Expo SDK you're using typically this should

01:47.560 --> 01:54.940
be delayed as one though of course if you were building the app with let's say Expo SDK 30 free and

01:54.940 --> 02:00.040
then whilst you're building it a new word and comes out you should always follow the update or the upgrade

02:00.040 --> 02:04.450
guides which are released along with the new export version.

02:04.450 --> 02:11.170
New export versions simply means that some features could change that maybe some breaking changes were

02:11.170 --> 02:12.930
added some bug fixes.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.580
So typically you want to upgrade but you want to follow the upgrade instructions though you don't have

02:18.580 --> 02:21.010
to use the latest version here to be able to deploy it.

02:21.130 --> 02:25.420
You can also deploy an older version your platforms that should be self explanatory.

02:25.420 --> 02:30.520
You can describe for which platforms you want to publish and I'll remove Web here because we haven't

02:30.520 --> 02:34.860
really focused on that and support for it also is still kind of experimental.

02:34.900 --> 02:40.530
So let's go with Iaw and Android then you can set a word in and this number is totally up to you in

02:40.530 --> 02:40.780
the end.

02:40.780 --> 02:46.120
You should just manage to work in such that whenever you publish a new version of your app you change

02:46.120 --> 02:51.400
that and you have free numbers which you can change where typically the last number should be changed

02:51.430 --> 02:57.100
if a new version only includes tiny bug fixes but no major new features the middle number should be

02:57.100 --> 03:02.490
changed if you have a new version that does introduce Major were important new features.

03:02.610 --> 03:07.200
And the first number should be changed whenever you have a real major new word.

03:07.210 --> 03:12.860
And that might also very well include some breaking changes or some huge changes.

03:12.880 --> 03:20.320
So that's kind of something which also signals your users if it's a rather big important update or just

03:20.320 --> 03:22.670
a small one just a small fix.

03:22.900 --> 03:26.180
Orientation is a setting we already saw earlier in the course.

03:26.180 --> 03:30.220
There you can lock the orientation off your app.

03:30.310 --> 03:34.790
You can set it to default to allow for rotation or for rotating gap.

03:34.960 --> 03:41.370
You can set it to portrait or landscape mode to lock it down icon and splash screen.

03:41.370 --> 03:45.140
That's something I'll come back to in separate lectures soon.

03:45.150 --> 03:52.080
This allows you to set an app icon and the app splash screen and you just set a pointer at a input source

03:52.080 --> 03:59.100
that a basic file and then Expo will generate a bunch of icons for a different device sizes different

03:59.100 --> 04:00.980
screen sizes which is really convenient.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.710
But again I'll come back to this in more details later updates.

04:04.720 --> 04:10.050
There's also something I'll come back to that's related to the over the air update thing which is a

04:10.050 --> 04:12.600
very interesting asset bundle patterns.

04:12.620 --> 04:21.450
Also something I'll come back to this kind of has an impact on how extra assets like images that are

04:21.450 --> 04:22.290
part of your app.

04:22.290 --> 04:28.050
And with that I don't mean the icon but images to which you display in your app which you store locally

04:28.080 --> 04:29.930
or funds which you might be using.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.530
How those are distributed.

04:31.530 --> 04:38.190
But again I'll come back to this and then you can also set platform specific settings here for Iaw and

04:38.190 --> 04:39.750
Android.

04:39.750 --> 04:43.760
Now if you want to publish your app you can do this in a very simple way.

04:43.890 --> 04:46.800
You just need to run Expo publish.

04:46.860 --> 04:52.860
Now when you first run this you will be prompted to log in with your expo account or create a new one

04:52.860 --> 04:54.300
if you don't have one yet.

04:54.330 --> 04:59.190
So simply create one it's free it doesn't cost you anything you just need to create one you can do this

04:59.190 --> 05:01.460
on the fly off after running Expo publish.

05:01.500 --> 05:05.980
As I said you will be prompted to create an account or log in if you aren't already.

05:06.150 --> 05:10.870
And there you can create the account on the go in this command line here.

05:10.890 --> 05:13.990
All you need is a email a username and password.

05:14.070 --> 05:20.010
Once you did this and you run Expo publish this will try to publish your app and no worries it will

05:20.010 --> 05:23.600
not immediately publish it to the app stores now.

05:23.610 --> 05:27.780
Instead let's see what happens if we tried to do this.

05:27.780 --> 05:34.730
It now builds a javascript bundle for Android and also for Iowa's it also gave us a warning by the way

05:34.730 --> 05:37.430
regarding our assets not being optimized.

05:37.430 --> 05:39.570
That's something we can have a look at in a second.

05:40.670 --> 05:45.730
And with all of that it's now uploading the javascript bundles.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.780
We don't know where but we'll see in a second.

05:49.010 --> 05:51.040
And now it's done.

05:51.680 --> 05:55.130
So did it now create an app and upload it to the app stores.

05:55.130 --> 05:57.410
No that's not what happened here.

05:57.410 --> 06:01.900
Instead what it did here is it created deployment.

06:01.910 --> 06:04.400
It published our app to export.

06:04.400 --> 06:09.190
So what you can do now is you can entered a U or L which was displayed here.

06:09.260 --> 06:14.060
What you find is your app now hosted on expos servers.

06:14.060 --> 06:20.860
So to say and you can scan this barcode here with a real device with the expo client app.

06:20.870 --> 06:26.100
So basically what we already did during development can now be done with our published app.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.400
So let me briefly show this to you.

06:28.400 --> 06:34.220
Here's my iPhone and now again I just point my camera at this QR code or with Android you open your

06:34.220 --> 06:39.650
expo app and candy bar code there and now you can open that app in Expo.

06:39.650 --> 06:43.010
Now again you need the expo Klein installed for this.

06:43.070 --> 06:47.600
Now what you'll also see here on the screen however is a warning that I can't open this app because

06:48.050 --> 06:50.060
I'm not the offer of the experience.

06:50.060 --> 06:55.280
So the expo plan on our Web site as you see here can no longer open published projects that don't belong

06:55.280 --> 06:57.090
to the signed end user.

06:57.140 --> 06:59.450
Now that's a Iow limitation on Android.

06:59.450 --> 07:04.430
You would be able to open this app but of course the question is in general why would we publish our

07:04.430 --> 07:05.180
app like this.

07:05.180 --> 07:07.270
It's very hard to reach users with this.

07:07.270 --> 07:12.650
They need to have the expo client app installed which almost no one has in the world.

07:12.650 --> 07:15.620
Probably just a couple of react native developers.

07:15.680 --> 07:20.000
So this is not really how we want to distribute our app right.

07:20.030 --> 07:27.080
While this is just one step of distributing our app and this is actually not how we aim to targeted

07:27.110 --> 07:31.350
or how we aim to get it to all users over the world.

07:31.360 --> 07:39.070
Instead this is just one step of publishing it to the app stores this still is a nice step for you to

07:39.100 --> 07:45.010
now easily test your app or to share it with our users especially on Android on ISIS.

07:45.010 --> 07:47.940
Unfortunately there are some limitations where you can't test it.

07:47.950 --> 07:53.020
But with Android devices you can scandals and you can share an app across users you can show it to your

07:53.020 --> 07:58.060
friend and all this friend needs is the expert client app and you can scan this code and run the app

07:58.060 --> 08:00.070
you just build on his device.

08:00.070 --> 08:06.190
So for this it's nice but of course this is not the final solution for really publishing this to unknown

08:06.190 --> 08:06.730
users.
