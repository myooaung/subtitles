00:02.440 --> 00:07.470
We got working tabs at least on iOS, on Android we need icons,

00:07.630 --> 00:10.580
The good thing is we already added icons,

00:10.840 --> 00:17.770
the bad thing is using them on our tabs is not as straightforward as you might think.

00:17.770 --> 00:24.400
Remember we got this react native vector icons package from which we can import this icon component

00:24.670 --> 00:26.470
which we use here on place detail,

00:26.620 --> 00:34.820
this one. The thing is when we start our tabs where we have to assign icons, how can we use this component

00:34.820 --> 00:35.640
here?

00:35.720 --> 00:39.270
If we have a look at the documentation of react native navigation,

00:39.470 --> 00:45.340
we see the rest is icon property and it's optional for iOS but not for Android

00:45.680 --> 00:52.940
and here, we actually import a file with require and then this syntax which is simply an alternative

00:52.940 --> 00:57.830
to the import statement we used earlier in this course to import a local image.

00:57.830 --> 01:02.480
We can use an image here but we got our icons set which I'd like to use

01:02.480 --> 01:06.030
So how can we import our icon?

01:06.060 --> 01:13.770
The good thing is react native vector icons gives us a helper function for which we had to do this

01:13.950 --> 01:17.380
linking we already did in the last course module,

01:17.580 --> 01:20.440
so we don't have to do it right now, everything is already set up.

01:21.320 --> 01:25.220
So in start the main tab file here,

01:25.370 --> 01:35.510
I can just import icon from react-native-vector-icons/ionicons, just as before but now

01:35.540 --> 01:40.580
I don't use this component in a declarative way so I don't write

01:40.610 --> 01:45.340
icon something, instead we can use a helper method this

01:45.530 --> 01:54.200
icon has or does icon component or element has. We can add an icon property for each tab and then we

01:54.200 --> 01:59.140
can reach out to icon and call get image source,

01:59.240 --> 02:04.080
this actually fetches us an image of the icon which is exactly what we need to use here

02:04.130 --> 02:10.560
for this icon property. There we can then specify the name of the icon, the size and the color,

02:10.640 --> 02:14.550
so the exact same properties we used in the declarative approach here,

02:14.660 --> 02:23.860
size, name and color. The only issue is running this command doesn't instantly give us back the image,

02:23.880 --> 02:28.490
it's an asynchronous task so we can't assign it like this,

02:28.530 --> 02:36.210
it actually gives us back a promise and icon doesn't except the promise. The workaround is to simply

02:36.210 --> 02:46.060
execute the promise first and then in the then block, execute start tab based app, so we can say icon get

02:46.090 --> 02:47.250
image source

02:47.410 --> 02:54.220
and now let's pick a fitting icon, we want to find a fitting icon for finding a place so maybe we search

02:54.220 --> 02:55.610
for map here,

02:55.810 --> 02:58.690
we use that map icon, how about that?

02:58.690 --> 03:01.600
Use that one, md-map maybe,

03:01.630 --> 03:05.170
so let's pick this one and let's load it here,

03:05.230 --> 03:11.350
md-map. Let's pick size 30 and the color

03:11.350 --> 03:18.250
doesn't really matter here because the tab bar will use a custom color anyways or we'll set the color

03:18.310 --> 03:21.360
differently anyways so we don't really need to pass this here.

03:22.370 --> 03:28.860
Now that's the map icon but we need an icon for the second tab too and probably not the same one,

03:28.890 --> 03:33.000
it's about sharing a place so let's search for share,

03:34.110 --> 03:35.830
let's see what we find here,

03:36.060 --> 03:46.170
so typical share icons, so why don't we use that and maybe use this icon, that one, the first one, whichever

03:46.320 --> 03:47.230
icon you like.

03:48.170 --> 03:52.390
And if you're wondering how we can use different icons for Android and iOS,

03:52.490 --> 03:55.140
follow along, we'll cover this later in the course too.

03:55.460 --> 04:00.090
So now I also got get image source again for this second icon,

04:00.230 --> 04:09.410
now the issue is I got these two icons here but they both return a promise and I can't run start

04:09.410 --> 04:12.530
tab based app before they're both done,

04:12.530 --> 04:19.810
the solution is to use the promise object which thankfully is available in react native apps.

04:19.940 --> 04:25.170
It has an all method we can use and all takes an array of promises

04:25.340 --> 04:33.090
and the cool thing is all waits for all promises here to resolve, just need to separate them with a comma.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.770
So it will wait for all of them to resolve

04:35.960 --> 04:41.080
and once they are resolved, this then block thereafter is executed

04:41.480 --> 04:44.170
and there, we actually get an array of the data

04:44.200 --> 04:45.760
these promises returned,

04:45.800 --> 04:49.680
so of the image sources in our case, you can name this whatever you want.

04:50.060 --> 04:59.150
So inside this then block, I then want to execute my navigations start tab based function

04:59.150 --> 05:04.410
and now here, we can assign an icon, we simply access sources

05:04.490 --> 05:11.550
and here it's the first element which will be the image of that first promise and for sharing, it will

05:11.550 --> 05:13.160
be the second one,

05:13.170 --> 05:20.390
so with the index one, sources index one and this is how we can add icons.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.370
Now let's save all files and let's reload

05:23.370 --> 05:26.190
the apps, double r on Android,

05:26.190 --> 05:27.700
hit login again

05:27.810 --> 05:33.610
and now it's working, we got find place and share place, in this nice animation the ripple effect

05:33.690 --> 05:35.340
is all looking beautiful.

05:35.580 --> 05:38.710
And on iOS, also if we reload it,

05:38.850 --> 05:43.450
we login, here we see the icons too with the iOS style.

05:43.620 --> 05:46.400
Still the android icons because we only loaded these

05:46.500 --> 05:50.150
but again that is something we can fix later,

05:50.160 --> 05:52.450
it's already looking quite beautiful though.

05:52.590 --> 05:55.930
So this is how we add icons to our tabs.
