00:02.420 --> 00:04.480
Well that was a lot of work.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.320
We finish this module,

00:06.440 --> 00:10.700
we greatly enhanced the styling of this application

00:10.700 --> 00:16.040
where are we now really have a beautiful application with a nice authentication screen where we can't

00:16.040 --> 00:21.950
authenticate yet but that will change. Where we have a responsive design, where we have different icons

00:21.950 --> 00:27.790
depending on whether we're on iOS or Android and where we have this beautiful animation which doesn't

00:27.800 --> 00:35.100
load the list here because I haven't added items. A lot was covered and obviously, you can dive deeper

00:35.190 --> 00:40.650
and I encourage you to do so, dive into the official docs which I'll all link at the end of this module

00:40.920 --> 00:42.680
and play around with these things,

00:42.690 --> 00:49.020
you've got to practice them. Styling react native applications is maybe the hardest thing you can do because

00:49.020 --> 00:54.340
there's so many things to watch out for to make sure it works nice on all different devices and platforms

00:54.960 --> 00:56.320
but it's worth the effort,

00:56.370 --> 00:59.880
you want to provide a good user experience in the end.

00:59.880 --> 01:06.180
We spend enough time here, so let's move on and let's see what else we can do on our application to turn

01:06.180 --> 01:09.330
it into a better and better native application.
