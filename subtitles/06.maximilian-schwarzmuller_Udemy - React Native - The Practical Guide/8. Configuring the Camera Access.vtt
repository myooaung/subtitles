00:02.310 --> 00:09.000
So let's start with configuring this here launch camera acing is the function we call to open the camera

00:09.570 --> 00:13.310
but actually there you can configure quite a bit.

00:13.340 --> 00:19.920
If you pass the object here you've got a couple of options you can set and of course the official Expo

00:19.920 --> 00:24.520
docks for the image picker are the place to go to learn all about these options.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.930
No the default settings actually are quite fine.

00:26.940 --> 00:32.940
But for example here you could at allow us editing and set it to true to get a basic editor which allows

00:32.940 --> 00:37.560
you to cropped the image for example and that's actually something I will enable here.

00:37.620 --> 00:44.040
You can also set a specific aspect ratio where you want to lock in like 16 to nine which will be taken

00:44.040 --> 00:46.850
into account in your editing mode.

00:46.890 --> 00:52.680
You can also set if you want a base64 string instead of a file or in addition to the file I should say

00:52.920 --> 00:57.570
which means said that you get a text string that represents your image which is quite large though and

00:57.570 --> 01:04.190
I'll not do it here and you can also control the quality and there I will set the quality to Sarah about

01:04.200 --> 01:04.740
five.

01:04.740 --> 01:09.780
This should be a value between 0 and 1 where one is the highest possible value.

01:09.870 --> 01:13.350
And of course this also impacts the image size thereafter.

01:13.380 --> 01:17.030
So you want to pick a size or quality that makes sense for your app.

01:17.040 --> 01:23.490
If you're only using the image as a thumbnail you might not need super high risk images with that.

01:23.490 --> 01:28.050
This is configured at the question of course is how do we get access to the image that was taken.

01:28.950 --> 01:32.520
Well remember that this is a promise or did this returns a promise.

01:32.550 --> 01:33.570
Well of course they offer.

01:33.600 --> 01:41.050
We can await that promise and the result we get back after the promise resolved indeed is the image.

01:41.130 --> 01:47.340
So we can just store this image in a constant an image is no object with various pieces of information

01:47.340 --> 01:48.840
about the image that was taken.

01:49.590 --> 01:53.230
So here we can console log image to see what's in there.

01:53.250 --> 01:58.150
Let's save this and tested on Android there.

01:58.160 --> 02:05.930
If I now go to this new screen here take a image and I'll take this image with this dummy simulator

02:05.960 --> 02:06.460
camera.

02:06.470 --> 02:09.170
Get here and I confirm this.

02:09.200 --> 02:16.760
Now I go to this cropping or to this editing tool because I enabled editing here I have this 16 to nine

02:16.880 --> 02:22.050
format thing which I can move and by clicking on crop I can now select this.

02:22.250 --> 02:27.280
And if we now have a look at the console we see that this is the object we got back.

02:27.440 --> 02:32.930
It's our object with a canceled field which tells us that this was not cancelled but that we did take

02:32.930 --> 02:33.470
an image.

02:33.470 --> 02:37.880
So this is a field we can check to find out whether the user did take an image or whether due process

02:37.880 --> 02:38.700
was cancelled.

02:39.290 --> 02:41.330
We get the height of the image and the width.

02:41.570 --> 02:49.310
We get the type which is well image and the EU are ISO a link 2D image file.

02:49.310 --> 02:53.570
Now this is in a temporary directory which is cleaned up automatically periodically.

02:53.630 --> 02:59.830
So of course it's not the storage or the path where you want to permanently stored it.

02:59.840 --> 03:04.010
And we will actually move it later with the filesystem API.

03:04.670 --> 03:06.740
But for now it is something we can work with.

03:06.770 --> 03:16.840
So to output a preview we can manage some state here in the image picker by importing U.S. state and

03:16.870 --> 03:24.150
then initialize it up there use state can be called here.

03:24.510 --> 03:33.840
And of course I get back some some data here and that is my picked image and a set picked image function

03:33.870 --> 03:36.740
as you're used to from use state.

03:36.810 --> 03:39.160
And now we can utilize that here.

03:39.240 --> 03:44.340
Here I want to set the picked image to image that you are.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.550
So to that link to my image.

03:46.590 --> 03:53.910
So that path as a string to my image and the cool thing is this path can be used with the image component

03:53.940 --> 03:57.830
it works with the image component without any special configuration.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.160
So there we can add source and now we need to set this to object with this.

04:02.160 --> 04:08.800
You are I property thus far and of course we use that to point at network images.

04:08.820 --> 04:11.130
Well you can also point at local images.

04:11.130 --> 04:13.770
So here we can point at picked image.

04:13.980 --> 04:18.700
Of course this only works if we have a picked image which only is the case after we use the camera.

04:19.140 --> 04:23.940
So now we can add a check here or a simple ternary expression where we check if picked image is set

04:24.590 --> 04:31.770
and if it's not set hence the exclamation mark I showed his fallback text otherwise with the colon here

04:31.890 --> 04:38.820
I set the image and now we have this conditional output and therefore now if we save that and does hence

04:38.820 --> 04:42.640
restarts on both devices on both simulators.

04:42.660 --> 04:50.290
If I go to Android and I take my image here of course this camera opens unsurprisingly we can confirm

04:50.290 --> 04:51.490
this.

04:51.490 --> 04:56.230
She was our image crop it and now we see it here in the preview.

04:56.230 --> 04:59.700
So that's now our image getting used.

04:59.890 --> 05:05.310
And with that is of course time to add it to the place which we can add by clicking the safe place button

05:05.650 --> 05:08.350
and it's time to add some spacing between these two buttons I guess.
