00:02.940 --> 00:09.450
So let's add this last main navigation pattern you see in mobile apps and that's having a side door

00:10.170 --> 00:16.000
of course risk navigation as covered for Dad as well from react navigation you can import create draw

00:16.000 --> 00:18.740
and Navigator which does just what it sounds like.

00:18.750 --> 00:24.690
It makes it easy for us to create this draw based navigation pattern and it gives us such a draw and

00:24.750 --> 00:30.930
all the functionality we need to control the straw out of the box which is of course very convenient.

00:30.930 --> 00:35.060
So we simply create a new navigator and I'll do this at the bottom of this file.

00:35.490 --> 00:40.860
And just a quick side note of course you could split that into multiple files and have each navigator

00:40.890 --> 00:46.560
in its own file and then merge them together into one file by importing them into one central file.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.100
That is something you could do.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.420
I found it easier for this tutorial also to keep it all in one file.

00:51.430 --> 00:56.070
It's all too much too big of a file but you could definitely split this.

00:56.340 --> 01:01.410
So I will create my draw navigator here at the bottom of this file and all stored in that constant named

01:01.770 --> 01:04.380
Main navigator because in the end that's what it is.

01:04.380 --> 01:10.470
This will be our main navigator in the end because the tab will be inside of the draw and navigator

01:10.470 --> 01:11.980
in the end our haps here.

01:11.970 --> 01:13.190
So on both tabs.

01:13.200 --> 01:19.530
We have access to that side draw and decide draw allows us to go to a brand new screen which will not

01:19.530 --> 01:20.880
be part of our taps.

01:20.910 --> 01:26.130
So the draw navigator is above the tabs navigator in the hierarchy.

01:26.130 --> 01:28.680
So how do we configure such a draw navigator.

01:28.830 --> 01:32.070
Basically just as we did that before it takes two arguments.

01:32.070 --> 01:37.950
The first argument is an object where we configure the screens for destroyer navigator justice before

01:37.950 --> 01:46.350
we have identifiers like taps or meals favs whatever fitting navigator is for that first drawer entry

01:46.350 --> 01:47.570
you want to have.

01:47.850 --> 01:54.780
And here I want to point at my meals father tab navigator in and yet because that's what I want to load

01:54.780 --> 02:02.460
there and on a second entry is the filters screen we must not forget that we have one other screen that's

02:02.460 --> 02:08.550
the filters screen we haven't used it before now as it's time to shine and actually all wrapped as into

02:08.550 --> 02:11.130
a stack navigator even though it will be empty.

02:11.130 --> 02:13.850
So did we get a header there as well.

02:14.130 --> 02:20.370
So I will add another stack navigator here with create stack navigator.

02:20.370 --> 02:22.130
That's a very simple stack.

02:22.290 --> 02:26.670
It will have only one screen and that will be the filters screen which would therefore need to import

02:26.670 --> 02:29.190
here at the top because we're not doing that yet.

02:29.340 --> 02:38.670
Let's import filters screen here from screens filters screen and now we can use the filters screen down

02:38.720 --> 02:47.600
their website not not here but here in the stack navigator and named is filters navigator read anything

02:47.600 --> 02:54.450
like that and now it's this filters Navigator which can map to filters in my drawer navigator and I

02:54.450 --> 02:59.790
only use a stack navigator here so they also have a header there and for no other reason now on the

02:59.790 --> 03:04.260
filter screen will of course work on this in a second but on there there's one thing I want to do right

03:04.260 --> 03:12.810
away I will add my navigation options and I will add a header title there and set this to

03:15.280 --> 03:24.840
filters or filter meals anything like that with that back to the meals navigator we're creating that

03:24.840 --> 03:31.050
stack we're assigning the filters navigator stack navigator to our draw navigator and now we just have

03:31.050 --> 03:40.270
to use the main navigator here in our app container to start with debt and now if we save this we see

03:40.270 --> 03:41.350
nothing though.

03:41.350 --> 03:47.380
Well I said that the draw navigator would manage all logic for opening it ends on the thing it does

03:47.380 --> 03:56.020
not do for us automatically is show a menu icon so it doesn't show a hamburger button for us.

03:56.020 --> 03:59.710
That's something we have to do and we can decide on which screens to show it.

03:59.710 --> 04:04.600
And of course that would be the category screen because that's the root screen for the meals tab and

04:04.600 --> 04:09.320
the favorite screen because that's the root screen for his favorites tab.

04:09.340 --> 04:15.880
So in these two screens I want to add that menu icon and I add it in my navigation options as you learned

04:15.910 --> 04:20.390
because there I want to add it with the help of header left.

04:20.410 --> 04:26.620
Previously we used had a right to add actions to the navigation bar to the header but that menu button

04:26.620 --> 04:29.070
typically is on the left to added here.

04:29.350 --> 04:32.810
And I will use my header buttons for this.

04:32.920 --> 04:37.480
So we'll import from react navigation header buttons.

04:37.480 --> 04:44.970
This package we used earlier from there I will import header buttons and also item what we all use before

04:47.490 --> 04:50.280
and also import my custom header button.

04:50.280 --> 04:57.660
So header button from components header button so the same pattern we used before for adding that star

04:57.690 --> 04:59.730
I can indeed action bar.

04:59.730 --> 05:06.330
Now I'll do it here for the menu icon for the menu button and therefore we can now go down to the left

05:06.360 --> 05:18.000
and their ad header buttons this year as a component set the header button component to our header button

05:18.000 --> 05:18.500
component.

05:18.510 --> 05:23.610
We're importing from our own custom component and add an item in there which allows us to define the

05:23.610 --> 05:28.420
title that should be menu and then very importantly I can name.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.560
And there you can use IOW menu.

05:31.560 --> 05:36.570
And by the way you can always use the platform API here to use a different icon for Android and for

05:36.570 --> 05:38.640
ISIS if you want to.

05:38.640 --> 05:44.910
And last but not least all the add on press to do something when dead buttons pressed.

05:44.910 --> 05:52.200
And now this should render a nice looking menu button here on that screen and indeed we see it here

05:52.830 --> 05:53.600
on us.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.730
And we also see it on Android.

05:55.740 --> 06:00.040
Now again if you want a different icon on Android that looks more like a typical Android icons.

06:00.090 --> 06:05.550
The same is true for the taps by the way you can use the platform API to render a different icon there

06:06.350 --> 06:09.680
to save some time I'll use the same icons.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.910
So this is how we display the icon.

06:11.910 --> 06:18.360
How do we now opened a draw though well for this we need access to the navigation prop and we don't

06:18.360 --> 06:21.420
have that access in the navigation options like this.

06:21.420 --> 06:27.330
But of course we learned earlier that you can use the function form here where you then get your nav

06:27.330 --> 06:27.680
data.

06:27.690 --> 06:33.180
You could say in that function you then have to return your configuration object.

06:33.180 --> 06:36.720
So here you have to return an object in the end.

06:36.930 --> 06:40.170
And now nav data has such a navigation prop.

06:40.170 --> 06:46.380
So now here in on press we can say nav data dot navigation Dad will now be available that's provided

06:46.380 --> 06:50.350
by react navigation which executes this function the end.

06:50.550 --> 06:54.030
And there you will have a toggle draw method.

06:54.030 --> 06:59.850
You would also have open draw if you know you only want to open it but toggle draw will open it if it's

06:59.850 --> 07:01.890
closed and close it if it's open.

07:01.890 --> 07:06.440
So here you have toggle draw and dash should open the side menu.

07:06.440 --> 07:12.570
So if we save that now indeed the drawer opens we can work on the styling and the text we see here in

07:12.570 --> 07:20.890
a second but this is how you can open that drawer now before we take care about how this looks here.

07:20.930 --> 07:22.690
Let's make sure we have to say one favorites.

07:22.700 --> 07:27.050
And of course you can all deposit a video and do it on your own here because the steps will be the same

07:27.050 --> 07:29.570
as for the meals categories here.

07:29.570 --> 07:34.430
It's a nice practice to offer but after this short pause you have to pass this video we'll do it together

07:36.210 --> 07:38.520
so were you successful.

07:38.520 --> 07:46.400
Let's do it together and in the end it's all just about copying this setup here 2D favorites screen

07:47.060 --> 07:53.210
so I will copy this entire navigation options setup from the categories screen to the favorite screen

07:53.660 --> 07:58.760
and replace my navigation option steer with it of course that means that I have to renamed us here to

07:58.760 --> 08:05.450
favorite screen and here change the title back to your favorites but now I already have this dynamic

08:05.450 --> 08:12.130
navigation options creation function here where I have to toggle draw call here the icon I when he uses

08:12.170 --> 08:17.720
the same we just have to make sure we import all the things we need to import and for Dad we can grab

08:17.720 --> 08:25.100
the imports here from the categories screen as well from the react navigation had or buttons package.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.020
And from our own header button.

08:27.020 --> 08:34.920
Grab that and added here on the favorite screen now with Dad if we saved as this should be all now on

08:34.930 --> 08:41.100
the favorite screen we also have to draw and you can open it there as well we can not just open it by

08:41.120 --> 08:46.180
way if we click on filters role to take into the filter screen there we right now just don't have a

08:46.180 --> 08:52.160
way back but that's actually something we can all fixed right away because of the filter screen I simply

08:52.220 --> 09:02.560
also just want to have a draw at the top so on the filter screen I will also add my imports here Whip's

09:02.680 --> 09:07.280
header buttons ends on and then all the add by navigation options here.

09:07.570 --> 09:13.780
So copy the navigation options from the favorite screen this dynamic function and add it to the filters

09:13.840 --> 09:19.900
screen and replace the navigation option stair of course therefore then changed this year back to filters

09:19.960 --> 09:27.730
screen and change to title back to filter meals or whatever you want here and with that we should have

09:27.940 --> 09:34.600
a draw on the filter screen as well and that allows us to go back to our meals now a couple of things

09:34.600 --> 09:35.580
are missing though.

09:35.620 --> 09:40.870
For example on the filter screen the header looks totally different and therefore here on Android I

09:40.870 --> 09:46.930
can't even see my button because it's white the text here is not the text I want to display I also want

09:46.930 --> 09:55.570
to use different colors here maybe different font so there is work left to do but the basic draw functionality

09:55.720 --> 09:59.820
was added and as you see again with very little effort.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.550
So let's now take care about styling the draw and that filters screen.
