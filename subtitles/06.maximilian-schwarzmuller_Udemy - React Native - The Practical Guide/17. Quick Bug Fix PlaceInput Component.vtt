Before we dive into platform specific styles, so different styles for Android and iOS, there's one tiny

00:08.390 --> 00:15.920
bug I want to fix. In our place input component which I refactored from a class based component to one

00:15.920 --> 00:17.600
being a functional component,

00:17.870 --> 00:22.360
we should add a const in front of this place input name.

00:22.370 --> 00:28.640
It still worked without that because javascript automatically turned this into a variable but it was

00:28.820 --> 00:31.670
bad code, was semantically not correct.

00:31.700 --> 00:32.430
So now it is,

00:32.450 --> 00:34.430
so make sure to add this little bug fix

00:34.430 --> 00:35.400
we should apply.

00:35.540 --> 00:39.500
And with that, let's move on and let's write some platform specific code.
