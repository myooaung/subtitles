00:02.200 --> 00:04.720
There are a couple of things where we could continue.

00:04.740 --> 00:08.950
But I want to continue with the input container which is the container around these inputs.

00:08.980 --> 00:15.340
So around you select a number text around the text input here and around the buttons and this container

00:15.340 --> 00:18.970
has a width and it aligns to item spot as I described earlier.

00:18.970 --> 00:21.820
It would be nice to have that card to look there for Dad.

00:21.820 --> 00:27.410
We need some more exotic styles which sounds really fancy but simply some style rules.

00:27.410 --> 00:30.450
We haven't used before.

00:30.470 --> 00:34.080
For example I want to add a shadow a slight drop shadow.

00:34.110 --> 00:43.310
You do this with four core properties which you can use a color an offset and a pass a T and A radius.

00:43.310 --> 00:46.760
No shadow color should be clear it's the color of your Shadow.

00:46.760 --> 00:50.210
Shadow offset is how much it's offset from your container.

00:50.210 --> 00:54.290
And that actually takes the object which then in turn takes a width and a height.

00:54.290 --> 00:59.390
So you could say I want to offset the shadow by two pixels regarding the width and by two pixels regarding

00:59.390 --> 01:07.220
the height that influences the three dimensional effect your creating opacity describes how transparent

01:07.280 --> 01:08.990
this shadow is.

01:08.990 --> 01:15.950
If you set opacity to 1 then you have a totally in transparent so a very visible strong shadow.

01:15.950 --> 01:21.800
And if you increase that so or decrease that I should say if you set this to Sera that one for example

01:21.950 --> 01:28.910
you have a shadow which you can barely see Shadow radius then basically describes how sharp that shadow

01:28.910 --> 01:29.280
is.

01:29.300 --> 01:35.290
If it has rough edges or if it's a bit more blurry softer things like that.

01:35.330 --> 01:40.610
So here I'll go with a shadow color of black by the way you can also use hex codes here if you want

01:40.610 --> 01:47.720
to and you can also use R D you'd be a codes if you prefer this ever normal argy Biko codes actually

01:47.870 --> 01:53.270
or all the with an alpha channel to describe transparency here though the transparency here won't have

01:53.270 --> 01:59.030
a direct influence for a shadow you will have to set this with shadow opacity for our colours it would

01:59.030 --> 02:04.100
have an influence but that's just a side note attached you'll find a link with more details about how

02:04.100 --> 02:09.260
you can configure colours and which colour values react native accepts because obviously that's way

02:09.260 --> 02:14.030
more exhaustive than what I can show here I will just go with the name because while I want the black

02:14.030 --> 02:20.420
colour so why not go with that shortcut now besides to colour the shadow here will all receive an offset

02:20.510 --> 02:23.990
and as I said offset here takes an object.

02:23.990 --> 02:31.040
Now in case you wonder how I notice for one my Ida e tells me if I start typing shadow off since here

02:31.040 --> 02:36.530
you see that hint I get on the right you should normally be getting this as well but in case you don't

02:36.530 --> 02:42.830
get this do you official docs are of course the place to go and they are always under a guides components

02:42.830 --> 02:49.100
and API eyes you can click on the View component there or simply click on the API docs here in the top

02:49.100 --> 02:57.800
right corner and then she was your view there and there you'll find some style prop and then you can

02:57.860 --> 03:03.890
find a list of all of you stalls that are supported and of course also how you configure those in there

03:03.890 --> 03:10.040
for example you'll learn that shadow offset is an object with a number and a height for the colour you

03:10.040 --> 03:14.630
learn that this takes a colour and that's exactly the link you find attached here where it's described

03:14.630 --> 03:16.740
which kind of colours you can use.

03:17.030 --> 03:24.020
So that's just a little side note here I'll use a shadow offset with a width of zero but a height of

03:24.020 --> 03:32.030
Q so that my shadow is offset a little bit to the bottom so to say not so much to the right so not at

03:32.030 --> 03:40.310
all to the right actually and I'll then also add a shadow radius which is a number of let's give six

03:40.310 --> 03:41.870
a try and see what that does.

03:42.650 --> 03:49.970
And last but not least a shadow opacity of 0 2 6 which is relatively transparent but which I think looks

03:49.970 --> 03:51.610
quite nice.

03:51.850 --> 03:58.480
In addition I'll give my input container a background colour of light to make sure that it's always

03:58.480 --> 04:03.370
white and not transparent which is otherwise the default so that if we would have another background

04:03.370 --> 04:08.890
color behind the container let's say as the base color of the entire screen the container here would

04:08.920 --> 04:11.100
always have a white background.

04:11.140 --> 04:16.180
Now with that if you save this you should see a shadow that looks something like this on IAW but you

04:16.180 --> 04:20.190
see no shadow at all on Android and that's not a bug.

04:20.410 --> 04:28.120
Instead the shadow properties here only work on ISIS and that leaves one important question How can

04:28.120 --> 04:32.820
you set a shadow on Android then is that not possible.

04:33.070 --> 04:39.610
It is but there you have a special style Prop D elevation prop this only works on Android as the tooltip

04:39.610 --> 04:48.280
also shows here platform Android whereas these shadow properties only work on Io s now elevation simply

04:48.280 --> 04:55.090
takes a number of let's say 5 and then use the default Android material design elevation so you have

04:55.090 --> 05:00.130
less control there but on the other hand you get the default material the sign looks which your users

05:00.130 --> 05:06.070
might be used to anyways so that's the good thing about this and now we also have a shadow here on Android

05:06.340 --> 05:13.590
and on IAW on ISIS you will also notice that the shadow is visible on the left and right of the box

05:13.590 --> 05:19.840
as well even though I gave it as a shadow offset of 0 for the width that can be controlled with the

05:19.840 --> 05:25.480
shadow radius though if you set shadow which had a radius to zero then you see you only have to shadow

05:25.480 --> 05:30.970
where you defined it's offset here so you can make sure that the shadow really is only there where you

05:30.970 --> 05:37.060
want it if you do set a shadow radius though and by default there also is a default shadow radius you

05:37.060 --> 05:41.350
get this this spill effect which is a more natural shadow after all.

05:41.350 --> 05:47.860
So here it's actually the effect I want now is that I added a shadow both on Android using the default

05:47.920 --> 05:53.500
Android shadow and on I was by the way on Android you can of course change the elevation level to play

05:53.500 --> 05:59.950
around with different levels of elevation until you have to look you want for your application you have

05:59.950 --> 06:05.530
enough shadow basically now besides having the shadow here however I think it would be nice to have

06:05.530 --> 06:11.680
some padding in this box now because these items sit way too close to the edges they sit directly on

06:11.680 --> 06:20.350
the edges after all so to change this I'll also add a little bit of padding here and the debt will be

06:20.350 --> 06:26.440
of heading of 20 and again that's a value you can experiment with find the padding that you personally

06:26.440 --> 06:33.910
prefer and you think that looks good and if we try that now this looks way better.

06:33.970 --> 06:36.700
In addition rounded corners would be a nice thing.

06:37.120 --> 06:45.870
So I'll add border radius here of let's say tend to have slightly rounded borders.

06:45.870 --> 06:52.940
We now saved at this looks pretty sweet to me on both platforms on both devices.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.740
So this is now the input container.

06:54.770 --> 06:58.570
We can't see the input and the buttons probably should have the same size as well.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.950
But at least the container is now looking good.
