00:02.480 --> 00:04.330
So are you still with me?

00:04.340 --> 00:08.330
We did a lot of styling in this module but that's of course crucial,

00:08.330 --> 00:15.740
mobile apps are a lot about making sure they look good and obviously they respond to changes in the

00:15.740 --> 00:19.900
device orientation or they provide different stylings for different platforms

00:19.910 --> 00:22.380
and all these things were covered.

00:22.460 --> 00:26.290
Now it's time for another important thing, animations.

00:26.570 --> 00:34.500
I want to have an animation here in the find place component, when we have places, we don't have any yet

00:34.550 --> 00:40.610
but if we have places, I want to have a button which says something like start search and when we press

00:40.610 --> 00:48.710
this button, I want to animate it to fly towards us and become transparent and then load in the places

00:48.710 --> 00:50.350
we have. Right

00:50.360 --> 00:56.630
now, we manage all the places in our redux state but later in this course when we actually store places

00:56.630 --> 00:58.850
on a server and fetched them from there,

00:58.970 --> 01:05.240
this animation makes more sense because it provides some interaction whilst we are loading the places.

01:05.540 --> 01:10.120
So therefore, let me show you how to handle animations in react native

01:10.340 --> 01:15.620
and as always, I can only recommend the docs of course where there is a guide on animations where you

01:15.620 --> 01:17.030
can dive much deeper

01:17.060 --> 01:20.440
but before you dive deeper, let's dive in together.

01:20.620 --> 01:27.670
So we want to add an animation and first I need to work a little bit on find place so that it's in the

01:27.670 --> 01:34.990
state that we can actually add an animation to it, in find place, I want to add a button in the middle

01:35.080 --> 01:38.510
which is displayed instead of this list here

01:38.560 --> 01:46.300
if we haven't loaded the data yet. For that, I will create a new variable here which I'll name content

01:46.510 --> 01:54.700
and that content is either our button or the list depending on whether we get data or not. Let's say by

01:54.700 --> 01:57.140
default we don't have the data,

01:57.460 --> 02:01.870
so I'll start by implementing the button in this case, the search button which we can click to fetch

02:01.870 --> 02:03.450
data. For that,

02:03.460 --> 02:12.450
I'll need to import some touchable item, maybe touchable opacity and I want to construct my button with

02:12.450 --> 02:14.400
that I'll want to build my custom button,

02:14.520 --> 02:21.130
so touchable opacity should wrap a view here because we can style that view then

02:21.290 --> 02:25.630
and that has nothing to do with animations, I just need a custom button here.

02:26.340 --> 02:35.850
So let's quickly implement all that code for it and on that button here, I just want to say find places,

02:36.190 --> 02:41.760
now this button of course needs certain styles then and for that I need a stylesheet,

02:41.890 --> 02:45.180
so let's also import stylesheet here

02:46.160 --> 02:49.580
and let's add some styles below our component

02:49.820 --> 02:56.690
so const styles equals stylesheet create, there

02:56.690 --> 03:00.670
I'll add a search button property which should hold the styles for my button,

03:00.710 --> 03:06.210
this will be added to the view in my touchable opacity element and there I want to have a border or

03:06.230 --> 03:10.560
color of let's say Orange to be in line with our other theme.

03:10.700 --> 03:19.190
I want to have a border width of maybe 3 pixels to have a bit of a wider border, a border radius of maybe

03:19.190 --> 03:23.460
50 and a padding of 20,

03:23.480 --> 03:27.530
so this is the styling for my search button. In there,

03:27.530 --> 03:30.070
I want to have a text so the search

03:31.450 --> 03:36.280
button text will be a separate property to style the text separately,

03:36.610 --> 03:45.760
I'll give it a color which should also be orange, I'll add a font weight of bold to have a fat text and

03:45.760 --> 03:48.690
set the font size to 26 maybe.

03:48.910 --> 03:51.780
Now these two styles can be assigned,

03:51.800 --> 03:54.130
the view here receives

03:56.290 --> 04:07.580
styles search button and the text receives styles search button text. That's a search button which

04:07.580 --> 04:12.470
should be displayed if we have no data, to determine if we have data or not,

04:12.530 --> 04:14.390
I'll add a state here

04:14.390 --> 04:25.390
to this fine place component and I'll simply set some property in there, maybe places loaded

04:25.640 --> 04:28.980
and initially this could be false.

04:29.030 --> 04:34.590
Now correctly, you would say that we probably would handle these through redux

04:34.940 --> 04:38.000
but here, we always have the places in redux,

04:38.030 --> 04:40.990
I will adjust this later when we actually reach out to the web,

04:41.000 --> 04:42.750
now it's all about the animation.

04:42.770 --> 04:45.950
So we have this internal state places loaded,

04:46.100 --> 04:50.440
now when we press the button, I want to play the animation

04:50.750 --> 04:54.950
and once the animation is done, display the places.

04:55.130 --> 05:03.710
So therefore I will add an onPress handler to touchable opacity and I want to execute a new method,

05:03.710 --> 05:07.190
let's add it here which is places

05:09.730 --> 05:14.770
search handler, don't expect an argument here.

05:15.080 --> 05:24.390
I'll hook it up so onPress I execute places search handler and in there, it's now all about starting an

05:24.390 --> 05:25.230
animation

05:25.230 --> 05:30.610
and as I said, at the end of the animation, switching places loaded to false.

05:30.630 --> 05:37.380
Now for this to have an effect, I need to work in my template though to actually render different things depending

05:37.410 --> 05:39.360
on places loaded,

05:39.570 --> 05:48.090
so what I'll do is I'll check if this state places loaded is true in which case I don't want to render

05:48.090 --> 05:49.000
the button.

05:49.140 --> 06:00.410
but I will then set content to my place list here, like that, place list should then be output. And now in the

06:00.410 --> 06:05.300
view down here, the view we always return

06:07.880 --> 06:10.550
which I should wrap with

06:13.020 --> 06:14.350
parentheses,

06:14.820 --> 06:17.560
I want to output this content.

06:19.020 --> 06:23.930
So now we're outputting content and content is either our list or this button depending on whether we

06:23.920 --> 06:26.040
loaded the data or not.

06:26.040 --> 06:31.170
Now let's quickly see if this all works by going into places search handler and not playing an animation

06:31.320 --> 06:41.970
but simply calling this set state and there, I just want to set the state such that places loaded is

06:41.980 --> 06:45.510
set to true when we click the button. If we now save

06:45.520 --> 06:49.500
all of that and we reload our application,

06:52.440 --> 06:58.320
we can submit, we get this find places button here, needs a little more adjustment from a styling perspective

06:58.320 --> 07:03.260
but if I click it, it disappears and we would see the list if we had any, I guess.

07:03.570 --> 07:04.700
So this should work,

07:04.710 --> 07:10.650
now the button needs more styling, to be precise the positioning here in the view has to differ depending

07:10.650 --> 07:15.990
on whether we're outputting the button here or our list.

07:16.020 --> 07:22.430
Now a way of doing that is to add a button container style here

07:25.350 --> 07:34.960
and a list container style because both will be positioned differently and in the button container,

07:35.230 --> 07:48.080
I'll set flex to one, justify the content in the center and align items in the center to center the button

07:48.080 --> 07:49.740
in the middle of the page.

07:49.940 --> 07:56.270
If we have a list, I actually don't want to set any of that so I can just remove that and I only need

07:56.270 --> 07:58.090
to set the button container

07:58.220 --> 08:07.160
if the data has not been loaded, so I'll set the style of my view here equal to a check where I see if

08:07.160 --> 08:09.680
this state places loaded is true,

08:10.010 --> 08:17.220
if it is then I'll attach no style because then I have the list which doesn't need a specific style

08:17.240 --> 08:20.740
otherwise I'll attach styles button container.

08:20.950 --> 08:24.660
With that if we save this and go back to the application and reload it

08:27.810 --> 08:30.780
on both devices and I go here,

08:30.780 --> 08:33.090
the button looks nicely centered.

08:33.090 --> 08:40.930
Now let me actually add a place to see if that works and click find places and that looks as before.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.850
So that's looking good to me,

08:43.020 --> 08:47.250
now with that, the preparation is done, let's now add an animation.
