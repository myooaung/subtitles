00:02.380 --> 00:03.240
So we get a working

00:03.240 --> 00:10.810
login flow but it only makes sense if you also use the token. Now for this let's go to firebase and

00:10.810 --> 00:12.790
there to the database part,

00:12.840 --> 00:16.710
remember the rules which we just turned to true in the past?

00:16.720 --> 00:20.050
I'll change this now, I'll set to the following,

00:20.170 --> 00:23.950
read access is only granted if auth is not equal to null.

00:24.170 --> 00:32.070
This auth variable here is a special variable provided by firebase which in the end contains the information

00:32.070 --> 00:34.260
whether the user is authenticated or not

00:34.260 --> 00:37.360
and if it's null, it means the user is not authenticated.

00:37.660 --> 00:39.310
So if we check if that's not null,

00:39.310 --> 00:43.650
we say we only give access if the user is authenticated.

00:43.820 --> 00:50.540
So now if I publish this, only authenticated users can access our data and we can immediately see this.

00:50.680 --> 00:56.740
If we go to find place and we or if we reload the app and we do login

00:56.740 --> 00:59.360
but keep in mind we're not doing anything with the token yet,

01:00.370 --> 01:03.350
you see that yellow warning here on the right,

01:03.700 --> 01:07.070
now here we actually got an unhandled promised rejection.

01:07.090 --> 01:12.760
If we go to our app and we have a look at places, we see that there in get places which is the action

01:12.760 --> 01:14.680
that just was dispatched,

01:14.800 --> 01:22.210
we actually do have a catch block but due to the way fetch works here, we actually only would have caught

01:22.450 --> 01:29.860
problems with the sending of the request, here however we got a problem with the response, so we should

01:29.920 --> 01:36.610
add catch at the end here to catch any errors and this will now lead to a different result.

01:36.640 --> 01:45.380
So if we update get places in places like this and we now submit this, now we get this alert,

01:45.560 --> 01:49.370
so this not only fixes this or improves this error handling,

01:49.370 --> 01:56.810
it also shows that we indeed didn't successfully login here because in our rules, we disabled it, only

01:56.810 --> 02:02.510
authenticated users are allowed and even though we successfully did authenticate, we don't prove that

02:02.540 --> 02:07.300
to the backend, we need to send that token and we're not doing that yet.

02:07.340 --> 02:13.880
So first of all, let me quickly improve all our methods like this to put the catch block to the end of

02:13.880 --> 02:14.410
them,

02:14.480 --> 02:19.460
so to make sure that we catch all possible errors that could occur here,

02:23.110 --> 02:29.680
let's do the same also for deleting. And with that out of the way,

02:29.980 --> 02:34.740
let's now think about how we can prove to the server that we are authenticated.

02:35.170 --> 02:37.840
Now we'll do this in the next lecture.
