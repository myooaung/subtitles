Now besides Aikins and splash screen our app also might include other assets.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.110
This app actually doesn't.

00:08.110 --> 00:13.480
But you might have other images here in the asset folder which you're using your app with image component.

00:13.520 --> 00:16.670
So not network images but local images.

00:16.670 --> 00:23.270
As we also use them early in the course or you might be using custom fonts as I did in many of the course

00:23.270 --> 00:24.440
modules.

00:24.440 --> 00:29.820
Now if you do that there is actually something interesting happening in a managed Expo app.

00:29.960 --> 00:35.540
When you publish your app and even if you later deploy to the app stores which I will show you these

00:35.600 --> 00:43.520
assets by default are actually taken by Expo are optimized hands on and are then uploaded onto one of

00:43.520 --> 00:49.940
their servers for free but they're uploaded there and your app is configured to download them from the

00:49.940 --> 00:52.070
servers when it launches.

00:53.110 --> 00:59.740
Now the advantage of this is that your app bundle is kept a bit smaller because the files are not included

00:59.740 --> 01:04.850
in your app but instead live on a server and are downloaded into the running app.

01:04.960 --> 01:10.780
But the disadvantage of this approach can be that your app always needs an Internet connection because

01:10.780 --> 01:16.690
if you don't have an internet connection your images and your funds can't be loaded into the app and

01:16.690 --> 01:20.090
that of course might lead to your app not working in the way it should.

01:20.170 --> 01:26.740
So therefore you actually might not want to have your images or funds uploaded to expose servers or

01:26.740 --> 01:28.390
at least not all of them.

01:28.390 --> 01:31.500
And that's what you can control with that asset bundle patterns.

01:31.510 --> 01:38.890
Setting the app Chase and fall whichever path or paths you provide here will be excluded from uploading

01:39.250 --> 01:40.780
and you can use wildcards.

01:40.810 --> 01:47.920
Now as you see what this basically says is all files should not be uploaded so all files should be included

01:48.010 --> 01:49.340
into the app bundle.

01:49.420 --> 01:55.630
If this would be an empty array or if this would not be set at all this option then you would have to

01:55.630 --> 01:59.640
default behavior of uploading all assets to the servers.

01:59.860 --> 02:07.450
With this approach which was pre configured here you say well upload everything to exposed service except

02:07.450 --> 02:12.810
for what you find in this path and this path on the other end is a wild card that says everything.

02:12.820 --> 02:20.110
So every file in every folder of this project should be part of the app bundles so actually nothing

02:20.110 --> 02:22.030
will be uploaded with this setting.

02:22.030 --> 02:28.930
You could also be saying well everything in assets or maybe everything and assets and sub folders of

02:28.960 --> 02:31.750
assets should be part of TSA bundle.

02:31.750 --> 02:37.930
If you had any other files which you use the app in other folders you would upload them so you can really

02:37.930 --> 02:40.150
control this in great detail.

02:40.210 --> 02:46.210
And again you can learn more in the official box if you wish to attach to find a link to that as well

02:46.540 --> 02:49.020
and therefore you can control what's part of your bundle.

02:49.060 --> 02:54.400
Therefore increasing the size of it a little bit into the loading time of the app a little bit or what

02:54.400 --> 02:59.650
should be stored on servers which might make your bundle a bit smaller but which forces you to always

02:59.650 --> 03:01.050
have an internet connection.
