00:02.900 --> 00:03.590
So that's it,

00:03.590 --> 00:06.260
we polished our application,

00:06.260 --> 00:07.640
it's now working fine,

00:07.640 --> 00:14.300
it's looking good and now we're also making sure that we can indeed use it in the best possible way

00:14.300 --> 00:15.740
or in a really good way

00:15.740 --> 00:21.650
I'd say. Obviously feel free to dig deeper and improve this even more but I'm pretty happy with the state

00:21.650 --> 00:22.330
of it,

00:22.370 --> 00:25.640
so why don't we finally publish it.
