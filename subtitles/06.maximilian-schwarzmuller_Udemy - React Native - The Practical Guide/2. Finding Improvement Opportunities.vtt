00:02.240 --> 00:05.740
Let's start simple with the size of the wise.

00:05.750 --> 00:12.140
We're running on right now I have relatively big emulators here and it will now change this and I'll

00:12.140 --> 00:13.090
change it on Android.

00:13.100 --> 00:18.620
But of course we could do the same on us here on Android and I will create a new word chill device which

00:18.620 --> 00:20.690
is actually way smaller.

00:20.690 --> 00:26.570
And for Dad in my list of images here when creating a new virtual device I'll pick a super small one

00:26.660 --> 00:27.410
like this.

00:27.410 --> 00:30.040
Three dots seven inch phone here.

00:30.050 --> 00:36.290
Now one important side note you might be thinking Dad not many users use such small devices anymore

00:36.470 --> 00:39.980
but that really depends on the market you're targeting.

00:39.980 --> 00:45.980
If you're targeting primarily the U.S. well then maybe you don't really need to optimize your app for

00:45.980 --> 00:47.360
small devices.

00:47.360 --> 00:52.910
But if you're targeting the whole world or maybe some emerging countries well then that looks different.

00:52.910 --> 00:58.340
So you definitely want to know what your target is in which device is your target users you is.

00:59.150 --> 01:06.170
So I will create this device here a relatively small one somebody click next year pick Android pie in

01:06.170 --> 01:09.640
my case here as the Android version and then finish this.

01:09.770 --> 01:14.190
And now it is will create this virtual device and now I will also launch it.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.740
So now it is is booting up on my second screen I'll bring it back here in a second.

01:19.770 --> 01:22.110
I'll close this android device for the moment.

01:22.110 --> 01:27.330
This bigger one and here's my smaller one booting up.

01:27.430 --> 01:33.550
So let me also increased is a little bit and this just increases the size in which we can see it not

01:33.580 --> 01:36.300
the dimension of the phone.

01:36.420 --> 01:43.010
And as you can already tell this is definitely a smaller device with less pixels available both on the

01:43.010 --> 01:45.640
on the height and the width.

01:45.660 --> 01:50.360
So now with that I already am back in my project.

01:50.380 --> 01:54.900
This is the project we worked on in the last sections and you find it attached in case you didn't follow

01:54.900 --> 01:59.730
along here and I already started my exposed server with NPM start.

01:59.730 --> 02:06.410
And by hitting a I now install Expo and then this app here on this emulator.

02:06.510 --> 02:13.460
So let's wait for this to finish and launch and here's my app and we can already tell that our app is

02:13.550 --> 02:17.200
certainly not optimized for smaller screens here.

02:17.210 --> 02:22.060
The buttons are not really positioned dead well so something's wrong there.

02:22.060 --> 02:26.090
And now let's see how it works when we start the game.

02:26.090 --> 02:37.490
Well then your dis seems to work if it like click Start Game Well that certainly is working here but

02:37.550 --> 02:42.670
we have an issue on our starting screen and maybe here we want to change some sizes as well maybe want

02:42.670 --> 02:49.730
to remove the margin or reduce the margin we have between this number and this box with our inputs here

02:50.330 --> 02:58.490
maybe one to increase to with our boxes down there or log off the Robins we had half.

02:58.490 --> 03:03.590
So maybe you want to change something there and when the game is over maybe once you shrink the size

03:03.590 --> 03:08.570
of the image a little bit but because this is super large and it actually has won you a disadvantage

03:08.810 --> 03:12.320
because since this pages and scroll I can't reached the new game but.

03:12.470 --> 03:14.950
So that's a real game breaker.

03:15.140 --> 03:20.740
It's reviewable breaking our game this distance here also is a bit too big between the image and the

03:20.780 --> 03:22.280
text 0.

03:22.280 --> 03:26.000
There's a bunch of work to do just because we're on a smaller device.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.610
This doesn't even respect the fact that our users might rotate the device which by the way at the moment

03:31.640 --> 03:36.150
is disabled anyway so I'll come back to this and how to enable it in a second.

03:36.170 --> 03:43.010
So let's start working on that and let's learn how we can actually calculate our space we're distributing

03:43.010 --> 03:49.160
the sizes we use in a more dynamic way and make sure that our app looks good on all kinds of devices.
