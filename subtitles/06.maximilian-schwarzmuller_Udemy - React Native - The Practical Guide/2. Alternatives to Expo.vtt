00:02.410 --> 00:05.770
You could say there are around three ways of building a risk native app.

00:05.770 --> 00:09.420
One is with expo with the so-called manage to workflow.

00:09.430 --> 00:14.920
That's the approach we used in the course and disaster kind of a dashed line around it because this

00:14.920 --> 00:20.290
is not really an alternative for building a non Expo app does of course heavily embraces Expo instead

00:20.440 --> 00:21.440
it is the approach we use.

00:21.450 --> 00:27.190
Of course it is easy to use has pretty much zero setup it works out of the box you can easily test the

00:27.190 --> 00:33.250
app on a real device you got lots of native modules built in which are super easy to install into use

00:33.730 --> 00:39.610
it's controlled with the exposed seal ie you just type NPM start or expose start you've got the expo

00:39.610 --> 00:46.710
dev tools in the browser it's easy to run on simulators and real devices and you still can get a standalone

00:46.720 --> 00:53.080
app which you can deploy which as I explained contains the expo client as a rapper so to say since you

00:53.080 --> 00:58.510
can also easily test it on real devices you technically don't even need to install Android Studio or

00:58.600 --> 01:05.530
X code to build an app with expo I did install it and I kind of instructed you to all install it for

01:05.630 --> 01:11.320
discourse so that we could spin up simulators and test it there because I didn't constantly want to

01:11.320 --> 01:16.990
test it on the real device that records that screen but you don't need to do that you can test it on

01:16.990 --> 01:20.360
a real device with the expo client app installed there only.

01:20.410 --> 01:23.120
So that's something you can do now.

01:23.200 --> 01:28.810
This is the approach we use but of course this is done at Expo heavy app it's app fully in the Expo

01:28.840 --> 01:33.590
ecosystem with all the restrictions or disadvantages I outlined.

01:33.640 --> 01:39.610
Now an alternative to that is that you still use Expo but these so-called bare workflow or that you

01:39.610 --> 01:44.380
build a react native app without expo at all with you react native seal I.

01:44.610 --> 01:51.720
Now the expo bear workflow thing can even be created from scratch or by ejecting from the managed workflow

01:51.720 --> 01:55.080
and that's something I'll also show you in this module.

01:55.110 --> 02:01.530
Now when you build an app with the bare workflow you get a non Expo app you build a native app as you

02:01.530 --> 02:03.490
would build it with you react native Seelye.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.950
So you get the same basis there.

02:05.970 --> 02:13.920
The difference is that you can still use special Expo packages installing them is a bit more complex

02:13.920 --> 02:20.040
then when you're in the manage to workflow you need to do more manual wire up work at least for some

02:20.040 --> 02:27.330
packages but many not all but many of the Expo packages which are included in the managed workflow are

02:27.420 --> 02:32.560
available as standalone packages you can bring to any react native app as well.

02:32.640 --> 02:38.480
And the expo team is working on making more and more packages available outside of the Managed workflow

02:38.970 --> 02:45.450
so you can bring that and with the bare workflow it's relatively easy to add these packages not as easy

02:45.450 --> 02:50.870
and quick as in the manage workflow but still very easy when building an app without exploit all with

02:50.890 --> 02:51.900
react NATO supply.

02:51.930 --> 02:58.420
You can still bring these packages but then more manual setup is required now as I said it's relatively

02:58.420 --> 03:01.660
easy to configure and manage in the bare workflow.

03:01.660 --> 03:04.610
You have to manage more in the react native seal ie workflow.

03:04.630 --> 03:12.790
So there you really build everything without any support by Expo regarding the native modules you use

03:13.480 --> 03:19.540
you can't use any native module you want all the non expert ones you can bring these special Expo packages

03:19.540 --> 03:23.620
which you need to wire up manually but you can bring any other native module.

03:23.620 --> 03:28.480
Now when we come to building the app and distributing it with the managed workflow you will see in the

03:28.480 --> 03:35.650
deployment module that's super easy to do with the bare workflow it's a bit harder in quotes it's it

03:35.650 --> 03:42.700
requires more work with Android Studio and X code and it's not as easy as with the actual managed workflow

03:42.940 --> 03:48.670
you also for example and that's one important restriction you will not be able to build ISIS apps on

03:48.670 --> 03:49.520
Windows.

03:49.660 --> 03:54.910
That is possible in the managed workflow because the build won't happen on your order on your machine

03:54.910 --> 04:00.160
there but in the cloud with the bare workflow and with the react native seal ie you are responsible

04:00.160 --> 04:05.260
for building the apps and therefore you need to do it locally on your machine and therefore due to Apple's

04:05.260 --> 04:10.320
restrictions you will not be able to build an ISIS app on Windows or Linux.

04:10.330 --> 04:12.630
So that's one thing to keep in mind there as well.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.820
So you do it all on your own there.

04:14.950 --> 04:20.320
So you need these tools installed and whilst you won't use them to write code you will need to fiddle

04:20.320 --> 04:27.360
around in them a bit and you will use them to then build your app and deploy it at the end these are

04:27.360 --> 04:29.830
the alternatives now for deployment.

04:29.830 --> 04:35.050
I'll have a separate module where I have a look at how that works with the managed workflow and also

04:35.050 --> 04:36.700
without the managed workflow.

04:36.820 --> 04:39.820
So that's not something I'll focus on in this module.

04:39.820 --> 04:45.130
Instead in this module I want to show you how you build an app with the react native CLIA how you also

04:45.140 --> 04:50.350
build it with expo in the bare workflow and how you can eject from the managed workflow to the bare

04:50.350 --> 04:51.280
workflow.

04:51.280 --> 04:56.560
We'll also have a look at how you can add some native device features in these two alternatives because

04:56.590 --> 05:00.390
that is the part where it mostly differs from the managed workflow.

05:00.540 --> 05:05.130
The way you write your components and so on and which components you use from reading native.

05:05.130 --> 05:10.710
That does not differ at all because there was nothing specific about expo in that put it in other words

05:10.710 --> 05:14.370
if we have a look at the project we worked on earlier in the course.

05:14.370 --> 05:20.100
This native module project is essentially what you'll lose when you're not using the managed workflow

05:20.460 --> 05:24.960
is all the expo related imports everything you're importing from expo.

05:25.080 --> 05:31.290
That basically is something which now is harder or which you now need to do differently.

05:31.290 --> 05:36.540
If you're not using Excel like a default such a file would not need to change at all.

05:36.540 --> 05:42.120
Only files where you use something from Expo need to be adjusted or need to be implemented differently

05:42.240 --> 05:48.190
when not using DB managed workflow or to be precise you might not be able to use certain packages anymore

05:48.270 --> 05:52.810
or you can still use them and you probably don't even need to touch your code at all.

05:52.920 --> 05:58.020
But in order to use them you need to do more manual setup work than you need to do with expo in the

05:58.020 --> 05:58.910
managed workflow.
