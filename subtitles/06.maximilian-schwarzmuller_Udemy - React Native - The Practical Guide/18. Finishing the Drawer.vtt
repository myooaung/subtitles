In the last lecture, we made our drawer work but on android it's not looking that great,

00:07.730 --> 00:11.910
that's why I've already imported a stylesheet in my side drawer component.

00:12.320 --> 00:21.080
I want to create my styles constant here and use the stylesheet to create my javascript object with

00:21.090 --> 00:22.530
styles I can use here,

00:22.730 --> 00:29.720
I want to create a container property there which holds the styles for this side drawer.

00:29.720 --> 00:36.760
Now the idea here is to add a margin to the top, maybe 22 pixels, without pixel just 22,

00:37.170 --> 00:43.430
maybe a background color of white so that we don't have this transparent drawer we currently have on android

00:44.390 --> 00:47.630
and with that, let's save this and assign it here.

00:47.630 --> 00:54.250
Now one trick if you want to combine multiple styles, you can pass an array to style,

00:54.380 --> 00:57.290
the first one can then be styles container for example,

00:57.320 --> 01:04.070
the second is your custom javascript object which I didn't put into my styles here so that it dynamically

01:04.070 --> 01:07.740
recalculates the width in case we rotate the device

01:08.240 --> 01:11.190
and with that, we get the style set up for the drawer.

01:11.390 --> 01:17.170
Now if we reload the Android app and we login again, we see a side drawer

01:17.210 --> 01:24.900
here, it is very tiny though, we can conveniently fix this by simply adding flex 1 to the container so

01:24.900 --> 01:28.050
that it takes the full available space.

01:28.050 --> 01:32.500
With that, if we now reload the app, login again and try this again,

01:32.790 --> 01:38.950
now we get a drawer, though the problem is with margin top, the whole drawer is pushed down,

01:39.180 --> 01:43.820
so the better solution might be to use padding top.

01:43.900 --> 01:49.610
So now with that finally, let's login and open that drawer

01:49.750 --> 01:54.270
and now we get a nice looking side drawer on Android too.

01:54.310 --> 01:58.720
Now we'll work on the styling of this item and make it more useful in the future,

01:58.780 --> 02:06.280
in general we'll improve the usefulness of this application and work a lot on the styling but the navigation

02:06.460 --> 02:07.540
got pretty far,

02:07.540 --> 02:09.700
we get a nice navigation in place,

02:09.760 --> 02:15.370
we get tabs, we get drawer, we can add item and then go into the detail page of the item

02:15.400 --> 02:19.960
but one thing that's missing is we can't open the drawer from our other page.

02:20.110 --> 02:28.390
Now as I told you, you have to implement this drawer toggle functionality on every page, so simply copy

02:28.390 --> 02:36.100
the constructor and the on navigator event code from the share place page and go to find place and simply

02:36.100 --> 02:38.390
add it at the top there.

02:38.410 --> 02:43.930
With that, we can save this and now reload this application

02:44.290 --> 02:49.180
and now the drawer should work both on find place and share place

02:49.570 --> 02:53.250
and of course it should also still work on iOS.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.560
So here it's on find place

02:55.660 --> 02:58.570
and here it's on share place.

02:58.570 --> 03:00.200
So that's all looking nice,

03:00.340 --> 03:02.800
let's see what else we can do with navigation.
