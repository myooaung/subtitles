WEBVTT

00:02.190 --> 00:05.630
Let's work on the orders screen before we add the navigation.

00:05.670 --> 00:07.920
We don't need to finish it but I want to be able to view it.

00:08.700 --> 00:15.300
So in there I important react from react so that I can build a valid react component imports something

00:15.300 --> 00:20.060
from React Native as always and that something is also what we're pretty much used to right.

00:20.060 --> 00:21.810
It's never dead surprising.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.050
We'll need a view.

00:23.370 --> 00:32.880
We'll probably need a flat list because we'll have multiple orders potentially an infinite amount and

00:32.880 --> 00:43.670
I want to build who rendered that and with that here we can build our orders screen like this.

00:43.790 --> 00:53.710
Also export does of course and styling shouldn't really be required here.

00:53.770 --> 01:01.570
Actually we shouldn't even need the view here because I just want to put my list of orders so of course

01:01.720 --> 01:04.350
the data we need here will come from redux.

01:04.360 --> 01:10.600
So we should import use selector from react redux which allows us to tap into the redux store.

01:11.350 --> 01:19.330
So here we can get our orders with the help of you selector and use selector now points at State DoD

01:19.390 --> 01:25.740
orders and that of course is the identifier I assigned here and combined with users orders here.

01:25.810 --> 01:29.680
This gives us access to the state slice managed by the orders reducer.

01:29.680 --> 01:34.040
And there we have a number of orders property which holds the actual array of orders.

01:34.060 --> 01:37.860
So here I need to access stated orders not orders in the end.

01:37.870 --> 01:41.070
That gives me my orders which are stored and Redux.

01:41.110 --> 01:48.640
Now here we just need to return our flat list and this receives orders which should be an array in which

01:48.640 --> 01:56.640
it is as data now a key extractor is not required in newer versions of React Native because each order

01:56.640 --> 02:01.520
if you have a look at the model has an idea and newer versions of react should be looking for that.

02:02.010 --> 02:09.780
But to be safe I'll add it here and render item now of course should hold a function that receives the

02:09.780 --> 02:16.440
item data that in the end returns whatever we want to render per order now order item will be more complex

02:16.440 --> 02:17.010
in the future.

02:17.010 --> 02:21.990
For now I'll just output some text again so that we quickly have something on the screen we can see

02:21.990 --> 02:23.670
before we refined this.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.650
The text here for the given item could be.

02:27.660 --> 02:32.590
And now let's have a look at the order there we have the idea we have two items which is he has not

02:32.580 --> 02:32.990
released.

02:33.000 --> 02:40.150
So the easiest thing to output is simply the amount so here I'll just output the total amount property

02:41.050 --> 02:44.380
which my order has here.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.050
This is what output in the flat list.

02:46.050 --> 02:48.360
Now we have a basic orders screen.

02:48.360 --> 02:55.550
Of course we now need to be able to reach that so let's go to the shop navigator and import the orders

02:55.610 --> 03:04.740
screen your orders screen from the screens folder from shop orders screen.

03:05.180 --> 03:11.630
And now here the important thing is I don't want to added to this stack navigator because it's not part

03:11.630 --> 03:12.590
of this stack.

03:12.590 --> 03:16.490
Instead I want to reach it with a menu with a side menu.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.840
So we'll need to build a draw navigator.

03:19.910 --> 03:24.430
Of course you could also work with taps if you prefer this but I want to work with the draw here.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.720
So we need that to draw our navigator.

03:26.750 --> 03:31.760
Now the orders screen even though it will be the only item it should be in its own stack though.

03:31.850 --> 03:34.490
So we also have a header there.

03:34.490 --> 03:45.550
Hence all create a new orders navigator here where I create a numbers stack navigator and they're the

03:45.550 --> 03:53.740
only mapping I need is orders which points at orders screen the second argument here should still set

03:53.740 --> 03:57.640
up some default navigation options and I'll use the same options as I do here.

03:57.970 --> 04:04.660
Hence I'll actually grab this object cut it out of here and store it in a separate constant default

04:04.700 --> 04:07.170
nav options like this.

04:08.550 --> 04:13.590
This is a pattern I also already used in the navigation module because now we can use this constant

04:13.590 --> 04:19.830
here in the product navigator for the default navigation options and also here new orders navigator.

04:19.830 --> 04:26.760
Now of course the goal is to create a draw or Navigator which I'll name shop navigator overall because

04:26.760 --> 04:29.160
it combines different shop features.

04:29.160 --> 04:36.260
You could say with the help of great create draw navigator dare I now want to merge these two stacks

04:36.270 --> 04:40.410
the products navigator and the orders navigator into it.

04:40.410 --> 04:48.300
So here we need the products with the products navigator and the orders pointing at the order as navigator.

04:48.330 --> 04:56.160
So at these stack navigators I also want to configure my content option stare on the draw does allows

04:56.160 --> 05:02.280
me to for example set to tint color of the items when they're selected then I want to set the act of

05:02.280 --> 05:11.680
tint color to colors dot primary so that they are colored with the primary color if they're selected.

05:11.710 --> 05:17.710
Now it's the shop navigator that should be returned here this alone won't do the trick but it's a first

05:17.710 --> 05:18.680
step.

05:18.730 --> 05:25.870
Now before we add the menu button let's go to the orders screen and they're actually add a title sold

05:25.900 --> 05:28.630
at navigation option stair.

05:28.630 --> 05:29.940
Set this to an object.

05:29.950 --> 05:35.680
Right now we need no dynamic options here because I just want to set the hider header title to your

05:35.680 --> 05:36.290
orders.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.620
And now did I think of that.

05:38.710 --> 05:42.670
We should also add this on the card screen where I'm not doing this yet there.

05:42.670 --> 05:48.520
I also want to set this on the card screen set this to your cart.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.200
So this is now in the card screen navigation options.

05:51.220 --> 05:57.270
This is in the orders screen or just navigator is setup with that all setup.

05:57.280 --> 06:04.000
We need to add this menu button this is hamburger icon for example on the products overview screen where

06:04.000 --> 06:09.220
I want to be able to open the drawer and go to my orders now to added there.

06:09.220 --> 06:13.780
Let's go to the navigation options of the product overview screen which is already dynamic which is

06:13.780 --> 06:14.550
good.

06:14.860 --> 06:21.070
And then besides adding header right for this cart I can let's add had left and had her left should

06:21.070 --> 06:29.100
hold header buttons as well of course but there it'll be my menu items sole name and such and there

06:29.220 --> 06:37.170
I want to use MDA menu or IOW menu depending on the platform we're running on and I want to navigate

06:37.170 --> 06:38.910
of course nowhere.

06:38.920 --> 06:46.150
Instead with the navigation prop here so to say I want to call toggled Ras which will open the side

06:46.160 --> 06:48.950
draw now dead.

06:48.950 --> 06:54.920
Same setup by the way is all the required in the orders screen so that we can leave that screen.

06:55.700 --> 07:01.820
So actually here we will Nat needs debt dynamics set up off the navigation options where we have a function

07:01.820 --> 07:09.020
here in which we return our config object so that in there we can also add had or left with the header

07:09.020 --> 07:15.170
buttons with our menu that targets draw which relies on the NAF data here and of course for that we

07:15.170 --> 07:22.910
need to import header buttons header button and item so on the product or review screen in the end I

07:22.910 --> 07:25.700
need to import these things here.

07:25.700 --> 07:30.860
These two lines need to be added to the orders screen as well.

07:30.860 --> 07:32.700
So there let me add it.

07:32.840 --> 07:39.020
Adding the header buttons and item import from react navigation header buttons and the header button

07:39.020 --> 07:45.300
import from our custom component now with that if we save this we should have a menu button here and

07:45.300 --> 07:52.410
we do it opens the door we can go to orders and I get an error here because in the order screen of course

07:52.890 --> 07:55.560
I'm using the platform API so we should import it there.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.400
Let's do that let's add platform.

07:58.400 --> 08:08.170
And now if you go back we can go to order as there we also can go back and to say Mr. Case on Android

08:10.060 --> 08:12.160
now with Dad we added the draw.

08:12.160 --> 08:15.400
There is one thing I want to add to the draw though which I haven't done before.

08:15.400 --> 08:21.940
Before I continue working on my orders list were we're not outputting yet anything yet because we're

08:22.240 --> 08:28.570
not really adding drawer orders we haven't connected this order now button yet where we're not seeing

08:28.570 --> 08:33.180
anything though that changes if we do add something to the cart click order now.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.810
Once clicking it multiple times will get given you an error right now.

08:37.860 --> 08:41.140
Then we see that order here that we'll need to clear the cards.

08:41.140 --> 08:45.940
That's number of thing we need to do but before we do that in the drawer I actually always want to have

08:46.030 --> 08:51.340
icons next to my entries here and adding these icons is actually very simple.

08:51.340 --> 08:57.640
Haven't done doesn't in the navigation module but we'll do it now to add icons you just need to go to

08:57.640 --> 08:59.920
the screens you're navigating to in your drawer.

08:59.920 --> 09:04.990
In our case that's of course these two navigators so these are not screens but these two navigators

09:05.440 --> 09:11.200
and all these navigators or if they were screens on these screens you can set navigation options and

09:11.200 --> 09:17.230
with that I don't mean the default navigation options you set for all screens off that navigator but

09:17.230 --> 09:23.080
you set for this navigator if it's used inside of a never Navigator as it's the case here.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.020
So we can't add navigation options here.

09:25.030 --> 09:29.320
Again this will not be applied to the screens of this navigator but instead this will configure this

09:29.320 --> 09:32.550
navigator if it's a screen offered no navigator.

09:32.740 --> 09:39.700
And here are the orders Navigator is a screen of the shop navigator in the end and there in these navigation

09:39.700 --> 09:50.140
options we can add a draw icon and tree which can be a function that gets let's say to draw a config

09:51.150 --> 09:56.890
does function called for you by RAC navigation and it gives you destroyer conflict which most importantly

09:56.890 --> 10:03.870
tells you for example what your tint color is because here you can now return a component like in New

10:03.880 --> 10:10.630
Orleans component to render an icon for Dad you just need to make sure you're importing ionic pins from

10:11.200 --> 10:12.780
at Expo vector icons.

10:12.790 --> 10:16.650
So you need to add that import into shop navigator file.

10:16.780 --> 10:23.770
Now with that added If we go down here I'm returning my ionic and now I can configure it as I always

10:23.770 --> 10:24.640
did this.

10:24.850 --> 10:30.720
And for Dad again we can use the platform API which we are already importing here if you're not.

10:30.730 --> 10:39.340
Make sure you do we can use that to check your operating system and if it's equal to Android then here

10:39.790 --> 10:43.820
I will render M.D. create as I can.

10:43.820 --> 10:49.820
Otherwise I w create there's just when I can I picked in advance.

10:49.850 --> 10:56.640
Now of course we can also configure the size here and I'll stick to my good ole 30 at 23.

10:56.760 --> 11:02.130
And in addition to that said a color if you wish to add now of course that should not be colors primary

11:02.190 --> 11:07.620
because Dennis icon would always have to add color instead this color should be assigned by the draw

11:07.710 --> 11:13.310
which is the thing that knows if the item is selected or not and which will change the color appropriately.

11:13.380 --> 11:16.570
So here you should access draw a conflict or tint color.

11:16.680 --> 11:22.110
And this tells you which color dish should have at the moment and distinct color will change depending

11:22.110 --> 11:24.330
on whether this is currently selected or not.

11:25.370 --> 11:29.350
Now that's the case for my orders.

11:29.540 --> 11:30.470
Excuse me.

11:30.580 --> 11:39.080
The I can here should DMD list and I w list not create so that's my order setup now with the list icons

11:39.440 --> 11:46.130
of course the same thing can be done here by copying it over on the products navigator and there I want

11:46.130 --> 11:54.490
to use empty cart where I w card so this card icon again and now does is almost ready to be used one

11:54.490 --> 11:59.500
thing you need to do however is you need to import react from react.

11:59.500 --> 12:06.610
Now in this navigator file because now you are using components with that J.S. syntax as you know j

12:06.610 --> 12:14.260
as Xs comp. or converted to react create element in the end and therefore you need to import react for

12:14.260 --> 12:16.190
this syntax to work here.

12:16.510 --> 12:21.850
Now with Dad if you go back you have these nice icons here next to your items that they're all the colored

12:21.850 --> 12:23.230
correctly.

12:23.230 --> 12:26.020
Also here on Android of course.

12:26.020 --> 12:32.110
So now that's the side draw finished we can also go to the orders screen and we can even see an order

12:32.110 --> 12:32.920
there.

12:32.920 --> 12:37.450
However right now the card does not cleared and therefore if you click this multiple times you'll actually

12:37.450 --> 12:42.520
get a warning because then what you do is you click this too fast and hence you create multiple orders

12:42.790 --> 12:48.700
with the same pseudo unique I.D. where we in the end use the current timestamp if you click us too fast

12:48.700 --> 12:50.770
multiple times it's the same timestamp.

12:50.860 --> 12:56.110
That's why this warning is coming and I would want to clear the card after placing an order anyways

12:56.860 --> 13:02.050
so let's make sure we do clear the card after placing an order and then of course let's make sure we

13:02.110 --> 13:04.930
output the orders in a nice way than we currently do.
