WEBVTT

00:02.190 --> 00:07.590
To add the action item to the header I'll do something which I did in the navigation section as well

00:07.800 --> 00:09.480
in the components folder.

00:09.660 --> 00:11.470
I want to add my own header button.

00:11.550 --> 00:17.160
And now for this I'll add a new sub folder in there which I'll name you I add my idea here is simple

00:17.580 --> 00:23.340
I have to shop folder which holds all the components that I use in my shop that output some shop related

00:23.340 --> 00:30.090
information in the UI folder I want have some general UI building blocks which I'll of course also use

00:30.090 --> 00:35.580
in this shop application but which are not really focused on outputting shop or product related data

00:35.610 --> 00:42.240
but which are simply dare to provide some default styling or layout and it's in this UI folder where

00:42.270 --> 00:51.680
I will add my own header button like going in there and importing react from react and then importing

00:53.540 --> 01:02.330
header button from react navigation header buttons this package I installed at the beginning of the

01:02.330 --> 01:10.370
module if you haven't done this make sure you NPM installed as package and then also import ionic pins

01:11.090 --> 01:15.760
from at Expo vector icons.

01:15.850 --> 01:23.640
To be super sure that you have that installed run npm install dash to save at Expo the vector icon so

01:23.640 --> 01:26.220
that this package is a way lable in your project.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.070
These are the imports I need here.

01:28.110 --> 01:35.990
Now I also want to import my colors from the Constance folder and there two colors jazz file and now

01:35.990 --> 01:43.880
in here I'll add my custom header button component which is a normal react component in the end that

01:43.880 --> 01:51.390
receives props and needs to return some J as X and I will of course export my custom header button here

01:51.390 --> 01:51.830
in the end.

01:52.560 --> 01:58.020
And now the jazz exit is returned here is the header button I'm importing from react navigation header

01:58.020 --> 02:05.090
buttons but I have to configure it in a certain way loops use the header button here from HREOC NAPE

02:05.190 --> 02:10.280
navigation header buttons for one does should receives all the props we get here.

02:10.280 --> 02:15.310
So we just forward those but an additional set my I can component here too.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.460
Are you mannequins so that we always use eye on icons for rendering that.

02:18.470 --> 02:24.670
And of course you could use one of the different vector icon sets provided by Expo vector icons as well.

02:24.860 --> 02:30.800
I'll set the icon size to 20 free which I found to work out really well but of course you can experiment

02:30.800 --> 02:33.140
with different values here as well.

02:33.140 --> 02:40.370
Also maybe if you're using a different I can set try out a different icon size and forward colour.

02:40.490 --> 02:41.990
Well there it depends.

02:41.990 --> 02:47.150
Because on Android we have like a red background here for IOW we haven't.

02:47.150 --> 02:50.680
So we need to set a different color based on the platform we're running on.

02:50.780 --> 02:59.760
So actually import the platform from React Native here and then we can check the platform here.

02:59.870 --> 03:01.870
Nifty OS version is Android.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.970
Dan I know I have this solid field background.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.820
For the icon should be white when I was on the other hand the background is not filled it's transparent

03:11.120 --> 03:19.090
and therefore on I was all actually set my eye can color two colors start primary.

03:19.150 --> 03:26.980
Now we can use that to add I can hear on the product overview screen there in my navigation options

03:26.980 --> 03:27.490
here.

03:27.490 --> 03:35.800
I want to add my header right section so I can on the right of my header and for that here we need to

03:35.800 --> 03:42.610
import a couple of things we need to import Hatter buttons and item from the react navigation header

03:42.610 --> 03:44.660
buttons package we installed.

03:44.800 --> 03:53.780
I of course also need to import my own Hatter button from components UI header buttons sodas component

03:53.780 --> 04:03.720
we just worked in and now down there header right is header buttons as a wrapper to possibly have multiple

04:04.140 --> 04:10.950
items in there but I will only add one item as self closing element on header buttons before we continue

04:10.950 --> 04:17.430
with the item we have to set the header button component equal to to header buttons so to our own header

04:17.430 --> 04:23.820
button here and the item can now be configured it should receive a title which can be card it should

04:23.820 --> 04:24.290
receive.

04:24.340 --> 04:28.840
I can name and I actually want to use a different icon based on the platform we're running on.

04:28.980 --> 04:34.590
So they offer from React Native I will import platform that is optional you could use one and the same

04:34.590 --> 04:39.270
icon for both platforms but I think it also looks good to have different icons.

04:39.270 --> 04:47.820
And then here I'll check platform OS and if that's Android then I want to use the MDA card icon which

04:47.820 --> 04:54.360
is the ionic and card icon for lower material design and Album wise I'll use the Iaw card icon and again

04:54.360 --> 04:57.140
you can find all available icons in this icons list.

04:57.240 --> 05:03.540
I showed you earlier in the course the expo vector icon icons list and last but not least when the item

05:03.540 --> 05:09.000
gets pressed we probably want to do something and for now I don't do anything but we'll changed as soon

05:11.260 --> 05:12.850
if we know as we should see this.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.500
I can hear.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.220
Here it is here's our card.

05:15.280 --> 05:21.250
Also on Android and now we just have to make sure that when we tapped as we are taken to our a card

05:21.340 --> 05:27.250
screen for Dead of course we have to add some logic or some some output to the card screen.

05:27.880 --> 05:31.610
So instead of the card screen we of course have a normal react component.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.070
So we import react from react.

05:34.090 --> 05:43.420
We also import something from react native and that's something is a view component to wrap our screen.

05:43.540 --> 05:48.120
Maybe we'll probably output some text as well.

05:48.380 --> 05:54.780
We'll have a couple of card items being listed there which we can do with a flat list to have optimisation

05:54.800 --> 06:01.580
built in probably one to style some things with a style sheet and I'll also import the built in button

06:01.670 --> 06:11.060
component now my card screen here as always is a react component and I'll set up this stalls object

06:11.060 --> 06:16.910
here with style sheet create so that we can install this component as well and in the end we export

06:17.000 --> 06:21.030
our card screen here as a default.

06:21.070 --> 06:24.930
Now you can of course built this card screen in whatever way you want.

06:24.940 --> 06:32.640
I will build it such that we have a view and in that view I want to have two main sections to the topmost

06:32.640 --> 06:37.660
sections like the summary where I see the total amount and where I have to order now button.

06:37.980 --> 06:43.050
This will be in one row so I will have a nested view here where I can position items next to each other

06:43.590 --> 06:46.810
where I have like a text write say.

06:46.810 --> 06:55.240
Total and then here dollar sign and then my my total price maybe we can also nest this.

06:55.250 --> 07:03.620
You can have nested text components if you remember without issues to give us a separate color for example.

07:03.620 --> 07:08.670
So for now I a hard code nineteen ninety nine in there but later it will be derived dynamically.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.330
So that's one thing.

07:10.430 --> 07:18.610
And in addition in that same row here I want to have a button with a title of order.

07:18.700 --> 07:26.120
Now where I can press a two well-placed in order clear my cart and add this to my orders which we have

07:26.120 --> 07:28.750
yet to manage and output it in on the order screen.

07:28.760 --> 07:38.200
In the end now below this summary section I want to have a flat list with my separate card items so

07:38.200 --> 07:39.960
that we can really see what's in the card.

07:39.970 --> 07:43.360
Which products are in there how much of each product is in there.

07:43.360 --> 07:47.860
So that's another thing I will output there for the moment here.

07:47.860 --> 07:52.090
I'll just add a view with a text of card items as a place holder.

07:52.090 --> 07:57.660
But again this will be a flat list in the future but let's start with the total here to get that total.

07:57.660 --> 08:04.780
We can tap into redux because there we are managing our card so we can use use selector firm react redux

08:04.780 --> 08:10.810
as you learn to get data out of our store and here I have my card.

08:11.010 --> 08:21.360
Total amount maybe which I get with the help of use selector from my state DOT card slice Dot card here

08:21.390 --> 08:27.030
because in the app chairs file in combined reduced rates I assigned a key of card here to my card reducer

08:29.060 --> 08:33.160
so here I have dot card and then there insert of the card reducer.

08:33.380 --> 08:40.780
I manage my total amount the total amount field so that's what we need to access here total amount.

08:40.800 --> 08:45.570
This gives the card total amount that we can now use Dad down there.

08:45.730 --> 08:49.820
And with that to ensure that dissolves looks good it's time for some styling.

08:49.910 --> 08:56.450
So on the topmost view here l I'll add a style of screen maybe because this wraps the entire screen

08:56.450 --> 08:57.680
in the end.

08:57.680 --> 09:03.820
Then here on that view I'll add a style of summary because that holds all the summary items.

09:03.920 --> 09:07.130
Then here on this text I'll add a style of

09:09.710 --> 09:20.790
summary text and then here I'll add a style of amount so that we can style this amount text differently

09:22.270 --> 09:23.930
so for styles I want to set.

09:23.950 --> 09:34.840
Let's go down to the style sheet and add screen summary summary text and then also what did a name it

09:35.300 --> 09:41.820
amount and of course it's as always totally up to you how you now want a stylus.

09:41.820 --> 09:47.400
Now I'll start with the screen in the end I want to take the full size of the screen if we need to with

09:47.400 --> 09:54.420
the flatness later but I will start simple and we'll just say that I want have a margin in all directions

09:54.420 --> 10:03.390
actually here of 20 so around everything so that there is some space around everything then here.

10:03.390 --> 10:09.210
Summary which is our box with all the items in there with the order now but then our text should use

10:09.210 --> 10:12.820
a flex directional row to position items in well one row.

10:12.870 --> 10:19.950
I went to a line items in the center to make sure they're centered vertically and on their main axis

10:20.040 --> 10:28.670
I want to use justified content space between so that items have the free space between them and items.

10:28.670 --> 10:35.040
Are this text here and this button besides Dad we can add a little bit of margin here.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.360
Maybe all of 20.

10:36.360 --> 10:42.540
Which is mostly important also to have some spacing between the summary and our flat list several actually

10:42.540 --> 10:49.990
use margin bottom year to only have some margin to the bottom and I want to add a padding of 10 year

10:49.990 --> 10:55.030
because the summary should be kind of in an elevated box.

10:55.030 --> 11:05.050
And for this box here I'll go to my product item component and all copy my shadow set up here and the

11:05.770 --> 11:12.030
border radius maybe I have here and the background color so that I have the same look here in the cart.

11:12.040 --> 11:16.020
And that's of course up to you whether you want that or not but I'll copy that in there.

11:17.420 --> 11:27.410
For the summary text I now want to use a font family of open Sands bold to really highlight this total

11:27.980 --> 11:33.290
and a fun size of 18 and for the amount text in there.

11:33.290 --> 11:36.880
I'll set the color two colors dot X and color.

11:36.890 --> 11:44.160
Now for that important of course you need to import colors from the constants folder that I use axiom

11:44.150 --> 11:50.710
The not primary to really have to stand out to see whether it looks the way we want it to look.

11:50.710 --> 11:55.660
We need to make sure that's tapping this header button in our product overview screen actually takes

11:55.660 --> 11:59.520
us to the card screen and for that two things are required.

11:59.800 --> 12:04.510
For one we need to navigate here but before we can do that we need to register a card screen in our

12:04.510 --> 12:11.890
navigator so we'll do that first tell import my card screen here from the screens folder unsurprisingly

12:11.890 --> 12:17.980
from the shop folder and there from card screen and now that's the third screen I add here to this stack.

12:17.980 --> 12:26.350
Navigator card points at card screen with that setup added here we can go back to the product overview

12:26.350 --> 12:33.220
screen and there we now need that functional form for the navigation options because naff data then

12:33.220 --> 12:37.670
allows us to tap into the navigation prop and call navigate.

12:37.990 --> 12:41.240
Hence we need to wrap this in another object which we return.

12:41.300 --> 12:50.610
And then here we can call NAF data dot navigation dot navigate and there I go to cart and this of course

12:50.700 --> 12:54.950
is the identifier I just picked in the shop navigator here.

12:55.050 --> 12:58.530
This one with that.

12:58.580 --> 13:01.050
Let's see if I click here.

13:01.050 --> 13:01.740
There we are.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.030
This is my total.

13:03.030 --> 13:06.610
I actually think the axon color isn't that great there.

13:06.780 --> 13:13.170
So I'll actually go back to the card screen and stalled is to use the primary color as well.

13:15.490 --> 13:22.060
But the main thing is we can go there and if I now try to add items to the card I add at the shirt twice

13:22.060 --> 13:29.400
and the carpet once that total amount looks good to me that's all I've tried is on Android of course

13:29.400 --> 13:35.700
to make sure it works there as well and generally works I add one more red shirt and therefore here

13:35.700 --> 13:41.730
we also see an issue with the the way this is displayed to fixed is on the card screen make sure that

13:41.760 --> 13:48.600
on the price we always just output two decimal places on amount with two fixed to now by the way in

13:48.600 --> 13:51.350
case you're wondering where does what's coming from this long no.

13:51.540 --> 13:57.150
This is no bag or nothing really to react native does this normal javascript behavior when you're working

13:57.150 --> 14:05.080
with floating point numbers and of course to fix should not be called on the style here but on the card

14:05.110 --> 14:11.440
total amount so this was a normal behavior not a back does is how javascript internally kind of stories

14:11.440 --> 14:18.530
floating point numbers you could say but now we make sure that this is output correctly with two decimal

14:18.530 --> 14:29.830
places missing thing is the button and here I now actually want to use color colors accent to have my

14:30.760 --> 14:37.190
accent colored button so if I now go to my card here and I w does how the button looks like they're

14:38.920 --> 14:41.500
this is now how he looks like an android.

14:41.590 --> 14:46.690
We can always press this of course I want to disable it though if there is nothing in the cart.

14:46.990 --> 14:55.090
And for Dad we now need to get our card items as well so card items can also be fetched with use selector.

14:55.090 --> 15:01.320
Also from the card slice but there it's the items prop from the card reducer we're interested interested

15:01.320 --> 15:09.150
in so if I have a look at the card reducer dare you see we have the items property.

15:09.310 --> 15:11.260
This is an object which I'm retrieving now.

15:11.270 --> 15:18.280
So card items is an object not an array actually an array would be better for me here though and therefore

15:18.370 --> 15:25.750
I'll use the long form forgetting this and I will return an array here and not an object so we can get

15:25.750 --> 15:36.260
our trends for and card items here for example by creating a new array here inside of this selector

15:36.260 --> 15:43.910
function and then we can add a for in loop to go for all the keys in state DOT card dot items so to

15:43.910 --> 15:47.120
loop for all the key value pairs in this card.

15:47.120 --> 15:51.200
Items object we have in there and I want to add each of them.

15:52.950 --> 16:01.030
As a item to the transformed card items so there I will push a javascript object which has a product

16:01.060 --> 16:06.850
I.D. let's say which is just my key because an ID card items object the product I.D. is stored as a

16:06.850 --> 16:07.930
key if you remember.

16:07.930 --> 16:14.320
So now I add this to the product I.D. property and this object I add to the transformed card items array

16:15.300 --> 16:27.240
and besides that I'll have my product title which is of course state DOT card dot items for the given

16:27.240 --> 16:30.550
key dot product title.

16:30.650 --> 16:37.900
If you have a look at your card item model you'll see that their product title and product price are

16:37.900 --> 16:41.510
the property names that hold the product title and product price.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.570
So that's how we access both.

16:43.570 --> 16:49.790
So I'll do the same here for the product price and thereafter I also need to quantity which is state

16:49.790 --> 16:58.770
DOT card dot items for two given key dot quantity and of course all the the sum which is state DOT card

16:58.770 --> 17:05.640
dot items dot key dot some again basically just what we had here the card item.

17:05.640 --> 17:10.260
So what I'm doing is so to say I'm creating a new card item not with my model though because it's a

17:10.260 --> 17:17.690
card item with an additional product I.D. property so that I have to sit in here and now it's just transfer

17:17.690 --> 17:24.300
him card items that ray which I return after this for loop so that disk selector and the and returns

17:24.330 --> 17:25.850
an array and not an object.

17:26.040 --> 17:32.760
So card items is now an array which makes it easier for us to use it in the flat list and it also allows

17:32.760 --> 17:38.730
us to check here on the order now button whenever we want to disable it by simply checking the length

17:39.210 --> 17:41.000
of this array.

17:41.010 --> 17:42.720
We now have card items.

17:43.170 --> 17:49.260
So here on the button we can set the disabled prop which it supports thankfully there's a built in component

17:49.260 --> 17:56.790
which simply has a disabled prop and there I can check if card items length is equal to zero if it is

17:56.790 --> 18:01.650
then I know it's empty and then indeed I want to disable the button so disabled receives true or false

18:01.730 --> 18:08.020
by default it's false but I'll set it to true if card items length is 0 and now you see if I go to the

18:08.020 --> 18:16.800
card screen does this disabled if I add a product though when I go there it's enabled and of course

18:16.890 --> 18:20.540
you could also use a different colour for the order now button if you want to.

18:20.550 --> 18:26.580
Now with that we're one step closer to the finished cards and of course the next goal is to output the

18:26.580 --> 18:27.510
card items.
