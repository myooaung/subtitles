00:02.290 --> 00:06.820
I added the code to successfully dispatch an action upon logging in,

00:06.910 --> 00:13.300
now I want to make sure that our second button, this one switch to login, that it does something, something

00:13.300 --> 00:19.100
else than just throwing this alert. In the end the goal is to have a toggle button here,

00:19.120 --> 00:24.670
if we are in sign up mode which we are by default here, I want to go to login mode and the other way

00:24.670 --> 00:25.460
around.

00:25.840 --> 00:32.440
So for this, one thing is that we only want to render the confirm password button, so only render this

00:32.530 --> 00:40.810
view here essentially if we are in sign up mode, so what I'll do is scroll all the way up to our state

00:41.520 --> 00:50.290
and I'll add a new state here which I'll name auth mode and by default let's say that this is actually login

00:50.440 --> 00:52.410
and not sign up.

00:52.470 --> 00:58.700
So this is our default auth mode, we now need a handler that is fired whenever we click this switch button,

00:58.740 --> 01:04.020
so I'll add it here, switch auth mode

01:04.240 --> 01:06.510
handler would be a name that makes sense

01:07.270 --> 01:15.140
and in there, we create a simple toggle function, we call this set state and I will use the function for

01:15.140 --> 01:19.420
more of it because I will need to find out what the previous state was

01:19.910 --> 01:27.800
and in here, I'll return my javascript object where I'll set auth mode equal to and now we use the previous

01:27.800 --> 01:30.580
state and see what the previous auth mode was

01:30.710 --> 01:36.090
and if it was login, then I want to switch auth mode to sign up

01:36.140 --> 01:38.830
otherwise it seems we are in sign up mode,

01:38.930 --> 01:42.210
I want to go back to login then.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.880
With that, we can go down and also hook up our button,

01:46.210 --> 01:53.860
so if we scroll down to our button here which should be used for this, I will no longer trigger this alert,

01:53.860 --> 01:59.470
I will instead bind this to this switch auth mode handler.

01:59.910 --> 02:04.290
Now of course it shouldn't say switch to login if we are in login mode,

02:04.470 --> 02:09.560
so here I'll instead output something dynamic, I'll check this state auth mode,

02:09.900 --> 02:18.110
if it's equal to login, then here I will output sign up because we want to switch into sign up mode

02:18.140 --> 02:24.200
then otherwise we'll say login. And we also have to change something else

02:24.200 --> 02:28.670
but first of all let's see if this works and this works fine.

02:28.670 --> 02:31.030
Now of course switching that button is one thing,

02:31.100 --> 02:38.480
I also want to make sure that we change our controls appropriately and there, it might look like we only

02:38.480 --> 02:41.640
need to wrap the confirm control here,

02:41.720 --> 02:44.130
it's one part but it's not all

02:44.390 --> 02:53.360
so what I will do is I will actually add a new checkup here, I'll add a new variable confirm password

02:54.780 --> 02:58.090
control and set it to null and then I'll add

02:58.110 --> 03:09.670
an if check here, if this state auth mode is equal to sign up, then confirm password control should actually

03:09.750 --> 03:11.810
actually be equal to that view

03:11.820 --> 03:12.590
that wraps it

03:12.600 --> 03:12.870
right,

03:12.870 --> 03:18.960
so here we got this view which wraps confirm password control,

03:18.960 --> 03:24.650
this is what I'll assign as a value to this variable then.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.460
So this is confirm password control,

03:26.460 --> 03:32.070
this should now be used here at the bottom where we previously had our confirm password control, so right

03:32.070 --> 03:33.580
after this view here,

03:38.080 --> 03:42.410
so that now if we save everything and we go back, we only see two inputs

03:42.580 --> 03:44.170
but if I switch we see three

03:44.200 --> 03:45.120
and now two

03:45.190 --> 03:46.900
and now we can switch.

03:47.380 --> 03:54.280
However there is one more thing which might not be as easy to see, what if we rotate? We got a responsive

03:54.320 --> 04:00.010
design but here if I switch, this looks a bit strange, it would be better if this takes the full width

04:00.130 --> 04:02.880
if we are in sign up mode and landscape.

04:03.340 --> 04:14.480
So if we go back, we got our styling here for our password container and then for the password wrapper

04:15.100 --> 04:22.480
and we actually need to change this, not only depending on the view mode but also depending on whether

04:22.540 --> 04:25.860
we are in sign up mode or in login mode.

04:26.070 --> 04:29.150
Now you can solve this with a relatively long ternary expression,

04:29.170 --> 04:32.110
you can nest another ternary expression in this case here

04:32.290 --> 04:35.190
so that you check if this really should be applied,

04:35.410 --> 04:43.000
so here you could check if this state auth mode is equal to sign up because only then you want

04:43.000 --> 04:46.920
to attach the landscape container, otherwise it would be the portrait one

04:47.080 --> 04:51.300
but I'm not a fan of these super long ternary expressions,

04:51.610 --> 04:56.890
so what you can also do is you can take advantage of the fact that we only got login or sign up,

04:56.890 --> 05:00.960
you can go to this main condition here and there, we are checking if we're in portrait mode.

05:01.270 --> 05:05.920
That's one criteria but we could also check here are we in portrait mode

05:06.070 --> 05:08.910
or is this state auth mode

05:10.430 --> 05:17.270
login because if it's login, then we don't care about whether we are in portrait mode or not, we'll

05:17.330 --> 05:20.300
always use the portrait container.

05:20.330 --> 05:28.090
So this is what we can use, this is what I'll copy and what I'll add to my wrapper here too.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.570
Now if we save this and we reload,

05:30.660 --> 05:31.550
this looks good,

05:31.550 --> 05:35.930
if I switch to sign up, then it split up so we automatically get the right look then

05:36.320 --> 05:39.150
and it's fully responsive again

05:39.260 --> 05:45.830
but now we got this switch button to work correctly. Now with the working switch button,

05:45.830 --> 05:49.530
we also have to revisit our check for submitting this though,

05:49.670 --> 05:51.320
here the submit button,

05:51.320 --> 05:56.260
we disable it if either confirm password, email or password is invalid.

05:56.480 --> 06:02.660
Now if we're in login mode, confirm password is always invalid because we never get a chance of setting

06:02.660 --> 06:04.880
it to valid because we don't use it,

06:04.880 --> 06:15.240
so this here is only relevant if we actually start in or if we are in the sign up mode.

06:15.230 --> 06:21.570
So therefore here, we should fine tune this and say this whole button should be disabled

06:21.770 --> 06:35.360
if email or password is invalid or if this is invalid but only if we also have this state auth mode equal

06:35.360 --> 06:37.660
to sign up because otherwise this doesn't count.

06:38.430 --> 06:46.210
So with that if we reload, if we are in login mode and we enter something valid, this gets enabled,

06:46.210 --> 06:50.090
if we switch to sign up though, we need all three.

06:50.260 --> 06:51.310
So that is an improvement

06:51.310 --> 06:52.540
we definitely have to add.
