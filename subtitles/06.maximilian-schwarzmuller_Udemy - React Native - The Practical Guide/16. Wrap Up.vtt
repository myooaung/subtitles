00:02.160 --> 00:09.270
So this was another big module but you now know how you can pick an image or take an image, here only

00:09.270 --> 00:11.170
one of the two works on the simulator

00:11.180 --> 00:18.510
but this proves best that both works actually I guess. You learned how you can locate yourself and pick

00:18.600 --> 00:29.160
a location and then how you can use all that data to also view what you picked here in a nice responsive

00:29.160 --> 00:35.250
way on the place detail page. With that the application is really looking nice, really looking beautiful

00:35.250 --> 00:38.450
and I think this image in this place fits perfectly.

00:38.640 --> 00:45.930
So now let's continue to the next module to learn how we can finally leave our local device and send

00:46.020 --> 00:54.150
all that data over the wire to some server to store our location and our image and so on there, so that

00:54.150 --> 00:55.490
we can always load it

00:55.530 --> 01:03.630
and also and that is the idea behind this app, load the places of other people, so that we can see whatever

01:03.630 --> 01:10.660
someone else created, can view it and find it here and see which beautiful places other people got to share.
