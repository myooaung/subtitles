So we want to send the request to this server here, for this,

00:06.310 --> 00:12.130
you can visit the react native docs and if you click on networking under the basics, you'll find how

00:12.130 --> 00:14.560
you can send network requests to

00:14.590 --> 00:21.250
as I said restful APIs. What you can use and what I will use is fetch API,

00:21.370 --> 00:25.680
Now you may know that the fetch API is a browser API,

00:25.720 --> 00:33.220
so in a web browser you can also use this to send behind the scenes requests to a server, so called Ajax

00:33.220 --> 00:34.030
requests

00:34.030 --> 00:40.840
though technically the fetch API is basically the more modern way of doing that. In case you want to use

00:40.840 --> 00:45.720
your favorite javascript Ajax library like axios or something like that,

00:45.760 --> 00:50.920
you could also use that in react native though because react native does not only support the fetch

00:50.920 --> 00:58.940
API but also the older xml http request API which axios uses behind the scenes, so you can absolutely

00:58.940 --> 01:00.490
also use that

01:00.670 --> 01:04.270
and additionally, you can also use web sockets if you have that.

01:04.330 --> 01:08.410
Now I don't have web sockets, I don't have the xml http request,

01:08.530 --> 01:13.620
I will use this fetch API and you can find how it works on this page,

01:13.630 --> 01:19.540
you can also click on this link to be taken to the MDN, Mozilla Developer Network page about it

01:19.780 --> 01:26.080
to dive even deeper into it. Now what the fetch API simply does is it allows us to send a request,

01:26.220 --> 01:29.980
either a get request like this or with more configuration,

01:30.040 --> 01:36.020
all kinds of other requests like here, a post request but we will do this together.

01:36.340 --> 01:43.330
So this is what we will use, this is the client we will use in our application, in our react native app,

01:43.540 --> 01:46.550
the question just is where do we do this,

01:46.630 --> 01:48.390
do we do this in the shared place.js

01:48.490 --> 01:54.700
file, here place added handler where we currently dispatch an action, is that where we also store it on

01:54.700 --> 02:00.970
a server? Because we obviously not only want to store it on our local redux store, we want to store it

02:00.970 --> 02:01.820
on a server too,

02:01.840 --> 02:03.310
so is that the place?

02:03.910 --> 02:07.630
Well the place should be in the action creator,

02:07.720 --> 02:14.680
if you have worked with redux before in a normal react app, you know that any side effects, any asynchronous

02:14.680 --> 02:17.530
code should go into the action creator,

02:17.530 --> 02:21.280
so here places.js. There there in add place,

02:21.280 --> 02:23.130
I indeed would want to do this,

02:23.170 --> 02:30.340
here we get all the place data and this is where I want to use that data to store it on a server and

02:30.340 --> 02:35.010
thereafter, we can always decide what we want to do with it on our frontend

02:35.200 --> 02:41.890
but for example we dont really need to manage our places list here anymore because we're probably

02:41.890 --> 02:48.210
going to add some other logic to fetch places from the server anyways. But let's do one after the other.

02:48.400 --> 02:56.380
Let's first of all learn how we can actually use add place to send the request. We'll start into this in

02:56.380 --> 02:57.520
the next lecture.
