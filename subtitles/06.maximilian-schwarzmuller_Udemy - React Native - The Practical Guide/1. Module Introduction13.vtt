After a lot of work on debugging, adding redux and all these things, you learned a lot about how to work

00:08.980 --> 00:10.620
with react native apps.

00:10.630 --> 00:16.960
Now I want to go back into the code, I want to show you another important piece of the overall react native

00:16.960 --> 00:20.200
puzzle, how you can add third party libraries

00:20.410 --> 00:21.760
and actually we already did this,

00:21.760 --> 00:29.800
we added redux for example but I mean libraries that provide native code features so that give you access

00:29.800 --> 00:35.380
to some native device features which are not baked into react native because if you have a look at

00:35.380 --> 00:41.260
the react native documentation, you'll see it ships with quite some components but it doesn't cover everything

00:41.260 --> 00:47.290
you can do on a phone. For example, later in this course we'll add something like maps which is not built

00:47.290 --> 00:51.340
into react native so that we can access google maps. In this module,

00:51.370 --> 00:58.720
I'll show you how to add such third party libraries, add the example of a library that exposes some icons

00:58.720 --> 01:05.860
to us so that we can use some icons in our app. React native doesn't include any icons, so we can use

01:05.860 --> 01:12.700
that library I'm going to show you to still add some and connecting libraries that reach out to native

01:12.700 --> 01:16.320
code features as this library will is always a bit special

01:16.330 --> 01:20.760
but in the end, not that complicated and I will show you how it works in this module.

01:20.770 --> 01:22.830
So with that, let's just get started.
