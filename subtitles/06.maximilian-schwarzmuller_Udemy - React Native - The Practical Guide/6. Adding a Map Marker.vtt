In the last lecture we made sure that we can click the map and also then center to it

00:07.250 --> 00:12.380
but now I want to render a marker at the position where we clicked, so that we actually have some visual

00:12.380 --> 00:17.750
feedback about well where we're currently at. For this,

00:18.040 --> 00:26.820
I will add a new property to my state here and I'll add it next to focus location not inside of it, I'll

00:26.860 --> 00:34.270
name it location chosen because I only want to display a marker if the user did pick a location,

00:34.270 --> 00:41.980
so initially I'll set it to false, I'll set it to true here in pick location handler then, so location chosen is

00:41.980 --> 00:47.590
set to true here because now we did pick one and I want to use that to determine whether to render a

00:47.590 --> 00:48.940
marker or not.

00:49.330 --> 00:56.330
So in the render function, I'll add a marker variable which I'll set to null initially and then I'll add

00:56.380 --> 01:02.710
an if check where I see if this state location chosen is true because only then I want to show the marker,

01:04.110 --> 01:07.220
if it is true, the marker will be set to map view

01:07.350 --> 01:11.300
and now there's a subcomponent so to say .marker.

01:11.480 --> 01:18.930
It's a self-closing component and this marker now simply needs one property, the coordinate where it should

01:18.930 --> 01:20.160
be rendered.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.580
Now the coordinate here should also be the focus position,

01:23.610 --> 01:27.260
so I'll bind it to this state focus location.

01:27.690 --> 01:33.180
Now actually the coordinate only needs a latitude and longitude, doesn't care about the longitude delta

01:33.190 --> 01:35.780
and the latitude delta

01:36.000 --> 01:42.080
but we can still bind it to focus location because there we got latitude and longitude and it will just ignore

01:42.120 --> 01:44.070
the other two items.

01:44.190 --> 01:51.480
So therefore now we have our coordinate, our marker here set up, we can now render this marker inside

01:51.540 --> 01:52.830
our map view

01:53.010 --> 01:54.460
and that's super trivial.

01:54.480 --> 02:02.400
We turned a self-closing map view into a non self-closing element like this and then simply in-between,

02:02.790 --> 02:06.090
we render our marker variable and that's either null,

02:06.090 --> 02:10.020
in which case we won't see anything or it is the marker.

02:10.020 --> 02:10.800
So with that,

02:10.890 --> 02:13.230
let's try this out, maybe on iOS this time,

02:13.380 --> 02:17.350
let's quickly log in here with some credentials of your choice

02:18.350 --> 02:25.630
and now if I click on the map, not only does it center, it also places a marker and the same of course

02:25.640 --> 02:26.290
on Android,

02:26.300 --> 02:32.460
just for completeness sake let's also view this there if it there also works as it should.

02:36.160 --> 02:42.730
If we log in and we go there and we click on the map, we see a Google maps marker in there.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.240
So this is working,

02:44.290 --> 02:48.970
that is how easy you can add markers and you can actually do a lot about these markers.

02:49.090 --> 02:54.650
Check out the official docs and there not the map view element but the marker element.

02:54.880 --> 03:00.150
There you see it's for mapview.marker, what we just used and you see you can configure this,

03:00.180 --> 03:05.590
you can add a title, a description, you can add a lot of things and really configure this and fine tune this to

03:05.590 --> 03:10.750
your need so that your map snippet looks exactly the way you want it to look.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.780
I'm going to stick to the set up we have here

03:12.820 --> 03:18.490
and in the next step, I instead want to make sure that we can smoothly animate to the picked location.
