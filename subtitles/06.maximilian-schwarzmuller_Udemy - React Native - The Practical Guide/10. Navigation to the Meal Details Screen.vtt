So to reach that meal detailed screen from inside our category meals screen I'll do basically the same

00:08.890 --> 00:09.850
I did before.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.490
I'll add a button there.

00:11.740 --> 00:19.830
So add a button here on the category meal screen with the title of go to details or whatever you want.

00:19.960 --> 00:27.700
And then we was on press to fire a function when this button is pressed where I will use props navigation

00:28.060 --> 00:34.930
dot navigate using does navigate method to which we have to pass object where we set up our route name

00:35.110 --> 00:39.860
and now our route name has to be one of the identifiers we set up in the stack navigator here.

00:39.940 --> 00:46.140
In this case you want to go to them you'll detail page so I'll use meal detail here and point to this.

00:46.150 --> 00:54.150
So here pointed me you'll detail and we should be good to go if we now save this.

00:54.310 --> 00:59.530
We can go to meals then we can go to the details and you see we get another forward animation we can

00:59.530 --> 01:06.250
go back and back again of course and all of that because this stack of multiple pages is managed under

01:06.250 --> 01:08.320
the hood by a react navigation.
