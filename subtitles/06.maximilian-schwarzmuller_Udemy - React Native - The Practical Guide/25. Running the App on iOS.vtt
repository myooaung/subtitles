00:02.750 --> 00:04.060
So now for the important part.

00:04.070 --> 00:08.990
Testing isn't a real phone for this I'm reinstalling the expo client on my iPhone so that all the permissions

00:08.990 --> 00:13.940
I did set up there in the past during testing and so on are resets so that they can showed us from scratch

00:14.450 --> 00:20.330
and I opened up my Expo death window in the browser here but it was always open but now I brought home

00:20.390 --> 00:24.050
the screen so that we have to bar code there to scan.

00:24.050 --> 00:29.840
So with that we can of course scanned this with the help of the camera application here which at point

00:29.840 --> 00:35.090
that the barcode is so that I can tap this to open it on Android you have to scan or in the Expo app

00:35.250 --> 00:37.600
but I'll show this in a second.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.530
Got that.

00:38.630 --> 00:43.740
Here's the app and now I can add a place test this.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.350
And now you'll see something interesting.

00:45.350 --> 00:48.760
If I click take image I'm asked for permissions and I click.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.800
OK but now it is will actually fail.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.570
You'll see that warning here at the bottom.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.510
This failed.

00:55.550 --> 00:59.750
Note the reason for why it has failed is that I'm asking for the wrong permission here in the image

00:59.750 --> 01:00.510
picker.

01:00.530 --> 01:04.760
Now previously I had to change this because on the simulator I was also getting an error.

01:04.760 --> 01:10.760
Dear notice should actually be fixed by not just asking for the camera roll permission here but also

01:11.090 --> 01:14.520
you can simply add a second argument here for permissions camera.

01:14.540 --> 01:17.250
So we need both camera and camera roll.

01:17.420 --> 01:22.190
Now previously changing this to camera roll fixed the issue because well we did ask for the camera permission

01:22.190 --> 01:28.400
first but in the end you need to ask for both and whenever you reinstall the expo client or relaunched

01:28.400 --> 01:32.210
the app on a new device you definitely need to ask for both.

01:32.210 --> 01:35.590
For this to work so make sure you do ask for both.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.240
And with that added with both permissions added here.

01:38.240 --> 01:42.500
This will now always work because now we're asking for both permissions even though we're only using

01:42.500 --> 01:43.660
the camera here.

01:43.850 --> 01:50.330
But since this package could all use the camera roll we need to get both permissions and thereafter

01:50.390 --> 01:53.790
close Expo and re scan that barcode here.

01:56.540 --> 02:00.160
Like this and opened is an expo again and now it should work.

02:00.150 --> 02:10.100
So now if we go here and we enter test here and then take an image now I'm asked for whether I want

02:10.100 --> 02:17.450
to grant access and I do and now I'll take this amazing image here which is very meta because I take

02:17.450 --> 02:22.820
a image of the screen where I record that I take an image and I can use that photo.

02:22.820 --> 02:27.640
Here it is and now let's choose a location on the map.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.410
Maybe this one save.

02:29.420 --> 02:35.060
This seems to work or get my current location which I don't want years so I'll just click.

02:35.060 --> 02:36.560
Safe place.

02:36.560 --> 02:40.540
And here it is added you can view it can do the details.

02:40.580 --> 02:41.540
So this seems to work.

02:41.540 --> 02:47.930
And now let me also close this and reopen it so that we see where it was where you stored in a database.

02:48.080 --> 02:53.320
So it should now load displays hopefully and it does and all the data is there.

02:53.330 --> 03:00.290
So this is now our application running on a real iPhone and we fixed this important permission error.

03:00.350 --> 03:03.230
Let's now also run it on an Android device.
