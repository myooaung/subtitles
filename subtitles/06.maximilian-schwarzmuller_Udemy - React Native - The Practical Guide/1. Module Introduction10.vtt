Welcome to this course module. It's an important one, not a super long one but an important one.

00:08.420 --> 00:14.700
React native and redux, obviously we want to use both because we use redux in so many react apps,

00:14.770 --> 00:20.150
it's also important for state management in react native because why would it be different there.

00:20.260 --> 00:24.160
React native apps also of course use some state we need to manage right,

00:24.220 --> 00:31.130
so why not use redux and actually, it'll turn out that redux is really easy to use in react native apps.

00:31.150 --> 00:38.020
So in this module, we'll just have a brief, a very brief refresher on redux but I do expect you to know

00:38.020 --> 00:41.050
what it is or to have the willingness to learn it,

00:41.050 --> 00:46.540
I won't go through it in detail and thereafter, I will show you how to add redux to a react native

00:46.540 --> 00:46.940
app.

00:47.050 --> 00:49.030
So let's start with the brief refresher.
