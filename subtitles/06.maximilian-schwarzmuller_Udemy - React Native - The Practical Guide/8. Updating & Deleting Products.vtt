Now we know how we can store and fetch data of course in our app we can also edit and delete data however.

00:10.690 --> 00:15.760
So let's make sure that this works as well and for data to go back to my actions and their two products

00:16.360 --> 00:26.320
and in their products actions file we have our update product action creator here.

00:26.360 --> 00:31.050
Now just as before I will now change just to return async dispatch.

00:31.340 --> 00:39.440
And then in the end in their dispatch this action you're so moved that in there and we'll call the dispatch

00:39.440 --> 00:42.250
function here which we're getting by redux thunk.

00:42.470 --> 00:47.420
And before we do that we can now reach out to the server and update our data there.

00:47.470 --> 00:55.010
Now that will be pretty simple we can just again use the syntax from create product this year.

00:55.010 --> 01:02.390
So just fetch request alone should suffice here and do that before we dispatch thanks to a wait we will

01:02.390 --> 01:07.610
wait for it is because this dispatch function invisibly gets wrapped into the then blocked that belongs

01:07.610 --> 01:09.010
to this promise.

01:09.020 --> 01:15.050
But we need to tweak this request the you El for example is not entirely correct it points at the product

01:15.080 --> 01:20.990
but now we want to point at a specific product the one product one update therefore I'll use a different

01:20.990 --> 01:26.960
javascript syntax here with back ticks and instead of single quotes which still creates a string but

01:26.960 --> 01:33.980
a string where it can easily inject dynamic data into and I will add a new segment after products before

01:33.980 --> 01:40.970
dot Jason and we can now inject data with this dollar sine curly brace syntax and that's vanilla javascript

01:41.030 --> 01:48.850
not specific to react native it's just JavaScript and here I want to add my I.D. so that in the end

01:48.880 --> 01:55.630
I target this year L then the product node and then this I.D. Of course if you're using a different

01:55.660 --> 02:01.810
API then firebase d you or else you have to send your request to will differ then you should have an

02:01.810 --> 02:07.810
API documentation that tells you which you are ls are accepted or you're writing your own API well then

02:07.810 --> 02:13.270
you should definitely know where you can send requests this is how firebase wants it and the method

02:13.300 --> 02:20.980
now for updating also shouldn't be post but patch or put put will fully overwrite the resource with

02:20.980 --> 02:27.130
the new data patch will updated in the places where you tell us to update it and that's what I want

02:27.130 --> 02:34.270
here I also need to add my headers and now all that a body with the title description and image you

02:34.270 --> 02:38.240
add all but of course not with the price because we're not getting this and we don't want to touch this

02:38.980 --> 02:45.110
and this will send the request where firebase will automatically only change these fields on the product

02:45.110 --> 02:51.390
with this idea we're targeting now I actually don't need to store the response in a constant because

02:51.390 --> 02:56.880
I don't care about it anyways it's just important that we wait for this to complete and with that we

02:56.880 --> 03:05.640
should be good if we now save that and we go here to admin and start editing this and maybe add X automation

03:05.640 --> 03:12.540
work here and then important click somewhere else so that this re triggers do char form logic and submits

03:12.540 --> 03:19.140
its new data and we didn't click this checkmark we're taken back and we see a whiteboard here we also

03:19.140 --> 03:25.620
see this on firebase so this is working so this is how we can update data now what about deleting for

03:25.620 --> 03:32.550
this let's go back into our actions and for deleting we have our action creator now justice before here

03:32.580 --> 03:40.250
I returned as a sync function that gets dispatch as an argument and where in this function we then in

03:40.250 --> 03:48.360
the end dispatch this action that reaches our reducer and before we reach dead we can again send the

03:48.360 --> 03:56.950
request request it looks like this I will copy this part here don't care about the response really just

03:56.950 --> 04:04.240
like that I'll wait fetch now the you or L is wrong justice for updating I want to add my I.D. in their

04:04.400 --> 04:10.900
hands I'll use back ticks so that I can use this injection syntax again and add the product I do here

04:11.350 --> 04:17.790
send a delete request and we won't need to set a header because we all do won't have a body is that

04:17.790 --> 04:23.140
we can get rid of all of that just the method is important and that we'll wait and for now we should

04:23.140 --> 04:28.570
be able to delete data as well we can have a quick look at this if I create a new dummy product which

04:28.570 --> 04:35.500
I can easily delete without losing too much like that if I saved at the click delete here click yes

04:35.860 --> 04:43.210
it's gone year and also we saw it for fraction of a second here it was also deleted on firebase so this

04:43.210 --> 04:45.130
is how we can update and delete as well.
