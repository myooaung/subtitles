It's time to add some users to his application to add authentication because many apps which you'll

00:08.270 --> 00:15.700
build will have authentication they need users who can sign up or logging or log out to really work

00:15.710 --> 00:21.590
and therefore in this module we will thoroughly walk through everything that's included with signing

00:21.590 --> 00:23.410
users up signing them in.

00:23.570 --> 00:29.340
Logging them out giving them access to the back end so that they can send data to protected resource

00:29.370 --> 00:35.650
stare and so that only authenticated users can interact with the back and ends on will do all of that.

00:35.650 --> 00:40.370
And this module and you will learn how authentication works in native apps like this and how you can

00:40.370 --> 00:42.260
implement it in this react native app.
