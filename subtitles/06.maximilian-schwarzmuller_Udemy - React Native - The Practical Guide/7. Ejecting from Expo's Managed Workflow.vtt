00:02.230 --> 00:08.830
Now besides setting up a new project from scratch with React Native Seelye or with the Expos seal iron

00:08.860 --> 00:10.820
then choosing the bare workflow.

00:11.020 --> 00:19.710
You can even convert a managed project into a React Native bear workflow project.

00:19.900 --> 00:24.480
And that's pretty cool because that means you can get all the convenience features of the Managed workflow

00:24.490 --> 00:32.170
during development and once you're done for example or once you need a certain third party package which

00:32.230 --> 00:38.110
integrates some feature you don't have built into Expo and you absolutely need in such a case you can

00:38.110 --> 00:43.180
still switch and you don't have to rebuild the app from scratch and create a brand new project and copy

00:43.180 --> 00:44.890
over your code.

00:45.010 --> 00:51.380
How well in your project and this is the native device feature that great places project we build early

00:51.380 --> 00:57.520
on the course where we can add places where we are of course using the location maps to camera sequel

00:57.520 --> 01:05.230
lights so where we are using all these things there in this project you can simply run Expo eject and

01:05.230 --> 01:10.390
this transforms your project into a non Expo managed workflow project.

01:10.390 --> 01:13.110
Important though there is no going back.

01:13.110 --> 01:18.550
Of course you can copy your folder and make a backup copy and safeties or if you're using get you can

01:18.550 --> 01:23.860
of course go back to an earlier commit but if you haven't saved your project once you reject that you

01:23.860 --> 01:25.360
can't transform it back.

01:25.360 --> 01:26.900
So be aware of this.

01:27.160 --> 01:32.680
You would have to create a brand new Expo managed project and copy overall your code if you wanted to

01:32.680 --> 01:33.970
go back.

01:33.970 --> 01:40.720
So here if you run exploit Jack you should actually be asked to which kind of project you want to eject.

01:40.750 --> 01:46.180
And here I got two options in the end now the options you see here by the way might differ over time

01:46.210 --> 01:52.360
but here are the two options I have are better and expo kit Expo kit is deprecated.

01:52.360 --> 01:58.780
This is basically what we had before we had the bare workflow so you shouldn't really switch to this.

01:58.780 --> 02:02.520
Instead you can switch to bear here which simply means dead.

02:02.530 --> 02:08.710
Now you will be transformed to react native project as if it would be created with the react native

02:08.710 --> 02:13.010
seal ie without the expo wrapper but it will be pre configured.

02:13.030 --> 02:18.640
As mentioned here on the react native unique modules page which is it is kind of this package which

02:18.670 --> 02:26.200
Expo needs to expose all these Expo API is to a non Expo app so it will pre configure all these things

02:26.200 --> 02:29.140
during each action so that you don't have to do that.

02:29.350 --> 02:36.120
So you get a react native plus app so to say so if I hit enter here and now important you can't go back.

02:36.120 --> 02:42.310
Once this completed you can choose a name for the home screen and all choose great places here for example

02:42.910 --> 02:50.490
hit Enter now name my Android Studio and X code projects are and guide.

02:50.530 --> 02:54.670
But that's up to you and now does will do its job.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.280
It transforms the project.

02:56.290 --> 03:02.380
It adds an android folder and since I'm on Mac OS it also adds a Iow folder of course on Windows and

03:02.380 --> 03:02.790
Linux.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.970
It won't do that because they're since you now need to build this locally.

03:06.970 --> 03:08.660
It can't build ISIS apps.

03:09.640 --> 03:16.450
And it reconfigure its everything and installs a couple of dependencies so that you can use your existing

03:16.450 --> 03:22.150
code and all the expo packages you already installed in this bear setup.

03:22.150 --> 03:25.130
So it does not just set up all the uni modules stuff here.

03:25.240 --> 03:32.710
It also makes sure that all the packages you are already using like Expo location or Expo sequel light

03:33.130 --> 03:37.980
that those packages all the work so nowadays can take a while.

03:38.010 --> 03:46.260
Let's wait for this to finish and here it's done and you see it actually tells me that it generally

03:46.260 --> 03:50.430
did its job but there were two packages which require some manual setup.

03:50.430 --> 03:54.750
You can simply click on these links to get instructions on what you need to do there.

03:54.780 --> 04:00.810
It's the expo image picker and the react native maps package where you need to do some manual installation

04:00.810 --> 04:01.980
to finish it up.

04:02.820 --> 04:05.010
So here on the Expo image picker page.

04:05.010 --> 04:11.400
In the end what we need to do is we need to run port install in the Iaw folder so we need to do all

04:11.400 --> 04:11.810
the things.

04:11.820 --> 04:18.660
After installing the package so in the project folder all navigate into S and run port install port

04:18.660 --> 04:24.930
is like NPM for us it installs some dependencies which I w needs to work correctly.

04:25.050 --> 04:32.040
So that's what's happening now and once this is done will also need to add this entry year to the Android

04:32.040 --> 04:36.030
manifest so that's also something we'll need to do.

04:36.270 --> 04:42.030
So we need to go to the Android folder the app folder there and in the source folder Android manifest

04:42.360 --> 04:47.070
and then as described here at this inside of the application tax.

04:47.070 --> 04:57.060
So here is application and in there we should add this activity entry here like this that's required.

04:57.300 --> 05:02.280
Now while some already here you will also see that this manifest file all that was set up in a certain

05:02.280 --> 05:02.950
way.

05:03.090 --> 05:08.940
It includes all permissions and of course you don't want to do that you only want to ask for the permissions

05:08.940 --> 05:10.390
you really need.

05:10.410 --> 05:18.480
So as it says here remove any permissions your app doesn't need and for example my demo application

05:18.480 --> 05:24.300
here should only need to access fine location permission which I'll move up there

05:27.440 --> 05:36.890
and the camera permission of course which will move up there and also the right external storage permission

05:41.790 --> 05:43.520
that should also be required.

05:43.530 --> 05:48.900
These should actually be all permissions and you can check all third party packages or all Expo API

05:48.900 --> 05:54.110
packages you're using to make sure you're not missing any permissions.

05:54.300 --> 06:00.840
With that I'll actually comment out all these permissions here and all all these permissions that will

06:00.840 --> 06:09.170
test it to see whether that works so if that setting up the image picker package is done now react native

06:09.190 --> 06:14.880
maps all also needs to be configured there we can dive into the installation instructions.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.260
Now this npm install command that already happened.

06:18.390 --> 06:24.960
But now what we need to do is we need to run React Native link React Native maps so let's simply go

06:25.020 --> 06:32.380
up one level back into the root project folder and run run React Native linked React Native maps and

06:32.380 --> 06:34.590
dad will now link everything up.

06:34.600 --> 06:40.870
Make sure that everything works correctly that everything is configured correctly and you will still

06:40.870 --> 06:49.120
need to do some manual stuff all these things here should not be required.

06:49.270 --> 07:00.230
That should all be done with linking thankfully but on Android you need to make sure that you add this

07:00.230 --> 07:00.790
entry here.

07:00.790 --> 07:05.520
This metadata entry into your application key in the Android manifest.

07:05.630 --> 07:11.990
So here instead of application we can add this entry and there you need to place your Google Maps API

07:11.990 --> 07:12.740
key.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.680
Now I have that in the end folder.

07:14.690 --> 07:21.230
If you remember so I'll just grab this key and added here replace your Google Maps API key here with

07:21.230 --> 07:23.490
it and all the important.

07:23.660 --> 07:31.040
If you go to the Google Maps API page you need to enable this maps SDK for Android for your project.

07:31.040 --> 07:31.790
That's important.

07:31.790 --> 07:36.500
Otherwise this will not work for IOW you don't need to do anything special unless you want to use Google

07:36.500 --> 07:41.690
Maps data in which case you need to follow the instructions given in the react native maps.

07:41.870 --> 07:44.920
Instructions here for how to use Google Maps on and on.

07:45.800 --> 07:52.930
But for Android you definitely need to enabled Google Maps SDK for Android API here to enable this API

07:52.940 --> 07:58.760
you can go to the Google Cloud Platform here for the project you worked on earlier when you set up that

07:59.000 --> 08:05.240
API key and so on and then here under API eyes and services you can go to library which takes you to

08:05.240 --> 08:09.710
a library of all the Google API eyes and their de maps SDK for Android.

08:09.710 --> 08:11.120
You need to enable this.

08:11.120 --> 08:15.980
You also will need to set up the maps SDK for AOS if you want to use Google Maps and I which I won't

08:15.980 --> 08:17.150
use here though.

08:17.350 --> 08:18.760
Now it should be enabled here already.

08:18.770 --> 08:21.500
But make sure it is right in case it was not enabled.

08:21.590 --> 08:22.710
Definitely do so.

08:24.370 --> 08:27.240
With that this should also be set up such that it works.

08:27.250 --> 08:34.450
And now if you run React Native run Android the app we built in an earlier module with the expo managed

08:34.450 --> 08:41.260
workflow should now still work now without the expo managed workflow without the expo client being used

08:41.260 --> 08:47.770
on the simulator or the real device but instead build locally with Android Studio or of course all that

08:47.770 --> 08:48.090
with.

08:48.100 --> 08:54.000
IOW if you wanted to use that and therefore in the same way as you would do it in a react native seal

08:54.010 --> 08:55.510
I created Project.

08:55.510 --> 09:01.000
But now after ejecting from the managed workflow which of course means all this code was written in

09:01.000 --> 09:07.180
the managed workflow and yet I now run it in the non managed workflow which is pretty sweet.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.830
So let's wait for it to finish and see where this app works the way it should.

09:11.590 --> 09:16.780
It's coming up on the android emulator here which is the emulator I want to use for testing because

09:16.780 --> 09:23.020
data I can use the emulator a camera for testing and again just to emphasize this this is now not using

09:23.020 --> 09:24.400
the expo client app.

09:24.400 --> 09:28.930
We also couldn't scan a barcode here because there is no barcode to scan.

09:28.940 --> 09:34.570
This is no really app built with Android Studio and pushed to our app.

09:34.720 --> 09:38.710
So here's our app and now let's try adding a new place here.

09:38.710 --> 09:44.470
Test take an image allow access to the camera of course

09:49.370 --> 09:50.630
and then take this image

09:53.960 --> 09:55.190
Yep crop it.

09:56.060 --> 09:58.010
Pick a location on the map maybe

10:00.760 --> 10:04.050
here's the map coming up this location looks good to me.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.760
Safety is safe to place.

10:06.760 --> 10:07.540
Here we are.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.940
And now let me close this app.

10:10.060 --> 10:13.210
There you also see that this really is a stand alone app installed.

10:13.210 --> 10:19.210
If I open the app drawer here on the device you're on the simulator.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.040
It's this great places app you see here.

10:22.040 --> 10:28.920
So if a launch this does now relaunches the app we just worked in there's our place as it was stored

10:29.190 --> 10:30.330
in the local storage.

10:30.330 --> 10:34.540
The image obviously was stored on the filesystem system otherwise you wouldn't see it.

10:34.710 --> 10:41.370
And it works as before but now not inside of the actual client but as a standalone app without any Expo

10:41.370 --> 10:41.970
wrapper.

10:41.970 --> 10:48.300
Still using some of the Expo API as an expo packages with the help of this unique modules package which

10:48.300 --> 10:53.640
is automatically added and configured to the bare workflow which we on the other hand got with the help

10:53.700 --> 10:55.080
of ejecting.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.000
So lots of cool things going on there.
