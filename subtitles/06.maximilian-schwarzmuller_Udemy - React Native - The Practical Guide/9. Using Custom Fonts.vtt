00:02.190 --> 00:06.450
Now we added funds multiple times in this course already so it's not too new.

00:06.450 --> 00:12.780
How does works in the SS folder all add a funds folder and you can stored them wherever you want attached

00:12.780 --> 00:15.470
you find the two funds we've been using throughout the course.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.550
Open sense bold and regular.

00:17.550 --> 00:22.690
And now we have to load them when the app starts in the app J.S. file there.

00:23.100 --> 00:34.690
You now can import something from Expo and that something is the app loading component and you all need

00:34.690 --> 00:42.310
to import star as fund from Expo dash fund and to make sure that this is available to run npm install

00:42.340 --> 00:49.870
dash dash save Expo dash fund to install this into your project and ensure that you can use it.

00:49.890 --> 00:53.760
Now these are the two things you need to install there with that installed.

00:53.770 --> 00:58.620
We can add a new function here maybe name it fetch far fetched funds.

00:58.640 --> 01:07.690
This is a function which in the end takes no arguments but in there I can now call front load async

01:08.200 --> 01:13.510
and return that because that returns a promise and fetch funds should return a promise and they are

01:13.510 --> 01:18.910
passing a javascript object where remap the funds we want to load and then I'll have open dash sense

01:18.940 --> 01:25.560
which I map to my require import here where I point at the assets folder funds folder and that opens

01:25.560 --> 01:38.020
once regular and all the add open dash sense dash bold here as a key and map that to require slash assets

01:38.080 --> 01:45.560
slash funds slash open sense bold so that both funds are important here.

01:45.580 --> 01:51.230
Now fetch fonts of course needs to be called and that should be called by our app loading component.

01:51.370 --> 01:56.800
Hence we also need to import to use state from react so that we can control whether the data has been

01:56.800 --> 01:57.990
loaded yet or not.

01:58.240 --> 02:06.430
So did in the functional component here we can have our fund loaded state and set fund loaded in initially

02:06.430 --> 02:09.080
with use state that is false.

02:09.250 --> 02:13.190
If that should be true I want to render this output.

02:13.270 --> 02:18.970
Therefore as long as it is false hence the exclamation mark here I want to instead return the app loading

02:18.970 --> 02:25.210
component which prolongs our loading our startup screen and there we need to provide these start async

02:25.930 --> 02:30.850
prop which points at the fetch funds function which is a function which is executed when this component

02:30.850 --> 02:37.350
is first rendered and then on finish which executes a function once does loading is done and in this

02:37.350 --> 02:38.830
function that is to be executed.

02:38.830 --> 02:45.890
I'll set my fund loaded to true so that we no longer render app loading but instead we render this content.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.490
Now our fonts get loaded and now we can use them and I want to use them in two places.

02:51.520 --> 02:58.030
My product item which is the component we render on the products overview there of course we have some

02:58.030 --> 03:06.340
some text we have our title and we have our price here and it's there where on the title I also want

03:06.340 --> 03:12.760
to set a fun family of open dash sans dash bold and on the price.

03:12.760 --> 03:20.020
I also want to set off for the fun family of open dash sans and on the product detail screen it's the

03:20.020 --> 03:29.080
same the price should maybe get a fun family of open dash sans dash bold to have that bold style and

03:29.080 --> 03:33.310
the description will just get the open Sand's full form.

03:33.490 --> 03:40.880
Now that's not all actually in the shop navigator and my main navigator here in the default navigation

03:40.880 --> 03:41.880
options.

03:41.900 --> 03:51.520
I also want to use that font in the header so the header title style here should actually be an object

03:51.520 --> 04:01.360
where I set the fund family to open dash sans dash bold hues to bold open sans font they're and the

04:01.510 --> 04:09.600
header back titles style defines how did back text which we see on ISIS is stalled and that should also

04:09.600 --> 04:17.120
use a fun family of open sense though not the bold version with that if we now safeties and does reloads

04:17.860 --> 04:23.060
we can see our own font is getting used now we also see that here in Iowa as our title is therefore

04:23.110 --> 04:29.330
a cut off that's something we'll have to fix but in general this now looks the way it should look now

04:29.350 --> 04:37.010
let's make sure that title being cutoff is fixed and for Dad and the product item here which is where

04:37.010 --> 04:47.340
we have that title here this title should maybe have a reduced margin vertical of only 2 because I still

04:47.340 --> 04:53.800
like that distance and now the 15 percent of height we give to the title and the price sufficed shared

04:53.880 --> 04:57.390
us and therefore now it is looks the way it should look.

04:57.660 --> 05:01.540
Now we're using the custom font we can go to the details page.

05:01.710 --> 05:06.750
I'd say it's now really time to also make sure that we can add items to the cart and we therefore make

05:06.750 --> 05:08.340
this to cart button work.
