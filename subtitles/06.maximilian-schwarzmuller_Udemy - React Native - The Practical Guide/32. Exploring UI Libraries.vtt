00:02.200 --> 00:09.160
Now what you saw in this module and what's typical for React Native apps is that you have to style a

00:09.160 --> 00:10.810
lot on your own.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.460
The button is a rare exception.

00:12.460 --> 00:17.740
The built in button I mean which automatically gives you some base styling and even adjusts itself to

00:17.740 --> 00:19.330
the underlying platform.

00:19.330 --> 00:22.650
But other than that you really have to style everything on your own.

00:22.660 --> 00:24.140
Be that a text input.

00:24.180 --> 00:25.220
At this output.

00:25.230 --> 00:27.910
Be that the text here or custom buttons.

00:27.970 --> 00:33.340
You'll have to do a lot of manual styling and component creation and React Native because we act native

00:33.340 --> 00:39.130
only gives you these raw primitives to work with only the view the text and so on and you have to adjust

00:39.130 --> 00:42.350
them to your requirements and to the look and feel you want to achieve.

00:43.250 --> 00:49.090
Now React Native also actually has active community and there are some nice third party packages have

00:49.090 --> 00:55.360
been created which are essentially collections of pre-built components that sometimes even change their

00:55.360 --> 01:01.030
look depending on the platform they're running on sometimes not but which always give you some pre styled

01:01.030 --> 01:05.020
components you can use and therefore you might want to look into those.

01:05.020 --> 01:09.760
If you're building an app in cases where you want to a white setting up all these styles on your own

01:10.030 --> 01:16.270
where you don't have your own strict corporate identity or your own detailed look which you need to

01:16.270 --> 01:18.230
fine tune in every detail.

01:18.370 --> 01:25.090
In such cases attached you find a link to this document from the expo docs where you find some examples

01:25.090 --> 01:33.610
of popular third party UI kits you eye component libraries which you can add to your React Native project

01:33.880 --> 01:41.880
which also work and React Native projects created with Expo to easily get pre-built components you can

01:42.000 --> 01:49.470
well drop into your project on the pages of these projects you also see previews of how this would look

01:49.470 --> 01:54.720
like which style these pre-built components have and how they work and you can always dive into the

01:54.720 --> 02:02.080
docs of these packages to explore which components they for example give you and whether that's something

02:02.080 --> 02:04.820
that might be interesting to you or not.

02:04.840 --> 02:11.410
So checking out these UI kids can be worth it because that can give you certain elements like pre-built

02:11.410 --> 02:17.980
buttons pre-built text fields and whatever it is dead look and feel the way you want your app to look

02:17.980 --> 02:22.900
and feel and which then of course saves you the time of building these components on your own because

02:22.930 --> 02:29.260
what you do then is simply you add this library to your project you install it and of course you always

02:29.260 --> 02:33.070
find installation instructions on these pages as well.

02:33.070 --> 02:39.970
So you install such a library into your project and then all you have to do is you in the end just import

02:40.000 --> 02:45.100
the components you need into your component files and start using them.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.350
So that's really simple.

02:46.350 --> 02:51.540
That's a nice alternative to building everything on your own and it of course depends on what you needed

02:51.550 --> 02:55.830
your app but such kits exist and therefore having a look is definitely worth it.
