00:02.250 --> 00:04.350
Now let's also fixed the game over screen.

00:04.350 --> 00:07.130
It's not that bad because it's scroll.

00:07.200 --> 00:11.790
Of course you can also play around with different layouts there you could shrink the image further if

00:11.790 --> 00:17.360
you're on a smaller screen that's something you can do you'll learn how to do that with dimensions with

00:17.370 --> 00:18.150
event listeners.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.010
Use the fact and use state.

00:20.070 --> 00:25.160
I will keep it very simple here and just make sure that we take advantage of the scroll view.

00:25.170 --> 00:29.550
We already have and have a little bit more spacing at the bottom so that this looks better.

00:29.550 --> 00:35.610
That's of course very easy to implement on the game over screen in the end.

00:35.710 --> 00:44.200
I have my main button here at the bottom and I just need more spacing here or in other words in this

00:44.200 --> 00:47.520
view which holds all the content on my screen.

00:47.560 --> 00:53.470
I just need to add a little bit of padding here padding vertical to be precise.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.940
So top and bottom of let's say 10.

00:56.950 --> 00:58.740
That's a very simple change of course.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.390
As I said you could go more complex than that.

01:01.420 --> 01:04.930
You learned all about the tools you need for that Whip's

01:07.880 --> 01:09.100
let's start a game.

01:09.510 --> 01:22.990
Well let's quickly have a look if that simple fix does the job though.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.410
And with that I'm good again.

01:24.670 --> 01:27.070
We have some things there which you could improve.

01:27.070 --> 01:34.340
For example we're locking in the width of the image based on the orientation we have when we start.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.610
And that's not what we might want here.

01:36.670 --> 01:43.180
We might want to dynamically recalculate this and for Dad you would have to manage it with inline styles

01:43.210 --> 01:45.990
and state and use effect and an event listener.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.370
I'll leave it like this here.

01:47.520 --> 01:52.510
Although to not unnecessarily bloat this module but you'll learn about the tools you need for that.

01:52.540 --> 01:58.420
And with that you got all the basic tools mostly the dimensions API and the different ways of using

01:58.420 --> 02:05.590
it to build nice user interfaces which look good and work rate on different orientations and different

02:05.590 --> 02:06.850
device sizes.
