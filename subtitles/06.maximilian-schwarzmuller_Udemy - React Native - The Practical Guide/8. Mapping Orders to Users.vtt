WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:07.590
We're adding tokens everywhere which is important but for orders we don't just want a panther token

00:07.600 --> 00:11.800
we all do want to make sure that orders really belong to the logged in user.

00:11.800 --> 00:17.080
Now the good thing is we're storing the user I.D. which firebase generated in our redux store.

00:17.080 --> 00:21.480
So mapping our orders to users isn't too hard.

00:21.520 --> 00:29.140
We get access to our full store here so we can get the user I.D. by calling get state DOT off dot user

00:29.140 --> 00:33.270
I.D. That's all this gives us to user I.D. of the currently locked end user.

00:33.340 --> 00:40.030
And now we can inject this here and replace the hard coded you one with user I.D..

00:40.030 --> 00:46.840
Of course not just for adding orders but also for fetching orders because we want to fetch the orders

00:46.900 --> 00:49.060
of the currently locked in user.

00:49.060 --> 00:55.540
So here let's all the received that second argument get our user I.D. and here exchange single quotes

00:55.540 --> 01:03.640
for back ticks so that we can use this day a dynamic convenient injection here and then replace or interpolate

01:03.640 --> 01:10.940
as it's called this string here by adding the user I.D. So there's now all to make sure that the orders

01:10.940 --> 01:11.880
are stored correctly.

01:11.900 --> 01:18.160
But of course it's not just the orders the products also should be stored such we should make sure that

01:18.160 --> 01:23.000
when we create a product we actually do add our owner I.D. to it.

01:23.020 --> 01:26.960
That's something we're currently not doing and that's something which we should do.

01:27.100 --> 01:33.200
So here I actually also want to get the user I.D. here and create product.

01:33.370 --> 01:39.380
And when I then send my request to create a new product I don't just want a safe title descriptions

01:39.400 --> 01:39.920
on.

01:39.970 --> 01:48.130
All the one to set owner I.D. field and the exact name is up to you which is equal to the user I.D.

01:48.130 --> 01:49.720
of the logged in user.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.610
And that's not something brand new.

01:51.610 --> 01:59.560
Now we really start mapping products to a user something we only did in a dummy way before this all

01:59.560 --> 02:05.980
the means by the way Dad when we dispatch create product here I want to pass a new piece of information

02:06.490 --> 02:11.520
I want to add the owner I.D. there as well and all the point that the user I.D. here.

02:11.890 --> 02:16.310
And that means that in the products reducer we need to respect this.

02:16.540 --> 02:24.130
And in there instead of hard coding does I.D. Here we can now get this from our act dot product data

02:24.580 --> 02:28.200
from owner I.D. there because that's what I just added there.

02:28.210 --> 02:33.990
So here products I added owner I.D. I added this key to product data to the actually dispatch.

02:34.090 --> 02:39.910
Now the reducer we have to use that extract that here and use that as an owner I.D. of the product we

02:39.910 --> 02:42.230
create locally in redux.

02:42.340 --> 02:49.780
Of course there's all the means that here when I get the products that belong to that user I also want

02:49.780 --> 02:53.190
to make sure that I filter correctly for the correct I.D..

02:53.800 --> 02:58.960
So when we call set products here I want to make sure that user products are really filtered down to

02:58.960 --> 03:07.540
the locked in user so the product action creator when we fetch all products here of course I do want

03:07.540 --> 03:16.190
to fetch all products but there I also want to be able to get my state so that I can get my user I.D.

03:16.400 --> 03:21.920
from the state because then here when we create a loaded product I don't just want to forward those.

03:21.950 --> 03:28.350
I also want to add a new user product's key to my action object where I take the loaded products.

03:28.400 --> 03:37.590
Here I filter them and I have a look at each product and if the owner idea of the product is that is

03:37.650 --> 03:43.590
equal to the user I.D. then I want to keep it because then it's a product created by the currently locked

03:43.590 --> 03:44.290
end user.

03:44.340 --> 03:45.840
Otherwise I'll not keep it.

03:45.840 --> 03:51.040
It's still part of the loaded product which I passed a product but not part of the products I passed

03:51.040 --> 03:52.510
to user products.

03:52.860 --> 03:58.170
And that allows me to go back to the reducer and there in set Products User products is initialized

03:58.200 --> 04:04.860
not by filtering here but by setting it equal to action user products which now takes the filtered products

04:05.160 --> 04:12.290
filtered indie action creator with the logic we just wrote where we take to user I.D. does make sure

04:12.560 --> 04:18.260
that we only see the products we really created and we don't see the product of our users.

04:18.270 --> 04:25.310
Now of course by the way we cannot all to make sure that in our products store here we don't start with

04:25.310 --> 04:28.460
our dummy products but we actually start with an empty array.

04:28.460 --> 04:37.440
In both cases here there's all the means of course that now if we save this and we log in we should

04:37.440 --> 04:41.230
be able to view our previous product.

04:41.310 --> 04:42.020
Here it is.

04:42.030 --> 04:45.010
But if I go to admin we don't see it there.

04:45.090 --> 04:50.340
That makes a lot of sense because this product was created earlier in the course and therefore it has

04:50.340 --> 04:58.650
no owner I.D. This product has no owner I.D. so therefore it's not included in any user's product which

04:58.650 --> 05:01.980
is great because now I have a nice example that there are no products yet.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.190
Maybe we should also show a message here.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.050
As a side note in orders we also don't see anything.

05:07.050 --> 05:12.720
And maybe we should show a message here as well because orders for you one that's now not a valid user

05:12.720 --> 05:13.450
I.D. anymore.

05:13.470 --> 05:18.680
So these orders are never loaded for any user and that's good because that's how it should be.

05:18.680 --> 05:23.840
So now with that I'll just tweak these pages a little bit to show a message if we can't load any data.

05:23.870 --> 05:32.620
So here in the user product screen if user products length is equal to zero then I don't want to return

05:32.620 --> 05:41.090
my flat list but instead I'll return a View here where I have a text break say no products found maybe

05:41.110 --> 05:46.810
start creating some and it will need to set up some stalls there.

05:46.820 --> 05:49.520
We also need to import the view and text.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.460
Otherwise we contemplate us.

05:51.680 --> 05:59.060
And now I'll just do some quick and dirty inline styling here with Flex 1 justified content center and

05:59.090 --> 06:04.340
a line items Center of course you could also assign your own font here to the text and so on.

06:04.340 --> 06:09.070
Also stood like this and then copy this and move it over to the orders screen.

06:09.170 --> 06:12.060
Make sure you input a view and text there as well.

06:12.110 --> 06:18.350
And then here we can also add this check if user products length is empty of course here we should check

06:18.410 --> 06:24.010
orders length not user products length but if that is empty I say no order is found.

06:24.110 --> 06:28.910
Maybe start ordering some products like that.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.940
And with that we should be seeing that text if nothing is found.

06:31.940 --> 06:41.090
So if I now try this again and log in real quick and we go to the admin page we see the text here and

06:41.160 --> 06:42.630
we go to the orders page.

06:42.630 --> 06:44.540
We also see the text here.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.460
So now it's working as it should.

06:46.620 --> 06:55.470
If I now create a new product on the other hand for example a scarf let's say with a nice little a U

06:55.470 --> 07:03.190
or L which I select it for a fifty nine point ninety nine dollars Woollen scarf.

07:03.210 --> 07:12.060
If I do that and submit this this works fine and it also shows up here under admin also shows up under

07:12.060 --> 07:16.650
products we could of course also filter it out there if you wanted to but why not.

07:16.650 --> 07:18.290
Why don't we have it here too.

07:18.380 --> 07:26.840
If I add this to the card and I click order now now here under orders we see it and on firebase we also

07:26.840 --> 07:32.460
see that under orders now we have a node with our user I.D. with our orders.

07:32.490 --> 07:35.670
So this is now really working in the way it should.

07:35.670 --> 07:39.960
Here on this application and therefore for now here we have a setup with which we can work.
