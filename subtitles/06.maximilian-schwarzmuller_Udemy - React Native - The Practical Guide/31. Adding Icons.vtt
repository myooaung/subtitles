00:02.300 --> 00:05.320
Adding icons is super straightforward.

00:05.330 --> 00:07.760
In a react native app that uses Expo.

00:08.060 --> 00:09.670
We can get rid of the button import by the way.

00:09.670 --> 00:11.530
We don't need to build in button anymore.

00:11.900 --> 00:18.830
But back to the icons because our icon can be added by importing something from.

00:18.980 --> 00:23.180
And now it's at Expo slash vector icons.

00:23.180 --> 00:26.410
Might be a bit of a strange package name but that's just what it is.

00:26.420 --> 00:31.910
It's part of the Expo toolkit so to say it's automatically included in any React Native project you

00:31.910 --> 00:33.260
created with Expo.

00:33.500 --> 00:40.250
And there you can import components that help you render icons and a pretty nice component there is

00:40.250 --> 00:45.920
the ionic bonds component for that you simply have to know that there are different I can sets which

00:45.920 --> 00:52.790
are built into expo or into this vector I could s package to be precise I unicorns as one set of icons

00:52.820 --> 00:58.490
managed by the team behind iconic in the end so the icons which are included in that set are managed

00:58.490 --> 01:02.450
by that iconic team and I'm really just talking about the icons here.

01:02.450 --> 01:08.300
This has nothing to do with us adding anything from ionic to direct risk native app we're just using

01:08.300 --> 01:09.650
their icons.

01:09.650 --> 01:16.080
You also got other icon sets like evil icons material icons so a lot of icon sets you can use.

01:16.190 --> 01:22.520
And a great place to learn about all included icons and get an overview of all the included icons is

01:22.520 --> 01:27.680
the official Expo icons documentation which you find attached to this video as well.

01:27.680 --> 01:34.270
A link to this documentation and there you can not only learn more about how to use them but you'll

01:34.270 --> 01:40.460
also find a link to the icons directory and that is a long list of all the included icons you can use

01:40.470 --> 01:45.110
and you always see to which I can package this belongs.

01:45.110 --> 01:50.030
You can also search for I can stare like remove to find all icons that have something to do with removing

01:50.030 --> 01:55.070
stuff and then you see that there is something from the ionic coins package something from the material

01:55.070 --> 01:56.820
icons package and so on.

01:57.140 --> 02:01.820
Now the icons I searched for it in advance are from the ionic cons package.

02:01.820 --> 02:07.040
So here all import ionic pins from Expo vector icons and this not automatically is a component we can

02:07.040 --> 02:10.830
use in our J as X code to output an icon.

02:10.940 --> 02:15.820
And if we would have used material against that would also be a component just to output a material

02:15.820 --> 02:16.270
icon.

02:16.340 --> 02:22.810
But I want to use an ionic an icon so I'll use that and I'll go down to the J as X code and instead

02:22.810 --> 02:30.040
of using lower here I'll actually output such a ionic and such a I can hear in my button and the great

02:30.040 --> 02:36.250
thing is such a I can here can also be nested into our button even though what we're outputting here

02:36.250 --> 02:43.930
props children is instead of a text node but that is supported you can output icon component in that

02:43.930 --> 02:46.290
text component as well so that will work.

02:47.140 --> 02:51.910
So back to this ironic in here though right now I'm not saying anything about the icon I want to use

02:52.390 --> 02:58.400
and there the icon I picked in advance has a name of MDA dash remove.

02:58.900 --> 03:06.430
Now you tell react native and kind of Expo that you want to use that icon by adding the name prop here

03:06.520 --> 03:12.520
on ionic coins and then this takes a string with the I can name which you find in that directory right.

03:12.550 --> 03:15.970
So here I picked this I can hear which I want to use.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.440
So that's the name MDA dash remove which we now use here.

03:20.530 --> 03:22.520
So that's the I can name we add here.

03:22.600 --> 03:28.660
Next you can also set up the icon size and pixels and here I'll go with 24 to have a nice big icon and

03:28.660 --> 03:33.250
also the color does icon should have and here I'll set this to have a white color.

03:33.280 --> 03:38.920
Now I'll copy that and use the same on the greater button but there of course the icon is a different

03:38.920 --> 03:39.320
one.

03:39.340 --> 03:45.580
Here I picked MDA ad as an icon and you can of course explore that list of icons and pick different

03:45.610 --> 03:50.650
icons if you want to and you can also try a different icon package instead of ionic icons or even use

03:50.650 --> 03:54.830
to different icon packages in one and the same component.

03:54.850 --> 03:59.650
You don't have to stick to one icon package only you can mix and match them as you want.

03:59.650 --> 04:04.150
So we could render an eye on a can here and render a material icon here.

04:04.150 --> 04:08.350
But of course you should ensure that the overall look of your app makes sense.

04:08.350 --> 04:13.840
So if you're mixing icons too wildly chances are that it's not going to look that good.

04:13.840 --> 04:18.160
So typically you want to stick to one set but you don't have to technically.

04:18.190 --> 04:23.500
So here I picked these two icons and now with that if we safeties we start a new game here.

04:23.500 --> 04:30.190
Now we got a plus and a minus icon here to indicate where the numbers should be lower or higher.

04:30.190 --> 04:36.100
And that is pretty nice in my opinion because that gives us a whole new way of building user interfaces

04:36.430 --> 04:41.380
because with icons we really have another important tool for building great user experiences.
