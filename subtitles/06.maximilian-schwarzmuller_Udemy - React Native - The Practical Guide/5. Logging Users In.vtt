00:02.190 --> 00:08.710
Now let's make sure we can all log in for dad Andy off action creator so in the store actions folder

00:08.710 --> 00:12.720
in the all file we can duplicate to sign up.

00:12.930 --> 00:18.210
Action creator copy it and renamed a copy to log in.

00:18.220 --> 00:22.870
This all will need e-mail and a password but it will send the request to a slightly different you are

00:22.870 --> 00:26.620
ell if you have a look at the official docs for a signing in.

00:26.620 --> 00:30.370
This is your you or l it might look almost equal.

00:30.490 --> 00:37.170
But here the difference is this word sign in with password instead of sign up after accounts colon.

00:37.170 --> 00:40.380
This is what we need to change to have a valid you are Elif again.

00:40.400 --> 00:46.110
And of course therefore you could also think about ways of merging this into into one function and reusing

00:46.110 --> 00:51.750
code I'll explicitly let it split up here to make it really clear that we have two separate functions

00:51.750 --> 00:57.940
here and now with that we're sending a request to this you or L we still need to attach email password

00:57.970 --> 01:03.250
and this return secure token field which always should be true and we'll get back pretty much the same

01:03.250 --> 01:08.630
data as when we sign up just one extra field which basically tells us where it is.

01:08.650 --> 01:16.100
Email is part of an existing account so I pretend that we sent the same data here.

01:16.150 --> 01:17.160
We can leave it as it is.

01:17.160 --> 01:22.300
We want to have this check here and therefore here I can then also log my response data.

01:22.300 --> 01:30.320
Of course I don't want to dispatch a sign up action here but instead dispatch a new log and action thereafter.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.890
Though we're also not doing anything.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.120
Therefore now will soon do so.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.500
I can already change what we dispatch with that.

01:37.510 --> 01:38.490
Let's see where that works.

01:38.500 --> 01:44.290
But Ford is of course some changes on you off screen are required because right now there we always

01:44.290 --> 01:51.190
when we press this button we always sign up right now and that's not what I want instead of always signing

01:51.190 --> 01:58.210
up I want to either sign up or log in depending on which mode we're in and this mode should be changeable

01:58.210 --> 02:01.730
with the help of this button which allows us to switch between modes.

02:02.110 --> 02:07.990
So in order to be able to switch between modes we need to manage some additional state in the off screen.

02:07.990 --> 02:12.940
Basically a state that allows us to find out whether we're a log and mode or in sign up mode.

02:12.940 --> 02:22.560
So here I use my state and I start with false because this should say is sign up and set is sign up

02:22.560 --> 02:28.300
and that therefore tells us where we're currently in sign up mode or if that's false if we're in the

02:28.300 --> 02:29.040
log in mode.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.680
Basically because these are the two modes we have right.

02:31.710 --> 02:37.190
So is sign up is false initially because initially I want to be in log in mode and now we can use is

02:37.190 --> 02:42.450
sign up to determine what happens when we press the log and button but all of which text we all put

02:42.480 --> 02:45.740
their so let's start with the text here.

02:45.790 --> 02:48.090
I don't always want to say log in.

02:48.140 --> 02:51.320
Instead I want to check if is sign up is true.

02:51.380 --> 02:57.020
Then here I want to say sign up and I only want to say log in if this is not true.

02:57.020 --> 03:00.350
And here of course I don't always want to say switch to sign up.

03:00.350 --> 03:03.020
What I say here depends on the mode we're in.

03:03.020 --> 03:13.050
So here I will now use back ticks which switch to so that here I can inject the dynamic value which

03:13.050 --> 03:20.190
now depends on is sign up and then the dynamic value even is a string where I say log in because of

03:20.280 --> 03:25.340
is sign up is true we switch to log in mode or if is sign up is false.

03:25.470 --> 03:32.360
We switch to the sign up mode because we are in log in mode so that changes the text.

03:32.360 --> 03:39.890
Now here in this function I want to call set is sign up and basically invert it for this we can use

03:39.890 --> 03:47.000
that function form of updating this where here we get our previous state so where I pass a function

03:47.000 --> 03:52.740
to the setter function here and I return what the previous state is not.

03:52.880 --> 03:58.430
So the previous state of course is a boolean because with is sign up we are managing a boolean state

03:58.460 --> 04:00.390
which initially is false.

04:00.620 --> 04:06.200
And now here Dale for I get that current state and I set the opposite as a new state.

04:06.200 --> 04:10.420
So if this is currently true I set it to false if it was false I said it to true.

04:10.430 --> 04:11.980
That's what's happening here.

04:12.810 --> 04:19.000
Now we just need to make sure that different things happen here for Dad all renamed is from sign up

04:19.000 --> 04:28.060
handler to off handler to be more generic and it's naming and of course bind by off handler down there

04:28.810 --> 04:33.130
and now in that off handler function we can check in which mode we are.

04:33.370 --> 04:37.180
So here I can check if is sign up is true.

04:37.180 --> 04:45.110
And if that is the case then of course I want to dispatch this action so that's fine else if that's

04:45.110 --> 04:50.060
not true I want to dispatch the other action and therefore we can even changed as a bit dispatched down

04:50.060 --> 04:53.280
there and define our action up here.

04:53.540 --> 04:57.890
And now my action initially is undefined.

04:57.890 --> 05:10.190
And then I set action either to this or I said action equal to off actions log in with form state input

05:10.190 --> 05:24.250
values whips input values email and form state input values password like that and now action is a variable

05:24.580 --> 05:26.940
which I can pass to dispatch down there.

05:26.980 --> 05:33.880
So I always dispatch does action but does action is ever the result of off actions sign up or of off

05:33.910 --> 05:40.750
actions log in depending on whether we're in sign up mode or in log in mode with that we're really flexible

05:40.750 --> 05:48.860
and now if we safety's if I switch here you see the text updates here on Android as well and therefore

05:48.910 --> 05:56.390
now if I switch to log in mode so if this says log in and at try logging in here make sure you entered

05:56.390 --> 06:02.130
the same credentials you used before for creating this and I press log in.

06:02.130 --> 06:03.300
This looks pretty good.

06:03.300 --> 06:06.730
I get my console output here with the data.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.240
This you or l should return.

06:09.240 --> 06:15.930
So dad looks like it works with Dad we're able to sign up and to log in but of course we're not doing

06:15.930 --> 06:17.930
anything with that token right now.

06:17.970 --> 06:22.740
And of course we also have no error management or a loading state management.

06:22.830 --> 06:24.690
So these are things we'll also have to add.
