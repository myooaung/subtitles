00:02.280 --> 00:05.200
Let's start with styling the draw on the fielders screen.

00:05.220 --> 00:06.560
That's not difficult.

00:06.570 --> 00:11.080
It's something we did before in the filters navigator here in the stack navigator.

00:11.100 --> 00:16.500
When the NHS have to set up the detailed navigation options we're all using for the fab navigator and

00:16.500 --> 00:24.090
our meals navigator so we can just copy this second configuration object here and add this on our filters

00:24.090 --> 00:29.270
navigator here as a second argument to create stack navigator.

00:29.350 --> 00:31.870
Of course you can remove that commented outline.

00:31.870 --> 00:39.220
But with this simple change we're making sure we're using the same navigation bar where action bar style

00:39.220 --> 00:40.450
here.

00:40.450 --> 00:45.580
So that's a simple but useful change now for the draw itself.

00:45.580 --> 00:48.770
What about this look here and the style of the draw.

00:48.780 --> 00:55.690
Now for one you can if you want control the entire draw and change how items are laid out there and

00:55.990 --> 01:01.120
not use this default of having a list with ripple effect here on Android and a different effect than

01:01.120 --> 01:01.910
I was.

01:02.050 --> 01:05.680
But I think that is a nice default which I actually don't want to change.

01:05.710 --> 01:10.930
If you would want to You can however replace this entire component which is rendered in here and it

01:10.930 --> 01:15.850
helps you find a link to the official box where you can learn more about this in case you need to customize

01:15.850 --> 01:16.510
this.

01:16.780 --> 01:25.050
What I of course do want to change is the style of these items and the text which is displayed here.

01:25.060 --> 01:26.550
Now that's not too difficult.

01:26.590 --> 01:32.500
Let's start with the text as a text as you can tell it by default takes these identifiers here meals

01:32.530 --> 01:34.550
father filters.

01:34.570 --> 01:39.020
Now of course it can do that but meals fast.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.250
That's not really a text we want to show to our users.

01:42.250 --> 01:47.540
Therefore I want to override this and we can do this with the good old navigation options which justice

01:47.560 --> 01:53.920
before with the taps where we also could control the label text we have to set on our stack navigators

01:54.160 --> 02:00.460
ever when we're creating the stack navigator there besides setting default navigation options for every

02:00.460 --> 02:05.690
screen in that navigator we can set navigation options for the whole navigator itself which is then

02:05.700 --> 02:10.510
not for the screens in the Navigator but for the navigator when it's used as a screen which is what

02:10.510 --> 02:11.500
we're doing here.

02:11.740 --> 02:19.570
And then here we could set a draw label and could set this to filters with a couple of exclamation marks

02:19.570 --> 02:22.100
just so that we see that this has an effect.

02:22.150 --> 02:23.720
Now we see that here.

02:23.770 --> 02:27.220
So that's where we can set this one option.

02:27.220 --> 02:32.800
Alternatively here when creating the draw and navigator we can use that longer form where we set up

02:32.800 --> 02:38.260
a screen and where we then set up navigation options here and these are simply just alternatives where

02:38.590 --> 02:40.230
neither of the two is better or worse.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.830
You can use several of them.

02:41.980 --> 02:47.840
And now here I will set draw label to meals.

02:47.840 --> 02:52.760
Let's say that seems that makes more sense to me that meals farce.

02:53.600 --> 02:58.670
So with that if I now open the drawer I see meals and filters for filters I now didn't overwrite the

02:58.670 --> 03:02.100
title because I'm fine with the default of taking my identifier.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.580
But for meals I did override it.

03:04.580 --> 03:08.420
Now what about the styling the color and so on.

03:08.420 --> 03:15.020
Well that of course can be controlled as well well justice before with for example the taps where we

03:15.020 --> 03:21.260
also could pass a second argument to create bottom tap navigator to control the layout and the styling

03:21.260 --> 03:22.130
of the taps.

03:22.130 --> 03:28.190
In general we can do the same for the draw to create draw and navigator we can pass a second argument

03:28.220 --> 03:31.320
which is an object configured to draw a navigator itself.

03:31.550 --> 03:33.290
And there we get a couple of options.

03:33.320 --> 03:37.880
Again official box gives you an exhaustive list of everything you can configure.

03:37.880 --> 03:42.980
For example you've got your content options which allows you to control the content in the draw so to

03:42.980 --> 03:47.730
draw items to the end and there you got a bunch of settings you can setup.

03:47.930 --> 03:53.960
For example you can set a active tint color which is basically to color an item has when it's active.

03:54.090 --> 03:59.870
Then we can set this two colors accent color if we want to instead of using that blue default day for

03:59.870 --> 04:00.320
now.

04:00.320 --> 04:05.170
This is orange and this is how easy it is to change this does all we need to do.

04:05.330 --> 04:08.980
Now if you also want to change the font debts you stare.

04:09.080 --> 04:15.710
We can do that as well besides setting act of tint color here on the content options we can set up a

04:15.710 --> 04:17.120
labeled style here.

04:17.120 --> 04:22.010
And that takes a style object which will be applied to the underlying text component in the draw so

04:22.010 --> 04:24.810
we can set up things like text the line there if we want to.

04:24.950 --> 04:32.870
Or in my case you're simply set up the font family and set this to open sense maybe like this.

04:32.870 --> 04:36.550
Not even the bold version if we do that clearly see a difference.

04:36.550 --> 04:40.790
Now I'll set it back to bold actually because that's nicer but to see a difference.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.890
I think it was clear without bold.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.950
So now we're using our own font here.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.570
The bold version and our own color.

04:47.570 --> 04:48.530
And that's pretty neat.

04:48.530 --> 04:54.130
I'd say same of course all the works on Android.

04:54.170 --> 04:58.460
This is how you can work with your draw.

04:58.460 --> 05:01.700
How you can all those style everything there.

05:01.940 --> 05:07.850
And with that you learned about the main navigation patterns you can add to your app with the help of

05:07.850 --> 05:09.270
React navigation.

05:09.290 --> 05:15.770
Now obviously as I emphasized multiple times for this module there's a lot to configure all these navigators

05:15.770 --> 05:20.990
have different navigation options and settings for the navigators themselves and therefore definitely

05:20.990 --> 05:26.060
check out the official box and simply play around with the different settings you see there to experiment

05:26.060 --> 05:31.820
with what you can do the things I showed here and the things we changed here are probably the common

05:31.820 --> 05:35.000
things you want to customize which is why it did showed him here.

05:35.090 --> 05:36.580
But again there is so much to do.

05:36.590 --> 05:40.950
Definitely check out the official docs for this app.

05:40.970 --> 05:43.960
The navigation part is basically done.

05:43.970 --> 05:46.410
There's not too much else to add.

05:46.430 --> 05:50.360
Now it's time to revisit the general styling.

05:50.360 --> 05:56.600
For example make sure we are using the right fonts everywhere also in the tabs and in the header and

05:56.660 --> 06:00.590
for example all the forward the text here which we're currently not.

06:00.590 --> 06:06.050
And then also fill the rest of the app with some meat for example the detail page here which still has

06:06.050 --> 06:11.810
some dummy content at the moment and also our filters page which also just has dummy content.

06:11.810 --> 06:14.290
That's what I'll do in the rest of this module.

06:14.330 --> 06:20.330
They're often the next module will all to make sure that we add more logic and that we for example can

06:20.330 --> 06:25.700
mark something as a favorite and Candy for that added to the favorites tab which currently doesn't work.

06:25.910 --> 06:30.470
But for now let's finish the styling and add the rest of the layout and content to this app.
