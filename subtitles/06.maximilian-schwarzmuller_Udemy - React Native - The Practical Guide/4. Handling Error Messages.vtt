00:02.260 --> 00:07.960
For this I'm back and his application we worked on this Gold's application where we can add some goals

00:07.960 --> 00:13.510
here and this is the code we wrote there I haven't changed anything in there.

00:13.630 --> 00:19.370
Now let me showcase the different things that could go wrong and how you fix them.

00:20.290 --> 00:21.760
So let's start simple.

00:21.790 --> 00:28.930
Let's say we have a simple syntax error here where we open our model in the end by setting the Met At

00:28.930 --> 00:30.000
Mode to true.

00:30.040 --> 00:35.860
Let me remove that closing bracket and it's a clearer syntax error it's a error we can and we should

00:35.860 --> 00:40.090
totally a wide because we as a developer made a clear mistake.

00:40.090 --> 00:45.490
A The good thing is even our idea e recognizes this and gives us a warning here though unfortunately

00:45.520 --> 00:47.890
the error it's showing here is not entirely correct.

00:47.890 --> 00:50.370
It says that it's expecting a comma.

00:50.380 --> 00:54.120
Well actually that's not the real problem the real problem is a missing bracket.

00:54.190 --> 00:57.160
Still we get an idea that something's wrong here.

00:57.160 --> 01:02.890
And whilst you still need to think about the issue and you can't blindly use that solution by looking

01:02.890 --> 01:06.700
at that code at some point you should find out that there is a missing bracket.

01:07.030 --> 01:12.670
Even if you forget this and you saved as let's say then the javascript bundle will be built here as

01:12.670 --> 01:18.520
you see I launched this on both Android and iOS and now we're getting this red error screen I was talking

01:18.520 --> 01:20.440
about it again here.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.280
We can simply read the error message.

01:23.410 --> 01:29.410
It's still pointing us at the wrong solution expecting a comma but it does point us at the right code

01:29.410 --> 01:29.780
line.

01:29.830 --> 01:36.580
Here you see it highlights this button title at new goal line so it still shows us where we should look

01:37.060 --> 01:41.170
and that the issue is probably stemming from this line.

01:41.170 --> 01:48.490
We get the same error by the way here in this console and although in our expo def tools here there

01:48.490 --> 01:53.470
you see the same error message all with a hint at the line where does error is coming from.

01:53.470 --> 01:58.770
So you're getting a lot of help for tracking down this issue now here.

01:58.780 --> 02:04.270
It's unfortunately still not picking up that I fixed this error and hence here we see it crashed by

02:04.270 --> 02:05.650
us on Android.

02:05.650 --> 02:07.690
It's not reloading now on Android.

02:07.690 --> 02:10.000
We see a command we can use to reload the app.

02:10.090 --> 02:16.240
We can click down there or press our twice to reload but it's still on picking up the change here even

02:16.240 --> 02:18.010
though I fixed that in code.

02:18.010 --> 02:21.850
So one solution here is to simply stop the packets or restart NPM start.

02:21.970 --> 02:27.910
This happens rarely but sometimes this breaks and then simply restarting this NPM start process is the

02:27.910 --> 02:29.480
thing to do.

02:29.530 --> 02:35.500
And with that I'll rerun it on Android but pressing I by pressing a and on I by pressing I.

02:35.570 --> 02:37.850
And now it relaunch the app on these devices.

02:37.870 --> 02:43.540
Again this will happen rarely but sometimes it will just happens and you can just restarted to get this

02:43.540 --> 02:45.500
back to work correctly.

02:45.520 --> 02:50.380
Now with that running again let me show you an example for the error message you're getting where you

02:50.380 --> 02:53.800
don't have a syntax error but you still have a clear bug in your code.

02:54.640 --> 03:02.830
Let's say when we add a goal here with the goal title we add a check where we see if goal title length

03:02.950 --> 03:09.520
is greater than zero to check that the value is not empty or actually that it is equal to zero which

03:09.520 --> 03:11.700
means the user didn't enter a title.

03:11.700 --> 03:17.740
And in this case we just return which means we're not going to add this goal here and we're all not

03:17.740 --> 03:18.790
going to close the modal.

03:18.790 --> 03:21.610
So we're just ignoring the user input because it's empty.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.130
We might want to show error message.

03:23.140 --> 03:26.470
But for now we'll just do it like this.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.120
Now when we do that it will generally work.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.230
All right here.

03:30.230 --> 03:37.400
Right if I save this and we go back here opened it and I click at you see I can't add an empty goal

03:37.430 --> 03:40.650
I have to enter something for this to disappear.

03:40.670 --> 03:47.030
Now let's say in our goal input component where we are fetching user input where we then forward it

03:47.030 --> 03:55.990
by calling on ADD goal here we forget to do that we forward now here or we forward nothing because we

03:55.990 --> 04:02.200
simply forgot to add this year now our app starts just fine it doesn't break immediately because we

04:02.200 --> 04:10.760
have no clear error in our code no syntax error but if I enter something here and I click Add I get

04:10.820 --> 04:14.510
undefined is not an object evaluating gold high length.

04:14.540 --> 04:18.170
And again this is an error message that helps us.

04:18.170 --> 04:24.680
It informs us that the problem has something to do with something being undefined and that it is related

04:24.680 --> 04:27.280
to this gold title length check.

04:27.470 --> 04:33.130
And then you could dive into the place where you access gold title length and trace down the issue.

04:33.320 --> 04:39.020
So we're having problems getting the length of gold title because it's undefined as it seems while we're

04:39.020 --> 04:39.800
getting it here.

04:39.800 --> 04:45.320
So the error is certainly not here but let's go to the place where at Gold handler is called in the

04:45.320 --> 04:46.130
end.

04:46.130 --> 04:51.620
Now if you remember we're passing this to the on add gold prop here on gold input so we should probably

04:51.620 --> 04:56.780
go to the gold input which you by the way can also do by holding command or control and clicking on

04:56.780 --> 05:04.460
the component name well in there we call on it gold here and oh here we see what the error is of course

05:04.460 --> 05:08.360
in this case I constructed this error a year but you get my point.

05:08.360 --> 05:13.790
Obviously this is an error you could certainly have in your code where you forgot to add it where you

05:13.790 --> 05:19.120
maybe change the way your code works and you forgot to adjust it in all the places and therefore you're

05:19.130 --> 05:20.610
suddenly getting this error.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.900
Now the error message helped us find the issue.
