00:02.280 --> 00:08.810
So whenever our location changes here in the location picker I want to inform the new place screen.

00:09.030 --> 00:11.460
Well that of course means dead here.

00:11.490 --> 00:20.400
When I picked up place on the map or although here if I got the user location in both cases I went to

00:21.030 --> 00:26.840
trigger a method or a function which I expect to get from my new place screen.

00:26.940 --> 00:31.740
So the same thing as we're doing it on the image picker and yet there once I took a image I called Props

00:31.800 --> 00:35.810
on image taken to call a function that the parent component.

00:35.850 --> 00:40.360
So the new place screen can pass to the image picker and I want to do the same here.

00:40.390 --> 00:43.080
When I use the same pattern here in the location picker.

00:43.110 --> 00:50.820
So here after picking a location with D please locate me button I want to trigger props on location

00:50.910 --> 01:02.720
picked and forward this location in the end right and I want to do the exact same thing if I got a new

01:02.720 --> 01:03.560
map location.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.640
So besides setting the internal location to update the preview I'll forward.

01:08.900 --> 01:14.570
In this case here the map pick location so on location picked us now a prop we can set on the location

01:14.570 --> 01:20.030
picker so I'll do that here in the new place screen and this should now point to a function which will

01:20.030 --> 01:28.960
receive the picked location so here we can add the location picked handler.

01:29.020 --> 01:37.870
This is a function and this function will of course receive the location in the end and for the moment

01:38.200 --> 01:46.020
I'll just console log at their and then take the function name here and passed it to all location picked

01:46.170 --> 01:51.770
Soledad a reference to this function is passed to on location picked into the location picker.

01:51.840 --> 01:56.430
Now one important thing on location picked is getting used and use effect here.

01:56.460 --> 01:59.190
Therefore we should specify it as a dependency.

01:59.400 --> 02:05.730
So to only specify this and not all our props I'll use this D structuring syntax for I get all location

02:05.730 --> 02:10.230
picked out of my props like this so that I can use it without props.

02:10.320 --> 02:17.340
Now I can use it here on location picked and now to make sure we get no infinite loop back in the new

02:17.340 --> 02:20.850
place screen where we do with sand in this function.

02:21.030 --> 02:27.120
I need to make sure that the location picked handler which is what I do provide on location picked is

02:27.750 --> 02:29.620
a function that doesn't change all the time.

02:29.640 --> 02:37.830
So here I'll import use callback and wrap use callback around my location picked handler to avoid that

02:37.830 --> 02:42.380
this gets recreated with every render cycle in it therefore get into an infinite loop.

02:42.660 --> 02:47.760
And here use callback needs no dependencies because in there right now I'm doing nothing with external

02:47.760 --> 02:49.350
data.

02:49.420 --> 02:55.630
So now we should see that log hopefully when we ever select a user with the Get use location button

02:56.930 --> 02:57.930
and that's looking good.

02:58.040 --> 03:02.700
Here's my output and the same if I pick it on the map.

03:02.710 --> 03:12.520
So if I pick a location here and I click save I also get this outward so that seems to work this year

03:12.520 --> 03:13.740
was my first output.

03:13.810 --> 03:18.430
This was the second output for picking it on the map was Dad we have the information available in the

03:18.430 --> 03:19.740
new place screen.

03:19.840 --> 03:24.680
Now we just need to store it in some state there as we're doing it with the title and the image.

03:24.720 --> 03:32.080
Saudi selected location selected location and set selected location.

03:32.080 --> 03:39.400
We get that with the help of U.S. state and now we can call set selected location in here and set our

03:39.400 --> 03:44.770
location like this don't need to specify this as a dependency.

03:44.770 --> 03:50.540
You could but react will guarantee that it doesn't change any ways so you don't need to specify this.

03:50.930 --> 03:59.830
And now we got our selected location here we can now use this in the safe place handler there besides

03:59.830 --> 04:02.560
forwarding title value in selected image.

04:02.560 --> 04:10.420
We can now also forward the selected location to ad place and they offer the next thing we'll do is

04:10.480 --> 04:16.960
work on our redux logic to take that location into account and that's one thing that's missing right

04:16.990 --> 04:17.650
now.

04:17.650 --> 04:22.750
Also make sure we translate this coordinate pair we get into a human readable address as well.
