Now there is one other place in the APA I want to use my own font that's here in the recipes list.

00:07.170 --> 00:10.080
This text here simple affordable and the duration.

00:10.200 --> 00:13.400
That's not using our own font and that's something I want to change.

00:13.620 --> 00:16.110
And that's of course our email item here.

00:16.110 --> 00:23.460
There we have these free text components and these simply need to get a style that uses our own fund

00:23.910 --> 00:28.470
now by the way early and of course you'll learn about alternatives to that instead of assigning a style

00:28.470 --> 00:30.690
and repeating a style assignment here.

00:30.690 --> 00:36.210
You could also create your own wrapper component as we did with body text earlier in the course which

00:36.210 --> 00:41.430
is simply wrapping the built in text component that always sets your own font family that will be an

00:41.430 --> 00:47.550
alternative or you set up a global style which you import into this fall and actually not think about

00:47.550 --> 00:49.350
it since we'll have more text later.

00:49.350 --> 00:54.990
I will create my own wrapper component here and I'll have my let's say default text J.S. file here you

00:54.990 --> 01:00.330
can name does whatever you want it in there I'll import react from react because I'm creating a react

01:00.330 --> 01:06.950
component and import text and style sheet from React Native.

01:07.050 --> 01:10.500
And now this is a thin wrapper around the built in text component.

01:10.500 --> 01:17.550
So default text this component here is simply a component which returns the built in text component

01:17.940 --> 01:24.300
around props start children so that we can use default text with opening and closing tax and in between

01:24.300 --> 01:32.730
pass our text and they're all point at style start text here to assign my own textile make sure style

01:32.730 --> 01:40.280
sheet is imported for this and then use style used to solitude to create one down there and store it

01:40.280 --> 01:48.050
in the styles constant Of course all the export default text thereafter and now here in text I will

01:48.050 --> 01:54.170
simply set up a font family of open sense that should be my default here that's the only thing I'll

01:54.170 --> 01:59.870
change and now we can use default text whenever we have text in the app that should use our own custom

01:59.870 --> 02:10.000
font family so for example here on the meal item we can now import does custom text so import default

02:10.000 --> 02:18.360
text from DOT slashed you full text from our own component there and now use it default text down there

02:18.900 --> 02:27.110
instead of the text component which I'm currently using just like this and though with that if we now

02:27.110 --> 02:32.290
go there this actually is our own custom font it doesn't look that different but it is our own font.

02:32.480 --> 02:38.630
This is especially clear if we go there and we change this to open sense bold of course because the

02:38.630 --> 02:48.320
bold version is always a bit easier to recognize but I'll change it back to the non bold version so

02:48.320 --> 02:53.300
we have our own custom texture as well you could style everything things here as well add colors add

02:53.330 --> 02:59.150
icons whatever you want I'm done with my styling for the moment now I want to make sure that we have

02:59.240 --> 03:05.360
more meaningful content here on the detail page before we done also later work on the filters screen

03:05.360 --> 03:05.600
here.
