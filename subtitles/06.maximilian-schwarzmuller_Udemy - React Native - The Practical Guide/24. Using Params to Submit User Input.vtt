So what about submitting this the submit button of course is in our header and they offer you learned

00:07.880 --> 00:10.460
how you can connect header and component.

00:10.460 --> 00:12.230
We did it with the help of parents.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.980
So I'll add a new function here in the edit product component.

00:16.220 --> 00:23.320
Submit handler could be the name and then there in this function I want to do whatever needs to be done

00:23.320 --> 00:25.270
to add a product or updated.

00:25.330 --> 00:27.700
So we need to dispatch some regex actions.

00:27.700 --> 00:34.160
For now I'll just console log submitting here so did we see that this executed.

00:34.270 --> 00:40.530
Now we need to pass that submit handler to our parents and we can do that with the help of use effect

00:40.540 --> 00:48.640
here which I show you early already and also with use callback and we wrap our function here with use

00:48.640 --> 00:49.700
callback.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.360
And of course this function has no dependencies right now.

00:52.360 --> 00:57.370
So we can just use it like this does ensures the dysfunction isn't recreated every time the component

00:57.400 --> 01:00.720
renders and therefore we are white entering an infinite loop.

01:00.880 --> 01:06.890
And now we can execute use effect here to execute a function after every render cycle.

01:07.090 --> 01:10.510
And here our dependency is submit handler which never changes.

01:10.510 --> 01:16.240
Which means right now it is only executes once which is great because then we can set parents here pass

01:16.240 --> 01:25.670
an object where we bind submit as a key to the submit handler now submit is a parameter which we can

01:25.670 --> 01:38.000
retrieve here in our header our submit function can be fetch from nav data navigation get param submit

01:38.420 --> 01:43.880
that's the key I just set up in the set parents call and submit function is there for what should be

01:43.880 --> 01:50.720
executed when this button is pressed I'll just point on press to that submit function at the end now.

01:50.730 --> 01:55.770
Right now one little change has all the required use callback like this would actually recreate it every

01:55.770 --> 02:00.180
time does re renders we need to pass and that second argument which should be an empty array now it

02:00.180 --> 02:04.170
is function will never be recreated and now we await an infinite loop.

02:04.170 --> 02:12.220
So now if we go to the admin screen go here and click this button you actually see submitting here and

02:12.220 --> 02:13.690
that works day for as it should.
