WEBVTT

00:02.350 --> 00:05.320
With that we added taps and yes on favorites.

00:05.330 --> 00:06.970
We're not doing anything yet.

00:06.970 --> 00:08.370
That's something that we'll follow.

00:08.380 --> 00:14.070
But we have taps at least before we work on the favorites.

00:14.070 --> 00:19.620
Let's work on the taps a bit more because right now we have taps on Android that don't really look like

00:19.620 --> 00:25.080
we would expect Android taps to look like this looks more like IAW taps if you ask me.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.840
Sure it works and you can keep dead of deaths the style you want.

00:27.840 --> 00:33.090
Nothing wrong with that but it would be nice for two of them were Android specific look maybe and for

00:33.090 --> 00:39.300
Dad we have a separate navigator we can create though we have to install the extra package for this

00:39.390 --> 00:41.180
first of all so let's do that.

00:41.860 --> 00:45.660
Let me quick to equate that server here and run npm install dash dash save.

00:45.660 --> 00:53.490
And now that's react dash navigation dash material dash bottom dash taps.

00:53.490 --> 00:58.920
By the way they're all is react navigation material top taps I'll not dive into that in discourse here

00:59.130 --> 01:04.170
but attached you all to find a link where you can learn more about that alternative Navigator will use

01:04.170 --> 01:09.130
the material bottom taps navigator here and install this package does is how we started.

01:09.150 --> 01:13.800
So let's wait for that installation to finish and thereafter let's install one other package which will

01:13.890 --> 01:25.240
also need with NPM installed dash dash save and that's react dash native dash paper let's install this

01:25.240 --> 01:26.680
as well.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.720
And Wednesday's installation is finished.

01:28.810 --> 01:32.400
Let's restart the exposed server with NPM.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.940
Start again because now we installed packages that help us render an alternative.

01:37.970 --> 01:43.780
Tab navigator and it's thankfully really straightforward to use and has pretty much the same or very

01:43.780 --> 01:48.730
similar configuration options than the bottom tab navigator especially when it comes to how we set up

01:48.730 --> 01:54.730
icons and so on attached you find all the docs for this alternative navigator and for dead yet another

01:55.000 --> 01:56.160
alternative navigator.

01:56.290 --> 02:05.080
I mentioned and let's use it by importing from this newly installed installed react navigation material

02:05.080 --> 02:12.770
bottom taps navigator package here and from there we can import to create material bottom tap navigator.

02:12.830 --> 02:14.310
Function here.

02:14.450 --> 02:18.950
Now make sure you all have platform imports because we'll now need this because I only want to use this

02:18.950 --> 02:21.980
navigator instead of to create bottom tab navigator.

02:21.980 --> 02:31.070
If we're on Android so here we can check whether platform OS is equal to Android.

02:31.070 --> 02:36.830
And in that case I want to use that new create material bottom tab Navigator a function which I just

02:36.830 --> 02:37.680
imported.

02:37.740 --> 02:44.060
Otherwise after the colon we'll use the bottom tab navigator we set up in the previous lecture.

02:44.060 --> 02:49.700
So that of course leaves us with one question How does D material bottom tap navigator work how do we

02:49.700 --> 02:50.880
configured it.

02:50.990 --> 02:56.750
And the good news here is generally it works the same as the bottom tab navigator.

02:56.750 --> 03:01.100
There are some details you can configure on the tab navigator itself.

03:01.100 --> 03:05.670
So for example which color to assume when and so on that differs.

03:05.690 --> 03:12.210
But regarding how you set up your tabs and match screens and set up icons that's exactly the same.

03:12.350 --> 03:18.650
And therefore we can actually take this entire screen config here cut it from here and store this in

03:18.650 --> 03:24.350
a separate constant here which I'll name tab screen can't think you can name it whatever you want because

03:24.350 --> 03:25.990
that can be reused.

03:26.240 --> 03:33.070
And now I use to tap screen config as a first argument both in the bottom tab Navigator as well as indeed

03:33.080 --> 03:40.010
material bottom tab navigator just like this and that only leaves us with an alternative second argument

03:40.160 --> 03:45.290
which we pass to material bottom tab navigator and just bottom tab navigator.

03:45.290 --> 03:51.330
This second argument we passed this object we pass as a second argument as LURD allows us to configure

03:51.330 --> 03:56.730
the tab navigator itself for example set up tap our options like the active tint color.

03:56.990 --> 04:05.480
And that difference a bit because for the material bottom tab navigator we don't set up tab bar options

04:05.480 --> 04:07.950
to configure our active tint color.

04:07.970 --> 04:14.530
Instead we directly have an active 10 color here in this object itself on the bottom tab navigator.

04:14.570 --> 04:17.330
We had this in a nested object in the tap our options.

04:17.330 --> 04:18.950
We don't have that here.

04:18.950 --> 04:24.590
Instead here we just set active 10 color like that two colors acts and color and there are other settings

04:24.590 --> 04:29.660
as well for example you can set shifting to true and I'll show what this doesn't what false starts in

04:29.660 --> 04:30.800
a second.

04:30.890 --> 04:39.550
And with that that's it for now if we now safety's this will rebuild our project and reloaded on the

04:39.550 --> 04:42.980
screen and we have the same tabs as before on.

04:42.980 --> 04:43.550
I was.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.140
That didn't change.

04:45.140 --> 04:48.440
But on Android we now have that more material.

04:48.500 --> 04:53.200
Look tab navigator here where we can now also switch like this.

04:53.240 --> 04:59.270
And that's this shifting effect which you see here that the tabs grow that the label only exists on

04:59.270 --> 05:00.740
the tab which is active.

05:00.860 --> 05:05.990
And if you said shifting to false here by the way you simply don't have does effect then you always

05:05.990 --> 05:08.390
have your labels there on Android as well.

05:08.390 --> 05:12.490
So deaths now are a look that looks a bit more like Android.

05:12.650 --> 05:19.990
I would say and stay for the look which I want to have here and you can take this even further.

05:20.070 --> 05:23.690
Let's say we want to change the entire Tap Bar.

05:23.830 --> 05:25.150
Background color here.

05:25.320 --> 05:30.800
Depending on which tab is selected and have a nice ripple effect that changes this along the way.

05:31.110 --> 05:36.360
For this we can go to our screen conflict and there to the navigation options and there we have to tap

05:36.360 --> 05:37.780
our icon.

05:37.800 --> 05:42.760
We can also set up a tap bar color here when this tab is selected.

05:42.810 --> 05:51.160
So to say for example set the two colors primary color and now important this only has an effect.

05:51.200 --> 05:58.850
If you do set shifting to true otherwise just tap out a color prop which I'm setting up here will have

05:58.850 --> 06:05.390
no effect because only the shifting effect supports this which will now have the effect will now have

06:06.640 --> 06:12.810
is that if I save this get the same look on ISIS because they're tap our color has no effect.

06:13.030 --> 06:17.770
But now you see we really have our Primary Colors a background of meals are selected.

06:17.770 --> 06:21.980
If we select favorites that changes to the average color.

06:22.030 --> 06:27.940
Now this change of course doesn't look that beautiful and therefore we can simply change that by also

06:27.940 --> 06:30.950
giving our favorites screen its own tap our color.

06:30.970 --> 06:36.430
So there we could say in the navigation options of the favorites screen next to tap or I can we set

06:36.900 --> 06:44.340
the tap or color dear to accent color what will now have is a differently colored Tap Bar which switches

06:44.340 --> 06:51.250
from our primary color for meals here to does X and color for favorites with this nice ripple effect.

06:51.250 --> 06:56.910
And of course down to is that we don't see the icon then because accent color for a tap or color is

06:56.910 --> 06:57.740
not a good choice.

06:57.750 --> 07:01.020
If our 10 color is all the x and color.

07:01.020 --> 07:06.270
So if we use does effect we might want to use white here as a thin color which we can always see against

07:06.270 --> 07:13.020
both the primary and the X and color and therefore here for the act of tint color we might want to use

07:13.020 --> 07:18.750
white instead of our accent color because white will work for both taps then no matter if the tap passed

07:18.750 --> 07:24.540
and colored and the primary color that dark purple or in the accent color that orange Therefore now

07:24.540 --> 07:26.640
you see we have this effect here.

07:26.640 --> 07:32.610
And this nice ripple change to the average tap here for favorites and I think that's a pretty sweet

07:32.730 --> 07:39.120
and easy to implement change that makes this look great on Android and certainly gives us a more distinctive

07:39.240 --> 07:45.660
android like look whilst keeping the default IOW look you would expect on that platform it's really

07:45.660 --> 07:47.730
easy to implement as you can tell.

07:47.820 --> 07:52.700
Now a quick side note if you don't want to use this shifting effect which I want to use here.

07:52.710 --> 07:58.020
But if you wouldn't want to use it then of course you might notice that the background color of your

07:58.020 --> 08:06.350
taps on Android is not your primary color but instead it is a bit lighter purple purple bluish color.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.060
Now typically you might want to change this too of course.

08:09.060 --> 08:12.060
And as you see Tap Bar color simply has no effect.

08:12.060 --> 08:14.080
This only works with shifting.

08:14.310 --> 08:21.330
Now if you want to change your background color for the entire Tap Bar in the non shifting case then

08:21.330 --> 08:29.570
all you have to do is here on the configuration of your tap navigator itself because it affects the

08:29.570 --> 08:30.410
entire Tap Bar.

08:30.410 --> 08:36.980
Now you can set up a bar style property and that simply is a style object where you can for example

08:36.980 --> 08:43.240
set the background color to colors primary like this and does simply changes the background color off

08:43.240 --> 08:47.180
the navigation bar for our Android bottom bar here.

08:47.180 --> 08:52.750
So that's how you can change this if you don't want to use the shifting pattern here.

08:52.790 --> 08:53.860
Shifting look.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.000
I will turn on shifting again.

08:56.010 --> 09:01.370
That will set this to true again because I really like this different colored Tap Bar I think that's

09:01.370 --> 09:07.100
a really nice look with that ripple effect that changes the color and that's how easy it is to implement

09:07.130 --> 09:08.660
different tap bars.

09:08.660 --> 09:13.820
Now again there are a bunch of configuration options both for the Tap Bar itself as well for it navigation

09:13.820 --> 09:18.590
options off the screens you have inside of your tap bar and therefore you find you official docks attached

09:18.590 --> 09:22.490
where you can dive into every single option and explore them and play around with them.
