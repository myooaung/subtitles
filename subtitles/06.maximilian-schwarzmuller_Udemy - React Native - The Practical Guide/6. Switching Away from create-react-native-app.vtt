WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:04.940
Now for this I will actually create a new project.

00:05.050 --> 00:10.490
Simply search for React Native on google and you'll find your official React Native docs.

00:10.530 --> 00:17.050
Now we'll follow de creation approach or one of creation approaches which is recommended there for that

00:17.050 --> 00:21.310
simply click on get started there and then important on this page.

00:21.310 --> 00:28.270
Don't follow the Quick Start which essentially just uses create react native app but choose building

00:28.270 --> 00:34.810
projects with native code and there you'll find instructions for different operating systems and your

00:34.810 --> 00:38.480
different operating systems on the target devices.

00:38.500 --> 00:44.980
Please note dead windows at ISIS is not support because you need a Mac to build Iowa's apps that's simply

00:44.980 --> 00:46.540
a requirement by Apple.

00:46.540 --> 00:53.770
Now my strong recommendation here is dead you go through these steps here for your operating system

00:53.770 --> 00:59.980
step by step because you can easily copy the command stair and this allows you to quickly install all

00:59.980 --> 01:03.810
the extra tools you need and then get started in the end.

01:03.810 --> 01:06.100
Setup is pretty straightforward here.

01:06.100 --> 01:11.680
You need a couple of helper tools as you can see for example here on windows you will need to execute

01:11.680 --> 01:17.800
this command with administration rights in the command prompt so right click on the executable and run

01:17.800 --> 01:25.780
it as administrator and once you install this year on windows and on Mac you installed node and Watchmen

01:25.780 --> 01:26.800
with brute.

01:27.010 --> 01:34.030
We are all on the same step where we have to install the react native CLIA and for this will use NPM.

01:34.030 --> 01:41.500
This node package manager we simply run this command which we can just copy in our terminal or command

01:41.500 --> 01:41.990
prompt.

01:42.070 --> 01:47.070
Now important on Mac and Linux you might need to add sudo in front of this.

01:47.170 --> 01:53.760
If you're getting any permission issues now enter your password your log and password here.

01:53.770 --> 01:58.450
If you're prompted for it and they're off their list will install the react data seal i.e. globally

01:59.140 --> 02:01.000
with that installed.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.880
We should make sure that we fulfill all the other requirements here for Android and Mac OS so that we

02:06.880 --> 02:13.210
have the Android Studio and JD K. was an 8 and so on installed and I will do all of that together with

02:13.210 --> 02:15.730
you in the next lectures too.

02:15.760 --> 02:21.070
So there you see that in great detail but again always check out these details steps.

02:21.100 --> 02:27.220
In case you're facing any issues for your platform because here you have to all written down step by

02:27.220 --> 02:28.040
step.

02:28.060 --> 02:33.610
For example don't forget to set these environment variables so that all the tools can find what they

02:33.610 --> 02:36.880
need and follow fruity steps carefully.

02:36.880 --> 02:40.720
Again I will also show you this in the next lectures.

02:40.720 --> 02:44.900
Now you'll then be able to create a new project by running react native in it.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.120
Awesome project or whatever project name you want to use.

02:48.490 --> 02:52.520
So you do that in which ever folder you want to create that project.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.820
So that's React Native in it.

02:55.030 --> 02:59.320
And then any name you want like are in course that will be your project name and the name of the folder

02:59.320 --> 03:01.510
which is created and then and that's important.

03:01.510 --> 03:02.890
Don't hit enter yet.

03:02.890 --> 03:08.350
Instead add a blank and then dash dash word in and then another blank and other whitespace and then

03:08.560 --> 03:15.310
react dash native one word just split across two lines for me here but that's one word react dash native

03:15.730 --> 03:22.450
at without a blank and things though just to add right after react native at seared not 5 9.

03:22.450 --> 03:28.200
Now what this does is it creates a new project where we use to react native versions here not 5 9.

03:28.210 --> 03:31.720
Now at the point you're viewing this there might be a slightly newer version.

03:31.900 --> 03:37.060
Some parts of this course some third party package has to be precise will not work with that version

03:37.060 --> 03:39.490
yet so that you're not facing any issues.

03:39.520 --> 03:45.520
I recommend going with this version I will of course continue to update this course and replace packages

03:45.520 --> 03:51.250
that won't work with the newest version but since this takes time and you won't miss anything by not

03:51.250 --> 03:57.550
using the very latest version of React Native I recommend that you stick to sort of 5 9 right now.

03:57.640 --> 04:02.770
Again I'll of course keep this course updated and ensure we all can use all new shiny features of any

04:02.770 --> 04:03.790
third party package.

04:03.850 --> 04:08.980
But with this version of React Native so sort of 5 9 you are learning React Native in a correct way

04:08.980 --> 04:16.480
with the latest syntax you're not missing out on anything and this will create a new project which will

04:16.480 --> 04:24.100
then allow you to create a react native app in a slightly different in a slightly more powerful way

04:24.340 --> 04:29.740
than you could do it with the create react native app project we had before.

04:29.830 --> 04:36.340
So this simply installs a couple of dependencies a couple of things in the project and once it's done

04:37.060 --> 04:42.430
you can follow the instructions here to run your app again for Dad you need to have these other tools

04:42.430 --> 04:47.290
like Android Studio X code and so on installed which I will do together with you in the next lectures

04:47.860 --> 04:49.550
and I want to be honest here.

04:49.570 --> 04:56.620
I recorded this lecture after I initially recorded the course because the setup process changed slightly.

04:56.620 --> 05:02.590
Now you will be able to follow along just fine because the folder structure ends on is equal to what

05:02.590 --> 05:03.520
we had before.

05:04.040 --> 05:09.590
And indeed we can simply open the newly created Project in our IDE e once we have it.

05:09.850 --> 05:14.110
Here it is and this is essentially the same set up you will see in the rest of the videos.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.510
There's just one important adjustment.

05:16.510 --> 05:22.960
When I later run my app on a simulator and I show you how to set it all up in the next lectures I will

05:22.960 --> 05:26.500
run NPM run ISIS or NPM run Android.

05:26.710 --> 05:28.180
With this changed setup.

05:28.180 --> 05:38.800
This should be react native run ISIS or react native run Android with a dash between run and Android

05:38.830 --> 05:39.720
or run.

05:39.790 --> 05:40.780
And ISIS.

05:40.870 --> 05:45.580
You can always go into the package does Jason fall here and there in the scripts.

05:45.730 --> 05:54.460
You can add a script called Io s where you execute react native run OS and add a script named Android

05:54.460 --> 06:00.530
here where you execute react native run Android so you simply add these two items.

06:00.610 --> 06:05.740
Don't forget to double quotation marks they are important you add these two items to the script section

06:05.740 --> 06:09.570
here and thereafter you can indeed run the same commands.

06:09.610 --> 06:15.640
I run in this course with NPM or on Android for example to behind the scenes execute react native run

06:15.640 --> 06:21.660
Android which is the right thing to run right now so you will be able to do that again in the next lectures.

06:21.670 --> 06:26.560
I walk through all the required set up to run your app on an emulator ends on.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.560
This is the setup we will use for the rest of this course.
