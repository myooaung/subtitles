00:02.290 --> 00:08.230
I want to start by creating a new project again and for this, I'll again use create react native app.

00:08.440 --> 00:14.910
Now one important note at this point, we will eventually eject from this set up to get more power over

00:14.920 --> 00:22.690
the configuration and to also be able to build this for deployment which we ultimately of course want

00:22.690 --> 00:24.550
to do because there are some limitations

00:24.550 --> 00:30.790
if we stay in the create react native app world. It's great for setting up a project though especially

00:30.790 --> 00:33.280
since we can easily eject later,

00:33.400 --> 00:34.830
so let's install it

00:34.840 --> 00:40.060
and if you haven't done this in the first course module already, here's the command you need to execute.

00:40.090 --> 00:43.120
You will need npm for that and you need it later too

00:43.210 --> 00:46.400
so for that, you should install nodejs from

00:46.420 --> 00:48.080
nodejs.org

00:48.370 --> 00:53.350
and once you got that installed and once you install the create react native app, you can simply open

00:53.350 --> 01:00.000
your normal terminal or command line on Mac or Windows depending on where you are and there navigate

01:00.030 --> 01:03.790
into the folder where you want to create this new project

01:03.940 --> 01:11.120
and in there you simply run create-react-native-app with dashes between these words and then the

01:11.210 --> 01:17.650
name of the project and of the folder you want to create, I'll name it rn-course for react native

01:17.650 --> 01:18.040
course

01:18.040 --> 01:23.500
of course. This will now create this folder and install all the dependencies,

01:23.500 --> 01:32.290
if you see an error here, that npm version 5 isn't supported, simply downgrade to npm version 4, instructions

01:32.290 --> 01:34.600
about as can be found attached to this video,

01:34.780 --> 01:39.040
you probably don't face this error anymore at the point of time you're doing this though,

01:39.100 --> 01:43.030
but if you do, then follow the instructions which are attached to this video.

01:43.030 --> 01:49.180
Now with that, I'll wait for this to finish and then we'll open this in an IDE and start working on this

01:49.180 --> 01:50.570
project,

01:50.590 --> 01:56.370
so the set up finished here and we could run npm start to start this development server and then open

01:56.370 --> 01:58.390
the app through the expo app

01:58.810 --> 02:05.690
but before we do that, let me open this application we created, this project we created with Visual

02:05.710 --> 02:07.510
Studio Code which is the IDE

02:07.540 --> 02:12.990
I will use here. So I open the project with visual studio code,

02:13.070 --> 02:14.930
it's a fast and free IDE

02:14.930 --> 02:21.670
but of course you could also use webstorm or you could use atom or sublime,

02:21.710 --> 02:30.290
you don't really use Xcode or Android Studio though because after all it's still a javascript project,

02:30.290 --> 02:36.090
we build native apps but we don't write native app code directly here,

02:36.200 --> 02:44.990
we don't write Swift or Android code so therefore, a web editor, a web IDE is a great choice.

02:45.020 --> 02:50.330
Now in this new project, we only got a couple of files as you already learned in the first course module,

02:50.330 --> 02:55.690
most of them are configuration files like package.json which defines our dependencies

02:56.000 --> 03:02.900
and we got this app.js file which actually hosts or holds our well root component in the end,

03:03.100 --> 03:06.420
the root component which makes up our application.

03:06.440 --> 03:13.040
Now we can't really see how this component gets loaded due to the set up we're using here with create react

03:13.040 --> 03:14.190
native app,

03:14.240 --> 03:18.180
one of the reasons why I want to eject, I want to show you how this gets loaded.

03:18.440 --> 03:25.700
Additionally whatever we build here in the end will always be wrapped by the expo app or this expo

03:25.700 --> 03:27.800
service which stands behind the app

03:28.040 --> 03:34.340
if we build it for native devices. This is why I will soon eject from this configuration so that

03:34.340 --> 03:37.120
we have a pure react native project we can work on

03:37.160 --> 03:41.850
but for now, let's stay in this world and let's dive into this app.js

03:41.890 --> 03:48.680
file. We already changed it in the first course module but it's super super important for you to understand

03:48.680 --> 03:52.280
what's going on here which is why I'll spend some time on it.

03:52.280 --> 03:58.010
So let's dive into this file and into components we can use and we can't use in the next lecture.
