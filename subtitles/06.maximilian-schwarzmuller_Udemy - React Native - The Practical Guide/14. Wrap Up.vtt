00:02.420 --> 00:05.220
So deaths and number of core module finished.

00:05.240 --> 00:10.520
You learned how to store your data not just locally in memory which you of course need for the running

00:10.520 --> 00:16.410
app but also how to store it on a server so that you can get it after your app restarted.

00:16.490 --> 00:22.550
Or importantly also on other devices using this app because you're not the only user of does application

00:22.910 --> 00:25.970
and whilst you sometimes have data that only belongs to you.

00:26.090 --> 00:29.240
The products in a shop certainly aren't all that kind.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.630
So it's good that we can now store them on a server.

00:32.630 --> 00:38.540
You'll learn how to store data there how to send requests how to send requests to change or delete data

00:38.570 --> 00:41.570
how to fetch data how to show a loading spinner.

00:41.570 --> 00:47.870
Also how to use this pull to refresh functionality how to show errors if you got some.

00:47.870 --> 00:54.290
All of that is important and all of these things are things or features you will need in most applications

00:54.290 --> 00:55.570
you build they offer.

00:55.580 --> 01:00.320
This was a key module hopefully helpful to you in future applications.

01:00.390 --> 01:05.240
And with that in this project here we can move on to also add authentication.
