00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.105
Now we're going to start by adding some blog posts to our website.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.895
We'll also create the blog page for these to be displayed on.

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:12.880
To get some content for the blog posts,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.340
I'm going to go over to Google and search for some Lorem ipsum,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.220
to get some sample text for the posts.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.720
Click on "Lorem Ipsum" and then scroll down to the generator.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.790
I'm going to generate five paragraphs of

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.495
text so we've got plenty of content for the post.

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:35.320
Click "Generate", then copy the five paragraphs,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.860
and then head back into the WordPress dashboard.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.400
Once you get to the dashboard,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.930
click on the "Posts".

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.700
We can keep the hello world sample post there for now.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.565
I'm going to generate five new posts.

00:00:55.565 --> 00:01:00.415
Click on "Add a New Post" and then give it a title of your choice.

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:03.760
I'm going to call this blog post one,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.515
and then in the text box,

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:10.180
paste in the Lorem ipsum.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.910
I've already created the news on the office category.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.910
Just simply select "Add new category" and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.150
type in a category of your choice, such as promotions.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.160
Then hit "Enter", and then you get the new category period on there.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.750
Just below the categories is also the area for tags.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.030
You may want to add a few tags as well.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.370
Type in and hit "Enter".

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.245
I'm going to create beauty,

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:47.670
hair, makeup, and that will do for now.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.060
Click on "Publish" and then add new at the top,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.865
and I'm going to make five new blog posts in total.

00:01:56.865 --> 00:01:59.145
We've got plenty of content to work with.

00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:02.055
You can either create your own or follow along with me.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:05.670
The next one is going to be August offer.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.080
Now I'm pasting in the sample text on the office category.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.050
I will add some tags and then click "Publish".

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.160
On the third one,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.395
this can be August news or newsletter.

00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:32.490
This can be the new section on the tags,

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.160
can be news and updates,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.000
paste in the content,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.780
and then hit "Publish".

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.625
I'm just going to make two more.

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:50.140
Add the new and then sample post.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.660
Paste that in and this can be uncategorised.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.920
Now I'll publish and then one more.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:09.610
Sample post 2 and then publish that.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.660
So we've got five posts now in total,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.255
so we've got plenty of content to work with.

00:03:15.255 --> 00:03:18.905
On the homepage, we've only got the link back to the homepage.

00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:21.530
Next we need to create the blog page.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.970
Back into the Dashboard a go to Pages,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.030
Add New, call this the blog page,

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.470
and then hit "Publish".

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.505
We need to tell WordPress that this is the page for displaying blog posts,

00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:38.945
so we go to Settings,

00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:45.170
Reading, and change the posts page to be the blog that we just created,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.615
and then save changes.

00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:50.130
Then check out the site and check if

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.000
the blog page has been added to the menu. Okay, that's great.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.925
Next we need to transfer the blog content from our bootstrap project into WordPress.

00:03:59.925 --> 00:04:02.955
If we just find our bootstrap folder,

00:04:02.955 --> 00:04:05.070
mine's on the desktop still.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.925
Then open it up, then drag the blog.html into your text editor,

00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:15.610
and we can start copying some of the content over to WordPress.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.565
We don't need the header or the footer section.

00:04:18.565 --> 00:04:23.335
What we need to do is scroll down to the blog section,

00:04:23.335 --> 00:04:26.780
and then we need to copy all of the blog section.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.465
Copy this and then keep going all the way down until we find the sidebar.

00:04:34.465 --> 00:04:37.670
There's the sidebar modules.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.285
Then copy everything up until the footer section.

00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:50.290
Copy and then go into the index.php and then paste all this just underneath get_header.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.550
I will start working with this now.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.485
I'm making it WordPress friendly.

00:04:55.485 --> 00:05:02.145
We'll start by cutting the sidebar out and putting the sidebar into the sidebar.php file.

00:05:02.145 --> 00:05:06.355
If we look for the closing blog-sidebar div,

00:05:06.355 --> 00:05:09.155
then look at the div just before that,

00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:17.345
and then copy the modules all the way up to the number of columns.

00:05:17.345 --> 00:05:21.980
Cut out the contents. We should just be left with the 12-column container.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.800
Then go to the sidebar.php,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.775
paste that in and save,

00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:30.935
then back into the index page,

00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:33.515
and hopefully you should be getting an idea of what we're doing here.

00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:36.705
In the same way that we got the header,

00:05:36.705 --> 00:05:39.800
and also in the same way that we put the footer back in,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.900
we're going to do exactly the same.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.090
Between the sidebar div,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:52.990
let's open up the PHP tags and then type in get_sidebar,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.350
the brackets and the semicolon, and then save that.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.195
Hopefully that makes sense. We've cut the sidebar out,

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.590
put it in its own file,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.160
and then added it back in using PHP.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.280
The next thing we need to do is,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.790
we need to add our blog post to the WordPress loop that we added earlier.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.990
We only need one of the bootstrap blog posts to work with,

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.565
and we've currently got three,

00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:21.800
so let's delete two of them.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.130
If we locate the end of the blog posts,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:35.175
there's one and there's two,

00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:38.060
so it leaves us just with one blog post.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.400
We don't actually need any of the content or any of the text,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.950
so we can delete that to make more space.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.135
We'll just tie this up so we know what we're doing.

00:06:50.135 --> 00:06:52.370
So we got the container, the row,

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.380
and the number of columns,

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.665
then the blog post there.

00:06:56.665 --> 00:06:59.180
As it stands, this is the content of

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.905
our blog post and we want to make sure that this is within WordPress loop.

00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:05.930
So every time it loops through a blog post,

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.985
it'll print out the blog post title,

00:07:08.985 --> 00:07:12.620
also the date, author, and then the content.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.980
We can start surrounding this with the WordPress loop.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.505
So if we cut the open end loop

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:25.055
and then paste this just above the div with the class of blog post.

00:07:25.055 --> 00:07:29.850
So we paste that in. If we cut the end of

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:37.260
the loop and then paste this at the end of the blog.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.240
I paste that in just there.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.000
We cut out all the paragraphs of text,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.980
so we need to add the content back in.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.790
We cut the PHP tags for

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:52.800
the content and then paste this back in just above the end of the loop.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.175
So that's the content in.

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:59.160
Now just to make sure our divs are all in place.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.300
We've got the div with the blog post and I think we just

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.005
need a closing tag after the content.

00:08:06.005 --> 00:08:10.350
Yes, that much is up with the blog post opening div.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:16.240
I'll just put a comment in there of blog post.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.295
I'll make some space between the end of the loop.

00:08:21.295 --> 00:08:25.495
It's now got the loop and some blog information in there.

00:08:25.495 --> 00:08:28.060
Let's head over to our website and see how it's

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.885
looking and give you a visual indication of what the loop is doing.

00:08:31.885 --> 00:08:35.050
So if you select the blog and then scroll down.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.020
So we can see that some blog posts start to appear

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.605
on the left and our sidebar is being pulled back in.

00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:46.780
But one of the problems we've got so far is we create five different blog posts.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.310
But as we scroll down,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.365
we're getting the same blog post over and over again,

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:54.105
and that's because in the index page,

00:08:54.105 --> 00:08:55.485
it's pulling the content,

00:08:55.485 --> 00:09:00.795
which is the Lorem Ipsum text for all the information such as the heading,

00:09:00.795 --> 00:09:04.675
the date, and the offer is all Static HTML.

00:09:04.675 --> 00:09:07.300
So we need to now convert this to PHP.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.635
So WordPress can pull in the correct information for the blog posts that we created.

00:09:11.635 --> 00:09:13.255
So let's start that now.

00:09:13.255 --> 00:09:17.515
We'll start with the Level 2 heading of new feature.

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:21.235
I want to separate this on a different line so it's more clear.

00:09:21.235 --> 00:09:24.500
So open up the PHP.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.980
Again, I'm just going to copy these

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.410
PHP tags because we'll be reusing them over and over again.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.650
To get the title, we type in the_ title.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:42.230
Let's save that and head back over to the blog and refresh.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.534
So now we can see we've got different titles.

00:09:45.534 --> 00:09:48.820
These are the titles of the five blog posts that we've done before.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.360
You hover over them, you can see that these titles are links.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.780
Usually in the blog, you won't need the link to the full post.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.395
So we can do that in WordPress by adding the permalink.

00:09:59.395 --> 00:10:03.415
So we can surround this PHP in a link tag.

00:10:03.415 --> 00:10:09.350
So a href is going to be equal to,

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.745
then we paste in our PHP.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:16.730
To make it a link, we type in the permalink.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.860
Don't forget the brackets and the semicolon.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.680
We need to tell WordPress where to link this two.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.365
So do this by adding a title.

00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:29.395
The title is going to be equal to,

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:31.750
paste in the PHP.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:37.520
Then we type in the_title_attribute.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.840
Let's put it on separate lines so it's more clear.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.335
So when it's close off the opening a tag,

00:10:50.335 --> 00:10:58.240
just after the title attribute and then add the closing a tag after the title.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.025
So let's take a look at that and refresh in the browser. So that's a good start.

00:11:03.025 --> 00:11:04.900
Our blog posts are now blue,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.000
which indicates it's now a link.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.310
So back into the text editor.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.905
Then we'll do the same with the date and the author.

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:13.780
So starting with the date,

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.160
paste in the PHP.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:23.780
Echo to the browser get_the_date.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.340
Then inside the brackets,

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.165
we need to tell WordPress what format we'd like the date to appear.

00:11:31.165 --> 00:11:33.010
So inside the quotations,

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.690
pass in three parameters.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.450
So the first one is a capital F,

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.400
which in PHP means the month,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.485
and then separated by a comma.

00:11:41.485 --> 00:11:45.415
A small j is for the day of the month.

00:11:45.415 --> 00:11:47.410
Then as we use in the footer section,

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.635
we can use the capital Y to get the year.

00:11:50.635 --> 00:11:52.930
The next we'll do the author.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.615
So we'll change the author's name,

00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:57.850
paste in the PHP.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.070
The author is pretty straightforward.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.100
It's just the_author.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.725
Then bracket and semicolon.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.630
Let's save that and take a look.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.270
Great. So now it post in the username, which is tranquil_admin.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.275
It also gives us the date which the post was created.

00:12:20.275 --> 00:12:25.250
It should all be the same because they'll all create at the same time.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.410
So while we're in the blog post section,

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.080
I'd like to add a little bit more information to the blog.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.870
Just below the author,

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.395
I'd like to add some information which shows

00:12:38.395 --> 00:12:42.640
which category and which tag we've used for all the posts.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.145
So that's pretty straightforward to do.

00:12:45.145 --> 00:12:48.550
If we just go below the author section that we just done there.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:53.770
I'm also going to add some Font Awesome Icons to make these look a little bit better.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:13:00.470
So Font Awesome is added with the i tag and the class is fa.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.815
So we'll add the tags first.

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:12.040
So the Font Awesome Icon for tags is fa-tag. Then close that.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:19.790
Then we can generate the names of the tags by typing in the_tags.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:25.060
Let's save that and check it's working okay and refresh.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:29.300
So we got a picture of the tag appearance.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.245
Then we're going to go down to a blog post where we've got some tags,

00:13:35.245 --> 00:13:37.840
we've got news and updates,

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.860
and then here starts all working correctly.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.080
Then add a break tag.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.705
We'll start out in the categories.

00:13:46.705 --> 00:13:49.300
So a Font Awesome Icon.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.640
So i class fa,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:57.890
and this could be fa-folder-open,

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.730
and then add some PHP.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:13.970
This time we use the_category and then save. So let's take a look.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.050
So we've got the Font Awesome Icon appearing,

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.815
but we've got the names of the categories appearing below.

00:14:23.815 --> 00:14:27.160
We want to make sure that they are in line with the folder.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.920
We also wanted them to be separated with comma.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.920
So this is pretty straightforward to fix if we go

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.040
inside the brackets and at the quotations.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.395
All we need to do is add a comma,

00:14:38.395 --> 00:14:41.575
which is the separator, and then a space.

00:14:41.575 --> 00:14:47.125
So there's a space between each of the categories and then refresh.

00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:51.500
Now, we also have now got them in line with the Font Awesome Icon.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.380
To make this look a bit more like the tags one,

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.355
we'll just add the word categories in front of it.

00:15:00.355 --> 00:15:03.355
So just before the category,

00:15:03.355 --> 00:15:08.290
we'll add PHP tags and then we'll echo or we can use a shorthand

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:15.730
which is an e with an underscore before it.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:20.439
Then the word we're going to echo out is category.

00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:24.820
Then a colon, we've got space stuff there as well.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.805
So it's a space before the first category name.

00:15:27.805 --> 00:15:31.810
So save and then refresh.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.750
That looks good, looks a lot better than before.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.670
So hopefully that made sense to you.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.160
Well, add in a Font Awesome Icon.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:45.190
Then straight after, we use in PHP echo to echo out the word category.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.825
Then straight after the word,

00:15:46.825 --> 00:15:50.350
we're using the category function to print out all the categories

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:54.595
associated with the blog post. So save that.

00:15:54.595 --> 00:15:58.405
Some of you guys may have noticed as you being scrolling up and down page,

00:15:58.405 --> 00:16:01.420
that these blog posts are quite long.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.794
Normally on a blog, you just have a short introduction,

00:16:04.794 --> 00:16:06.940
maybe just a paragraph or so.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.895
Then if you click on the blog or the title,

00:16:09.895 --> 00:16:13.885
you then take into the full blog post on a separate page.

00:16:13.885 --> 00:16:17.095
We can do this pretty easily in WordPress.

00:16:17.095 --> 00:16:22.340
It's just a case of changing the content to be the excerpt.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:30.890
So save, and it should now be a shortened version of the blog posts. Just like that.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:37.870
So a little bit later on the course we'll create the template for the full blog post.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.850
Want to click on the title.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.310
So happy would tell this has come along for now.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.930
So we'll end this video there.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.640
We're really making good progress.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.425
We'll now go WordPress content,

00:16:47.425 --> 00:16:52.300
which is generated dynamically rather than the static bootstrap posts.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.970
So thanks for watching, and we'll see you in the next video.
