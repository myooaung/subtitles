00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.840
Welcome to this video on advanced custom fields.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.025
So far all of the changes that we've made so far to the theme,

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:11.430
we've done encode in the text editor,

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.160
though if the end user of your theme want to change some information,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.410
some text or some images,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.600
we need to provide a way for them to change

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.420
content quickly and easily without knowing how to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.480
code and a great way of doing this is by adding advanced custom fields.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.050
If you go over to the website, which is advancedcustomfields.com,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.975
this is the website for a really easy to use plugin,

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:46.260
which we're going to implement into our theme in this video.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.990
Because this is a plugin,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.705
we can add this easily in the dashboard.

00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:54.734
Go on to the dashboard,

00:00:54.734 --> 00:01:02.290
and then select plugins, then add new.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.590
In case you've not used a WordPress plugin before,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.125
it's just a way of adding extra functionality to the WordPress call,

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:14.150
and there's thousands of different WordPress plugins available,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.855
and it's really worth a quick search to find some great features to add.

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:27.480
I'm going to search for advanced custom fields, and then Enter.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.635
The version I'm going to use is the first one which comes up,

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:36.110
which is the advanced custom fields,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.150
and then select "Install Now".

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.710
Once you've got the success message at the bottom there,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.570
then click on "Activate Plugin".

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.730
Now that's activated, we get a new option in the dashboard,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.495
so go down to custom fields and click on that.

00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:03.740
I'm going to show you how to do this by going through the front page,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.720
changing some of the areas on there,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.230
such as the text on the office sections.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.885
I'm going to enter a field group,

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:15.560
which is a group of fields which you want to change.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.975
Select the "Add New" button,

00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:20.045
and keep this organized.

00:02:20.045 --> 00:02:23.370
I'm going to call this section the front page,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.620
then publish that, and then I'm going to add a field,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.570
and a field is one of the areas which you want to change.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.110
If we go into our front page,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.725
so back into the local host and the Tranquil site.

00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:44.615
I'm going to start by changing the feature text on the front there,

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:47.450
and this is going to be a field.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.740
Back over into the dashboard,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.535
the field label is the name,

00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:56.670
so we'll call this the feature text,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.010
and if you just press Tab,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.070
WordPress will automatically generate field name,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.400
and this is the name that we'll add to the code later on.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.880
The field type is okay as text,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.950
and then we can add some instructions which shows up in the dashboard for the user.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.900
I'm going to change this to use this field to change the main feature text,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.245
and required, yes, you will not be always there.

00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:33.810
You can create a default value if you want,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.760
but because it's required it's not really needed for now. Add this field there.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.400
Now we've got our feature text field included,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.650
and we've got the field name of feature_text.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.820
I'm just going to copy that name,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.690
and then in the function section,

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.850
if we look for the featureText function,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.100
and in the front page section,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.850
we can delete this fully responsive premium spa message.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.945
Delete that, and then we put in the function,

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:10.179
the_field, and then in brackets,

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:12.730
we put in the name of the field that we just created.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.365
We'd copied that before,

00:04:14.365 --> 00:04:18.950
so paste in feature_text and save.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.215
If you go back over to the homepage and refresh.

00:04:23.215 --> 00:04:27.305
There's nothing there for now because we need to add this into the dashboard.

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:32.545
Because we only want these custom fields to show up on the front page,

00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:40.970
we need to change the location to be the page type equal to front page,

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.215
and then update that,

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:46.320
so back to the top and hit "Update".

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.040
Now if we go to the front page and then edit page,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.245
and then scroll down, we should see the feature text section that we just created.

00:04:57.245 --> 00:05:00.330
Now we've got this as part of the dashboard.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.860
The user can add or change different parts of the website without knowing any code.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.960
You can put the heading back in,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.880
so FULLY RESPONSIVE, and the break tag,

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.985
PREMIUM SPA THEME, and the break tag,

00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:27.610
FOR WORDPRESS, and update,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.660
and then view the page.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.120
There we go, so that's our text back in place.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.325
If we go back to edit page,

00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:40.940
one thing I just want to remove is

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.385
the content editor because our page is generated via the template.

00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:50.930
To remove that, just go to the advanced custom fields,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.495
and then in the hide on screen section,

00:05:53.495 --> 00:05:56.630
just check the content editor,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:07.230
then update, and then refresh the edit page section, and now that's gone now.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.045
There you go, so that's how you add a custom field in WordPress.

00:06:11.045 --> 00:06:13.550
We'll continue the front page in the next video.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.760
We'll start in custom fields to the latest Office section.
