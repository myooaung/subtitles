00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.665
Our website is taking shape now,

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:09.510
we've completed the header section and also the featured image and text.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.555
We then moved down to creating the welcome section,

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:15.960
which has got links to all the sections of the website.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.155
If we take a look at the finished website,

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:23.705
the next part we're going to be creating is the latest offers section.

00:00:23.705 --> 00:00:29.610
It's going to consist of a similar level 2 heading and divider to the last section,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.640
and then we're going to create a new row with three different special offers.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.895
The three different offers are static texts for now,

00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:41.210
but once we get to the WordPress section later on in the course,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.860
we'll make sure that the user can log in and change the values,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.695
so they can keep the special offers up-to-date even without any technical knowledge.

00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:55.375
Let's get started in the index page,

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:58.230
so we'll get started with a comment.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.685
This section is going to be called the latest offers,

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:07.380
and we'll do just below the welcome section like we've done in the last video,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.390
so we'll locate the closing section and then paste the comment just below there,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.490
so that's the latest offers.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.040
The latest offers will have its own section

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.530
too and this will have an ID of latest-offers,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.875
they are within the section.

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:42.329
We'll create the usual div with the class of container,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.320
and then because the row that we're going to be using

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.155
is pretty much the same as the last section,

00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:57.540
we can just copy the div with the class of row and we can reuse that.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.655
Paste that within the container,

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:08.650
and then we need to change the level 2 heading to latest offers.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.465
Because this time we're on a purple background,

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:25.690
let's change the divider to be the divider-silver.png and let's take a look at that.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.740
There's our section with the level 2 heading on the divider,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.510
so we're just going to add one more custom class which is going to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.680
be a class to add some margin to the bottom of the divider.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.450
If we look at the finished project we need to make sure that the free divs

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.700
below the divider are slightly pushed down from the image,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.675
so let's add the class to the row of margin bottom.

00:02:57.675 --> 00:02:59.715
We'll add a margin in the next video,

00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:07.090
in the CSS, let's just add a closing comment to the container.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.930
Let's put the free special offers on row,

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.940
so let's create a new div with the class of row.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.130
We're going to create the free special offer divs but we need to put

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.655
those free special offer divs into a container,

00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:31.385
so we're going to put a full 12 column width container surrounding those.

00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:39.180
Div with a class of col-sm-12,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.985
and that will create a full 12 column container.

00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:45.305
Because the free special offer sections are nested,

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:52.230
we need to create a new row for those to go inside.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:01.805
Within the row, the first special offer is going to be div class col-sm-4,

00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:07.755
so it takes up a one third of the page and also so we can add our custom styles,

00:04:07.755 --> 00:04:11.730
we'll also add a custom class of offer.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.215
To start we need put the price,

00:04:16.215 --> 00:04:18.960
we need to put price in the span tags,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.855
and then we'll put the name of the special offer in a level 3 heading,

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:26.345
and then two separate paragraph tags just below.

00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:30.120
For the price, the span,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.670
and then in-between there the first one had a price of $60,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.585
and then below that in the level 3 heading,

00:04:38.585 --> 00:04:41.330
the name of the offer.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.150
The first one is family offer,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.385
I'm just going to put a break tag in there,

00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:53.590
and then the <p> tags,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:05.320
so the first line of text was family pool and then line two was great day out,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.640
so let's see how that's looking.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.340
It's all there but there's still a little bit of work to do with the CSS,

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.355
but let's continue for now adding the rest of the offers.

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.845
If we locate the div,

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:26.930
in fact let's do some comment first,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:35.530
so just copy the container comment and then the first one is for the class of offer.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.860
The second one is called sm-4,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.740
and then this is the row,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.690
in fact this is the nested row,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.150
then just below that it's the 12-column wrapper,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.240
and then the final row container.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.470
Let's copy the full section for the special offer,

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.230
and then let's paste in twice just below.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:20.820
The second special offer had the price of a $120 and this is a bridal package,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.440
so the name of the offer was for the bride.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.640
The first line of the text was hair and make-up,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.890
and lastly it was the full pamper package,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:53.225
and then the last special offer was the weekend pass which had a price of $90,

00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:56.820
so the name was weekend pass.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.490
The text was modern facilities,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.320
and the last one had the text of perfect gift.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.275
Back into the browser,

00:07:16.275 --> 00:07:17.520
that's all appearing fine,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.535
that's exactly how we want it.

00:07:19.535 --> 00:07:21.125
Join me in the next video,

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:25.140
and we'll continue with the section by adding the CSS.
