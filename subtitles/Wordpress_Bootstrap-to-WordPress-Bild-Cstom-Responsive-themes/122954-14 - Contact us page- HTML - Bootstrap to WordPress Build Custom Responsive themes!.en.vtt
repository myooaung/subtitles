00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.550
So welcome back. In this video,

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.940
we're going to be creating the final page for our Bootstrap template,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.295
which is going to be the Contact Us page.

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:10.020
So this is what it's going to look like.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.390
So we've got the Contact Us section which has two-six column containers.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.820
So the one on the left hand side will be for

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.180
the address details and then on the right-hand side,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.720
we'll embed a Google iFrame with a lakeside location and then just below that,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.795
we'll add a section to Send Us a Message,

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:33.359
and this will span the full width of the webpage.

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:35.100
When we get to the WordPress section,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.885
this will be fully functional.

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:40.230
So let's get started in our text editor.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.200
Let's start with the About page,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.135
I'm going to copy all of that and then use this as a starting point for our new page,

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:51.280
and then paste this in.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.580
Let's save this as contact.html.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.790
This page will be using the same footer,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.100
so we keep all the footer section in there.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.980
For now, we can keep the About what section,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.630
but we can just change this to the Contact Us section

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.470
and then change the section id to Contact.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.605
The level two heading can be changed to

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:31.230
Contact and that will keep this whole row consistent with the rest of the website,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.805
and the following row with the text.

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:36.230
We can delete all the text for now,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:45.090
we don't need that, but we can keep the row and we'll reuse that.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.085
So within this row, this is going to be the two-six column sections.

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:51.710
The one on the left will have the Address,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.940
and the section on the right will have the Google Maps iFrame.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.340
So let's start by creating two new divs with a class of col-sm-6.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.770
I will do exactly the same for the Google iFrame.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.405
So first of all, we'll start on the div on the left,

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:16.640
which will have the Address information.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.865
First of all, we're going to add some custom CSS.

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:25.320
So we can add our own class of Address and also,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.690
if we take a look at the finished website,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.810
you can see that the address has

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.220
the darker background image and this is from a Bootstrap well.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.110
So let's add the class of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.540
well and the address is going to be the same as the footer section.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.590
So if we scroll down to the bottom of the page and then copy the Address tags,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.890
and paste this into the div on the left and it's also a Font Awesome icon,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.705
which is just to the left of the name.

00:02:57.705 --> 00:03:01.485
So let's add that just after the opening address tag.

00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:03.360
Let's add the icon.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:13.120
It has i tag with a class of fa fa-map-marker.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.470
Then, just below the Address,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.615
we're going to add some email and telephone information.

00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:26.505
So both the email and the telephone section has a Font Awesome icon.

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:30.780
So the first one is for the email,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.440
and this is a class of fa fa-envelope-o,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.360
and then just after the icon,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.300
we can add the text of email.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.480
I'm just going to put generic email in there,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.800
so mail at mail.com and then add a break tag on the second icon.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:08.089
This for the telephone. So this has a class of fa fa-phone and text all telephone.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.580
Again, I'll just put a generic number in there.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.340
So let's take a look at that, if we go back into the browser and then refresh.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.210
So we've got the div on the left-hand side showing nicely.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.790
Just something to change in the Email section.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.010
We'll go back up.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.040
So we just got a few things we need to change there,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:42.810
so we'll change that to a colon and then an at symbol, and there we go.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.725
So next, we need to create the iFrame on the right-hand side.

00:04:46.725 --> 00:04:48.810
So if go over to Google Maps,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.435
and if you find a nice lakeside location,

00:04:51.435 --> 00:04:56.850
and then what you need to do is click on the Menu and then select

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.670
Share or Embed Map and select

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.860
the second tab which is Embed Map and then copy the link that Google provides.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.860
Then, if we go into our second div,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.710
we can paste this in and let's see how that's looking.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.215
There we go, so that's working fine.

00:05:22.215 --> 00:05:24.560
We'll add some CSS in the next video for this,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.810
but that's looking okay for now.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.895
So that's this row finished,

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:34.530
so next we'll move down and we'll add the Send Us a Message section.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.740
So back into the text editor,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.575
and if we locate the div with the class of row on facilities,

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:45.260
we don't need the facilities class anymore,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.510
but we'll add our own class of Message Area,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.670
and then all the content between this row we can get rid of.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.980
So if we look for the class in row container,

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.595
it's all images and all the divs.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:05.145
Let's get started on the Message section.

00:06:05.145 --> 00:06:08.160
So let's create a full width section.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:16.890
We'll give the div a class of col-sm-12 and then nested inside,

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.720
we'll also add a div with a class of well,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.180
so that stands out a little bit more.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.010
Then inside the well,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.900
we're going to create the HTML form.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.080
Let's head over to the finished project and take a look.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.330
So to style, we'll add the text at the top of Send Us a Message,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.190
we'll then add some form-groups with the inputs for the name,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.365
email and the message text area and then we'll add a Submit button to the bottom.

00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:49.560
Let's start with the text at the very top.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.080
We'll add some p tags and then the text or Send Us a Message.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.625
Then just below, we'll add the first div with the class of

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:11.105
form-group and this is a Bootstrap class we'll be using to surround the free inputs.

00:07:11.105 --> 00:07:21.870
So to start, we'll add an input with a type of text and a class of form-control,

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.320
which is also a Bootstrap class.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.270
Then id of inputs name

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:38.590
and then the placeholder text simply of name and close off.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:44.645
So next we're going to add a label and this label is going to be for the screen readers.

00:07:44.645 --> 00:07:49.290
So let's give it a class of sr-only.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:55.275
To link this label to the input inside the opening tag,

00:07:55.275 --> 00:08:04.890
we can add fall and then match it with the input id of inputs name.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.140
Then between the label tags,

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.330
we can add the text to appear of name.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.520
So let's copy this form-group and we'll use this for

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.670
the Email section and then paste this in below.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.260
So within this form-group,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.840
we need to change the input to be

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:30.705
input-email and the text to be email and then within the inputs,

00:08:30.705 --> 00:08:40.060
we'll change the input name to be input-email and the placeholder text to be email,

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.925
and then paste in the form-group one more time.

00:08:43.925 --> 00:08:53.770
So this time it's going to be input message and the name of the message.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.585
Instead of using the input,

00:08:56.585 --> 00:09:00.295
we can just delete that and this time because it's going to be a message,

00:09:00.295 --> 00:09:02.870
we can add a text area.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:10.380
So the text area will have the class of form-control.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:18.510
The id of input-message,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.470
which is the same as the label,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:30.870
and the placeholder text is going to be equal to message,

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.270
and then the last attribute is going to be

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.330
the number of rows we want to appear as default.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.495
So I'm going to set this to be free initially.

00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:50.755
Then to close up the text area section and then just after the text area,

00:09:50.755 --> 00:09:56.050
the last thing I want to add is the input for the Submit button.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:01.330
Inputs, so we have a type of submit.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.750
This will have the familiar class that we've used earlier on of

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:13.810
btn btn-default and this

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:18.410
will have the same styles that we've used on the buttons in the index page.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:23.425
Finally, the value, which is the text on the button,

00:10:23.425 --> 00:10:31.540
will be Submit and then close off and I should add a few closing comments.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.850
Then just above the row,

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.910
this is the closing tag for the 12 column section.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.260
Then just above that,

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.530
this is for the class of well,

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.320
so let's save that and check this out in the browser.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.680
There we go. So there's our form at the bottom of the page.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.070
So that's all the HTML we need for the Contact Us page.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:09.810
So join me in the next video and we'll finish off the contact page by adding the CSS.
