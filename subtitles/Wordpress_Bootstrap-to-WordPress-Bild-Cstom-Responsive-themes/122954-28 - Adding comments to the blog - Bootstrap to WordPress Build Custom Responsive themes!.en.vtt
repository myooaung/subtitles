00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.760
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.725
we're going to create the facility for users to comment on posts.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:10.710
The way we do that is we're going to create a new page.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.900
This is going to be a page template.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.260
Save this as comments.php,

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.080
and save this in the same directory as all your PHP.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.765
Then for this we're not going to reinvent the wheel,

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:33.255
we're just going to copy the comments page from the 2014 theme,

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.045
which is included with WordPress download.

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:45.240
If you go to your WordPress installation in htdocs and then open up trunquil-wp.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.890
Then if you go into the content on themes,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.260
I'm going to use the 2014 theme and then open up the comments.php.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.520
Select all and copy,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.310
and then paste the content into comments.php and save that.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.005
We can leave pretty much all of the comments.php as it is.

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:18.835
We'll just move the WordPress 2014 references just from there.

00:01:18.835 --> 00:01:24.245
Some benefits of using the template from one of the included themes,

00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:29.260
it had some nice features such as checking if a post is password protected.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.180
There's only one or two little things we need to change.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.285
If we scroll down to the printf line,

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:40.990
and we're going to customize this slightly by changing one thought to comment,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.195
and then on the next line change thoughts to comments, and then save that.

00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:51.815
Then to include this back into our theme,

00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:55.915
we need to go over to the single.php template.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:59.375
Then I'm going to put this underneath the pager.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:03.170
We need style WordPress whereabouts in the blog post,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.545
we want the comments to appear and it's usually at the bottom of the post.

00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:10.545
So let's put this just below the pager.

00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:14.775
When I add a comment just in here,

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:19.870
this comment I'm going to say load up the comments template.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.410
Then after that, open up

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:35.370
the PHP tags and then use the comments template function.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.209
Then save. It will go over to a blog post and refresh.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.910
You should see at the bottom of the post we've got the facility now to leave comments.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.190
Let's go ahead and add a few sample comments,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.480
and check it's all working okay.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.125
There's our first comments.

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:04.300
We can also reply to the comments.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.480
You say hello in there and then post the comments and check it's all working.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.695
There's our two comments on there, so that's good.

00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:16.384
Next I just want to go into the CSS,

00:03:16.384 --> 00:03:19.400
add some custom styling and make sure that

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.545
the comments fits in a little bit more with the rest of the website.

00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:27.465
So head over to our style.css.

00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:31.620
Then I want to add some style into the bottom of the page.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.470
Copy the comments and add this just below

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.990
the plug single post and change the comment to be the comment section.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.880
To get started, I want to make sure that the comments section at the bottom has

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.539
a similar style into the sidebar modules and also the blog posts.

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.950
The way I'm going to do that is by copying

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.660
the same styling as we used in the sidebar module.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:17.595
So just copy this section and then find the selector.

00:04:17.595 --> 00:04:24.325
So we open up the Chrome developer tools with inspect element.

00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:30.890
We need to find the ID of the container which surrounds all of the comment section.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.425
Click the magnifying glass and then find the surrounding container.

00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:42.980
It's the div with ID of comments and then the class of comments area.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.540
Let's add that in now.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.614
The div with an ID of comments,

00:04:51.614 --> 00:04:55.060
and then the class of comments-area,

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.865
and then paste in the styling.

00:05:01.865 --> 00:05:04.920
Let's see how that looks.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.475
Good, the styling now matches the rest of the page.

00:05:13.475 --> 00:05:15.740
Next, I just want to highlight

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.125
the comments just so they standout a little bit more from the rest of the background.

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:24.410
We'll givethis a dark gray background and also add

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.195
a board round and also a little bit a margin just to separate them out.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:34.470
So the class that we need is comment-body.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:44.565
So first of all, we'll start with the background and the background color is eee.

00:05:44.565 --> 00:05:53.420
Then the border radius is 10 pixels to match the rest of the site.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.440
Then the margin, 30 pixels on the top and bottom,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.125
0 on the left and right.

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:03.540
So let's save and refresh.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:10.735
Next I want to add the divide image between the header and the comments.

00:06:10.735 --> 00:06:15.150
Let's find out the selective [inaudible].

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.705
Click on the magnifying glass and the header.

00:06:18.705 --> 00:06:25.215
That's called a class of h2 comments title. Let's add that in now.

00:06:25.215 --> 00:06:32.980
So h2 and then the class of comments-title.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.340
Then it's cropped the same styling that we used in the blog post title.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.690
So we scroll up to the blog section and look for the blog post title.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.675
We can copy the exact same CSS,

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:51.900
which gives us the image and also the styling.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.290
Paste this into the comments title section and save,

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.535
and let's take a look. So that's looking good.

00:07:02.535 --> 00:07:06.530
Next I want to add a little bit of margin onto the bottom of

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:13.080
the comments and also a dashed line across to separate the reply section.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.855
To do that, we need to use the class of comment list.

00:07:19.855 --> 00:07:22.325
Let's add some margin,

00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:27.425
margins at the bottom of 60 pixels and then

00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:33.750
border onto the bottom of 1 pixel and the dashed line.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.525
Let's take a look. There we go.

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:42.440
Then what we need to do right now, let's do a little bit style into the reply section.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.415
I'm going to make the text area to be the full width.

00:07:46.415 --> 00:07:49.170
Let's get the class for that.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.550
The selective for that is text area with the idea of comments.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.970
So type in text area,

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.600
then ID of comments.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.415
Set the text area width to be

00:08:08.415 --> 00:08:16.900
100 percent and add some margin on to the bottom of 20 pixels.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.990
Then refresh. So now that's full width.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:26.480
The last thing and I want to do is style the submit button.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.070
We're going to make it the same as the submit button that we used on bootstrap website.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.495
It's got the same blue color as the rest of the website.

00:08:34.495 --> 00:08:37.545
Let's find out what the selective is.

00:08:37.545 --> 00:08:41.955
The input has an ID of submit.

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:50.310
We can just add the submit ID onto the button defaults up in the global section.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.635
Just after button default separated by a comma,

00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:57.790
also add the ID of submit.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.600
Then do the same in the hover state.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:08.890
Submit hover, and then back down to the comments section.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.295
Under the text area section,

00:09:16.295 --> 00:09:20.840
also add the submit ID and let's make the button

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.370
match the text area by giving a width of 100 percent.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:34.325
So let's save that and see how that's looking and refresh.

00:09:34.325 --> 00:09:37.025
We don't need the developer tools anymore.

00:09:37.025 --> 00:09:39.640
So that's looking a lot better now, that's looking good.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.900
One thing that you may not know is so far when we've

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.900
been adding the comments and we click on the reply button.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:52.435
As soon as you hit reply, we're taken to the bottom of the screen at reply.

00:09:52.435 --> 00:09:56.090
This is fine for now when we want to go one or two comments.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.435
But on a page, it's got tens or hundreds of comments.

00:09:59.435 --> 00:10:02.285
We don't want to be taken right down to the bottom of the page.

00:10:02.285 --> 00:10:07.055
We want the comment box to appear just underneath the post we've commented on.

00:10:07.055 --> 00:10:10.190
Luckily, WordPress has some JavaScript to do this.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.770
The way we can add the JavaScript in is by head note to the functions.php.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:20.270
If we'll look for the enqueue script section in

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:25.245
the theme setup just underneath the Bootstrap JavaScript,

00:10:25.245 --> 00:10:28.315
we're going to add the common reply script.

00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:33.620
So we'll check first if the post is singular.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:44.360
Now we'll enqueue the script just as above, with wp_enqueue_script.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.490
The script name is comment reply,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.625
and a semicolon at the end of that. So save that.

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:59.375
If you go over to WordPress and refresh,

00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:02.305
now if you click on the reply button,

00:11:02.305 --> 00:11:04.140
and it's not work for some reasons.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.715
So we'll just check why.

00:11:05.715 --> 00:11:08.560
This will take you to the bottom of the page.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.940
Let's take a look over this.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.465
We need to make sure that it's within the curly braces.

00:11:16.465 --> 00:11:20.370
So cut this section now that we just done and

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.450
paste it within the curly braces or within the function.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.795
Save that and let's see if it's working now.

00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:30.510
Click on the reply, and there we go.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.665
Now rather than being taken to the very bottom of the page,

00:11:33.665 --> 00:11:35.690
we now have the JavaScript enabled,

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:41.080
and this makes you that the box appears just below the comments that will reply in them.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.300
So that we go such a fully functional comment section.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.120
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you in the next video.
