00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.275
Welcome back. We're making good progress with our WordPress blog.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:07.170
We've now got WordPress pulling in the contents of

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.575
all our blog posts and displaying them on the blog page.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:15.270
We've used the WordPress excerpt to shorten down the contents of the posts,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.205
just be a couple of sentences.

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:21.885
Now, we want to add a Read More button at the end of the text.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:26.675
This can also link to the full blog post in the same way as the title.

00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:29.595
To add the Read More button at the very end,

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:33.485
we can add this in our index page straight after the exempt.

00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:35.720
Just make a little bit of space there.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.300
Let's create a link and then inside the quotations,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.625
pasting the PHP tags.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:46.650
This time, we're going to echo to the browser,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.160
get_permalink(), and semi-colon at the end,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.120
then close off the "a" tag and add the closing tag there.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.700
Now, we've got the link,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.605
we need to add the text.

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:03.620
PHP again, and we use a shorthand again,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.530
so _e just echo to the browser.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.310
Then inside the brackets,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.270
the first parameter is going to be the text we'd like to display,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.725
which is going to be Read More and then short three dots afterwards.

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:22.030
Then save and see if that's working okay.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.705
That's at the end of each one of the blog posts, so that's good.

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:31.435
One little change you'd like to make is,

00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:35.960
I don't like the square brackets at the end of the text,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.310
so I'm just going to remove them and just make it into the three dots.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.170
Let's see how to do that.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.320
If we head over to the WordPress codecs,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.660
and we'll look for the codecs for WordPress.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.585
Then search at the top for

00:01:54.585 --> 00:02:03.085
the excerpt and click on the function reference to the excerpt.

00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:05.215
Scroll down a little bit further,

00:02:05.215 --> 00:02:10.375
and it will give some information about how to use it and some examples.

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:15.220
But if you go a little bit further to about halfway and look for the title which says

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.210
remove the three dots in a square brackets using filters.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.135
If we just simply copy the function,

00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:26.895
then head over to the functions.php.

00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:30.515
Let's paste this in but outside of the setup function.

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:33.810
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and we're going to

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.840
paste this underneath the add_action for the scripts.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.605
At the minute, we'll return in the dots on the square brackets,

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:47.555
but we just want to delete those square brackets and save that.

00:02:47.555 --> 00:02:50.020
Or you can put in anything that you prefer.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.825
Let's see if that's working.

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:55.050
Back over to the spa page and refresh.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.990
Good, that's all working correctly.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.360
The square brackets have been removed.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.710
We just want to change this title back to be the same color as the bootstrap website,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.735
which is the dark gray.

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:14.510
If we just click on Inspect Elements and then select it with the magnifying glass,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.680
we can see that the cluster Bootstrap uses is blog-post-title.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.200
Copy that, I'm going to change this color in the style.CSS.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.840
Let's take a look for the blog section and then we'll

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.510
paste this in just below the title section we've created before.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.500
Because it's now a link,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.180
we will add the "a" and we'll set the color to be the value of 494646.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:56.460
Save that and refresh.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.980
The title is now the same color as the Bootstrap website.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.830
You may have already noticed that we're missing the fancy image which

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.730
separates the blog title and the rest of the content,

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.825
that's because we still got the dots and the slush.

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:18.430
We're going to remove them and then refresh,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.370
and this puts the images back into the blog.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.605
If we go back down to the bottom of the page,

00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:30.340
you can see it is the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.655
We're now going to get these to work in WordPress.

00:04:33.655 --> 00:04:36.710
Go back into the index page.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.875
If you take a look for the Pages section,

00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:43.835
and we can keep the links [inaudible] as they are.

00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:46.040
But we don't need these links anymore because we're

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.695
going to put these in a WordPress way.

00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:53.715
We can just delete the hyperlinks of Previous and Next.

00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:59.850
To get the next page of posts, insert the php.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.590
Then to get the next posts,

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.660
we type in next_posts_link

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.395
and then we want the button to say "Older Posts",

00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:18.720
so we type that inside the brackets.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.210
Then we'll copy this piece of

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.900
PHP and then we'll paste it just below between the list items.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.535
But this time, instead of next_posts,

00:05:30.535 --> 00:05:33.170
it's changed to previous.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:42.720
Then we'll change "Older Posts" to be "Newer" and save,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.840
and hopefully, that should work okay, then refresh.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.100
That causes the buttons to disappear and you may be wondering why.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.150
Well, the reason is because there isn't a previous page or

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.735
a next page to go to because we've only got five or six blog posts,

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:04.245
and by default, WordPress puts 10 blog posts in a page.

00:06:04.245 --> 00:06:06.870
Just to test if the pager is working,

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.550
head back over to the dashboard and then down the Settings,

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:20.060
on Reading, then change blog pages to show at most from 10 down to five,

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.225
and then save changes.

00:06:22.225 --> 00:06:25.115
Then hopefully, if all is working correctly,

00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:29.440
when we scroll down to the bottom of the page in the blog,

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.360
we should now get a page here because we only got five posts.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.240
That goes as the "Older Post" button and there is the six post there.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.084
Then click "Newer Posts",

00:06:41.084 --> 00:06:44.080
we will get the first five.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.750
Congratulations on getting this far and getting

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.595
the blog posts all working. Thanks for watching.

00:06:53.595 --> 00:06:55.430
If you've join me in the next video,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.190
we'll create a PHP "if else" statement,

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.650
which will change the feature text at the top of

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.470
the page depending on what page we're on. I'll see you there.
