00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.420
In the last couple of videos,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.600
we've looked at advanced custom fields and we've allowed

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.925
the administrator to change certain things such as the text on the website.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:17.370
In this video, we are going to make our website even more customizable by allowing

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.355
the admin or a certain user to change

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:24.745
the background featured image without knowing how to code.

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:29.315
WordPress allows us to do this in what we call custom headers.

00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:31.475
If you go over to Google,

00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:36.150
and search for the codex custom headers,

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.780
it should be the first result.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.690
So going to the custom header section and then if we scroll down the page,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.090
and if we look for the example,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.910
so copy this example and then go into the functions.php.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.565
This can go right to the very bottom,

00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:03.490
but still within the PHP tags.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.660
We're not going to have the fixed width,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.310
so we can remove that or the fixed height.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.145
I'm just going to comment these two lines out,

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:18.725
and then we've got the default image path in case the user doesn't upload an image.

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:23.310
So the default image is going to be the lakebg,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.450
and that's been our images folder, so that's okay.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.650
Save that and shown out one more thing into the array, which is uploads.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.860
This allows the user to upload an image,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.315
so uploads equal to or greater than and that's going to be a Boolean of true.

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:51.300
Then if we go into the header.php,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.820
we can change the image location.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.260
So find that file and then scroll down to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:04.010
the feature section at the bottom and then we can delete the image source,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.815
so everything between the double quotations.

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:09.020
Rather than having this image,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.200
which is being pulled in from our theme folder,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.275
we can use the custom header.

00:02:14.275 --> 00:02:16.670
So between the php tags,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.250
we use the WordPress function of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:30.000
header underscore image and save that and then go over to the WordPress Dashboard,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.040
down to Appearance and then

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:43.070
Customize and then select the "Header Image" and we can add a new image.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.320
So this is the posts thumbnail,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.350
so we'll upload a new image.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.405
So in your images folder,

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:53.885
there's a second background and now which is lakebg2.

00:02:53.885 --> 00:03:02.010
Select that and Open and then put in the old textile lake backgrounds,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.460
then select that and skip cropping,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.210
and then Save and Publish.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.135
So once I've saved, just tick the X in the corner and then go to

00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:21.870
Visit Site and there's our new image as the background.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.600
So now that makes it really easy for the site owners to change the background image.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.405
They're just need to go into the Dashboard and customize like we just did them,

00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:34.890
and that's the end of this video. So thanks for watching.
