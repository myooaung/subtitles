00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.510
So in our blog page,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.655
we've got the shortened down posts,

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:06.900
and in this video,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.105
we want to make sure that if we click on the Read More button or on the title,

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:16.590
that this links to a page which is going to show the full length post,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.925
and we do that by creating a template called single.php.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:25.155
So head over to your text editor and create a new page,

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:30.690
and save this as single.php,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.760
with all the rest of the PHP files.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.255
WordPress has two different types of page templates we can use.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:41.540
There's the single use template,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.005
which we'll be using for the Contact and About Us page,

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.190
and that's only going to be used on one particular page,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.570
or there is also a Global template,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.060
which is a bit of a more general template.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.705
We need to put a comment at the top of the page.

00:00:56.705 --> 00:01:00.590
So the single page is going to be loosely based on our blog page.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.945
We can reuse a lot of the content.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:11.530
Copy the content from the Index page and then paste this into the single.php,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.090
and because this is going to be a global template,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.665
we need to add a comment at the top.

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:21.585
Still WordPress is the name of the template.

00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:24.310
Add the comments.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.070
It's going to be the name of the template,

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.310
so it's going to be Single Post Template.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.705
This will have some of the same functionality as the blog page,

00:01:43.705 --> 00:01:45.910
but with just one or two little changes.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.030
For example, in the blog page,

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.730
we have the title linking to the full post,

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.865
but we don't want that because we're already on the full post.

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:59.105
Let's remove the hyperlink surrounding the title,

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:02.840
remove the hyperlink, so the closing a tag.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840
We can also remove the title attribute,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.040
the permalink, and all the way to the opening a tag.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.090
Save that and head over to the blog and click on one of the blog posts.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.150
This is the single page that we're now working on,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.985
and we still need to add the title to the top of the page.

00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:29.930
Now you can see when we click on the link at the top,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.010
it's no longer a link,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.140
it's just the blog title.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.560
We need to change the shortened version of the post to be the full length.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.360
We do that by changing the excerpts back to the content.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.770
Save that and then refresh.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.200
Then we've got the full length of the post.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.120
Next, I just want to head over to the style sheet and add a little bit of line height in,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.480
just to create some space between the tags,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.000
the category, and the text below.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.930
If we go over to the style.css and copy a comment,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.140
I want to paste this just below the blog sidebar,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.080
the About Us, the Contact Us.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.735
I'll put it just before the mobile styling.

00:03:16.735 --> 00:03:22.580
Paste that in and we'll call this the Blog Single Post.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.285
Let's just take a look at the class we need to target here.

00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:32.525
If we go into the index page,

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:36.780
I want to add styling to the tags and the category.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.335
The class which surround those is blog-posts-meta.

00:03:43.335 --> 00:03:45.860
I just noticed there's a little mistake there.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:54.315
We need to move the closing P tag to actually start before the tags and category,

00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:57.640
and then end just afterwards.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.570
Otherwise, that won't work.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.495
Let's just put that in and save that.

00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:10.745
Back to the style sheet and then paste in the class.

00:04:10.745 --> 00:04:15.185
Don't forget to put a dot in front of it because it's a class,

00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:22.100
and then just add some line spacing with the line height property of two M's,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.680
and let's refresh the browser and see how that's looking.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.810
Okay. That still hasn't changed,

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.955
so there's still a problem somewhere.

00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:33.310
If we just take a look.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.270
It's because we've changed the closing paragraph tag on the Index page,

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.430
but we've not done it in the single.php.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.565
So head to single.php,

00:04:47.565 --> 00:04:51.400
and then just move the closing p tag,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:05:02.415
and put this after the category, and save that.

00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:04.425
Let's see if that's working now.

00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:08.150
I think that's working, we're just missing the tags off there just because I

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.135
don't think that post has got any tags, which it doesn't.

00:05:11.135 --> 00:05:14.305
If we try the August Newsletter one,

00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:17.955
we've got the tags, we just need to add a break Tag into there.

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:25.305
Just after the author and after the closing a tag, the break tag.

00:05:25.305 --> 00:05:28.440
Hopefully that should solve it all now.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.150
Great. That's looking a lot better.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.400
We've now got some line height between

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.045
the tags and the categories. That's looking good now.

00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:38.930
Then if we go down the page a little bit more,

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.810
we can also remove the Read More button,

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.935
because we don't need that.

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:44.900
In fact, we can move the whole of

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.825
the link and just pull it up a little bit more and save,

00:05:49.825 --> 00:05:53.460
and then refresh that, and there we go.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.980
That's the Read More button removed.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.155
One thing we need to be conscious of when building WordPress themes

00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:04.160
is that sometimes users can upload posts which are really long.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.635
That was at only five paragraphs,

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:08.450
so it looks quite good on the page,

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.360
but if somebody uploads a read-along post,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.060
they may want to split it up into different pages.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.225
We maybe want to add pager with previous and next on at the end of the post,

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.435
just split it up a little bit.

00:06:21.435 --> 00:06:25.430
The way we can do that is we could allow users to put a break tag in.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.920
If we choose a blog post,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.435
we'll just choose one that we're on now,

00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:31.375
which is the August newsletter,

00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:36.425
and if we just choose a point in which you want to add a pager,

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:38.060
we can add a comment in there,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.565
which is the same as a HTML comment,

00:06:40.565 --> 00:06:43.680
which says Next Page.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.920
I'm just going to copy this and paste it in one more time,

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.140
and then update that post,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.100
and back to the site.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.335
Let's take a look at that. Now we've got our blog post appearing,

00:07:05.335 --> 00:07:07.660
and it cut off after two paragraphs,

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.335
where we'll put the next page break-point, which is great.

00:07:11.335 --> 00:07:14.980
Next we need to just add a pager onto the bottom of the posts,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.735
which will allow us to skip to the next page.

00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:24.105
We can do that in the single.php and add this just below the content,

00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:27.730
so open up the PHP,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:36.550
and then the WordPress function that we'll add a wp_link_pages,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.980
brackets and semicolon, and then save and refresh the blog page.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.520
Now we can see at the bottom,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.100
we've got the number of pages, so we've got 1,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.270
2, and 3, and they all appear to be working correctly.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.900
The last thing we want to do is add a pager onto the bottom of the post so

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.175
we can skip to the next or the previous post if you want to.

00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:10.530
Back in single.php, go down to the pager,

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.315
and instead of saying next posts,

00:08:13.315 --> 00:08:18.340
we just take the S of the end and that will link to the previous or the next post,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.040
and we don't need the text inside the brackets,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.845
because the name of the post is put in with WordPress dynamically.

00:08:26.845 --> 00:08:31.410
Save that and then refresh the browser. There we go.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:35.300
Now we've got the August newsletter and we can link to the

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.745
previous or the next post just by clicking on the buttons at the bottom.

00:08:39.745 --> 00:08:42.750
We're making good progress,

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.770
and the last thing we need to do is just at the text

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.385
at the top of the page for the single post.

00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:55.560
We'll do that in the Functions page again and we'll add another Elseif statement.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:03.230
Elseif, in fact, instead of adding a new statement on there,

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.305
we can just add it onto the is_home one.

00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:10.685
Just because we're going to be using the same text of Tranquil Spa Official Blog.

00:09:10.685 --> 00:09:13.465
So just after is_home,

00:09:13.465 --> 00:09:18.000
we use the two pipes, which means all,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.480
so if we're on the home page or the page is single,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.255
then prints out the text Tranquil Spa Official Blog.

00:09:30.255 --> 00:09:33.220
Save and refresh.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.745
Okay. Good. So that's the template finished for the single blog post,

00:09:37.745 --> 00:09:39.665
and if you join me in the next video,

00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:43.800
we'll make it possible for users to add comments to the posts.
