00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.670
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.180
I'm going to show you a couple of starter themes which are really

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.605
useful to give you a good head start when building WordPress themes.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:15.210
Throughout this course we've built everything from scratch and that's really a great way

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.475
to get started until you understand what goes on when building a WordPress theme.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:22.995
However, if we build in lots of themes,

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:25.620
we just want to get a jump start on development.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.480
It's a good idea to start with

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.140
a WordPress starter theme and a couple of popular ones are underscores and bones.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.200
So a start theme is pretty much what it sounds like.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.535
It's not the finished end products which you can download

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:43.039
off places like ThemeForest or the WordPress homepage.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.725
It's just the theme in its most basic,

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:50.480
such as all the necessary files and folders and a lot of

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.495
the required WordPress functions such as the loop

00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:58.140
and all the templates and really easy to get started with.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.975
For the underscores theme,

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:02.420
we can click on the "Advanced Options".

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.150
Then to simply generate the theme folder,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.550
all we need to do is add the information such as

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.320
our theme name and also some of the information like the slug and author,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.235
which will be put into the common section in the CSS template.

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:20.210
Then we'll just hit "Generate" and we can download that and there is also

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.725
an option to add SAS instead of the standard CSS.

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:30.370
Another popular theme as well as underscores is the bone starter theme.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.930
Just like underscores, it's free to

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.865
download and it's a really popular starter theme for WordPress theme developers.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.430
It is really worth taking a look at if you are planning to

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.745
build more themes or build themes for living.

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:49.640
But one thing to take into consideration when using bones is that it uses SAS by default.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.265
So if you're not too comfortable with SAS,

00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:55.385
you may need to brush up on that or use a different starter theme.

00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:58.130
So just to give you a better idea of what's included,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.530
I'm just going to download this theme

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.590
and then we'll take a look at the contents and see what's inside.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.360
It should be a zip file, so just unzip that.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.890
Then if we open that up,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.595
we've got the likes of the 404 page.

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:21.560
We've got the archive's page,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.605
things such as the comments, the functions,

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:28.355
the pre-built index page on the header and footer,

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:31.310
as well as many other pages that we've been creating,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.185
such as the search page,

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:38.100
the sidebar, the single dot php and the style sheets.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.670
The whole thing is designed to be customized so we'll encourage

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.525
just use this as the basic starter and then build from there.

00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:52.070
So if you take a look at the index page and open it up in your text editor.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.645
A lot of this is quite familiar.

00:02:55.645 --> 00:02:57.445
So we've got the get header,

00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:00.130
php at the top and right at the very bottom,

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.190
should be the get_footer and the get_sidebar.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.360
There's also the WordPress loop,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.680
which we scroll past that.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.525
So it goes as the open loop.

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:17.585
If we have posts and then the loop contents,

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:21.945
and it should be plenty of familiar functions in there such as the_permalink,

00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:28.575
the_title_attribute, and the_title of the_page, and then the_contents.

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:31.540
So while building a theme from scratch is a great way

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.700
to learn and a great way to get started,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.400
it's also worth considering using one of the started themes to save you a lot of work.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.000
That's it. I just wanted to show you a couple of these themes to get started with.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.385
There's plenty more out there if these two don't suit your needs.

00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:50.890
Just do a quick Google search for WordPress starter themes.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.380
I hope that gives you something to think about it.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.820
Thanks for watching. I'll see you soon.
