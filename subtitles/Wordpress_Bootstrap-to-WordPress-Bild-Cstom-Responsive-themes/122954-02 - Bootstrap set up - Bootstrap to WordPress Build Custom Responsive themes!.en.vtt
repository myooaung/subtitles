00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.620
Welcome to the Bootstrap section to this course.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.770
In this section, we'll be building our website using

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.800
the Bootstrap framework which later on in the course,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.735
we'll use to convert to a fully responsive custom WordPress theme.

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:22.845
To get started, head over to getbootstrap.com and hit the Download Bootstrap button.

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:26.040
You're then taken to the download section.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.730
There's three different versions of Bootstrap you can download.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.150
I'm just going to go for the standard version on the left. Hit the Download button.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.930
Once that's downloaded, if we go to the downloads and then unzip that.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.225
Because our theme is called tranquil spa.

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:50.475
This is the Bootstrap template.

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:53.200
I'm going to call this tranquil-wp.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:04.090
Then I want to save this onto the desktop. There we go.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.800
You should have already downloaded the images folder,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.050
which is included in this video.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.135
If you haven't, go ahead and do that now,

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:17.930
and then drop that into Bootstrap folder.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.190
If we open up the Bootstrap folder and take a look at what's included.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.145
First of all, we've got a CSS folder which includes all the Bootstrap CSS,

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:31.740
both the standard version and minified files.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.610
There's also the fonts folder,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.770
which includes all the glyph icons.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.660
As our own images folder, which we've just put in,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.890
there's also a JavaScript folder which includes the Bootstrap JavaScript files.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.705
To get started, if we open up

00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:57.690
the text editor and then I'm going to drag in our project folder.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.420
There we go. So the Bootstrap folder we just

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.200
downloaded includes pretty much everything we need to get started.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.695
The only thing I need to add for now is an index page,

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:15.245
so I'm going to press Command and N,

00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:17.855
or Control+N, to create a new page.

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:21.545
I'm going to save this as index.html,

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:26.010
and place that inside the tranquil-wp folder.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.780
Once we've got our index page,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.145
we need to now head back over to getbootstrap.com.

00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:36.980
Still within the Getting Started section,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.200
if we just scroll down a little bit further,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.340
until we find the basic template.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.965
We're going to use this as a starter template.

00:02:48.965 --> 00:02:52.505
It includes all the basic HTML structure

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:56.795
and also the links to the Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:02:56.795 --> 00:02:59.610
Just hit the copy button,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.385
then back into the index page, we can paste that in.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:12.120
For now, I'm just going to change the title of the webpage just to tranquil spa.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.940
Then let's hit the live preview button and then see how it's looking in the browser.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.700
There we go. It's a pretty basic template.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.320
We've just got the Hello, world!

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.200
heading. But it does say it was a lot of time we'd create an index page.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.335
We've mentioned that Bootstrap comes with its own CSS files,

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:36.070
which is great for a starting point.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.365
But we also want to make our template custom,

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:42.830
so we're also going to add a new CSS file.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.565
I'm going to create a new page and save that

00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:54.130
as custom.css and I'll place this in the CSS folder.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.830
Now let's link this in the index page.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.410
As you can see there's already,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.260
the link to the Bootstrap minified version,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.900
so if we just copy this and the comment,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.800
we can paste this just below and we'll call this the custom CSS,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.645
and also change the file name to custom CSS.

00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:30.655
There's just one or two other things we need to link into our webpage to get started.

00:04:30.655 --> 00:04:33.715
The next one is the custom fonts.

00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:36.080
If we head over to Google,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.300
and search for fonts.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.540
That'll take us to google.com/fonts.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.115
Once we're in there, we can search on the top-left.

00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:53.670
The font I'm going to use for this webpage is called Merriweather.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.715
You can choose a different font if you have any preferences,

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.500
but I'm going to stick with this for

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.065
now and I'm going to select the standard Merriweather.

00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:05.705
So what we need to do,

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:11.180
we need to look at the boxes on the right-hand side and click on the second box in,

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.680
which is the quick use tab.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.595
Google provides us with different font weights we can use,

00:05:18.595 --> 00:05:21.755
and every time we select a font weight to download,

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.905
it shows us the impact on the page load times.

00:05:24.905 --> 00:05:30.760
So the fonts we're going to use in this project is the 300 weight,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.090
the 400, which is the normal size,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.970
and also the 700 for the bold text.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.625
It's really easy to include into the project.

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:52.335
We can just copy the link for the head section and paste it in below our CSS.

00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:55.305
I'm also going to put a comment in there,

00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:58.305
just for the custom fonts.

00:05:58.305 --> 00:06:05.265
We'll save that and head back over to Google fonts,

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:10.685
and then the last thing we need to do is integrate our fonts into the CSS.

00:06:10.685 --> 00:06:13.470
So copy the font family,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.595
and then head over to our custom CSS file.

00:06:18.595 --> 00:06:21.890
The font family will go into the body section,

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:28.600
and I'm just going to start by adding a comment just for the Global section.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.470
This section will keep all the styles which we are going to be using throughout the site,

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.870
and we'll start with the body section.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:49.480
Paste in the font family and we will add the font weight,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.475
we'll add the standard font weight of 300,

00:06:53.475 --> 00:07:00.480
and also add the font size to be 16 pixels as standard.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.465
That's how we add the fonts to the website.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:07.820
Then the very last thing we need to do for the setup is to go back

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.900
over to Google and search for Font Awesome,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.920
and then go to the GitHub page for Font Awesome.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.065
This is going to be the I concept we're going to be using for our website.

00:07:27.065 --> 00:07:30.515
If you want to check out the icons which are available,

00:07:30.515 --> 00:07:33.620
just select the icons tab at the top and you can

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.430
take a look at all the different ones which are available.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.605
To download this, we need to go to, Get started.

00:07:41.605 --> 00:07:45.530
There's a couple of easy ways to include these in our project.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.050
We're going to go with the CDN route,

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:58.840
which simply involves copying the link and then pasting that into our head section.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.520
This links our website to the Font Awesome icons,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.890
which are hosted at this address.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.255
Lastly, I'm going to copy the comment,

00:08:13.255 --> 00:08:16.830
paste that in, and name this,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:21.870
Font Awesome, and then save that.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.155
There we go. So that's our Bootstrap section, all setup.

00:08:25.155 --> 00:08:26.975
If you join me in the next video,

00:08:26.975 --> 00:08:30.750
we'll continue with the project by creating the head section.
