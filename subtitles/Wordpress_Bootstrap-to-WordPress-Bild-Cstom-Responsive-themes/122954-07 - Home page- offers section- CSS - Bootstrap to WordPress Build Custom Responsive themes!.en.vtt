00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.800
In this video, we'll continue with the latest offers section.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.380
In the last video, we added the HTML for the free separate offers and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.880
in this video we're going to be adding

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.530
the CSS to make it look more like the finished projects.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.670
We are going to be adding the purple background color for the full section.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.700
We'll also be changing the background and text color for the free individual offers.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.260
We'll also be making sure that the pricing circle is positioned

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.165
horizontally in the middle of the div and also overlapping at the top.

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:39.165
We'll do that with some absolute positioning.

00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:42.970
If we go over to our CSS,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.260
we can create a new section.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.830
Let's do this at the bottom just before the mobile styling.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.380
This is the latest offers.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.075
The latest offers section had the ID of latest offers.

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:10.135
We'll just use this to create the purple background color.

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:12.250
Set the font color to be white,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.490
and also make sure that all the text is aligned.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.700
First of all, we'll set the text-align to be in the center.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.585
Because we're using a purple background color or dark background colors,

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:27.910
we want the div to have white text.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.260
The purple background color has the ID of 97689c.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.290
Let's take a look in the browser.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.740
Now we've got the purple background color and the white text,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.390
so we can move on to the three individual offer divs.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.220
If we look back into the index page, the free offers,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.655
we give them a custom class of offer,

00:02:00.655 --> 00:02:03.190
we used on all three of them.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.900
We can select that now.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.540
So the class of offer.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.900
We're going to set the dark background color first.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.540
The background for the free offers has an ID of 4a525f.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.749
There we go. Because these will be containers for the price and circles,

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.150
we're going to set the position to be relative.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.580
To make them a little bit taller,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:45.425
we'll add a minimum height of 350 pixels high and a little bit of padding.

00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:48.860
I'm going to add 40 pixels on the top and bottom,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.610
and then 10 pixels on the left and right.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.085
Then next we can start at any price and circles.

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:05.880
The price and circles were wrapped in a span tag.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.740
Select them using the offer class and then span.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.430
Let's start by changing the background color.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:29.550
The circles will have the color of 8abbb1 and the display is going to be set to block.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.860
We give these a height and width of 100 pixels.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.250
Because the price is going to be inside,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.100
we'll set the text-align to be center.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.230
Let's take look and see how that's looking so far.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.440
We've got the free pricing divs appearing,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.350
we've got a different background color.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.840
Next we need to make them a circle.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.305
Then we need to look a position in the circles where we want them.

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:05.440
To make those circles,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.020
we can just add a border-radius of 100 percent,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.175
and that makes him into a circle.

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:20.730
Then to make the text vertically aligned,

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:27.004
we can also set the line-height to be 100 pixels,

00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:30.415
which is the same as the full height of the div,

00:04:30.415 --> 00:04:35.010
and that moves the price into the middle of the circle.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.730
Because we've got a relative container to work from,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.200
we can set these pricing circles to have a absolute position.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.690
We'll start referencing these circles from the left-hand side of the container.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.090
We'll add some margin-left of

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:05.290
50 percent to put

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.360
that into the middle of the container.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.959
Now it's not quite in the middle because we need to compensate

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:16.535
for half of the width of the circle. Let's do that now.

00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:18.715
If we set the left,

00:05:18.715 --> 00:05:22.630
we can set the value to be negative 50 pixels,

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.740
which is half the width and that should make them horizontally centered.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.735
Then next we can reference the circle from the top. Let's set the top.

00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:38.635
Now if we would set the value of the top to be zero,

00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:42.865
what would happen is a circle would go to the top of the container,

00:05:42.865 --> 00:05:47.095
but we need the circle to be overlapping by half of the height.

00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:50.265
Instead of setting the top to be zero,

00:05:50.265 --> 00:05:53.780
we can set the top to be negative 50,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.460
which is half of the height.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.920
There we go. That's the positioning exactly where we want it.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.335
Just to finish off the pricing section,

00:06:06.335 --> 00:06:09.990
we'll just add the font size and the font-weight.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:17.285
The font size which end up to 2ems,

00:06:17.285 --> 00:06:23.400
and lastly the font-weight is going to be bold.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.730
There we go. Then next we'll create some spacing.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.500
The author name is in a level 3 heading.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.860
Let's add some margin to the bottom just to push the text

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.805
favored on and we can also increase the font size too.

00:06:40.805 --> 00:06:43.780
Below the span section,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.640
we've got the class of offer and then h3.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:07:00.970
Margin-bottom is 50 pixels and also let's change the font size to be 1.2ems.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.170
That gives us a little bit more space below the heading.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.220
I'm also going to add some spacing between the two lines

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.520
below by adding some extra line-height.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.760
The two lines were in P tags.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:25.540
The offer p, we can increase the line-height to 2ems.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.490
That gives you a little bit more of vertical spacing.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:40.355
Now let's create some space between the divider and also the free special offer sections.

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:44.930
If you remember back in the index page in the first row,

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.695
which had the level 2 heading on the divide image.

00:07:48.695 --> 00:07:54.035
We also added a custom class of margin-bottom.

00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:57.990
We can add that custom CSS,

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.695
and push the free divs down.

00:08:01.695 --> 00:08:11.085
Let's set the margin-bottom to be 70 pixels and see how that looks.

00:08:11.085 --> 00:08:14.960
Great. That's exactly how we want it looking on the desktop view.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.495
If we shrink the browser down,

00:08:17.495 --> 00:08:23.085
down to a mobile size and then scroll down to the free offers,

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:26.735
we just need to make a little change on the margin-bottom

00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:31.445
because the free divs blend into one when they are stacked on top of each other.

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:39.830
We can easily fix that if we find the section with the offer class.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:46.760
Then we can add some margin onto the bottom of 60 pixels.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.355
Let's see how that looks.

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:51.860
That looks better now. We've got space between

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.710
the three special offers on the mobile view.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.770
That's it. That's the end of the latest offer section.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.220
Thanks for listening, and I'll see you in the next video.
