00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.720
Welcome back. Now, we've got our Bootstrap project all set up.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.150
Let's take a look at the final project and

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.345
take a look at what we are going to be building in this section.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:16.870
So next we're going to be adding the HTML for the header section.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.300
The header section contains a navigation bar across the top,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.525
which is going to have the logo in the top left.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.220
Also on the right-hand side,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.725
we're going to have the menu links.

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:35.480
We're going to add a large background image and also the featured text in the center,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.085
which is going to be both horizontally and vertically aligned.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:43.835
The text and image is going to be static for now.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:47.615
But once we get onto the WordPress section later on in the course,

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:52.640
the user will be able to change the background and also the text.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.920
So to get started with the header section,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.715
let's head over to our text editor and let's get rid of the sidebar for now.

00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:03.675
So if we scroll down,

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:08.385
we can delete the hello world h1 heading,

00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:13.570
and then let start with a comment for the header section.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.270
Okay, so the header section will be between the header tags.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.560
We're going to get started with the navigation bar at the top of the page.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.945
So that will be in nav tags and it's going to have some Bootstrap classes.

00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:37.300
The first one will be

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.250
navbar and then navbar-default.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.270
So we'll be using a lot these bootstrap classes as we go through the project.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.245
If you are curious to know exactly what each one of these is doing,

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:59.745
we can go over to the Bootstrap CSS in the CSS folder.

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:03.105
If we'll look for the bootstrap.css,

00:02:03.105 --> 00:02:06.240
for example, if we look for navbar-default.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.674
So heading to Bootstrap CSS,

00:02:08.674 --> 00:02:12.620
and if you use your text editor's find function

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.340
and then type in the class you want to look for.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.135
So I'm going to look for a navbar-default.

00:02:18.135 --> 00:02:22.040
This will then take you to the section of the CSS which applies.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.565
So we can see that by adding a navbar-default,

00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:29.610
it includes various borders and background colors.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.840
So we can use this if you want to know exactly what's

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.075
going on in the CSS behind the scenes.

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:39.950
But it's also worth bearing in mind that any of these bootstrap classes we have included,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.640
we can also add to or override in our own custom CSS file.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.690
So next we're going to add a div with the class of container-fluid.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.925
Again, container-fluid is a bootstrap class.

00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:02.235
You can either use container-fluid,

00:03:02.235 --> 00:03:08.555
which provides a fluid full-width div or you can use the container class by itself,

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.470
which includes a div with a fixed width.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.415
Then within the container fluid,

00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:18.690
we're going to create a new div with a class of navbar-header.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.750
Within this div, this is going to be the section

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.335
which includes the information for screen readers.

00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:30.739
Also, we take a look at the finished project.

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.215
You can see if we shrink the browser down,

00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:35.375
it's a fully responsive website.

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:37.985
So once we get below a certain size,

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:41.780
the navigation menu turns into a drop-down menu.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.230
So the header is also going to contain the information for the drop-down button.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.530
So let's start with that button now.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.720
The button is going to have a type of button.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.030
We'll add some Bootstrap classes.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.960
The first one is navbar-toggle, and then collapsed.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.220
It's going to be collapsed by default,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:20.790
so we can add the data-toggle to be equal to collapse and

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.310
the data-target is equal

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.280
to.navbar-collapse.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.160
So what the data-target is doing,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.890
this is linked in the button to a div with a class all navbar-collapse.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.310
We'll create that after the button.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.340
Nested inside the button,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.275
we're going to add the three icon bars,

00:04:52.275 --> 00:04:54.170
which are on the drop-down button.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.600
So the first one,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.705
these will all be between span tags.

00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:04.765
The first span tag will just be a class for screen readers.

00:05:04.765 --> 00:05:09.720
This will have a class of sr-only and

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.885
the text for the screen reader will be toggle navigation.

00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:24.880
Then next, we'll add another span with a class of icon-bar.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.030
So this is the first of the three icon bars.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.895
So it's going to be exactly the same for two more.

00:05:31.895 --> 00:05:38.160
So we can just Copy and Paste or Duplicate that and just change the spelling there.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.820
There we go. Okay, so let's check that on the preview.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.620
There we go. So on the smaller screen,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.830
we've got the drop-down button appearing there.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.710
That should disappear once we get to a certain size. There we go.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.730
Next, we need to add the logo to

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.870
the top left hand corner and also the three navigation links.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.995
So to start, the logo is going to go just below the button,

00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:10.015
but still within the navbar header div,

00:06:10.015 --> 00:06:11.910
and it's going to be a link.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.230
So we'll put the href of tags and this is going to

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.505
link back to the index page, which is index.html.

00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:25.860
The bootstrap class is navbar-brand.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.695
Because our logo is simply text,

00:06:30.695 --> 00:06:33.005
we can just type this in there.

00:06:33.005 --> 00:06:35.605
So Tranquil Spa.

00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:39.090
That's the end of the navbar header section.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.160
So I'm just going to add some comments.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.525
So we'll call this the navbar-header and we'll end that there.

00:06:51.525 --> 00:06:54.420
So just below the navbar-header div,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.365
the next day we will have the three links of home,

00:06:58.365 --> 00:07:00.495
blog and latest news.

00:07:00.495 --> 00:07:08.190
So the container div will have the class of collapse.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.065
Then next, we'll add the navbar-collapse class,

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:15.270
which we used for the data target.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.100
Then within this collapse section,

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:29.110
we'll add our unordered list and add our bootstrap classes of nav navbar-nav,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.440
and also navbar-right,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.450
which pushes the navigation links to the right-hand side of the div,

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.790
then free list items,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.370
which are also links.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.980
So the href, for the first link is for home,

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.845
so this will link to the index.html,

00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:55.750
and the text was home.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.875
We need two more list items.

00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:06.930
The second one is for the blog.html and change the name.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:12.250
The third link is for the latest new section.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.355
Now I'm just going to leave the link empty for this one,

00:08:16.355 --> 00:08:20.345
we'll be creating our template for the blog section using bootstrap.

00:08:20.345 --> 00:08:22.970
But when it comes to the latest news section,

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.690
this is going to be dynamically generated in WordPress.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.050
We're basically going to be using the blog page,

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.345
but we're just going to use a filter,

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:36.810
just to filter out the blog posts to be the latest news category.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.290
Then let's adds some comments.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:45.630
So let's first add a comment to the navbar-collapse closing div,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.670
and then the last one is for the container-fluid.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.670
I can close that up there.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.740
So let's check that out in the browser and see how that's looking.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.800
Great. So we've got the logo appearing.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.160
We've got the three links on the right-hand side.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.990
Shrinking the browser down,

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.905
that drops to a drop-down button,

00:09:18.905 --> 00:09:22.830
which expands to show the three links.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.855
By the way, because this drop-down button is working,

00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:31.400
this also shows that our our Bootstrap JavaScript,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.055
which is included in the js folder,

00:09:34.055 --> 00:09:37.130
is all linked correctly and it's all working.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.690
Down at the very bottom of the page,

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.680
you can see that the links are already included in the bootstrap template,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.925
both for jQuery and also the Bootstrap JavaScript.

00:09:46.925 --> 00:09:49.475
So we know that's all working correctly.

00:09:49.475 --> 00:09:53.255
Now, we've got our navigation bar complete.

00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:59.550
Next, we're going to start on the background image and also the text.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.415
We're going to call this the feature section.

00:10:03.415 --> 00:10:08.455
So we're going to put this just below the navigation.

00:10:08.455 --> 00:10:12.270
Let's Copy that header and then Paste

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.750
this just below the closing and nav tag but still within the header.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:22.510
I'm going to call this the FEATURE SECTION.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.825
So because the feature section has

00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:31.120
a large background image which we want to stretch to the full width of the page,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.780
we're going to make use of the bootstrap container-fluid again.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.590
Then within the container fluid,

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.355
we need to add another bootstrap class of

00:10:45.355 --> 00:10:51.490
row and also our own custom class, which is feature.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.165
So we can link to that in the CSS in the next video.

00:10:55.165 --> 00:10:58.030
Then add the path to the image.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.605
So image sauce.

00:11:00.605 --> 00:11:08.020
We've got Images folder within the project and then the large background image is

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:15.555
called lakebg.jpeg and add some alt text in there.

00:11:15.555 --> 00:11:18.910
I'm just going to add lake backgrounds.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.720
So let's check if that's working okay.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.320
I head back into our project.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.740
So there we go, there is a large image pinned in the background.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.280
So let's next add the text which overlays the image.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.670
The text will be going in its own div,

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:44.560
and we'll add a custom class of feature-text.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.365
Then inside this container,

00:11:49.365 --> 00:11:51.960
we'll add our text in the p tags.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.390
So the text was FULLY RESPONSIVE

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:04.660
PREMIUM SPA THEME FOR WORDPRESS.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.155
Then I'm going to add some break tags after

00:12:09.155 --> 00:12:13.820
the word responsive and also after the word theme,

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.540
just to split that up into different lines.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.545
So if we go back into the browser and see how that's looking,

00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:24.530
we won't have the text appearing over the image just

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.985
yet because we need to add some CSS for that to work.

00:12:27.985 --> 00:12:30.545
But the text is appearing just below,

00:12:30.545 --> 00:12:32.480
so we don't need to worry about that just yet.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.915
We'll solve that in the next video.

00:12:34.915 --> 00:12:39.579
So we'll just finish this section off by adding some closing comments.

00:12:39.579 --> 00:12:48.330
First of all to the fluid-container and then to the div with the class of row,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.580
and then the feature text.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:04.610
So there we go. So that's the end of the HTML for the header section.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.290
If you join me in the next video,

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.310
we'll continue with the header section by adding the CSS.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:14.730
I'm going also take a look at the bootstrap rows and grid system.
