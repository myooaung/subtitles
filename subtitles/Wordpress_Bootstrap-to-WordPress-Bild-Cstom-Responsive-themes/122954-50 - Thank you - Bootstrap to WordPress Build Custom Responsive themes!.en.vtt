00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.205
Congratulations on finishing this course.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.665
I just want to say a big thank you for taking this course

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:11.565
and especially well done if you've made it to the very end.

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:16.395
I hope you've enjoyed taking this course as much as I enjoyed putting it all together.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:20.250
I really hope building this project has give you the skills and confidence you

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.285
need to continue building custom themes for yourself,

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:28.130
the paying clients, or even making WordPress themes to sell.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.820
We've covered a great deal in this course.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.960
Hopefully, you should be now comfortable using Bootstrap.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.225
We then installed a localhost on WordPress to begin the conversion.

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:41.585
We then set up our WordPress theme folder on index page,

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:44.005
and then the header and footer templates.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:48.785
We then continued the conversion to WordPress by adding the nav walker,

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:53.245
and also amending the image file paths to work with WordPress.

00:00:53.245 --> 00:01:00.700
We then moved on to the famous WordPress loop and began constructing the blog index page.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.050
We then made sure we could add comments to

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.595
the blog and went through all the various page templates,

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:09.125
and then linked these templates to our code.

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:12.735
We then organized our code using Get Template part,

00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:15.200
and then moved on to more advanced features,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.695
such as advanced custom fields,

00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:19.350
adding a post class,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.370
and custom header images to make sure that our theme is fully customizable.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.550
Then lastly, we finished off by making sure our contact form was

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.770
fully functional and also prepared our theme for translation.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.975
Once again, a big thank you from me for taking this course.

00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:40.290
Congratulations for finishing it and good luck in the future.
