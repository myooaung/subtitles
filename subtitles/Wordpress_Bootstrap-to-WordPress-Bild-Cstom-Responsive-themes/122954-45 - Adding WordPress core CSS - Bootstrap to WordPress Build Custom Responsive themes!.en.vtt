00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.390
Okay, welcome. So far,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.580
we've added all our Bootstrap CSS and we've also added some custom CSS.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.445
But this is just going to be a quick video,

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:15.060
just to add in some WordPress core CSS,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.770
which is required for the theme.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.730
So we head over to Google and search for WordPress core CSS.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:32.230
The first result should be the codex with the CSS section, so select that.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.390
Then, if you scroll down,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.750
you should find there's Core WordPress section,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.495
which we're going to copy and place in our theme.

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:46.910
Now, the majority of this is for captions and aligning images,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.405
and a little bit for accessibility.

00:00:49.405 --> 00:00:52.185
These are required WordPress core styles.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.240
So I want to copy the section,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.710
all the way down to the very bottom.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.920
So also screen readers there.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.080
So copy that, and then,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.245
over to our theme folder into the style.css,

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:14.750
I'm just going to paste this just above the Global section and then save that.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.130
So we've got the CSS for screen readers.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.050
We got some custom styling for captions and the caption text on images.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.120
There's also a margin added to the captions and also some styling for the align,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.420
for the right, left, center or none.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.290
So I'm just going to save that, and that's it.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.960
That's all I wanted to show you in this video.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.115
We just wanted to make sure that the core styles weren't missed out of our theme.

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:49.470
So that's it and will see you in the next video.
