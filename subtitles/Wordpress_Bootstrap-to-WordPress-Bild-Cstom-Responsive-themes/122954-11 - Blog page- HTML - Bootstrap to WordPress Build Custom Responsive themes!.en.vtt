00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.195
Welcome back. We've now finished our index page, our Bootstrap template.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:07.890
In these next few videos,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.385
we're going to be creating the last few pages to finish off

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:15.270
our Bootstrap template and then we can start converting to WordPress.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.060
In this video, we are going to be starting with the blog page.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.790
If we take a look at the finished project,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.520
we can get an idea of what we are going to be creating.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.230
We'll be reusing the header section and also the background image.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.385
But we'll be changing the text to Tranquil Spa Official Blog.

00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:38.965
Then scrolling down, we're going to have the individual blog posts on the left-hand side.

00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:42.145
We'll put three of those in our template.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:45.665
We'll have some links to older and newer posts.

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:47.270
On the right-hand side,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.740
we'll have a sidebar.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.290
The sidebar will have a little bit of text about the website.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.265
We'll have an archives page where all the blog posts will be stored by months and year.

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:00.830
We'll also be separating the blog posts into categories,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.510
and then if we go a little bit further down the page,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.495
we'll also be re-using the footer section.

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:08.990
Most of the sidebar will just be empty links for now.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.445
These will be generated dynamically in WordPress.

00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:15.500
We'll just be adding them in Bootstrap as empty links to get

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.370
the look and feel of the site. Let's get started.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.260
We'll head over to our text editor with our project.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.460
Then let's create a new page and save that as blog.html,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.030
and make that's saved in the same level as the index page.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:42.090
Then if you go into the index page that we finished earlier and select all and copy.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.445
Then we can use this as a starting point for our blog page and paste that in.

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:53.510
As I mentioned earlier, we'll be using the same header section.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:02.010
If we scroll down to the end of the closing header tag, which is just there,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.360
we can start by deleting the Welcome section and delete

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.230
[inaudible] section and keep going all the way down to

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.030
the start of the footer section and then delete that.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.740
At this [inaudible] , we've just got the header and footer section.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.620
The first thing I'm going to change is the feature text.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.680
We're just going to change this to Tranquil Spa Official Blog.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.740
There we go. Then we're going to use a Bootstrap template for our blogs.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.040
If we head over to getbootstrap.com,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.250
and then select the Getting Started section.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.765
If we scroll down to the Bootstrap templates,

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:57.620
you'll see these default templates that Bootstrap provides.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.390
There should be one called Blog.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.270
So we select the Blog.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.580
We are going to be selecting some of the parts of this website to use as a template.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.070
The sidebar is on the right-hand side and also the blog post on the left.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.085
This is going to create a good starting point for our blog.

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:19.245
To get the code for this we need to Control-click or Right-click.

00:03:19.245 --> 00:03:21.940
Go to "View Page Source".

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.780
We're going to copy the code with the blog post on the sidebar.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.090
If we just scroll down a little bit further.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.575
We need to copy the container which is just below the blog-masthead.

00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:40.970
Copy the opening container and then down past the posts.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.940
We'll need to copy all the way down to the sidebar.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.905
It's at end of the sidebar,

00:03:46.905 --> 00:03:49.320
end the row, and the end of the container.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.120
Copy all our section and then go back into

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.550
the text editor between the header and the footer section, let's paste that in.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.500
To make things a little bit more clearer,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.690
we can add some comments.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.990
Let's add the first comment to the sidebar.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.720
If you look for the end of the blog and paste this just below.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:24.140
Change an entity sidebar section and then scroll up.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.500
Then up to the opening blog post,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.110
which is just above the container. Paste that in.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.030
This can be the blog section.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.890
Next, we'll take a look at how that's looking so

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.620
far and we'll see what changes we need to make.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.035
We've got our header section,

00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:50.990
and then we've got the sample blog post on the left,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.510
on the sidebar exactly where we wanted.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.250
Then we've got the footer section at the bottom.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.300
Back into the text editor,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.770
we just want to remove the bootstrap blog heading at the top.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.150
Let's do that now. We'll just leave the full div with the blog header.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.920
Let's take a look at that. That's the heading removed.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.225
By default on the Bootstrap template that we just copied.

00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:26.375
There's three different styles of blog posts.

00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:28.770
To keep our website consistent,

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.775
I'm just going to use the third blog post.

00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:34.785
We've gone back into the blog section,

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:39.340
and each individual blog post has a class of blog post.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.580
So we know where each block starts and ends.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.330
This is the first one. I want to scroll down to

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.170
the closing tag for the blog post and delete this one.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.860
I'm also going to delete the second blog post.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.280
Look for the closing div,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.315
for the blog post, and select that and delete.

00:06:08.315 --> 00:06:11.965
Now, we're just left with the third and final blog posts.

00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:20.540
To put this back in, we want to copy the style and then paste it back in twice below.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.580
Let's check in the browser. Now we've

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.625
got free blog posts back on our page but with a consistent style.

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:35.435
Then next we'll change the text in the About to section on the sidebar.

00:06:35.435 --> 00:06:41.095
Scroll down to the sidebar section and if we locate the About section,

00:06:41.095 --> 00:06:46.850
we can just delete the sample text between the P tags and let's put our own text in.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.530
Welcome to the official Tranquil Spar Blog.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.470
Then a second sentence just below,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.480
also in P tags.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.730
Here you will find all the latest news

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.660
on what's going on here at the Spa.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.500
That's the About us section.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.540
Will keep the archives as it is for now and we'll make

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.080
this work dynamically in WordPress later on in the course.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.650
The Elsewhere section, let's change it to Categories.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.940
Let's add some categories in there for now.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:49.250
The first one we can be changed into news and then offers and then lastly uncategorize.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.080
Then we'll put our social media section in.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:02.005
If we copy the sidebar module div and paste this in just below,

00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:05.720
we can change the categories to Follow Us.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.580
Because we've got all the social media links already in the footer section.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.300
We can just go back into our index page.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:24.950
Can locate the social media icons down at the very bottom in the footer.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:33.430
If we copy the five social media links and then paste these back into the blog section.

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:37.990
Delete those first and paste them in.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.570
Then let's save that and see how it's looking in the browser.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.795
That's a [inaudible]. We've got the About us text.

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:50.999
We've then got the Archives,

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:55.300
the Category section, and the social media section.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.085
That's nearly finished with the blog HTML.

00:08:59.085 --> 00:09:04.920
Just one more little thing I'd like to change is if we go to the container for the blog.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:14.300
One thing I'd like to change for the number of columns on the blog on the sidebar.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:21.165
By default, Bootstrap has the blog section taking up eight parts on the smaller devices.

00:09:21.165 --> 00:09:23.735
I'd like ours to be 12 columns wide,

00:09:23.735 --> 00:09:29.695
smaller devices, and then change to eight on medium devices.

00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:31.580
Then we also need to go down to

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:38.300
the sidebar section and do the same for the sidebar wrapper.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.065
To make the sidebar go full width on smaller devices,

00:09:42.065 --> 00:09:48.780
we can change that to 12 columns and then change it to col-md-3.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.485
To take the three columns on medium devices.

00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:54.890
Then because we change that to medium,

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.300
we'll also change the offset on the medium devices to one.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.985
Just as a little bit of distance between the blog post on the sidebar and then save that.

00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:08.240
That's just finished for the HTML for the blog section.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.070
If you join me in the next video,

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.980
we'll continue with our blog page by adding the CSS.
