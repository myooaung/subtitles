00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.530
Welcome back, guys. In this video,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.270
we're going to take a look at the sidebar.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.255
We're going to make sure that it's fully functional.

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:12.510
We're going to make sure that the archives module and

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.749
the category section is going to be dynamic,

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.170
meaning that WordPress will populate the categories and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.350
the months of the year by the blog posts that are available.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.860
So we'll filter them down to how we would like them displayed.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.235
The text that's in the archives are in category section.

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:31.935
It's just currently static HTML.

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:34.890
It's just what we've pulled in from the Bootstrap site.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.510
I'm going to change that now.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.390
We'll change this in the sidebar.php. Head over to that now.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.450
We'll start with the month of the year.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.650
If we just delete all of the list items for now,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.690
I'm going to replace this with a WordPress PHP function.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.375
Open up the PHP tags.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:01:03.780
Then inside this, we're going to replace it with wp_get_archives,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.965
with the brackets and a semicolon,

00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:12.680
and then save that, and head back over to the blog and refresh.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.500
Now, we'll use all the Bootstrap months of the year,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.015
which we put in earlier on.

00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:20.510
Now we're just left with the WordPress generated months.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.515
Currently, I've only got posts in the month of August.

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:26.615
Just to give it a little bit more content,

00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:29.020
I'm just going to add one more post.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.295
I'll just copy the sample text.

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:34.980
So add one more post.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.045
I'm going to call this the September news,

00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:42.565
and then paste in a little bit of text in there.

00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:45.419
This can go in the news category,

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:50.110
and a tag of news, and then publish that.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.420
Then go back to the blog section.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.445
Now we've got posts from two separate months.

00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:04.720
We can see that WordPress adds these in automatically.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.230
We're going to do exactly the same with the category section.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:14.680
Back to the sidebar.php and find the category section,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.665
which is just below the archives,

00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:21.100
and then delete the free list items that we've got in there.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.050
Open up the PHP, and the PHP function that we use

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.500
is

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.625
wp_list_categories and save that,

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.205
and then refresh the blog.

00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:46.940
Now the sidebar module under the categories has got the WordPress categories,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.670
that we'll inputting in as we create the blogposts.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.255
We've got an extra categories title in there which we don't want,

00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:57.705
so the way to remove that is back in sidebar.php,

00:02:57.705 --> 00:03:02.850
within the WP Lists Categories function, within the brackets,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:13.020
we can remove the title between the quotations by typing in title_li equals,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.035
we can just leave that blank so no title appears.

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:17.820
We'll save and refresh.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.390
We're just left with our level for heading that we've put in ourselves.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.950
Now WordPress has put the months and the categories in.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.520
We can actually select these links now.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.625
This should fill it down the blog page to show

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:35.195
posts only by the category of the month we select.

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:39.785
We selected News there and we'll just check it's all working by scrolling down.

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.570
We've just got two posts there,

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.985
both for the category of news.

00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:46.550
So if we select September,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.000
we should just get the one post that we made today. Now, let's try one more.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.470
Let's try the Offers section.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.070
We've just got the one blog post with the Offers category.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.425
That all appears to be working fine.

00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:02.975
If you join me in the next video,

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:05.075
we'll create the archive.php,

00:04:05.075 --> 00:04:07.860
which controls the layout of this view.
