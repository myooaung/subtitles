00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.775
When building websites or doing any kind of coding in general,

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:11.340
one thing we want to try and avoid is retyping the same code over and over again.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.920
If we go into our homepage,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.455
we've got the facility section.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:19.130
We've used is a couple of times on the website now.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.155
So we've reused the same code.

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:24.035
So we've got to in the front page.

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:28.890
If we also go down to the about us page,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.255
we reuse the same section at the bottom.

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:36.040
It's also in the 404 page that we created in the last video.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.635
One way we can reduce the amount of lines of code in our website,

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:42.140
and make our website a little bit more organized,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.235
is to use the get template part.

00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:48.500
This is basically just a section of our website,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.240
which you put on its own file.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.940
We can then call it into our page

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.260
just the same way as we did with the header and the footer.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.520
To get the code for this section,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.130
we're going to create a new page.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.320
I'm going to call this the content-facilities.php.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.620
Let's start by going to the front page of our website.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:27.540
If we look for the facility section, which is this part here.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.005
It's the div with the class of row on facilities.

00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.410
Look for the close and row tag.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.750
So cut this content out.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.650
So cut that making sure that you still leave the container in place.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.425
Then in the file we just created,

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:53.680
we can paste this in and then save that.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.985
Then go back into the front page,

00:01:56.985 --> 00:02:01.260
and in the same section that we've just remove this content,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.450
open up the PHP tags.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.960
Then we use gets_templates_part.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.745
Then in the brackets we use the name of the template that we just created.

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:20.850
Its content-facilities.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.030
Let's save that and head over to the front page and see if it's working okay.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.300
Yes, so that's all there.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.105
Just to show that it's pulling it from the template.

00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:39.320
If we just make a spelling mistake there and then refresh.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.930
You'll now see that that's being removed.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.950
Let's correct that and save.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.580
Copy this section of PHP,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.110
and we'll do the same in 404 page on the bowers page.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.125
So we'll start with the page about,

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:59.650
then look for the div with the class of facilities.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.660
Find in the close and row tags,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.310
and delete this section,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.430
and then paste it into PHP.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.695
The same with the 404 page,

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:22.300
so as the row facilities closing tag.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.660
Lay down paste in the get template part and hit "Save".

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.240
Let's go over to the website and see if it's working.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.180
We know all from page is working well.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.760
Let's go to the About Us page and it just there.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.560
Let's type in a address which we will recognize and we check to the 404 page.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.605
There's the facility section again at the bottom.

00:03:53.605 --> 00:03:56.630
We can use this with any section of the website that you

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.990
want or if you create in your own custom theme.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.105
If you find you create in the same HTML over and over again,

00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:09.465
just put it in its own template and pull inward you get template part.

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:12.215
It really makes your website a lot more organized.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:14.630
So that's it, and I will see you in the next video where we'll

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.270
create the custom template for the search page.
