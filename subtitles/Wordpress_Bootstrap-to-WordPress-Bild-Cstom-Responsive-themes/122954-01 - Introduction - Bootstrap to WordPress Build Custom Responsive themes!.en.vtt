00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.670
Welcome to this course on building

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.930
a custom responsive WordPress theme using the Bootstrap free framework.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.735
My name is Chris, and I'll be guiding you through the process step by step.

00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:16.930
We will get started by building a great look and theme template using Bootstrap,

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.225
one of the most popular front-end frameworks in the world.

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:22.450
Once this is built, I will guide you through

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.750
the process of converting this to a fully functional,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.640
great looking custom WordPress theme.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.240
In this course, you will learn things such as how to create websites using Bootstrap,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.865
adding custom navigation menus,

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:40.845
the WordPress loop, how WordPress templates work.

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:44.175
You will learn about widgets, custom fields,

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:50.615
header images, how to add language translation spots to your theme, and much more.

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:53.120
So this would be the great looking website we're going to

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.670
be building throughout this course.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.500
This is the homepage.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.490
It's a Spa based WordPress theme.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.635
I'm going to guide you through every step of the process.

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:06.560
So we're not just going to be building the homepage.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.485
We're going to actually be building the full site,

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:12.139
including various blog pages,

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:14.590
Contact, and About Us pages.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.790
As we get to the WordPress section,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.380
later on in the course,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.200
areas such as the Latest Offers section,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.970
we'll be adding custom fields to,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.950
to make sure that the website is fully customizable.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.525
Scrolling further down, we've got a Shop Online section.

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:34.210
Then the Photo section at the bottom with various links,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.615
the About Us, the Contact Us page.

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:40.140
If you scroll back to the top of the page,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.695
we'll also have a fully functional block.

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:44.600
We have a working sidebar,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.765
which includes a search box,

00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:50.755
and also ways to filter down the posts by the tags,

00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:54.725
the categories, or the months of the year,

00:01:54.725 --> 00:02:00.180
and of course this will fully customizable by the site administrator.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.975
We'll also make sure that users of your website can leave comments on the posts.

00:02:04.975 --> 00:02:07.270
So if you go into the individual posts,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.365
you will now get the full version.

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:14.900
Links to previous annexed posts and the Comments section below.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.875
Also we'll have a Latest News section,

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.650
which is pretty much based on the blog section.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.650
But we apply WordPress filters to filter down

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.310
the blog posts by posts start with the category of news,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.310
and we'll show you how to do that.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.240
There'll be no unnecessary content just to fill up the course,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.380
just straight to the point videos.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.950
Each one teaching you a new skill to use for your own projects or for paying clients,

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.075
and you will also pick up some PHP along the way.

00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:45.970
