00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.560
Okay. Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.900
we're going to be looking at the index page and we're going to

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.645
start rearranging the header and the footer,

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:13.110
and also adding some content to our functions file.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.825
Okay. So a couple of things before we get started.

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:18.435
If you make sure that the MAMP,

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:22.285
which you downloaded in the last video is up and running.

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:24.345
So if you say start servers,

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:27.970
make sure that you click on them to get that started.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.960
Then in your text editor,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.255
if you open up the tranquilwp ,

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.595
which is the theme folder for the project,

00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:39.880
and then head over to your web browser,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.990
and then if you type in the local host,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.980
:8888 and then forward slash tranquil-wp,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.025
and this will take us to the index page that we need to begin working on.

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:58.400
If you need to get back to the WordPress dashboard,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.725
we need to just add /admin onto the end of the URL,

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:06.670
and that will take us back to the dashboard.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.835
Okay. So let's get started.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.545
In the text editor,

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:14.780
we created our header and the footer files in the last video.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.960
So we're going to put both the header and the footer in these files.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.845
So we're going to take the header and the footer from the index page.

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:27.410
So if you go to the index.php and then scroll to the top of the page,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.845
we need to copy or quote all the content from the very top of the web page,

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:41.235
all the way down until we get to the closing header tag, which is just there.

00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:47.820
So copy all that right to the very top and then cut that,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.710
and now the header section is going to go into its own file,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.095
which is the header.php.

00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:57.400
So paste that in there and save,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.140
and then if we go back into the index page,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.300
we'll do exactly the same with the footer section.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.135
So scroll down to the bottom of the page and then below the shop online section,

00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:10.945
if you look for the footer comment,

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:17.345
and then cut all the content right to the very end of the index page.

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:22.265
So cut that, and then head to the footer.php,

00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:25.225
and paste that in and save.

00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:29.130
Okay. So if we go back to the index.php.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.520
So what we're left with is just the main content of the web page.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.480
We've taken out the header and the footer section.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.140
So because now the header and the footer are in their own files,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.320
we need to link those back to the index page.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.285
Not quite straightforward to do.

00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:48.590
If we go back to the very top where the header section was,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.010
we're going to start using some PHP.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.730
So to begin with PHP,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.920
first of all we need to have the file name with the PHP extension,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.495
and then to use PHP in the page,

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:09.835
we use an opening angle bracket and then a question mark, and then PHP.

00:03:09.835 --> 00:03:14.180
So this is the opening tag and the closing tag is

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.565
the question mark and then the closing angle bracket.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:22.070
Okay. Then between the opening and closing bracket,

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.755
we use the WordPress get header function.

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:27.335
So get_header.

00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:33.310
Because it's function, we use the curly brackets and then a semicolon at the end,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.900
and then we do exactly the same but use get footer at the very bottom of the page.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.310
So again, we'll use the PHP opening and closing tags,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.005
and then inside the tags,

00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:51.180
we use a WordPress get footer function,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.320
the brackets, and then the semicolon.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.395
So effectively what we've created is a header and a footer template,

00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:02.650
and every time we want to reuse these in WordPress,

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.030
rather than retyping over the same code over and over again,

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.375
we can just simply use the PHP and use the get header or the get footer function.

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:15.805
So and save the index page,

00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:19.800
and then next we need to go over to our functions.php,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.944
and because all the functions are going to be in PHP,

00:04:22.944 --> 00:04:25.450
we need to make sure that all the content on

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.870
this page is between the opening and closing PHP tags.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.835
So let's start by creating a PHP function.

00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:34.850
If you've not used PHP before,

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.450
it uses the function keyword.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.355
A function is basically just a chunk of code which we give a name to,

00:04:42.355 --> 00:04:43.910
and we can call it when we need it.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.170
So to set this up,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.420
use function and then the name afterwards, which is tranquilwp_setup,

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.355
and then at the end of the function name we use the curly brackets,

00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:01.060
and then use a set of curly braces,

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.330
and all the information that we put between the curly braces is going to

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.910
be the code which is executed when the theme is set up.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.960
So we'll add more to this later,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.390
but for now we're just going to add some theme support for RSS or automatic filings.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:28.665
So we do that by add_theme_support, and in the quotes,

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:38.445
type in automatic-feed-links, and then a semicolon at the end,

00:05:38.445 --> 00:05:41.220
and make sure that's the feed there.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.545
So make sure the RSS information gets to the head section properly.

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:49.850
We're going to add theme support also for the title tag,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.265
and this enables both themes and plug-ins to access the document title,

00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:57.260
so we can change it dynamically.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:04.710
So add_theme_support, and don't forget the quotes in there.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.410
This one is going to be the title tag.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.215
So title-tag.

00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:14.910
So next we need to tell WordPress to run this function when setting up the theme.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:24.360
So if we go outside the curly braces and then we need to add an action and the bracket,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.880
and then the semicolon at the end.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.895
This is going to take in two parameters.

00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:36.155
So the first one in the quotes is after _setup_theme,

00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:40.615
and then separated by a comma,

00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:42.710
we need to put the function name,

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.665
which is tranquilwp setup.

00:06:45.665 --> 00:06:50.890
So we're going to just copy that and paste that between the quotes.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:56.315
Just one more piece of PHP we need to add into the functions file before we move on,

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:59.610
is if we go up to the very top.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.120
Okay. So we're going to use a PHP if statement.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.120
So if you've not seen one of these before,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.470
it's really nothing to worry about.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:12.895
So I'll just get started by typing out and then we'll talk over exactly what's happening.

00:07:12.895 --> 00:07:16.395
So we're just going to check if a condition is met,

00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:20.285
and if it is, we run the piece of code between these curly braces.

00:07:20.285 --> 00:07:24.550
So the piece of code we want to run is we

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.630
want to add a variable called the content width,

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.910
and this is going to be set to 660 pixels.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.425
This value is going to control the maximum width

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:42.065
of any piece of content which is in the WordPress theme,

00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:46.870
and we use it to make sure that the user can't upload something such as

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:52.145
an image which is far too large for the design and causes layout problems,

00:07:52.145 --> 00:07:55.570
and then we'll put our condition between the brackets at the top.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.600
So I'm going to use the exclamation mark and then

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.815
isset and then between two more curly brackets,

00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:09.880
we're going to put our variable which is the content width.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:20.390
So this if statement would normally check if this variable exists by using isset,

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.425
but because we're using the exclamation mark before it,

00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:24.810
it's checking the opposite.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:29.570
So if the variable content width is not set,

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.440
then use the variable between these curly braces and make sure that

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.555
the content is no bigger than 660 pixels wide.

00:08:37.555 --> 00:08:40.740
Okay. So that's the functions finished for this video.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.750
We'll add more to this as we progress through the course,

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.570
but just one more thing I want to show you before we finish

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.655
this video is now let's turn to our PHP to our website.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:53.825
We need to make sure that debugging is enabled,

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:56.210
and I'll just show you exactly why.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.400
If we go over to Chrome,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.260
and then we go to visit site,

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.030
this is how the site is looking now,

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.250
it doesn't look very pretty, but it is working.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:13.180
So if we go over to our index page and then make a typo mistake,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:20.420
so for example if we go to the PHP at the top of the page, and for example,

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:25.189
if we weren't putting the closing tag after the PHP,

00:09:25.189 --> 00:09:27.605
and then if we refresh the browser,

00:09:27.605 --> 00:09:29.980
you can see that we get a white screen.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.375
So because we've got a white blank screen,

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:34.415
we know that we've made a mistake somewhere,

00:09:34.415 --> 00:09:38.185
but we've got no indication to show us exactly where we've gone wrong.

00:09:38.185 --> 00:09:42.980
So to give us an indication of exactly which line of code we've gone wrong on,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.520
we need to go to our WordPress folder,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.110
which is in the htdocs.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:54.260
So we find MAMP, htdocs,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.305
tranquilwp, and then we need to go back into the config file,

00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:01.680
where we see our database information.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.605
So just double-click to open that up,

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:10.049
and then if you scroll down below all the password and database information,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.980
and then the keys and salts.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.100
Right at the bottom of the page,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.240
if you look for the define WP debug,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.890
by default this is set to false.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.880
So we're going to set this to true, and then save that,

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.780
but don't forget to change it back to false if you're to upload this to a web server.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.620
So save that and then refresh in Chrome,

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.160
and then this will give us an error line,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.660
and it tells us exactly where we've gone wrong.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:46.740
So in our index page on line three. Let's take a look.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.005
So we can see that the issue was on line one,

00:10:50.005 --> 00:10:55.610
but WordPress didn't discover there was an issue until it found some HTML on line three.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.810
So it might not be exactly on the line but it

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.065
gives a good indication exactly where the problem lies.

00:11:02.065 --> 00:11:05.095
So then we can just close off the PHP,

00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:08.035
save and then refresh,

00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:10.130
and everything should be working again.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.630
Okay. So that's the end of this video.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.040
I will see you in the next video.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.390
We will start working on the header and the footer.
