00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.380
This video is all about creating a custom 404 page.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.830
A 404 page is where you go when the page isn't found.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.740
So essentially when you are a little bit lost on the website.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.380
If we go to the URL at the top bar and we type in unrecognized page,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.405
such as a lot of A's,

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:23.105
and then hit "Enter", so this is the page that you're taken to.

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:26.370
We've got the WordPress loop and some of the sidebar information,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.610
which is one of the backup templates.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.530
But we want something a little bit nicer and also

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.115
maybe some options and some links to get the user back on truck.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:38.630
If we go over to the Text Editor and as usual,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:46.470
create a new page and save this page as 404.php,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.520
and copy the page About.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.615
We use this as a base for our 404 page.

00:00:56.615 --> 00:00:59.090
Paste that in and save.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.390
Change the template name at the top.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.825
We're going to call this 404 page. Refresh that.

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:16.415
Now we've got the About Us template being used when we've found the 404 page.

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:19.765
First of all, I'm going to start in the feature text area.

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:22.530
Just add a little bit of text just so the user knows

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.650
that they're lost and they need to get back on track.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.775
Go to the function.php,

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:33.905
and then in the closing curly brace after the title,

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:36.275
we'll add another elseif statement.

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:46.000
But this time it's going to be if the page is 404 and then the braces.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.055
So if the page is the 404 page,

00:01:53.055 --> 00:01:55.350
we're just going to equal out some text.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.440
You can put in whatever text you want but I'm going to put "Whoops, we're a little lost."

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.720
Then see if that's working okay.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.690
We've got a little problem,

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.470
let's check that out and see what it is.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.960
I think it's just missing a semicolon at the end.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.420
Now we've got the text appearing on there.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.790
What I'm going to create is I'm going to delete the sample text,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.385
and then we're going to create four separate divs,

00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:29.790
which you're going to share with some links.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.950
The links are going to be to Archives,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.470
Categories, Recent Posts, all by the tags.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.330
We're going to put these links in with

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.320
the widgets in a similar way to how we used them on the sidebar.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.000
Go over to the 404 template.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.235
Instead of About Us as the level 2 heading,

00:02:50.235 --> 00:02:51.960
we're just going to put some text in to say,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.715
'Let's get back on track'.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:03:01.365
Open up the PHP_echo and close off the PHP.

00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:02.815
The text is going to be,

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:10.815
"Let's get back on track' with a colon at the end.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:13.665
There's a problem there. Let's take a look.

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:16.985
Because we've used a single quotation,

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:21.450
we need to change the surrounding quotations to be double,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.070
and then don't forget the semicolon at the end.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.805
It looks now we've got the,

00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:32.700
Let's get back on track level 2 heading.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.055
We can delete the sample text after the Lorem ipsum.

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:43.720
Delete the first paragraph and also the second paragraph,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.250
but keep the surrounding row we'll reuse up.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.335
We're going to create four separate divs for the widgets.

00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:54.695
So add a div with a class,

00:03:54.695 --> 00:03:57.600
the bootstrap class of col-sm-6.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.345
Then just copy this div and paste three more times.

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:08.860
So we've got four sections.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.360
We touched on widgets earlier on in the course in the sidebar section.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.820
We can also use widgets in various offer parts of the sign. Let's add them in here.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.895
Open up the PHP and then it's pulling the widget.

00:04:25.895 --> 00:04:29.130
We use the_widgets,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.935
and then in brackets we use the name of the widget that we want to pull in.

00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:38.795
First of all, to get the archives,

00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:46.520
we use WP_Widgets_Archives,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.795
and then a semicolon at the end of there.

00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:54.995
The categories is exactly the same.

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:58.650
But instead of archives it's categories,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.930
and then we'll provide a link for recent posts.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.720
So paste that in. But this time in brackets,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:16.380
it's WP_Widgets, then Recent Posts or Recent_Posts.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.585
Then to get a list of the available tags,

00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:24.000
instead of archives, it's Tag_Cloud.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.690
So Tag_Cloud and save that,

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.130
then refresh the browser.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.970
It looks as though there's a problem with the recent posts.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.645
That needs to be recent,

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:49.650
so remove the s at the end there. There we go.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.655
Now the user can now get back to a working page by selecting some of the links below.

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:59.945
By the way, if you want to use any different widgets or different links,

00:05:59.945 --> 00:06:03.405
you can find these in the codecs under the widget section.

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:06.640
You don't need to use the four that I've shown there.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.975
Now that's all working, I just want to add a little bit of styling,

00:06:09.975 --> 00:06:12.510
just to make it fit in with the rest of the website.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.450
We're going to put the same one pixel border

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.374
with the rounded corners around each of the four sections.

00:06:20.374 --> 00:06:26.475
Go to the style.css and it will create a 404 section.

00:06:26.475 --> 00:06:29.850
Copy any of the comments,

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.770
then head right down to the bottom.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.645
I'm going to make the comments be the 404 page.

00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:43.660
So the widgets, you got a class of widgets.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.300
To keep the styling consistent,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.199
we're going to use the same styles as we used for the sidebar or the sidebar modules.

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.415
If you go up to the sidebar section,

00:06:57.415 --> 00:06:59.845
look for the sidebar modules class,

00:06:59.845 --> 00:07:02.360
and then copy all these.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:10.095
Then paste these back into the widget section.

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:14.025
Save that, then take a look.

00:07:14.025 --> 00:07:16.975
So we needed that now, that looks a lot better,

00:07:16.975 --> 00:07:21.505
and it just looks a little bit old with the boxes being on even heights.

00:07:21.505 --> 00:07:23.440
So just to make that look a little bit better,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:31.125
I'm going to add a minimum height of 300 pixels and then refresh that.

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:36.495
Now make sure that the sections with not much content take up a little bit more height.

00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:40.980
Thanks for watching, and that's the end of our 404 page.
