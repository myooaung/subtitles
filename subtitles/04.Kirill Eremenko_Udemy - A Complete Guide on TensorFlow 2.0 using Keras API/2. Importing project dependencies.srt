Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:11,470
In the previous video we created our project structure and we created a few images for pipeline testing.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,240
So from this video we are starting with our code for the flask API project.

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:23,350
The first step of the project and the goal of this video is to import all product dependencies.

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,720
Let's start with the first one called Ice.

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:34,840
Ice is a native python library used to work with parts and files from locating them to removing them.

7
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,080
The next one is a request.

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,700
This library is used to create a post or get the request to our server.

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,980
Now we have our non-paying library as always.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,300
It is used for mathematical operations and Working with matrices then we have tens of flow the Library

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,160
of choice for neural net for building as we did in the previous video.

12
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,220
We need to import a few functions from the side by library specifically to read and save images from

13
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,730
the local disk.

14
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:15,370
And lastly let's import the project dependencies from flask import flask which is used to create flask

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,350
application itself.

16
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:23,800
Then we need to import request and this one is used to send the request to a specific path from our

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:33,420
flask and backend finally Jason ify Jason ify is used to return data in the Jason format when you're

18
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,920
building an API.

19
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,350
The Jason is the most common way of returning data to a user.

20
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,480
That's why we need to use Jason ify for this project to complete this tutorial.

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,510
Select all of your libraries and press control plus enter to import them.

22
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,750
Now all of these libraries are at your disposal and ready to be used from the next tutorial.

23
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,770
For now if you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments section otherwise I'll

24
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,950
see you in the next tutorial.
