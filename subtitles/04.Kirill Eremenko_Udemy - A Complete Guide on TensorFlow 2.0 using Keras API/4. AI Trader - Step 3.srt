Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in the previous video.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,350
We started with our model architecture.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,570
And now in this video we will complete it at this point.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,430
We have free hidden layers in our neural network.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,320
And there are only two parts missing from the model.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:26,400
Our output layer and to complete the model compile it and that is our goal of this video to add both

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,980
things to add the output layer to our model.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,850
Let us copy and paste the last layer and modify it because this is our output layer.

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:43,640
The number of units or neurons should be the same as number of classes or in this case actions.

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,370
And for the activation change rally to linear because we are going to use a means squared error for

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,650
our loss.

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,840
You will see why in a few windows.

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,990
But basically we will modify our actions with our rewards which is a continuous number and not a class

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,410
now that we are done.

15
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:10,790
We the model structure it's time to compile it write model dot compile and here as always we have to

16
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:18,040
provide a few arguments because these what we perform here is not classification but regression task.

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:26,320
We can't use the accuracy as our metric instead in this case we will leave it and empty okay for loss

18
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:35,200
provide MSE shorter for means squared error and for the optimizer specify optimizer is equal to DB DOT

19
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,740
cameras dot optimizer.

20
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:45,550
And here we will select Adam optimizer in the Adam provide L are shorter for learning rate and set it

21
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:54,430
to be equal to zero point zero zero one and return the model and now our model builder function is done

22
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:03,040
but for now the model function is not called and our model is not defined so let's do that in the in

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,800
its function at the end of it.

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,580
Right.

25
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,770
Self-taught model is equal to model builder.

26
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,310
This function will create a network initialize it and store it in this cell.

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,280
That model argument for us and that's it for this area.

28
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,760
If you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments section.

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,590
Otherwise I've seen the next tutorial.
