Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:12.770
In the previous video we finally allowed our API for image classification and in this video we can create

3
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.700
the first adjacent object that we are going to send to the model and receive some predictions back.

4
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.020
So the first thing that we have to do is to randomly select an image from our test set to send it to

5
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:40.270
a API pride random image is equal to MP dot random dot brand I and D to get a random integer.

6
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.360
And if you haven't worked with this function before it takes lo number and high number and in January

7
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.360
to number between those two.

8
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:57.250
So for us set low to zero and high set it to land on X test because we want an image from the test set

9
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.120
and let's write random image below to print it out.

10
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.550
Now did we have an index for a random image.

11
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.080
We can easily use it to create our Jason object if you don't know what the Jason object is.

12
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.810
It is a glorified python dictionary that is sent over the Internet with it.

13
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.530
We can send any information to a server and receive any information from it let's start with this data

14
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.350
is equal to Jason dumps.

15
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.100
This function takes a Python dictionary it creates a Jason object from it so let's provide byte condition

16
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.510
there is to it.

17
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.630
The first key of our python dictionary is signature name.

18
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.460
This is just a tag for tens of flow serving the value for this key is also string serving default.

19
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.660
This key value pair is something that we have to provide is a default configuration for our tensor flow

20
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.450
serving library.

21
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.950
The next thing that we have to provide is an image itself for the key set a string instances.

22
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.110
And for the value of this key we need to provide list of images that we are going to send to a server

23
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.190
inside brackets right.

24
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.040
X test.

25
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:22.590
And for index use a random image index and complete this statement by using do list function on it.

26
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.090
This is done because of the way that data is sent over the Internet.

27
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.070
We cannot send no objects or arrays over the Internet only native title lists.

28
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.900
Let us print out to see what we have there.

29
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.380
As you can see we have the first default pair for our denser flow serving and then we have our image

30
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.200
as a value for instance is key in the next video we are going to send the first post request to the

31
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.110
model for now.

32
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.760
If you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments section otherwise I'll see in

33
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.600
the next tutorial.
