00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.110
Hello and welcome back to the course on deep learning in the period sartorial we found out what can

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.270
volitional neural networks are all about.

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.020
And today we're going to dive into step one convolution.

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:18.010
So this is the kind of evolution of function that we try to stay away from mathematics and keep things

5
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.460
intuitive.

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.030
But I couldn't help but share this formula for you because it is so simple a convolution is basically

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.190
a combined integration of two functions.

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.310
And it shows you how one function modifies the other or modifies the shape of the other and if you've

9
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.800
done any signal processing or electrical engineering or a profession where signal processing is required

10
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.360
you would have inevitably come across a coalition function.

11
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.630
It is quite popular.

12
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.420
Now once again we're going to keep the mathematics light or keep them separate.

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.140
And if you'd like to get into the math behind the conventional Neural Networks a great additional read

14
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:04.960
is introduction to convolution all neural networks by Janson Wu who is a professor at the Nanjing University

15
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.770
in China.

16
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.730
This paper was published literally days ago like five or six days ago and it is oriented specifically

17
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.350
at people who are starting out at beginners who are getting to know conventional neural networks.

18
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.360
So the mathematics there should be accessible actually emailed.

19
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:31.450
Professor Francine Wu and yeah he said his whole goal is to make break complex things down so that people

20
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.310
who are new to this field can understand.

21
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.510
And also he mentioned that he's got some materials available on his home page so if you in your URL

22
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.140
if you just remove the last two parts and you just go to like Slash WJ X to that part that's his home

23
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.330
page and you'll be able to find more additional tutorials and materials which haven't been published

24
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.160
as papers.

25
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.530
But he uses them in his tutorial so you might find those useful so browse around there if you'd like

26
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.700
to get an introduction into the mathematics behind conditional neural networks and kind of build a solid

27
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.020
base around that area.

28
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.470
But we're going to move on and we're going to talk about the convolution.

29
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.090
So what is the conclusion in intuitive terms here on the left.

30
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.640
We've got an input image as we discussed that's how we're going to look at images just ones as areas

31
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.860
to simplify things and you can see the smiley face there.

32
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.560
There we've got a feature detector so feature detectors a three by three matrix.

33
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.070
Does it have to be three by three.

34
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.750
No it doesn't.

35
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.600
Alex Nat I think uses 7 by 7.

36
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.560
Now then some other one of those other famous ones uses like five by five feature detectors.

37
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.190
They can be different but usually you'll see that there are three by three and there are no reasons

38
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.330
to make them three by three.

39
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.590
So we're going to stick to the conventional way having a three by three feature detector.

40
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.660
Also the feature detector is called these are important terms because you might come across them.

41
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.710
There are many different terms for the feature detector.

42
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.540
But the most common ones are feature detector or you might hear it being called Colonel or you might

43
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.490
hear it being called filter.

44
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.710
So in this course we're gonna be using either filter or a feature detector interchangeably but just

45
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:23.830
bear in mind that it has those names and a conclusion operation is signified by an X in a circle just

46
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.610
as you saw in the formulas before.

47
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.130
And here what happens is on an intuitive level or just to think of it in terms of what is actually happening

48
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.850
in the background rather than the mathematics.

49
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.600
Well you take this feature detector or filter and you put it on your image like you see on the left.

50
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.040
So you cover the for instance in this case the top left corner the nine pixels in the top left corner

51
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.940
and you basically multiply each value by each value so respective value.

52
00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.350
So the top 0 by the top left grow value by the top left value then basically it's position number one

53
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.610
one by a position number one one position by number or 0 1 0 1 0 2 by 0 2 and so on.

54
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.590
So just its element Y is the multiplication of these matrices and then you add up the results so in

55
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.910
this case nothing matches up so Oh it's always either a 0 by 0 0 by 1.

56
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.510
So the result is zero.

57
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.560
Here you can see that one of them matched up the one on the left matched up.

58
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.820
And therefore we've got a one here and nothing matched up nothing matched up nothing matched up.

59
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.960
Then we move on to the next throw or so and the step at which we're moving this whole filter is called

60
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.530
the stride.

61
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.480
So here we have a stride of one pixel.

62
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.220
So here you can see again something matched up the bottom right corner matched up again stride.

63
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.290
What a bottom one in the middle of matched up here top right on match up then nothing measure the straight

64
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:58.810
is one you can change the stride you can make it 1 2 you can get 3 whatever you like.

65
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.750
The eventually the one that works well is usually at two.

66
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.360
So that's what people stick to and we'll we'll talk about what the stride is towards the end of this

67
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.500
material.

68
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.990
So here we've got.

69
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.540
We're matching up so we just keep our eye here you can see we've got a two because two of them matched

70
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.730
up and so on and so on so on.

71
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.780
There we go there's another one that matched up there we go and they were done.

72
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.150
So what's what have we created right.

73
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.800
A couple of important things here.

74
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.630
The image on the right is called a feature map also has several terms.

75
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.420
It also can be called sometimes it can bold feature.

76
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.230
So when you apply convolution operation operator to something it doesn't become convoluted it becomes

77
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.920
involved.

78
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:54.170
And it has a sometimes I like I think to myself in the wrong way but it's the correct term is involved.

79
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.690
It's a kind of old feature or it can also be called the activation map.

80
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.330
But we're going to be calling it a feature map in this course.

81
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.480
So it can be called any one of those things.

82
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.240
And what have we done here.

83
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.840
Well as you can see we've reduced the size of the image.

84
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.420
That's number one and that's the important thing I wanted to mention about your input image and the

85
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.220
feature detect and the stride right.

86
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.950
If you have a stride of one you can see the image reduced a bit.

87
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.130
But if you have a strategy to the image is going to reduce more.

88
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.560
So the feature feature up is going to be even smaller.

89
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:33.870
And that's an very important function of the feature detector of this whole convolution step is to make

90
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:42.030
the image smaller because that'll be it'll be easier probably to process it and it'll be just faster.

91
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.880
It will.

92
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:51.810
And you'll be just faster because imagine like here we've got a what a seven by seven image.

93
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.500
But imagine if you have a proper photo right.

94
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.250
Or you have like a 256 by 256 pixel image.

95
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.810
That's that's a huge number of pics they turn a 56 squared nor likely.

96
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.900
Let's say you have a 300 by 300 pixels.

97
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.130
So.

98
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:13.800
So we don't get confused with the RG B 256 let's just say we have a 300 by 300 image in terms of size

99
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.660
in pixels.

100
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:20.700
Then you have three hundred squared number of pixels that's a huge number and therefore a feature detectors

101
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.660
will originally reduce the size of the image and therefore straight off to is actually beneficial.

102
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.920
But then the question is do we lose information.

103
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.470
Are we losing information when we're applying the feature detector.

104
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.620
Well some information we are losing of course because we have less values and of resulting matrix.

105
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.900
But at the same time the purpose of the feature detector is to detect certain features certain parts

106
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.480
of the image that are integral.

107
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.100
And so for instance if you think about it this way like the feature detector has a certain pattern on

108
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:59.190
it the highest number in your feature map is when that pattern matches up in fact the highest number

109
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:05.820
you can get is in an now simplified example is when the feature is that a match is exactly and you can

110
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.470
see if that number four we have in our feature map that's exactly.

111
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:16.950
So if you look over here that's exactly where this feature detector because there's only four ones in

112
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:21.390
it matched perfectly so you can see this this part over here.

113
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:29.700
So the feature was detected here and as we discussed at the very start of this section that it features

114
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.040
is how we see things is how we recognize things.

115
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:40.350
We don't look at every single pixel so to speak in what we see on an image or in real life.

116
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.690
We don't look at every single pick we look at features.

117
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:51.480
We look at the the nose the hat the the feather the the eyes under or the little black marks under the

118
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:57.380
cheetah's eyes to distinguish should be between a cheetah and a leopard or the shape of the train.

119
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.580
We want to distinguish between a bullet train and normal train and so on so we don't look at everything

120
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:08.130
we look at features and that's what we are preserving and that's what the feature map helps us preserve.

121
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:15.210
Actually that's what it allows us to bring forward and and get rid of all of the unnecessary things

122
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:22.710
that even as humans we don't processes so much information going into your eyes at any given time like

123
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.080
gigabytes of information.

124
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:31.290
If you look at every single dot if not terabytes of information going into eyes per second and still

125
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.450
we're able to process that because we get rid of what what is unnecessary we only focus on the important

126
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.520
features features that are important to us.

127
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.910
And that is exactly what the feature map does.

128
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:49.430
So now moving on this is our input image and you we create a feature map.

129
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.350
So the front one let's say the front one is the one we just created.

130
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.150
But then how come there's many of them.

131
00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.240
But we create multiple feature maps because we use different filters.

132
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.540
Right.

133
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.800
And that's another way that we preserve lots of information.

134
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:10.530
So we don't just have one feature map we look for certain features and then or basically the network

135
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.580
decides through its training and this is something we'll discuss towards the end of the section through

136
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:21.870
its training it decides which features are important for certain types or certain categories and it

137
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.250
looks for them and therefore we'll have different filters and we'll talk about filters just now but

138
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:32.460
basically it'll apply these filters so to get this feature map it applied a filter like the one we saw

139
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.210
but then to get this feature map but apply a different filter to get this feature remember apply a different

140
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:45.270
filter and so on and so basically it just creates these feature maps and actually that's why personally

141
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:53.150
I think the term feature detector is better than filters so remember over here we have this filter which

142
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.040
we also can call a feature detector.

143
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.390
Well actually the word feature detector I think is better suited.

144
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.120
And the reason for that is that's what the purposes.

145
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.330
Right.

146
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.450
We don't want to just we don't want just filter out our image.

147
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.520
But even though that's the whole that's the same.

148
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.170
Same just a question of terminology.

149
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:15.720
But basically we want to detect features all right in this and this layer we're going to our in this

150
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.320
feature map.

151
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.140
We've detected where certain features are in the image in this feature map.

152
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:27.150
We've detected where certain other features are where a certain specific feature is look at this feature

153
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.270
map of take it where a certain other feature is located on the image.

154
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.350
So that's that's what we are doing.

155
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.550
And let's have a look at a couple of examples.

156
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:40.540
So here we're using and this is from gimp dot org.

157
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:48.630
Their documentation for it's a free like kind of tool like paint and you can use it to adjust your images

158
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:54.210
or work with your images but basically they have some valuable examples in their documentation and here

159
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.850
they have a picture of the Taj Mahal and you can choose which filter you want to apply.

160
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:06.090
So if you download this program and you upload a photo into it and then you can actually start a convolution

161
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:12.540
matrix and apply a filter then you will see that these things these English matrices actually applied

162
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.180
in image processing and design and so on.

163
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.740
So let's have a look at what we get what we get.

164
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.080
So.

165
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:22.140
So if we apply this filter five in the middle minus one minus one minus one minus one you can see that

166
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.960
it sharpens that image and.

167
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:25.620
Yeah.

168
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.920
So this is it's quite intuitive if you think of it.

169
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:36.240
So five is the pixel the main pixel like in the middle of the of the filter or the feature detector

170
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:41.910
and then minus one minus one minus one just so you're kind of like reduces the pixels around it the

171
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:46.980
inner in an intuitive sense then blur.

172
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:53.970
So basically takes C equal significant gives equal significance to all of the pixels around the one

173
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:58.980
in the center and therefore it combines them together and you get a blur edge enhance.

174
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:06.450
So here you can see that's minus one and one and then you get zeros right so you did delete to remove

175
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:12.090
the pixels around the main one in the middle and you only keep this one at a minus one.

176
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:12.810
And it gives you an edge.

177
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.060
Now this was a bit harder to understand how it works.

178
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.470
Like probably harder just to think of it intuitively.

179
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.640
Edge detect.

180
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.800
Right so this one probably makes more sense right you take the middle one.

181
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:34.380
You reduce the middle one the probably like the strength of the middle pixel and then you look for the

182
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:41.870
ones you look for these ones you see increase the strength of the ones around them.

183
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.040
So you have the ones there.

184
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.790
Yeah.

185
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:50.650
So that's that gives you like an edge Dex and you can see which you get there and boss another one.

186
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:58.080
So the key here is that it's as symmetrical and you can see that image becomes asymmetrical as well

187
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.720
so you get like that kind of feeling that it's standing out towards you.

188
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.140
And that's what you get when you have like minuses here and plus here.

189
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.300
Again this is very this is getting a bit technical now but at least we can get some kind of intuitive

190
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.090
understand lizards go quickly through them again.

191
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:21.420
So there is sharpen there's blur there is edge enhance there's edge detect there's embossed as low as

192
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:28.080
you can see these are great examples of the same image but we're getting feature maps so we use different

193
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.870
feature detectors to get different feature maps of the same image and therefore now we have lots of

194
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:42.810
the lots of versions of this image where in each one we've tried to detect certain things in these terms

195
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.270
they're not applicable to us they're being said like embossed is probably not applicable to us in terms

196
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:53.490
of convolution or neural networks but edge detect that's important we want to detect the edges edge

197
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:59.490
enhance probably not blur sharpened so certain things like edge it takes probably the most important

198
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:06.470
one for our type of work and in terms of understanding computers they will decide for themselves are

199
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:12.160
neural network will decide for itself what's important what's not and it probably won't be even recognizable

200
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.710
to the human eye you won't be able to understand what those features mean but the computer will decide

201
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:24.030
and that's the beauty that of neural networks that they can process so many different things and understand

202
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:30.660
without even having that intuition without having that explanation why they will understand which features

203
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:37.350
are important to them whether we have a name for them or not that that's a whole that's an irrelevant

204
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:44.850
question for their artificial neural network and my first one here's a image of Geoffrey Hinton Geoffrey

205
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:52.980
Hinton passed through one of these filters alright right so that brings us to the end of the day tutorial

206
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:59.040
I hope you enjoyed learning about convolution the key takeaway is that evolution the matter the primary

207
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:05.070
purpose and we can evolution is to find features in your image using the feature detector put them into

208
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:12.510
a feature map and by having them in a future map it still preserves the spatial relationships between

209
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:18.060
pixels which is very important for us to know because if they're completely jumbled up then we've we've

210
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:24.090
lost the pattern and at the same time it is important to understand that most of the time the features

211
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:31.650
a neural network will detect and use to recognize certain images and classes will mean nothing to humans

212
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.010
but nevertheless they work and that's what convolution is and I look forward to seeing you next eternal

213
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.920
until then enjoy deep learning.
