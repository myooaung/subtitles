Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in the previous video we talked about the base model

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,290
loaded in memory.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,980
And now we have everything at our disposal.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:21,160
Now it's time to freeze the base model which is also the goal of this video when you try to train your

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:28,300
model for a specific task and you don't freeze the base network it is going to change its initial weight

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,380
as well.

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,440
And that is not what we want.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:37,510
We want to take those learned features on the image net for example and apply them on a custom task

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:44,540
and only train custom layers that we are going to add on top of these bays network to achieve this.

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:50,270
We are going to freeze all layers in our base network and only train a few layers that we are going

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,990
to add.

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:01:00,420
You can freeze the network in a single line of code and it's very easy to do just right base model that

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:08,370
we defined before dot and choose trainable said that to be equal to False and that's it.

14
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:14,070
That's all what we have to do is to freeze all layers in our base network to prevent them from changing

15
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,450
their initial weight if you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments section.

16
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,280
Otherwise I've seen the next tutorial.
