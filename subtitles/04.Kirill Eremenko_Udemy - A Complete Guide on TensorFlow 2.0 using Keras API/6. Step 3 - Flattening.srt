Hello and welcome back to the course on deep learning.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,170
I hope you're tracking along with these intuition tutorials just fine and that you had a chance to play

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,000
around with everything we've learned so far.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,720
And today we're talking about flattening and the good news is that this is a very simple step.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,830
And this material is going to be very quick and then we'll be able to move on to the next interesting

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,880
things.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,140
All right.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,860
So so far we've got the pooled their pulled feature map and that is after we apply the convolution operation

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,060
to our image and then we apply pooling to the result of the coalition which they can involved image.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,540
And so what are we going to do if this pool feature map.

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,080
Well we're going to take it and we're going to flatten it into a column.

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,210
So basically just take the number as row by row and put them into this one long column.

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:53,620
And the reason for that is because we want to later input this into an artificial neural network for

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,220
further processing.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,590
So this is what it looks like when you have many pooling layers or you have the pooling layer layers

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:07,810
with many pooled feature maps and then you flatten them so you put them into this one long column sequentially

17
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:15,370
one after the other and you get one huge vector of inputs for an artificial neural network.

18
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,330
And so to sum all of this up we've got an input image.

19
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:27,000
We apply a convolution layer and let's not forget the relook or rectified rectified linear units.

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,010
Functional we apply after the convolution there as well.

21
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:39,280
And then we apply pooling and then we flatten everything into a long vector which will be our input

22
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,610
layer for an artificial neural network.

23
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,160
And exactly how that works we'll find out in the next tutorial.

24
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,950
Hope you enjoyed today's session and I looked forward to you next time.

25
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,640
Until then enjoy deep learning.
