00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.795
We've added our list of pages to the navigation.

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:06.615
But if you click on them, nothing seems to happen.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:09.000
Is it because we've only added them as

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.215
a list rather than telling the browser that they should link to other pages?

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:17.580
We do this by adding a A element which stands for anchor.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.740
This can be added in between the LI tags, just like this.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.905
I'm going to first cut the home text and then add the A tags.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:35.415
This has a opening and a closing tag and then we can paste the text back inside.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:38.445
I'm going to do the same for the about me.

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:47.835
I'm going to cut the text out and add the A element and paste this back inside and then

00:00:47.835 --> 00:00:57.540
the same for the blog and give that a save.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.130
Then we can add a element to the A tag called the HREF.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.765
HREF simply allows us to add a location to link to.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.970
We'll be linking to other pages,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.065
so we're going to add the names of our pages here.

00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:16.420
Add the HREF attribute inside of the opening tag.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.165
The index.html will link back to the homepage,

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:24.690
so this is going to be index.html.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.490
This is a relative file path.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.100
I'm going leave the about me page empty for now

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.745
as this will be a challenge for you later on in the course.

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:38.765
We've not created the blog page yet, but we'll add this soon.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:43.010
To prepare for this, I'm also going to add the HREF

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.615
inside here and this is going to link to the blog.html page.

00:01:49.615 --> 00:01:54.030
Give that a save and then if we go over to the browser and hit refresh,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.750
we can now see that the home and the blog is now turned into a link.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.775
We can see the underline and also the

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:05.935
cursor changes to a hand symbol to show that this is a link.

00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:08.970
Let's click on the "Blog" and you can see the page isn't

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.975
found because we haven't created the blog page yet.

00:02:11.975 --> 00:02:16.795
Let's go back and the Home link should keep us on the same page.

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:18.885
With these links now working,

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:23.120
I want to take a quick look at nesting and indentation.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.260
Already we've used both of these inside of our text editor.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.780
We've already talked about how we can nest elements inside of a list,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.310
just like nesting the NAV within the header section.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.790
With the NAV links we've just added,

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.270
this is also really important too.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.360
If we take a closer look at this list item,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.890
we see we have the home text in the middle.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.995
Then working outwards, we see the A tags on each side of this text.

00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:57.680
In third row, we have the surrounding LI tags on the outside.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.080
These are then surrounded by the UL tags and so on.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.440
Not nesting properly is a common beginner mistake and one

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.220
which often causes your website to not display as intended.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.295
This is something to watch out for and something which can avoid any problems.

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:21.565
Indentation is how many times or spaces each line is set in from the left.

00:03:21.565 --> 00:03:25.040
Your text editor may do this automatically for you,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.765
like you can see mine has.

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:29.885
You will often see indentation the equivalent of

00:03:29.885 --> 00:03:33.050
two or four spaces depending on your preference.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.765
For example, we can see both the body tags

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:39.520
indented at the same level with this line here.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.680
Then inside, we see the next ones which you come across,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.020
which is the two header tags,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.670
and they're both in line too.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.710
This then continue depending on how many elements are nested inside of a list.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.375
There's no standard which we must follow when indenting.

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:58.245
A law is just down to personal preference.

00:03:58.245 --> 00:04:02.450
However, using them correctly and consistently makes your code more

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.160
readable and we can also see more clearly what content is nested inside.
