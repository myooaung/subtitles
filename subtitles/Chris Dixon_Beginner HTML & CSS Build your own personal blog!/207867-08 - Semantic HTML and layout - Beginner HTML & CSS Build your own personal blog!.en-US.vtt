00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
I want to take a quick step back from adding to this website,

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.265
and take a moment to look at what we call semantic elements.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:13.245
Semantic elements are simply elements which clearly describe their contents,

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:17.895
not only to the browser but to other developers too, looking at your code.

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:20.040
Already in our index page,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.320
we have used some semantic tanks,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.995
both the header and nav are classed as semantic,

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.770
as I tell the browser that the content between them,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.770
zebra header or a navigation section.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.010
This is a diagram of a typical website.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.485
The body contains all the content we see on the screen, as we already know.

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:44.285
Here we see some typical sections of a website.

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:47.075
Each section has a div elements.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:51.895
A div is a section or a division used to group content together.

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:55.865
As you can see here, we use one for each part of the website,

00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:58.265
each having a id attribute,

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:01.075
so we can add a styling using CSS.

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:05.660
This is how things have been done for a long time and still are.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.270
Div elements are perfectly fine to use.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.350
In fact, we'll use them during this project too.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.225
Here we add some more div elements,

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:17.720
this time nested inside of the existing ones.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.175
Again, this is fine and also very common.

00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:23.545
However, since HTML five,

00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:26.510
we now have some alternative elements to use,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.355
just like you can see here.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.190
Rather than using a generic div tag,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.140
we can now use these semantic or descriptive elements.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.740
Both the div and also all the new elements which you see here,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.180
still have an opening,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.270
and also a closing tag to surround the content,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.205
just like the header and the nav which we previously looked at.

00:01:48.205 --> 00:01:52.430
There's also main, which contains the main content of the website.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.370
This is not to be used for any content which is repeated in other pages such as sidebars.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.470
For example, the aside element we see on the right is often used for sidebars,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.990
and is usually repeated across the website,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.160
therefore it's best to be kept separate from the main content.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.980
As you can see, there is also a elements for the footer now too.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.755
So this is the example we've seen earlier,

00:02:17.755 --> 00:02:20.825
but this time with the newer semantic elements.

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:23.780
Here you can see an article element which is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.335
ideal for uses such as a blog post or a widget,

00:02:27.335 --> 00:02:30.055
which has self-contained content.

00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:33.170
There is also a section element below too.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.055
This, as it sounds, defines the section of our web document.

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:40.190
This is to group related content together.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.545
We also now have the nav element,

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:43.970
which we've already seen.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.580
This is for navigation sections.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.435
Note that we have placed this inside of the header for this example.

00:02:50.435 --> 00:02:52.460
However, this is not required.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.680
I can be placed outside of the header or even nested inside of of areas too.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.150
We can also take things even further by reusing elements,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.200
such as the header or the footer to define the header and footer sections of an article,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.840
or even play sections inside of other elements,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.910
such as the sidebar.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.225
Remember though, this is just one common way to use these.

00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:20.485
They are not forced upon us in any particular way,

00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:22.760
and the use case will also differ

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.310
depending on the style of website in which you are building.
