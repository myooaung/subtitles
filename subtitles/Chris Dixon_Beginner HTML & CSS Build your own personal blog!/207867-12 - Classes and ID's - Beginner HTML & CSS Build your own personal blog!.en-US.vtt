00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.060
We've looked at selecting elements by their tag name,

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.685
such as HTML, header or url.

00:00:07.685 --> 00:00:11.950
There are also other ways to do this by using classes and IDs.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.185
Classes and IDs are attributes,

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:16.115
which we can add to elements.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:19.840
Let's start by looking at how we can use an ID.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.260
If we go down to the opening tag for the header,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.830
we can add an ID attribute and give this a name of our choice.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.380
I'm going to call this the backgrounds and save.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.145
We can now use this name of background with the hash prefix.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.335
Just below the HTML calibrators.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:50.330
Because it's an ID, we can use the harsh and then select it with the name of backgrounds.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.835
One of the reasons why we would do this is because if we take the header as a selector,

00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:04.020
then the styles would apply to all the headers on the page and domain awareness.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.420
If we go over to the finished site,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.570
I want this background to add the gray background color, which you can see here.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.560
We're provided with a background property to do this.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.330
Back over in the CSS,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.890
we can add the background.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.340
I'm going to give my knee hex color of d8.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.000
We also have access to the same range of colors as we did earlier with text.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.165
Save that, then go over to the browser and refresh the project.

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:44.855
Now we can see the gray background has appeared behind the whole header.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:46.895
If you look at the finished sites,

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:51.755
we can also see that the same gray background is also behind the text.

00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:55.730
However, this will not be a good use case for an ID.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.785
An ID is supposed to be only used once for one unique section.

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:04.220
If we wanted to use the same styles more than once,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.760
we could change this ID to be a class.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.610
Down in the header we can change ID to be equal to class.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.440
Then we can add the same class to the p text to other backgrounds to these two.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.220
So p-class is also equal to background.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.210
Then when it's change the CSS selector from a harsh to be a dot.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.620
This is how we select classes.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.450
Now if we save that and go back over to the browser, hit refresh.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.495
Now we've got the gray backgrounds in the header and also the text.

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:50.990
So this is the difference between using classes and IDs with CSS.
