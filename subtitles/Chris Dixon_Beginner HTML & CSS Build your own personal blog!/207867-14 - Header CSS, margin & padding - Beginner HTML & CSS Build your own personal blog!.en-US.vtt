00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.775
We now have a better idea of how we'll use the flexbox to layout our website.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:08.760
Let's now get to work on the header section.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.860
So let's open up the text editor.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.745
So we're going to be designing the site with a mobile first approach.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:22.115
This means, we'll start to layout the sites for a mobile device first,

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:26.475
then build on this for larger devices as more space becomes available.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:31.780
To do this, I'm going to shrink the browser to simulate a smaller device.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.350
So that looks about right.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.264
I'm going close this sidebar,

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:41.080
just to give us a little bit more space.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.600
So within the style section.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.555
Let's begin by adding the header selector, to the CSS.

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:52.080
So just below the backgrounds,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.520
going to add the header inside here, with the curly braces.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.080
So with smaller devices I want to align all the text into the center.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.870
We can do this by adding a text-align property.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.490
I'm going to set this to center.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.770
So save that and refresh.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.305
We can now see the text is within the center of the header.

00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:21.275
We also have the option of left and right too.

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:24.725
Next, like we've seen in the flexbox slides,

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:27.980
we want set header to be a flex container.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.355
We can do this by setting the display type,

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:34.440
to be equal to a flex.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.190
Sludge refresh the browser.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.425
You'll see the content is now displayed next, whichever.

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:46.955
This is, because by default the flex direction is set to row.

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:50.240
This is how we wanted to look for large devices.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.890
But with smaller devices,

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.445
we can set this flex direction back to column.

00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:57.410
So within the header section,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.730
let's add the flex direction property.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.270
Then change this back to column.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.225
Give that a save. Let's see how this is looking.

00:02:09.225 --> 00:02:13.175
Great. So can now see the content is stacked on top of each other.

00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:15.965
So do bear in mind as you go through the sites.

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:17.570
These are the CSS properties,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.460
which I'm adding for my blog.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.995
Do feel free to make any changes you want to best suit your website.

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:28.545
So next up I'm going to add some CSS to this h1 header title,

00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:30.505
contained within the header.

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:37.025
So we've already looked at how we can style this by adding a class or an id, to this h1.

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:41.105
Or [inaudible] h1 is like this.

00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:48.260
So let's add the header h1.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.270
This makes sure we are specific and only target the h1 within the header.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.410
This also works for over elements too.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.790
I'm going to add some margin and padding to this for spacing.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.760
Before we do this, let's take a quick look at what margin and padding is?

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.760
Let's say we are placing in a article element into our site.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.330
I would want it to nice equals space around, like we see here.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.754
If we just add in this article,

00:03:18.754 --> 00:03:21.800
by default, it may look more like this.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.200
Bunched up against the outer container.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.780
To keep some space on the outside of the element.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.335
We can add some margin,

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.435
just like you can see here.

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:36.500
Also, we can add space to inside the elements.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.860
This is called padding. For example,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.020
if we added a image inside here,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.660
padding would apply inside of the article,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.340
creating space around the image like we can see here.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.120
So basically, the margin is outside the elements and padding is inside.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.805
So now we know the difference between margin and padding.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.195
We can see this in action with the header h1.

00:04:02.195 --> 00:04:05.435
If we look at the header inside the browser,

00:04:05.435 --> 00:04:10.420
we can see there is some space already above this h1 elements.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.255
This is being applied by the browser as a default.

00:04:14.255 --> 00:04:18.870
We can remove this by suddenly margin back to zero.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.230
So add this inside the header h1,

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.040
give that a save and then refresh.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.980
Now you can see it's moved up,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.950
so the default margin has been removed.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.965
So this removes the default space above,

00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:36.250
but leaves everything tied together.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.050
We can add some extra space inside here,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.180
by adding a padding volume.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.415
So just below the margin,

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:44.990
I'm going to add some padding.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.030
[inaudible] mine to 15 pixels.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.035
But of course, do whatever suits your blog.

00:04:52.035 --> 00:04:58.205
Then refresh. Now you can see we've got some nice padded space in-between the elements.

00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:02.950
The last thing I want to do in this video is to remove the default bullets,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.925
to the left of the list items and also center the text.

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:13.750
We can now target the list items by using the LI selector.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.530
To remove these bullets, all we need to do,

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.410
is set the list-style property to be none.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.830
There are also options to changes to other styles too.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.485
Such as a square or even an image.

00:05:31.485 --> 00:05:33.840
So give that a save and then refresh.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.990
Now we can see that the bullets have been removed.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.790
Let's now space this out.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.485
I'm going to apply some padding.

00:05:40.485 --> 00:05:43.120
Just below the list-style.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.205
I'm going to set this to be a value of 10 pixels.

00:05:48.205 --> 00:05:52.930
So now we'll have some nice spacing around each one of the links.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.125
So things are starting to look a little bit better now.

00:05:56.125 --> 00:06:02.595
But we can see that the nerve items still not in the center. So why is up?

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:07.640
To better understand, we need to go over to the browser developer tools.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.315
So I'm just going to expand the browser a little bit bigger.

00:06:11.315 --> 00:06:16.890
Then I'm going to control or right-click and then go down to inspect.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.870
Then if we click on this little arrow in the corner.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.010
Then hover over until we see the UL up here.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.265
We can see we have this green section on the left-hand side,

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:35.460
which seems to be pushing everything over, this green section.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.265
If we scroll down to the bottom,

00:06:37.265 --> 00:06:40.420
we can see the green part is the padding.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.430
So this means that the padding is being added by default, within the browser.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.200
So all we need to do is to override this inside the CSS.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.900
We can do this by selecting the unordered list.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.380
Then setting the padding back to zero.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.635
Then give that refresh.

00:07:00.635 --> 00:07:04.825
Now you can see that the links are now nicely in the center.

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:07.850
So our header is now starting to look better.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:13.560
Now let's make this look even better by moving on to adding our background image.
