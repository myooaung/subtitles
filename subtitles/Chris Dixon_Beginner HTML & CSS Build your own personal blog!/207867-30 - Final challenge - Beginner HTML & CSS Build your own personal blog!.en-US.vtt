Congratulations for getting to the end of this course.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:08.925
Before we go, I want to leave you with one final challenge.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:13.575
I would like you to return back to your project and add to it.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:18.255
Remember we created 'about me' link at the top of the page.

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:22.455
Well, I would like you to go back and create your very own

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:27.405
'About Me' page and then link to it from the main navigation menu.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:30.170
This is all things we've already covered.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.440
If you do get stuck,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.315
just look over the rest of the project and I'm sure you will find the answers.

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:38.505
Doing this challenge alone,

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.460
without my help will really get you thinking about

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.270
things and also reinforce what you've learned so far.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.220
Also, if you're feeling particularly creative,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.600
go ahead and add a footer section too on each page.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.020
Good luck and I can't wait to see what you guys create.
