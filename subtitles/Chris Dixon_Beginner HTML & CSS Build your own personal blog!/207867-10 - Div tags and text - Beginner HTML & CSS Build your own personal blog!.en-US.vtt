00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.630
Let's now move on to adding the final HTML content to this landing page.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.600
Remember when we looked at the slides a few videos ago.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.560
We looked at descriptive elements and also using div elements.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.130
Well, I'm going to create a element using a div as a container for this main text of "Hi,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.775
I'm Chris, follow me on my journey around world."

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:28.650
Lets begin by going over to the index.html.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.475
Below the closing header tag I'm going to create this div section.

00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:38.580
So the opening tag and also the closing tag.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.490
Then we can nest inside here a p element.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.070
The p element represents a paragraph of text and we can use it to add our text inside.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.980
So I'm going to add my text within here.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.980
Of course, add the texts which suits your blog.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.610
It can be absolutely anything you want.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.360
So "Hi, I'm Chris,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.900
follow me on my journey around the

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:17.565
world," and then give that a "Save."

00:01:17.565 --> 00:01:20.444
Go to the browser, and then hit "Refresh."

00:01:20.444 --> 00:01:23.715
Now we can see the line of text is being added.

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:26.600
We can also add more than one p element

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.785
too and this will separate each block of text onto a new line,

00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:32.945
also with some spacing in between.

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:37.010
So this is now all of the content you see on the screen.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.450
Compared to the finished blog though it doesn't look very pretty.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.830
We'll get into styling soon with CSS.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.325
First of all, there are a few elements which you can add to HTML to change the text.

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:52.235
You will see on this finished version a few things.

00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:55.300
First, detect a split over two lines.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.595
Also the word 'world' is emphasized.

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:03.075
This is all done with HTML tags.

00:02:03.075 --> 00:02:06.785
First of all, to break the text onto a new line,

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:11.135
we simply add a break element where we want this break to happen.

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:14.715
I'm going to add mine just after the name of Chris.

00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:18.020
So go over to the p tags.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.170
Then we can add a break element.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.475
This is one of the few elements which doesn't have a closing tag,

00:02:25.475 --> 00:02:29.500
so we're okay to leave it just as is there.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.965
Now if we refresh,

00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:32.720
we see after the word Chris,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.255
that the second line has been created.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.090
The reason why this doesn't have a closing tag is

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.170
simply because we don't add any content inside.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.695
It's just added wherever we need it.

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:49.165
Now we can add some tags around the world text, so it stands out.

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:53.800
First, we can wrap the word world with m tags.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.625
So the m tag just before,

00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:01.680
and also the closing tag just after.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.250
The m element adds extra emphasis on

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.745
the text and typically displays in the browser as Italic.

00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:13.550
We can see by saving that and then refreshing the browser.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.360
Now we can see the word has changed to Italic.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.665
Also, we can add a strong element.

00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:26.500
You can surround all this m section with the strong tags.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.230
So add it just before the opening tag and then just after the closing m tag.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.110
The strong element gives the texts strong importance.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.565
This is also typically displayed in bold.

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:47.720
Again, this emphasizes the importance of understanding how nesting works.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.165
As we have the word in the center,

00:03:50.165 --> 00:03:56.290
and then the m tag surrounding it and then finally the strong tags on the outside.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.125
Then head back over to the browser and then refresh.

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:02.935
You can see the text is a little bit bolder.

00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:07.580
It can be hard to see the strong element at the moment but it will be more visible

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.365
later when we increase the size of the text and also add a background image.

00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:14.885
So with all HTML now in place.

00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:18.720
Let's now move on to adding some styling to this page.
