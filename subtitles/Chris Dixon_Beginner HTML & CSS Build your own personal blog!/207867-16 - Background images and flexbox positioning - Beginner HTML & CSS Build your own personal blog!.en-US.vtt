00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
You should now have evenly images provided with the course,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.275
or your own images which you want to use.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.870
To add these images to your project,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.170
all we need to do is add them to the project folder.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.030
These can be placed anywhere,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.395
but I'm going to add these inside of a images folder just to keep things organized.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:24.560
Back over in the desktop I'm going to open up the projects.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.475
Here you can see I've got the images which are available as part of this course.

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.745
Don't worry if you've only got the background image for now.

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:37.125
All the rest of these images are going to be used later in the course for the blog.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:39.240
Within this trouble blog folder,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.490
I'm going to right-click and create a new folder called images,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.090
and then I'm going to drag all these inside of the images folder.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.585
For now we'll only be using this background image for the London page.

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:56.910
Of course yours might be named something completely different,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.800
so just bear that in mind when we type this out inside the project.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.150
Now if we go to the index.html page,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.235
if we scroll down to the bottom,

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:08.855
blow all the CSS.

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:10.610
We will have this text of "Hi,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.770
I'm Chris, follow me on my journey around the world."

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.310
I'm going to add two classes.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.580
The first one is going to be for the surrounding div container.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.200
This class is going to be called journey image,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.015
so this is the class name for the container.

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:36.480
Then a second class for these texts of Journey texts.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.770
As you can see here we have two separate classes just

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.805
separated by space and this is perfectly fine to use.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.850
Now we have these classes added,

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.705
we can add the image to the journey image container using the CSS.

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:57.055
Back up to the Style section.

00:01:57.055 --> 00:02:00.200
Remember this is a class so we need to use the dots.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.360
We want to target the journey image.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.810
We can add a background image in CSS with the background property,

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.805
then we use a URL to provide a link to the file location.

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:25.080
This is stored within the images folder and the image is called backgrounds dot JPEG.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.470
Of course if yours is named something different you'll need to change that.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.890
Then we're going to add some properties first of all, of no repeats.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.390
By default, images will be repeated horizontally and vertically.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.490
We add no repeat because we want just one full-size image.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.275
Then center sensor.

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:53.270
This will sensor the image on both the X and

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.815
the Y axis by default to replace in the top-left.

00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:01.250
This moves the image back into the center.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.945
Then finally we're going to add fixed onto the end,

00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:07.310
this keeps the image position fixed when we

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.380
scroll and we'll take a look at these in just a moment.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.240
Give that a save, then if we go over to the browser and then refresh,

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.475
we still see that no image has been displayed on the screen.

00:03:21.475 --> 00:03:24.140
This is because the background image will only be

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.080
the height of the content inside of this div,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.885
which is the text,

00:03:28.885 --> 00:03:33.545
and this text however hides the image because of the gray background.

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:40.230
If we temporarily go over to the style and remove the background,

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.830
cut out and save and then refresh.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.520
We can see that the background has just about appeared on the screen.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.635
Let's add this back in.

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:57.455
To get around this, we can set the height of the journey image

00:03:57.455 --> 00:04:01.480
in the CSS using the minimum high property,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.100
and we can add this just below the background property.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.075
To scroll back down to the journey image,

00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:17.505
and then we can add the minimum height of 100 vh.

00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:20.585
Minimum height can be a pixel value,

00:04:20.585 --> 00:04:24.815
a percentage, or by 70 to 100 vh.

00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:28.790
This set says to be 100 percent of the viewport height.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.615
The viewport is a visible screen of the device.

00:04:32.615 --> 00:04:35.855
Save that, and now if we refresh,

00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:39.515
we now see that the image is on the screen.

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:42.545
One thing to notice when scrolling down in the browser,

00:04:42.545 --> 00:04:45.380
that the image is in a fixed position.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.380
This is because we set this to be fixed.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.530
If we were to remove this, we can see by

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.340
refreshing the browser that the image scrolls with the rest of the page,

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.130
but I want to keep mine fixed as I like to look at this.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.040
Let's continue with silent this image section.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.990
Below the minimum heights, I'm going to add the background size property.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.840
We'll set this to cover.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.800
The background size can be set to covert to make

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.925
the image cover the full background area,

00:05:18.925 --> 00:05:22.900
and then we're going to set the display type to be flex,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.205
just like we've looked at in the header.

00:05:25.205 --> 00:05:29.315
This is also going to be the flex container for our texts,

00:05:29.315 --> 00:05:32.545
so save that and if we refresh,

00:05:32.545 --> 00:05:35.900
we can now see that the text is now placed on top of

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.905
the image rather than sitting above it, like it was before.

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:44.030
We can now use the flexbox to align this text in the center,

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.495
both horizontally and vertically.

00:05:46.495 --> 00:05:48.979
To set the text line as vertically,

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.380
we can set the line items property.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.225
Let's add this just below the display type.

00:05:56.225 --> 00:06:00.835
Align items into the center,

00:06:00.835 --> 00:06:03.090
and let's take a look at this.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.425
Refresh. Now we can see that this is aligned vertically to the image.

00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:10.880
Now, to send the text horizontally,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:21.750
we can use another flexbox property of justify content and also set this to be sensor,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.140
so save and give that refresh.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.720
Now we can see the text has now moved into the middle of the image.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.205
Now you can see how easy it is to align text using the flexbox.

00:06:34.205 --> 00:06:39.300
Next up we'll finish off by adding the final styles for the mobile view.
