00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
We're now going to jump straight into building our blog project.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.395
The landing page will be the main entry page for the website.

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:09.195
It make sense to begin here.

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:14.505
It is also the most simple page and will link to the rest of the pages we create too,

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:17.760
such as the blog and the about me page.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.390
Creating a new website project is relatively simple.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.330
We begin with a new project folder.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.110
This folder will then contain all the files for our website,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.115
such as the different pages and also the images.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.940
I'm going to place mine on the desktop for easy access.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.805
You can add yours anywhere you find most convenient.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.200
Such as the documents.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.110
Yeah, I'm going to control-click or right-click and create a new folder.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.470
I'm going to call this the trouble block.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.440
So displays are anyway, find convenience.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.060
You should have already downloaded Visual Studio Code by now,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.435
or an alternative editor.

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:05.060
To open up this project in the editor all you need to do

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.495
is select your code editor and then go to file.

00:01:10.495 --> 00:01:12.950
You can select your folder from there.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.515
Or you can simply drag in the project folder and begin working.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:21.695
So you now see the project folder inside the sidebar.

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:24.065
We can see the title of Travel Blogger.

00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:29.195
Now it's time to create the new file to contain the code for our landing page.

00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:33.380
Traditionally, the main or the default page in a website is called

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.620
the index.html page. Let's create this now.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:46.510
So you can go to File and New File or Command or Control N to create a new webpage.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.120
You want to save this straight away as the index.html page.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.760
Making sure this has the HTML extension on the end,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.295
because the webpage will be an HTML.

00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:02.555
Also make sure this is saving inside of the travel blog project too.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:07.870
It's saved and you will now see the new page inside the project folder, in the sidebar.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.295
I'm going to just type in Hello into the index.html and then save that.

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:18.470
If you want to open this web page up in the browser to see the contents,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.210
all we need to do is open up

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.140
the travel blog folder and then double-click on the index.html.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.635
We can now see Hello!

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:33.650
Inside the browser. So this is just plain text rather than valid HTML.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.975
But congratulations on getting the first web page open inside the browser.

00:02:37.975 --> 00:02:39.950
Now this project is setup.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.550
Let's now move on to look into how to correctly structure a webpage.
