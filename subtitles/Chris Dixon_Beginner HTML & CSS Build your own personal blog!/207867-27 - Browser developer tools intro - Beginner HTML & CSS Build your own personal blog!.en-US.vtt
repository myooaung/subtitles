00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
Along with the testing on different browsers we mentioned in the last video,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.390
it's also useful to test how a site looks on various devices.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.700
Most of us do not have lots of types of tablets and phones round to test on,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.475
so Google Chrome helps us out with this.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:21.270
If we go over to a website, anyone's phone,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.715
and then if we click on "Inspect" option to open up the Developer Tools.

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:31.565
Bear in mind other browsers will also have their own version of the developer tools too,

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:34.175
but they may work slightly different to this.

00:00:34.175 --> 00:00:38.360
If we click on the icon with the mobile phone and tablet,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.915
which is just at the top here,

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:45.450
we can simulate how a site looks on different devices.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.120
Rather than having it Responsive or various devices to select.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.200
For example, if you click on the iPhone 6,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.900
we can see exactly how this would render in an iPhone 6.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.490
You can see with the media queries,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.950
this means everything still looks fine.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.280
This is particularly because we've designed this site to be mobile

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.080
first and built on top of it for larger devices.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:21.855
We can also select a large iPad and see how this looks. That looks all fine there.

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:25.190
If you don't have many devices around to test on,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.890
this is a good tool to see how websites look on different sized devices.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm just going to click on this icon again to return back to the desktop view.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.930
Another useful tool which we've already looked at in this course,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.015
is the ability to select an element by clicking on this arrow.

00:01:43.015 --> 00:01:46.740
This is useful for finding any problems and debugging.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.855
For example, if you're wondering why some CSS is not taking effect,

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:54.200
we can then hover over any elements on the site and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.890
take a look at all the CSS properties which have taken effect.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.370
For example, if we click on the level 1 heading,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.050
over on the right-hand side,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.060
we can see the header h1.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.905
We can also see the margin,

00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:12.440
the padding, and also see which style sheets these are coming from.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.435
This is useful on larger sites which may have more than one style sheets.

00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:23.700
We can also temporarily remove these and see how the site looks with or without them.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.110
We can also add different styles in.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.950
Let's change the color to be red,

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.110
and you can see the changes are instantly reflected in the sites.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.790
However, don't worry too much about breaking the site.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.260
A simple refresh will return everything back to normal.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.440
The developer tools are really useful and they can do a lot more.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.620
But a lot of this is for more advanced cases.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.200
We won't cover it here, but I'm sure as

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.825
you progress through your web design or development journey,

00:02:56.825 --> 00:02:59.750
you'll spend a lot more time inside here.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.145
Next, I want to show you a great text editor plugin called Emmet,

00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:08.550
which will really speed up your coding and make things a lot easier.
