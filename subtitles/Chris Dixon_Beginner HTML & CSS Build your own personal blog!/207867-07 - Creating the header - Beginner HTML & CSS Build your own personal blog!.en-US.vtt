00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
Now it's time to begin adding a site header.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:08.520
This header will contain the site title and also the links to other pages.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.370
We can also reuses code and have a consistent header across all of our pages.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.570
To begin that, start in the index.html page and add this in between the body tags.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.870
Just under the opening for the body.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.570
We can open up the header tags and again,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.930
like most essentially opening and also the closure inside.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.450
The header element is not mandatory.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.975
However, it is an element provided chains, hey, HTML5.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.910
So make sense to make use of it.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.000
The actual element itself won't display on the screen.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.695
So we save and refresh.

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:52.235
We still can't see any content inside the browser.

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:57.260
But instead it describes to the browser which content it will contain.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.280
Let's go ahead and add some content between the header tags.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.465
Begin with the name of the site at the top of the page.

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:08.950
We're going to add this within the H1 tags.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.450
So H one is a heading elements.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.370
Headings are added with tags from page one right through to H6.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.890
H1 being the top level of the most

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.760
important cited in and H six being the least important.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.230
The text displayed is also larger for

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.430
H1 and then gets gradually smaller right down to H6.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.610
Our site title is an important piece of information.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.890
So this is a good use for the H1 tag.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.430
I'm going to add the site title in-between of Chris Dixon's travel blog.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.000
Just give that save and then we can head over to the browser and then refresh.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.575
Now we see the heading at the top of the page.

00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:04.550
We'll make use of the over size of headings to as we go through these projects.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.345
Next, we can add the navigation links to the other pages.

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:12.680
We also have a surrounding elements for these two called nav.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.810
So just underneath H1,

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.100
I'm going to create the nav elements with the opening and closing tag.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.555
Both the nav and the header,

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:26.720
are what we call semantic elements.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.030
Meaning they describe the content within them.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.115
This is because a search engine such as Google

00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:36.265
can see these elements and know exactly what they are.

00:02:36.265 --> 00:02:37.840
So header will contain

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.280
these Site header and nav will contain the site navigation and so on.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.100
Most of the time we create our links using a list.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.940
So we didn't nav, we can create an unordered list by using the UL tags.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.150
An ordered simply means that each item in the list will not be numbered.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.320
For example, 123, and so on for each item.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.005
Then to create each item in the list,

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:10.420
or in our case, the list of pages.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.490
We add the LI tags

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.350
and then within the target we can add the name of each one of our links.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.990
I'm going to begin with the homepage.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.815
Then our second link,

00:03:27.815 --> 00:03:34.290
again within the LI tags is going to be

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.610
the about me page and the third one is going to be for the book.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.280
So the name that we add in between these list items,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.680
is going to be the name which we see on the screen.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.690
If you go over and refresh the browser.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.350
We now see home about me and also the blog.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.240
You can see by default that is a bullet next to each item on the left.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.505
If want this list to be numbered,

00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:11.330
for example 1,2,3, we can change the UL tags.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.365
Do we have here two OL for a ordered list?

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:18.050
This looks a lot different from the finish site,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.940
however, which we looked at earlier.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.660
This is because we've only added the HTML content.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.430
The CSS styling and layout will make this look a lot nicer in a later video.
