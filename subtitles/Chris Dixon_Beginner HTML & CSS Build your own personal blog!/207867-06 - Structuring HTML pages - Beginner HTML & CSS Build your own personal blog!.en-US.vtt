00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
When creating HTML pages,

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:04.875
which are to be read by the browser,

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.250
it is really important we structure our code correctly.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.815
The first thing we need to do in our index page is add a doctype declaration.

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:16.980
This declares which version of HTML we're using.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.440
HTML5 is the latest version,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.705
and the doctype looks like this.

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:24.225
Open up the tags,

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:31.600
use an exclamation mark and then doctype and HTML.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.030
Doctype s the early versions of HTML,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.479
were a lot longer and more complicated,

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.045
but HTML5 is now nice and simple.

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:43.220
The doctype is not case sensitive.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.465
But I always like to type it in uppercase anyway,

00:00:46.465 --> 00:00:53.350
then we have the roots HTML elements and that looks just like this.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.345
So most HTML elements,

00:00:56.345 --> 00:01:02.150
there is an open tag and also a closing tag which starts with the forward slash.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.475
This is the main route element,

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:08.060
meaning everything else must be added between these tags,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.435
with the doctype being the only exception.

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:13.190
Inside of the opening tag,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.455
I'm going to add a language attribute.

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:19.565
An attribute is just some additional information about the elements.

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:22.295
I'm going to be creating a site in English,

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:24.470
so the language code is "en".

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.655
So add the language attributes I am just going to set to ""en".

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:35.015
If you want to use a different language,

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:37.190
you can find a full list by searching for

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.080
HTML language codes and then select your language from there.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.215
This main HTML element now contains two elements nested inside.

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:50.380
First, we have the "head" section.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.655
Just like that. Again, this has the "opening" and also the "closing" tags.

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:03.425
The section contains data sometimes referred to as metadata,

00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:06.650
which is information about the HTML document.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.965
This information is not displayed inside the browser,

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:13.190
but it provides important information about your website,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.190
such as the site title, the description,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.095
and also links over files to which we'll look at later.

00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:23.770
Then other section is the body.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.800
So the opening body tag and then the closing tag with the forward slash.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.285
So just like a human would have the head section on top and then the body section.

00:02:38.285 --> 00:02:43.565
This section contains all the websites content which is displayed inside the browser,

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:46.160
such as any text or any images.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.540
So basically the head contains our website's data which is not displayed.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.950
And the body is for our website's content which is displayed in the browser.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.345
We can now add some contents in side of the head section.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.320
First up is the metadata.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.895
Let's add the meta element.

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:08.975
The metatag does not contain a closing tag.

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:13.650
Inside here we can add an attribute called the character set.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.455
Here we can specify the character encoding for the web page.

00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:25.260
The most commonly used is called UTF-8.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.695
You can find the list of available character sets inside the resources.

00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:34.610
The last metatag I will add is for the viewport.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.080
So again, open up the meta tag this time,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.910
the name is equal to "viewport".

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.780
The viewport is the visible area of the web page.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.840
In the past it used to just be a computer screen.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.805
But since smartphones and tablets,

00:03:52.805 --> 00:03:56.125
the viewport size can now vary considerably.

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:59.520
So this is why this viewport tag is important.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:10.710
First, we add the content and we set the content width to be equal to the device width.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.790
This allows the width of the page to be equal to

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.675
the width of the device that it's being viewed on.

00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:21.500
Then separated by a comma,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.410
we can add the initial scale to be equal to 1.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.575
This sets the zoom level when the page is first loaded.

00:04:33.575 --> 00:04:36.710
This can help keep zooming consistent when rotating

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.055
devices from landscape to portrait, for example.

00:04:40.055 --> 00:04:44.660
Finally, I'm going to add the site title just underneath.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.875
So this has the opening and the closing title tags.

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:53.195
With the forward slash for the closing tag,

00:04:53.195 --> 00:04:55.685
then we can have the title inside.

00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:59.970
So I'm going to call my "Chris Dixon's Travel Blog".

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.475
Then give that safe.

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:08.225
So this title element will be displayed inside the browser.

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:11.525
So if we go over to Google Chrome and hit refresh,

00:05:11.525 --> 00:05:15.365
we now see the title appears in the top tab there.

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:20.315
So this is the basic structure we need for any HTML page.

00:05:20.315 --> 00:05:24.380
If this is all new to you don't worry about memorizing all the issues yet.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.710
We'll use the same structure across all of our pages.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.980
So soon it will become more familiar.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.130
I know this part can seem a little boring.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.385
We're not seeing anything on the screen yet.

00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:38.495
But we'll move on now to adding some more content on the landing page.

00:05:38.495 --> 00:05:41.165
So next up we'll add the head section,

00:05:41.165 --> 00:05:46.620
which will contain the site title and also the navigation links to other pages.
