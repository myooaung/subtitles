00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.920
During building this project and also future projects.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.185
You'll always come across a need to find some high-quality images to use in your website.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:11.865
This blog is no different,

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:17.130
and here I want to show you a few resources to find some good quality images.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.280
The first one is pixabay.com,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.985
and this is a website where you can find free stock images,

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:27.990
and these are listed under the Creative Commons license.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.230
This means that it's free for commercial use,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.190
and we don't need to add any attribution to the offer or to the website.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.530
Finding images is simple.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.705
We can use the search facility or even click on the Explore.

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:46.185
So for example, if we wanted a picture of a tiger,

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:47.984
we could do a search,

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:49.950
and then if we select one,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.545
all we need to do is click on the free download.

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:56.110
Here you can see some information about the license.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.420
You can see that the image is free for

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.050
commercial use and we don't need to write any attribution.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.460
So this is a good website to use for high-quality images.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.885
Another one is a website called Unsplash ,

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:13.225
and you can find this art Unsplash.com.

00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:18.730
The images which you can find on here are also free to use and again,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.100
you can have easy search facility or click on

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.820
the images and then hit the download button.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.300
You'll also notice that there is a popup saying crediting isn't

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.115
required but is appreciated to give the photographers some more exposure,

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:39.130
and there is some text below to embed into the website if you didn't want at this.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.615
Another great resource is the Wiki media Commons website.

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:46.250
Everyday there's a new picture of the day which you can

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.870
use and all you need to do is click on the images tab at the top,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.445
and then we can select images by a category.

00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:57.405
The images on here are free to use,

00:01:57.405 --> 00:01:59.840
and you can also find out more information about

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.380
the license on the left-hand side and the Welcome section.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.805
This just basically has some information,

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:11.220
telling you how the images are free to use.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.125
Finally, we have a website called Shutterstock.com.

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:20.180
You may have already heard this as its probably the biggest,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.615
and does have the widest range of images available.

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:28.490
You can also download things such as music tracks and video clips to.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.830
However, there is a cost to this.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.675
Shutterstock is one of the ones on here which isn't free.

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:40.050
You can check out the pricing plans to by clicking on the link here.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.985
Another way of finding images is a Google search.

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:49.655
So that's also searched for our tiger.

00:02:49.655 --> 00:02:53.255
But one of the things to bear in mind is the licensing agreement.

00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:55.625
If we click on the images,

00:02:55.625 --> 00:03:01.850
one of the ways to filter this down to ones which are free to use it by going on to

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.560
the tools menu link and therefore go to

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.065
usage rights and the labeled for reuse with modification.

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:11.570
If we select this unissued now fills down

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.275
the images to ones which we're freely available to use.

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:18.965
But finally, always check the license and agreement before downloading

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:22.760
any images to check you are okay to use them for your use case.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.070
So all you need to now do is to select

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.960
an image which you are going to use for the background of your blog,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.315
and then have this available to use in the next video.

00:03:32.315 --> 00:03:34.760
Or if you just want to follow along with me,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.990
the image is used in this course provided inside the resources section.
