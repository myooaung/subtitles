00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.095
Congratulations, you've reached the end of this course.

00:00:04.095 --> 00:00:08.310
Hopefully by now, you should be more comfortable building great

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.660
looking websites using both HTML and CSS.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.660
You now should know enough to go ahead and complete more challenging projects too,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.745
to build on what you've already learned so far in this course.

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:26.420
Together, we have built a blog website with your topic of choice.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.195
Hope you've also managed to complete the challenge of adding the About Me page too,

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:35.045
or maybe even adding the photo section.

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:38.870
I would love it if you would also share your project too,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.660
for both me and fellow students to see.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.715
This is a great way to both showcase your skills along with inspiring other students too.

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:50.730
This is not the end of your journey though.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.515
Building websites is a continuous learning process,

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:57.685
but it can also be very rewarding too.

00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:00.455
The best way to keep learning is by building

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:04.385
more websites and keep challenging yourself along the way.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:07.895
If you do not have any projects to practice with,

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:12.920
try making one up, or even copying one of your favorite websites.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.325
Once you get comfortable with HTML and CSS,

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:18.950
I would then encourage you to learn a new language,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.015
such as JavaScript to really bring your websites to life.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:27.160
For now though, a huge thank you from me for taking this course,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.995
and I hope you've enjoyed it,

00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:32.520
along with learning some new skills along the way.
