00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
We're just about ready to jump into starting to build

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.485
our project and begin learning about HTML and CSS.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:09.000
Just before we do this,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.840
I'd like to take a moment to think about a theme for your project.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.245
On the screen here, this is a project which I will build in.

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:19.230
Which will be a personal travel blog.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.305
Of course, you're free to follow along with me,

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:24.600
and stick with the same theme of travel.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.375
However, I would encourage you to take a moment to think about something personal to you.

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:32.360
It could be something such as a sports book,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.690
a blog about web development or coding in general,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.775
or even about your favorite food for example.

00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:42.170
The project which will build can be customized to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.665
suit pretty much any type of blog you can think of.

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:49.090
Go ahead and be as creative as you like.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.230
Maybe write down a few ideas and once your idea has been finalized.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.040
We can then move on to the next video where we'll start our project.
