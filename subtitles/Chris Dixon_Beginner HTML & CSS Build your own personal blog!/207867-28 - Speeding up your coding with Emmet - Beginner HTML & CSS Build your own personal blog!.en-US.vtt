00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
During greatness course projects,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.610
we've hand-coded all of the elements in HTML.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.185
This is a perfect way to gain practice and memorize how things work.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.710
However, once you've had more practice and you know how things work,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.195
sometimes you may feel we need to speed up our coding and the more productive.

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:20.835
This is where Emmet comes into play.

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:24.630
Emmet is a plug-in for most popular text editors,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.295
which really helped speed up our coding and make work in more efficient.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.500
If we go to the download section,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.435
we can see the Emmet is available for most of the popular text editors.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:41.235
I would encourage you to go ahead and download for your particular text editor.

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:43.590
Also often most text editors,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.595
have a plugin Section in the preferences,

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:49.655
which allow you to install plugins more easily.

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:53.480
However, if you are using Visual Studio code like I am,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.275
it's already included by default.

00:00:56.275 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm going to go to one of the HTML pages.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.580
I'm going to scroll down to the body.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.210
Emmet provides us with some keyboard shortcuts,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.045
which really allow us to speed up our coding.

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:13.580
For example, when we first started this project,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.325
we typed out all of the html section,

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:18.935
including the head section, the metadata,

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:23.170
the body, and also the surrounding html tags.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.075
Emmet provides us with an easy way of doing this.

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:29.100
All we need to do is type html:5.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.510
Then we can see, we get the auto complete,

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.760
saying this is an Emmet abbreviation.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.630
All we need to do now is hit Enter or tab,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.020
and then we have a basic HTML structure in place.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.450
I'm just going to remove this and try to look at a few more examples.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.385
The one which will save us a lot of time.

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:51.200
Instead of type no elements.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.790
Just like we doing during this course with the opening and closing tag.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.330
All we need to do is type the name of the elements and again press Enter or

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.695
Tab and this fills out the opening and closing tag for us saving us a lot of work.

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:08.370
We can go even further.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:14.215
For example, if we wanted to create an unordered list with a list item already inside,

00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:16.205
you could do ul,

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:19.495
the greater than symbol and then li.

00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:25.570
Press Enter, and we can see this automatically adds the li inside of the list.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.450
If you wanted more than one list item,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.175
we could do ul,

00:02:30.175 --> 00:02:32.470
the greater than symbol and an li,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.340
just like we've done before.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.130
Then after the star symbol,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.785
we can add as many list items as you want.

00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:43.115
So for example, if we want five, we could do this.

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:45.640
Of course is so much more you can do.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.160
I really encourage you to have a play around

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.100
this and use once you get more comfortable with HTML.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.100
So I'm going to remove this.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.580
If you do want to look into this even further and find out more of the shortcuts.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.260
There's a good documentation on

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.695
websites which you can look through and find out more about the abbreviations.

00:03:05.695 --> 00:03:09.195
This is how we can use Emmet to speed of coding.

00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:13.770
Next up, we'll take a look at block versus inline elements.
