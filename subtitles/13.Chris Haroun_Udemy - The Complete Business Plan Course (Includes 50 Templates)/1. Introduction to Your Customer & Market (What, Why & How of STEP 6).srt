00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,180
Welcome to Step Six of the course in terms of the what why and how of.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,120
Step Six I'll kick off the what what are we going to learn.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:15,430
We will discuss who the customer is and what the total addressable market is in much more detail as

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,050
we're going to build upon what we answered in step three which was the executive summary part of our

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:27,160
business plan and if applicable as always will answer questions about our customer and the market including

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:34,420
what our market and customer research process is including using using survey tools like Survey Monkey

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,950
what our customer concentration is how we plan on collecting information about our customers as well

8
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,840
as how we plan on getting customers.

9
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:51,580
We'll also talk about social media how to get immediate e-mail alerts when our company or product or

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,710
service is mentioned on web pages meaning using Google Alerts.

11
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,750
In addition we'll talk about the customer service process that we use.

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,650
We'll talk about our customer response time.

13
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,460
You know what our customer loyalty program is etc..

14
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:12,490
And as always if a placable will talk about what percent of the market we want to capture now we're

15
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:18,760
also going to talk about what the problems are with the industry and what the solutions are to the problems.

16
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,280
Meaning why our product or service is it is a bargain or really good to use for our customers.

17
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,080
And you'll see that everything is always feeds into the next tab here.

18
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,680
Okay.

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,000
And also everything that we do here a lot of what we do in a step is going to feed into the presentation

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,390
part.

21
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:44,410
Here at the end of the course and that's optional now step 6 We're also going to discuss industry risks

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,020
as well as barriers to entry seasonality and much more.

23
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:55,580
Okay let's move on to why why are we documenting topics like customer research market sizing etc..

24
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:02,410
Because the customer is always right and the customer is the lifeline and the alpha and omega of our

25
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,440
business model.

26
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:09,940
And if we don't thoroughly understand who we're selling to then our success rate will of course not

27
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,430
be as high as we want it to be.

28
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,420
Okay lastly how how are we going to complete Step 6.

29
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:21,290
As with all steps we're going to answer questions in our inputs and analysis tab which then feeds in

30
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:28,930
other tabs including our Step 6 customers and markets put tap and you'll see that you'll see in the

31
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,050
Step 6 outputs tab here that I provides you with checkboxes.

32
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,440
So you can turn off certain items that just aren't applicable or of any interest to you to include in

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:46,210
your business plan including customer survey research customer response time customer loyalty programs

34
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,850
warranty policy and industry search trends as well as what percent of the total addressable market that

35
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,080
you want to own in five years.

36
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,130
And we can also turn on and off seasonality.

37
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,820
Thanks.
