00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.410
Please click on Step 7 input to analysis where we're going to talk about answering questions about the

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.600
competition.

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:16.390
And so you'll see here that's the first row here 7:1 is just informational for you.

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.760
OK.

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.860
And what I've done is I've pulled over why you answered and answered from Step three in the executive

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.720
summary where you talked about if a couple who your top three to five competitors are.

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.230
And I also pulled forward what you wrote your competitive advantage was back in step three when we created

8
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.750
your executive summary.

9
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.590
And so again the executive summary is just a summary of the important stuff and then we drill down into

10
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.740
more detail on the important stuff in the other categories here so for competition you'll see it's pulled

11
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.740
here for you if you've entered in the competitive data back in step three and the same thing that competitive

12
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.290
advantage.

13
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.590
And I made the fourth and fifth largest competitors optionals well because a lot of times you just want

14
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.350
to talk about the three biggest competitors in the market.

15
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.570
Everyone is different.

16
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.040
OK.

17
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.380
What you can do if you want is just to get a little bit more space you can minimize your task bar at

18
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.890
the top.

19
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.140
And even this it's it takes a second or two to two.

20
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.990
But what you can do if you don't I shall do that right now on second so I'll minimize That's

21
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.850
all right that's like a segment of Steinhart get.

22
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.130
All right.

23
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.470
So next here in 7:2 And these are just suggestions on a question.

24
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.330
But but I really want to help you to really think about the competitive environment in and how to answer

25
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.980
questions about your competition and so I wrote down here about things like Have you actually tried

26
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.120
the products or services from your competitors.

27
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.870
And if you if you have really think about that thoughtfully as you answer the next couple of questions

28
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.010
and before you invest in any company as well you ought to try the product it'll it'll help you understand

29
00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.100
what you're investing in much more detail obviously and think about what makes your your company's product

30
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.000
or service weaker than his competitors.

31
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.550
OK.

32
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.530
Just think about it in those perspectives in that perspective because it will really help you address

33
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.400
those issues here and go to your competitors Web sites if you can find out who they're hiring because

34
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.930
this basically signals what their future competitive strategy is going to be and as I mentioned before

35
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.820
go to the Twitter profiles of your competition see who they're following because it can tell you who

36
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.300
their customers are and their biggest partners as well people are they don't people leave their guards

37
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.640
down on Twitter like a lot of people will will follow politicians.

38
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.600
It's basically that bill will make 50 percent of the people maybe think less favorably of you.

39
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.240
I don't know what 50 percent is but whatever little bit off track there sorry.

40
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.140
Next up set up Google alerts on the competition we talked about Google alerts before.

41
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.680
But do it on the competition as well.

42
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.460
Because I just want you to be aware of when they issue press releases and when there's articles written

43
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.560
about them I want you to stay on top and ahead of the competition at all times.

44
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.990
I'm pretty competitive for you.

45
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.040
OK.

46
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.390
And then I want to read the new reports if you can of your competition because by law they have to disclose

47
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.920
what their weaknesses are and the risks in their business model.

48
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:22.190
And let me actually do is let me go to every country is different but if you're on a list on the stock

49
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.220
market in any country you usually have to disclose the annual report on a government website.

50
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.940
In Canada it's called Ceder in the United States is called SCC.

51
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.810
And I'll show you a quick example here and you can always go to the Web site of the company you are

52
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.390
looking at to get the report.

53
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.960
If you're on the stock market.

54
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.850
But what we'll do is we're going to ask dot gov.

55
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.620
And we'll just do a quick search on a ticker.

56
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.090
I know Apple.

57
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.680
Actually the ticker AAPL doesn't appear there is a deal.

58
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.220
And then when you see the 10-K that means annual reports so we can actually go here and just type in

59
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:06.860
10 oh I'm sorry right here 10-K and we can see all the documents historically if we want to go back

60
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.810
to 1994 and find out what the risk we're with Apple back then let's call their action might be kind

61
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.660
of fun.

62
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.290
This is when I remember they were on the cover of Wired magazine.

63
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.340
It said the word prey because people thought they going to go bankrupt is really sad.

64
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.790
And then they had the cover evil genius and Apple years later.

65
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.250
Right here he guess you can go through here and just do a search on the word risk.

66
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.560
And Steve Jobs actually wasn't at the company at this point.

67
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.280
He was fired by the board and then came back and turn it around.

68
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.530
Right.

69
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.260
So it was 31 instances that were at risk in 1994 for Apple.

70
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.290
You can just go down here and read about all the risks.

71
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.660
Right.

72
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.880
So in a lot of times it's this interesting foreign currency issue we talked about hedging earlier in

73
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.950
the course for commodities you can do the same for eFax currencies if you want to.

74
00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.620
Well you can just go down through here and read all this stuff and it talks about concentrations of

75
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.740
credit risk and how they distribute their products.

76
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.450
And you can learn a lot about your competition how they distribute their products as well.

77
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.460
By reading through the annual report I know it doesn't look all pretty and here is just kind of like

78
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.960
old antiquated tax but it's helpful it's helpful and they were on the brink of bankruptcy at one point.

79
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.130
It's amazing.

80
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.570
Look at this.

81
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.340
You can find out about a lot of different financial data as well.

82
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.140
We'll talk about a lot of this financial data stuff when we talk about Step 12.

83
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.470
OK.

84
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.910
Let me go back here.

85
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.340
Anyway it's kind of interesting little walk down memory lane for you there.

86
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.930
OK.

87
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.820
And then what else do I have here.

88
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:43.790
You can go to a glass door and Yelp and other Web sites like the Better Business Bureau to read reviews

89
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.240
on on your competition and what your competition has to say about management as well.

90
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.040
And you may not find anything there if they're if they're smaller companies but for larger companies

91
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.180
go there to get the fun go to class store.

92
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.960
So this course is more than just a business plan course it's kind of a corporate strategy.

93
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.990
I'm having fun.

94
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.580
You can always skip this if you want.

95
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:06.320
OK.

96
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:15.240
Let's go to companies and let's search for sales force which is the largest employer now in in San Francisco

97
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.100
worlds are one place to work to use it.

98
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.730
OK.

99
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.380
So you can go through here and learn a lot about the company what people have to say about this company

100
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.120
as well.

101
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.710
You can see what employees have to say about the management as well.

102
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.510
Oh here it is here.

103
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:42.510
So 97 percent of employees at sales force approve of the founder and CEO Marc Benioff this percent here

104
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.730
recommend to a friend you can read about the cons as well and the pros and look at that it is 4000 for

105
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.190
540 reviews anyway.

106
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.440
You can go there if you want and check out the competition and see what people are saying what I mean

107
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.490
can you see with Yelp.

108
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.410
Same with Better Business Bureau and other Web sites too I'm sure.

109
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.370
OK so next up we've got the description of the largest competitor.

110
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.780
I want to write a one paragraph note here on a profile on them.

111
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.320
OK.

112
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.420
Little things like you know maybe the year they were founded the size of the company their location

113
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:18.150
their market share and just other details that could really help the reader of your business plan you

114
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.690
know of understand how your company compares to competition.

115
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:28.890
Don't talk about strengths or weaknesses of the competition here unless it's kind of a brief comparison.

116
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.740
Can cause and Tiguan strengths weaknesses down here below.

117
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:39.630
And if you have data sources always provide a little footnote if you want to whatever.

118
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:46.940
It just helps to show in your final business plan documents how thoughtful you were by doing research.

119
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.410
So here you can write down the strength of your largest competitor and the weaknesses.

120
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.380
I just put dummy data here but you can write all here if you want.

121
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.590
Then you write a description of the second largest competitor similar to what I wrote here strengthen

122
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.690
weaknesses of the second largest competitor for them here.

123
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:10.220
And then it's all tagged here in my sample ones are actually not cured by the ERs are all Takht here

124
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:16.430
and then description of your third largest competitor the small feet and other places in the documents

125
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:21.650
and you'll see not just in part seven output but in the final document but as well it's pretty powerful.

126
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.430
You like it I hope.

127
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.420
Okay.

128
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:30.800
And then down here if you are to a fourth competitor and a fifth I made three competitors mandatory

129
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:38.060
your call whatever you can always override my mandatory suggestions by just going here marking the whole

130
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.290
steps having is done fifth fourth and fifth.

131
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.390
And then here I wrote down write down your strengths compared to the competition strengths based on

132
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:56.140
what you wrote above and then your weaknesses based on the competition's weaknesses.

133
00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:02.960
And this is all tagged so later on you can always scroll through and go to all of your answers for everything.

134
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:10.230
And then here how is the management of your company versus the competition's management.

135
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:15.560
And then you can talk about the price of your product or service compared to the competition.

136
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.080
I can talk about why your price is higher or lower than the competition.

137
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.460
And then once you're done with this thing open this up which will slow and performance a bit.

138
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.100
That's fine.

139
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:30.260
But when you're done with this just as as always please click on that button at the top.

140
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:35.840
If you answer all the questions this should say 100 percent if you skipped a couple of the ones that

141
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.180
are that are required I mean an optional ones it won't say 100 but I recommend just clicking this when

142
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.960
you're done and it will manually override and it says 100 percent done.

143
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.730
And now we are wow we're halfway there.

144
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.680
It's a lot.

145
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.500
So we're 50 percent there.

146
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.710
We're done all of sections we're done with this.

147
00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:01.400
This entire column here which is awesome and I will see in the next lecture which is step seven competition

148
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.570
what's next.
