00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.120
So in terms of updating.

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.660
Step 5 up until step 11 the end of Sept. 11.

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.990
It's really easy to just use exact same process you're just going to copy and paste special and based

4
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.810
on whatever data you entered in earlier in the course.

5
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.340
It will appear here and white one nicely cohesive summary.

6
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.010
Some resection here and just copy all of your boxes here.

7
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.700
We see all the data and pasted directly into into Word and the same thing with every single step.

8
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.690
OK.

9
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.740
And you can always go back and delete here.

10
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.620
Anything that's not relevant so let me just go here where we are we done executive summary and management.

11
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.190
And then here just use exactly methodology.

12
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.940
So product and service you're going to go to product and service over here will show you.

13
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.670
And we're just going to copy and paste.

14
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.470
It's really easy.

15
00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.470
So and if you ever get lost and you're not sure where you put something in here.

16
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:08.610
I made it help for helpful for you because what I did was I tagged everything so we go here.

17
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.120
You can always copy this and you don't have to this is optional and will bring you right here.

18
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.540
Case on the go here.

19
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.920
Paste.

20
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.390
I'll bring it here so this is that whole area.

21
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.520
It's a very long one right so you can copy this and paste it directly into product and service.

22
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.950
This is quite a long section here.

23
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.620
It's important obviously because Is your product so a click paste paste all that stuff for you which

24
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.970
is nice and it looks like I have a couple of grammatical issues there should be a dash there.

25
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.090
And then here dash.

26
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.600
I didn't know that.

27
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.260
Ok cool I'll put that directly there.

28
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.610
So it's pretty self-explanatory if you have certain things that are blank here.

29
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.160
You obviously don't have to copy that stuff over you can delete the headings right.

30
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.980
Although I made them mandatory.

31
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.960
Obviously there's nothing mandatory in this course you can get rid of this fuel price.

32
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.840
If you have all these things and just delete them and then when we repaginate or right click and update

33
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.900
the table of contents it'll update accordingly for all this so what I'll do actually is I'll go into

34
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.580
really fast forward mode.

35
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.750
You can skip the rest of this lecture if you want to but I only go in a fast forward mode and just update

36
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.000
every other field that I have with dummy data in here.

37
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:35.860
Up until the financials part and the financials part is is going to be way down here.

38
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.110
So that will be on that page and depending on how much did you insert that page might actually be on

39
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.050
page 30 or 40 or whatever it is.

40
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.560
So this template here is 60 pages.

41
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.900
If you have a lot more data and be close to 100 pages or if you have less obviously be closer to 30

42
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.110
pages if you cut a bunch of stuff to each their own.

43
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.530
So again I'll go in fast forward mode.

44
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.460
I'll update everything up until financials.

45
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.180
And you don't have to watch this you can skip it.

46
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.740
Otherwise I will see you in the next lecture where we're going to talk in great detail is the fun part

47
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.280
about how the financial side next

48
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.310
for

49
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.440
all

50
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.960
all

51
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.950
all

52
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.820
you

53
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.720
do

54
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.440
you

55
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.880
are

56
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:26.650
some

57
00:09:49.800 --> 00:10:01.650
your

58
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:15.870
you

59
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.580
or

60
00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.330
you

61
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:41.290
okay if you're still with me we're going to talk about financials in the next lecture.

62
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:47.950
And just for fun I had to go back up here right click and then go update field and it should update

63
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:48.890
everything.

64
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.640
And if you changed around some of your titles a little bit that should update as well.

65
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.860
And if it doesn't just update feel again and then say update entire table.

66
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.090
It'll get rid of.

67
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.140
Let's say there's a couple of line items you got rid of that are headings like outsource partners or

68
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.310
board advisors or employees four through 10 for example.

69
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.950
It would get rid of all that stuff.

70
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.880
And so this is all updated with all the stuff I just pasted in.

71
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:22.960
We're up to page 27 now and it's just dummy data so it will probably be longer than yours if you include

72
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.930
every field.

73
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:24.860
Everyone's different.

74
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.680
So in the next section what we'll do is we'll go through financials together thanks.
