00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.850
This part of the course is optional and only applies if you want to create a presentation or presentation

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.580
slides based on your answers to the questions.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:16.620
In steps 1 through 12 of this course in terms of the what why and how of creating your final final presentation

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.540
slides output.

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.080
What I'll do is I'll kick it off of the what.

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.230
What are we going to learn.

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.900
Well if we click on a final output button here called presentation slides we see that there are 10 slides

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.040
that have been automatically created for us and this 10 slide format is what works.

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.960
If you're meeting with potential investors business partners or venture capital firms and I know that

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.570
this works because it's based on the many meetings that I've had with investors when I worked in venture

11
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.290
capital and I've been able to raise money for my startups using this 10 slide format as well.

12
00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:00.690
Now the point of a meeting with using these 10 slides is to get the potential customer so to speak or

13
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.260
investors just interested in your business model so that they can ask to read your business plan.

14
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.500
Or if you wanted to raise capital it kind of gets you a first meeting and then if they like what they

15
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.750
see you'll get a second meeting that sort of thing.

16
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.960
So less is always more when it comes to presentation slides.

17
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.310
And if you're curious how to present to potential investors then you can click on this resources link

18
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:35.340
here to watch a presentation that I gave to ASH or HCC Paris MBA students on how to present to investors

19
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.920
and this is all optional of course.

20
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.110
Let's move on to why.

21
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.070
Why do I bother including this extra bonus optional section on presentation slides.

22
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.260
I included it because I realized while I was making this course and this Excel template that the questions

23
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.430
asked that you answered contained the inputs to all 10 of these slides.

24
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.350
So I thought it would be helpful and value added to include this view as well.

25
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.000
And you can even include these 10 slides in the appendix part of your final business plan.

26
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:15.110
Output which I explain how to do in this section of the course called Creating your financial part of

27
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.350
the click creating your final business model output.

28
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.690
Lastly how how are we going to complete your final presentation slides together well if you click on

29
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.130
the final output presentation slides button.

30
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.110
You will see that if you answer the questions in steps 1 through 12 your answers show up here on the

31
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.300
right side in the white shaded cells the middle blue shaded cells pulls data from my sample questions

32
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.820
from the shark virtual reality questions OK.

33
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:54.180
As you'll see that in your 10 presentation slides on the right side here that the data is all hyperlinked

34
00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.200
hence the blue underlined text and I architected this tab this way so that you can always click on the

35
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.540
text to go back to where in the course you document your answers just in case you wanted to make any

36
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.710
changes.

37
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.100
Now in the rest of the current section what I'll do is I'll explain how to access the templates that

38
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.880
I created for you so that you can pick a PowerPoint template that you want to use and then what I'll

39
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.750
do is I'll show you how to copy from this presentation slides tab here in Excel and how to pay special

40
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.020
into the PowerPoint template that you will use so that the formatting looks amazing.

41
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.470
Thanks.
