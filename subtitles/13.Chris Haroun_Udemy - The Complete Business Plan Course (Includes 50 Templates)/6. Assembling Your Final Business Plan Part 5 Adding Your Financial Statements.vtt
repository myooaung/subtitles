00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.800
Let's see what's next.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.810
Looks good to me.

3
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.230
All right.

4
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.090
And you can always put comments at the top here you can say below is our annual income statement knows

5
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.490
the trend in whatever if you want.

6
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.400
OK so in Italy that's to get rid of that would you print the annual income statement to cut

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.670
paste.

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.950
Look at that.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.020
That is awesome.

10
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.960
All right.

11
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.120
And we're going to go here.

12
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.990
Pay special

13
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.390
good luck.

14
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.190
That's fantastic.

15
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.040
And then what I can do is I can paint brush.

16
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.590
Or another way is to go here to shadow there good looking great man.

17
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.040
That's what I'm talking about.

18
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.170
And school look beautiful once we turn off that little paragraph mark there too.

19
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.830
Nice.

20
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.630
Really really good looking.

21
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.180
That's a good looking chart there.

22
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.310
Go back here.

23
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.810
Get rid of page mark.

24
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.940
Now we do quarterly Balochi.

25
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.180
And what we'll do is delete.

26
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.810
That's chance.

27
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.870
Get rid of that.

28
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.250
Copy this again cut.

29
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.190
Go back here.

30
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.260
There we go.

31
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.020
Need is that.

32
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.710
I love that.

33
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.050
OK hopefully all this data fits.

34
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.910
Anyway back here.

35
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.990
We're going to go paste the score here.

36
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.070
The second line paste special as a picture good good it fit.

37
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.300
And you can make your margins a little bit wide if you want to.

38
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.930
And some of you might be using full scapular that legal long sheets that you had on final exams makes

39
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.330
me nervous.

40
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.080
Has it come about.

41
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.780
But you know I'm talking about you can use that if you want or you can just hide certain columns whatever

42
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.070
you're called.

43
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.370
All right.

44
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.410
Oh I almost forgot the shadow picture format.

45
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.960
And you can do this all at the end.

46
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.370
Right.

47
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.330
So actually I'm not going to shower with the rest of them to show you a trick on how to do it faster.

48
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.840
OK.

49
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.070
We'll come back to shattering later.

50
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.310
OK.

51
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.220
Next up we've got the annual balance sheet.

52
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.610
Get rid of this or just I mean to replace it with other.

53
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.310
I mean did cut and that's going to highlight that one.

54
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.560
I'll show you.

55
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.260
There we go.

56
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.100
Good copy.

57
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.370
Never cut copy pace.

58
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.130
Meshell good.

59
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.270
All right we're cooking.

60
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.830
Nice.

61
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.850
All right.

62
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.430
And then here get rid of this.

63
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.590
Now we're doing quarterly cash flow statement

64
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.530
cut.

65
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.120
Remembering to come back and paint brush in minute was quietly there copy don't cut copy.

66
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.410
Second line has to be consistent and obsolete.

67
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.340
So it doesn't push this.

68
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.890
Next Page pastes picture good looks good up.

69
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.590
It's not perfect.

70
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.730
So here's what we can do.

71
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.250
If you want you can make this a little bit smaller there or make it a little bit wider here so I can

72
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.020
make a little wider outlooks for us.

73
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.100
And yeah that will impact all of these but I don't care because I already copy those copy again.

74
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.560
Get rid of that paste special as a picture.

75
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.300
I'm such an idiot.

76
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.010
I'm not going to edit that out even.

77
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.060
OK.

78
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.930
So I can highlight all of this again or I can go it or it recognize.

79
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.300
OK.

80
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.980
Copy paste as a picture.

81
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.630
Good.

82
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.710
OK that's better.

83
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.890
Great.

84
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.480
OK.

85
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.250
And we'll come back and we'll shatter that later.

86
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.410
GARRETT That's bad I would swear now on the cash flow statements cuts.

87
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.350
And then I'm going to paste this here.

88
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.820
Now this tagging is making sense.

89
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.140
This is the last one.

90
00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:03.860
Get a copy and then I can go here and then I'm going to paste as a picture worked.

91
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.800
Fantastic.

92
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.460
All right.

93
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.900
Great.

94
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.340
And you don't have to mention the currency because at the very top here of the financial section and

95
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.210
I will shadow it a second I promise.

96
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:21.180
But here at the top of the financial section you'll see almost there all data is in Gibraltar pounces.

97
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.340
Turn that off now.

98
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.660
OK great.

99
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.320
OK good looking good.

100
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.490
All right.

101
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.210
And I will fix the footer in a second.

102
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.770
I mean the head.

103
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.050
Yeah.

104
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.500
I mean I'll change back to the other sections Akten in a second you'll see what I mean.

105
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.840
Just to make it more narrow instead of wide like this.

106
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.260
OK.

107
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.620
Now here's where you do.

108
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.110
So I get a double click on this picture painter so I can paint multiple times.

109
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.180
I just double click there

110
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.360
one shadow to show how fun is this.

111
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.550
Three shadow if you can't read all that stuff you can always just just take a certain year and make

112
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.140
it wider.

113
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.620
The image for Shadow was foreshadowing.

114
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.160
I know that will stop them.

115
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.010
OK we're done.

116
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.070
Good.

117
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.730
All right.

118
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.910
Great.

119
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.490
We are done with this.

120
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.220
Looks great.

121
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.590
So amazing.

122
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.750
Look at that.

123
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.780
Incredible All right.

124
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.490
So cool.

125
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.520
So what I'll do is in the next lecture I will show you the appendix and I will put it back.

126
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.210
I'll keep you can either keep it in landscape mode if you have wide dependencies which you probably

127
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.900
don't you probably have resume's which are more porous oriented but in the next lecture I'll show you

128
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.750
how to change this section out a new section break so we can have portrait instead of landscape and

129
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.360
notice that landscape didn't impact the portrait up here is a new section.

130
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.940
OK so again the next Lesher I'll explain how to do the appendix next.
