1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,030
You know it looks a little bit off to me there is just a shadow.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,520
That's fine.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,340
OK.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,680
All right.

5
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,850
I think we're done now with this.

6
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,660
You know we're done.

7
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:07,940
We're done.

8
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,650
OK good.

9
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,620
Great.

10
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:09,980
All right.

11
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,690
Let's go back home and see what is next.

12
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:12,990
OK.

13
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:18,770
We talked about all of this oh this was a pain the next to line me up on the outside.

14
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,500
All this is here.

15
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,610
These here these are lines.

16
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:34,140
So I grouped everything together and I create these little lines here individually which was disastrous.

17
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,370
So if I were to go group and then ungroup and then I drew them on there.

18
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,030
And the reason I drew them on there is because I wouldn't have.

19
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,140
These are all formulas here and I wanted that to be shown in the background.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,900
And there is a way to put formulas on text but it's not perfect.

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,520
It's kind of buggy.

22
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,080
All right.

23
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,220
So what it did was this I just drew this.

24
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,800
And once you create one the rest are pretty easy so you learn little tricks hit shift control commands.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,230
And then when I drag it down it's going to make a copy.

26
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,260
Take your finger off you there and over and over and over again create multiple ones.

27
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,790
And then when you move things it's shift.

28
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:20,070
So it'll only go left right or up or down but not in between diagonal and they were off there.

29
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,140
And that's how you line things and you want to zoom way way in as well.

30
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,460
When you do that just get it perfect.

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,660
Come talking like an artist.

32
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,030
Now it's just software it's all I like.

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,900
I always have.

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,040
All right.

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,030
And then here just all these these here are the things the first video of each one of the different

36
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,590
sections in the course.

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,950
And so I just read up on my website which I got over Squarespace you Squarespace beacon can it's it

38
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,350
makes it really easy to create web sites from scratch.

39
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,870
And that is it.

40
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,400
And this here by the way that's just text.

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:04,210
And I put that there because if it takes a while for for a page to load an Excel tab to load them what

42
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,100
you do is Yep I threw this text here just to.

43
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,310
So I want to say hey you're still with me right.

44
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,280
That sort of thing.

45
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,080
And I made it.

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,420
I started with 2.1.

47
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,340
This is some Mike's site.

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,200
So we see they start with higher numbers like you never start with one point out people like oh my god

49
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,240
it could be buggy.

50
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,090
And you start with 2.0 like oh 2.1 is good enough.

51
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,420
It's a minor upgrade as well.

52
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:25,840
All right.

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,650
At least I'm honest about being on the call.

54
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,000
All right.

55
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,900
And that is that.

56
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,130
And this year what I did was I disabled this.

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,250
I just made it a little bit transparent because when you're in the first tab you can't go back anywhere

58
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,270
right.

59
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,850
And so you can do is just get rid of the text there so we can actually do something with the box.

60
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:52,920
So when you click there signs that are box appear there are picture formats you kick it and then what

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,990
I did was I went to transparency here and I made it less transparent.

62
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,250
Instead of being like that I didn't want I want to press it and say hey it was going to go back man.

63
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,010
And then the very last happens while I did that so you can't you can't go forward.

64
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,630
And so I click presentations has to live here right there see.

65
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,630
And go back home.

66
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,050
And we are now done with the with the men is great.

67
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,290
OK good.

68
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,880
And one thing I'm going to show you and I know you're probably really curious about this.

69
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,390
Is this going to show you this.

70
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:33,430
And after I show you this what I'll do is over and give you your story on how I do this data here.

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,420
This one is tricky.

72
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,450
And so this here basically you've got it.

73
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,300
And don't try to recreate this just use what I have for you here.

74
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,140
Can I just copy and paste it right for me.

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,170
The way you do is it's all pattern recognition with this stuff.

76
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,830
So you go to HIDDINS speedometer or Odama.

77
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,860
I don't know what it is.

78
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,370
And then you're going to have I removed certain labels just you can ignore that there.

79
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,150
But this is where the needle is set up.

80
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,140
And then I've got different different dial labels right.

81
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:15,420
So if I wanted to actually Control-C and if I were to pace labels over here then the labels would appear

82
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:24,140
here I think let we see actually home here paste here Kenmare came here.

83
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,440
Hold on a second here.

84
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,020
Yeah I must've deleted it.

85
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,040
But they all show up but showed up on here all of the labels.

86
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,150
Anyway it's fun.

87
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,070
And then basically it used to go 10:23 for all the way up.

88
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,840
And then what I did was I found that there was a formatting issue so I just created and pasted special

89
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,900
numbers up.

90
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,710
OK.

91
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:55,650
And then here just play around with this and then just copy what I have because what happens is the

92
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,610
needle goes up based on different numbers.

93
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,280
It's too hard for me to explain but I went to total progress here.

94
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,070
So watch this Master-Maid he told us it commands and you can always just command and then the open square

95
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,440
brackets are called Square back and said jump right there.

96
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,380
OK.

97
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,620
So here I am here so I can hard code here 50 percent point five over.

98
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,420
I can't remember and will go back there and I'll show you what happened this could run off of that.

99
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,810
So a hidden speedometer.

100
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,310
I guess I was point five percent.

101
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:30,200
Chris 50 percent want to go here.

102
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,270
There you go.

103
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,220
There you go.

104
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,040
All right good.

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:41,960
So it's just basically all this did was it drives off of total progress which is over here and it controls

106
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,970
a couple of times.

107
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,660
And what I did was I named this cell here.

108
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:52,310
And that's how it knows to refer to that I could have said go to G 11 and whatever but then I'll never

109
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,830
remember what Jila means.

110
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:01,140
But I call it total progress so I got to create another one hearing and say in when you do this.

111
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,620
It has actually you got to first of all click here and it can't be a reserved word you can use the words

112
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,420
already been done and you can have spaces the way computer code works is all Pramer always have to be

113
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,280
attached kind of so hi.

114
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,230
Hi there like this got here and sometimes it doesn't work.

115
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,190
And if it's being a pain in the neck and this happens sometimes you go up instead of being all the name

116
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,020
here.

117
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,660
What you do is Excel treats it like a formula c Go here to define name and get to work so I guess I'll

118
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,170
go Hi there.

119
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,540
OK.

120
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,050
And watch this.

121
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,960
It'll work it'll show there.

122
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,830
OK anon.

123
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,310
For those you using Windows.

124
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,730
This probably won't be an issue for you.

125
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:40,230
OK.

126
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,220
So hi there shows up.

127
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,970
So if I were right equals.

128
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,990
Hi there.

129
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,510
Good.

130
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,060
Then it knows that.

131
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,970
And this is really powerful when you're looking at financial statements.

132
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,340
We look at financial statements in this course and we had the red and green different colors.

133
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,750
So basically turn's formulas in English is kind of like COBOL which is computer oriented business logic

134
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,130
language.

135
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,680
But for myself to program this stuff.

136
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,340
All right.

137
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,480
So whenever I change this to what will be shown over here.

138
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,770
Great.

139
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,550
All right good.

140
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,010
Great.

141
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:20,130
So now you kind of understand this put on yourself just play around these numbers here if you want and

142
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:26,010
then I think if you were to add numbers here or one of these columns Ill add the labels back here if

143
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,090
you want look again.

144
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:27,860
All right.

145
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,420
So we are now done with that.

146
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,410
And what do we show you next is just to keep it consistent.

147
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,010
Do these and then I'll do these here OK and then we'll be done with them.

148
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:47,070
But the many completely and part me you want to make sure your menu is perfect though because the worst

149
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,660
thing can happen I've learned by failing and I made a course last year I had to go on every single tab

150
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,270
and change one little thing and a million times so make sure the last thing you do is you put this on.

151
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,190
It's like yeah OK.

152
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,960
Right.

153
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:08,040
So these here refer to different step status so basically member step 1 all this stuff.

154
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,200
If I drive up here and grouped it up or whatever.

155
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,910
Step One two three four Yeah.

156
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,050
All the way in here.

157
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,520
So this is step 13 status.

158
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:22,290
And that's all it is and I formatted it in such a way that it's on two different lines and I'll teach

159
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,540
you that in a second.

160
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:31,020
So if I go to command or control or whatever and then openings and close brackets here.

161
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,640
Then it jumps back to here.

162
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,260
OK.

163
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,980
So we're on step 1 tab.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,500
OK.

165
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,960
And then what I did was I grabbed it from down here.

166
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:48,430
So ignore everything else just look at Wilderness and this here is named step 1 status.

167
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:56,640
That's the name and that's how every single page here all of these pages know to go right here.

168
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,960
They all know that step 1 status is the content Cerci here.

169
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,440
OK good.

170
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,080
Now I'm going to hits back and work that way or probably not.

171
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:07,420
Yeah.

172
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,710
Well I.

173
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,610
So I went back there so again the use on my screen is getting done here.

174
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,320
Sort of that knows whatever.

175
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,840
All right so.

176
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,900
And basically what happens is this here is a formula and I get the form.

177
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,160
And so when you're working with formulas I know it might seem a bit intimidating but I promise you gets

178
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:29,790
a lot easier.

179
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:37,230
Caja what you do is you always start with one bracket and you ignore everything else so I'm not going

180
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,570
to I'm going to escape to cancel this out here.

181
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,710
We always start like really basic like that.

182
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,780
Oh I start with some.

183
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,910
And then you build on the outside of his escape.

184
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,580
So a with that is OK.

185
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,670
All right.

186
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:59,470
So what I did here is this is counting what percent I'm done of that step in the flags as well.

187
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,190
And so what I did was remember here when I said you can override me over by clicking here.

188
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:14,750
So if you click here this will change override to true can overrides on other tab but basically make

189
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,670
nullify all this crap here.

190
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,790
So this is just if then logic is really cool.

191
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:28,000
So if this manual override button is pushed meaning it's true then just make it 100 percent we're not.

192
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,690
But if it doesn't then do something else.

193
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,730
And if it doesn't it's basically their main option.

194
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:44,250
But if it if it's not at 100 percent then execute this formal here and ignore this if everything I throw

195
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,570
if err on the outside of a lot of things just in case you change something and then you're like hey

196
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,020
what's going on.

197
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,820
And this is just doesn't work.

198
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,100
I just have it kind of going blank like it.

199
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,060
So always throw if error on after you've done everything.

200
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:06,260
And so what's going on is inside here it's basically just calculating what percent you're done.

201
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:14,620
This step and so if I get rid of that manual overdrive override which is 100 percent it'll disappear.

202
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,290
And then the calculation will occur at 0 percent.

203
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,420
And by the way it's basically saying well if there's no cells filled in right.

204
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,040
If you haven't answered all of the required questions remember some require some optional.

205
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:35,480
If you haven't done that then it's going to calculate it to be less than a hundred percent.

206
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,460
And before I show you the formula there because I know I probably confused people because I'm not that

207
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,730
good at explaining this.

208
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,260
I want to just match one more thing.

209
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,480
You know I had it on two different lines.

210
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,900
Zero percent and zero flags.

211
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,260
Well this here if you use a character called 10 char 10 it basically it's like a paragraph mark.

212
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,520
When you're hitting enter in Microsoft Word it's pretty cool.

213
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,430
OK.

214
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,890
Now what you do is going to build in the slope.

215
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,240
Here I am telling you I am not doing that.

216
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:03,910
OK.

217
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:10,040
So I'm going to go here and I usually hide stuff that's formula based because I don't want the student

218
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,270
to erase it or get confused or just you know in a day with too much stuff.

219
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,970
OK.

220
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,790
So what I did was here I created a bunch of things here and a lot of really smart much smarter developers

221
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,940
and I do like to use these big arrays which is kind of like databases within fields where to keep it

222
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,820
simple.

223
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,730
So did he was here member here if it's optional I said you don't have to fill it out.

224
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,480
So I did this.

225
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,260
That's pretty cool feature I just learned it.

226
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:45,960
It's called is number and is number is basically saying within this box here Deayton search for the

227
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,400
word optional.

228
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,490
If there is the word optional then return the word true.

229
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,380
That's it.

230
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,650
That's all it is.

231
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,730
That's all it is.

232
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,730
And if it's true then make this zero if it's false.

233
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,400
Make it one.

234
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,630
So that means because you haven't answered anything yet here I just know for a fact because this is

235
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,580
a blank template.

236
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,280
This is what is personal from of course.

237
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,960
So if I did all this stuff here then that's 18 K there's 18 once.

238
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:19,490
That means there's 18 of these that have to be answered that are not optional.

239
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,490
So it'll go to 70 and if I put the word optional in somewhere here.

240
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,100
So I just sneak it in here see how that works.

241
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,700
Optional

242
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,510
see if it picks up that no.

243
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,830
Optional it has to be a word or at the beginning.

244
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,280
Let's see here option.

245
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,370
Oh that's why.

246
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,190
Oh I was smart.

247
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,120
See that there dude.

248
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:52,780
OK.

249
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,650
I threw the open square bracket because I got messed up before I threw the word optional somewhere else.

250
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,330
Me try to fool myself.

251
00:13:59,340 --> 00:13:59,640
All right.

252
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:06,870
So if I had a little wash this little square bracket here to the beginning that should go to true.

253
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,450
So watch this.

254
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,230
I wonder if it's going to be caps sensitive or not.

255
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:14,950
There you go.

256
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,340
Yeah.

257
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,960
See you.

258
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,450
OK.

259
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,150
That's how you do it.

260
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,280
Now it says 17 buckets.

261
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,290
So all it does it counts up.

262
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:27,850
And then what I did here was these here are just formulas you know if if that what you saw over there

263
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,860
was zero that make it no otherwise.

264
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,570
Yes it is required.

265
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,290
And then we just did a count of the yeses here and them.

266
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:40,180
That's how we did the math to figure out what percent we have finished of this section or not.

267
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:48,040
And then for the flags all I did here was I basically said well if over here they select come back to

268
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,580
this question then put it in the number one over here.

269
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,250
So watch this

270
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,520
the number one will go there and when the number one is there then I put conditional formatting in.

271
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,910
That's just number one there otherwise is blank conditional formatting is here a conditional format

272
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,170
I don't jump around a bit but it's easy to explain a conditional formatting basically will it'll make

273
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:19,080
you ill make it a different color that box or put it in like a character or a cool thing like like a

274
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,870
flag.

275
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,590
So here are they.

276
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:22,920
That's right.

277
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,430
It was a new feature and they wanted to show off to it's on the Home tab.

278
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,880
It's actually true it's a marketing thing.

279
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:28,330
OK.

280
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,310
So basically what you do is you can insert a new rule.

281
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,450
I'm going to go to manage rules here and show you what the flag looks like.

282
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,890
So here is icon set.

283
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,350
OK.

284
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,930
And then what you do is you just grab that.

285
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,720
You the rule here but so if it's greater than zero which means it's one that make a flag.

286
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:56,190
If I want to I can change this to that and then it would show that instead and I used to use this a

287
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:01,560
lot there is this a lot when I was amental portfolio and I have my own phone whatever and I kind of

288
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,120
created my you know my my own portfolio manager system which is in another course my whatever.

289
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,310
OK good.

290
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:13,140
So I think I explained the red flag thing just counting the number instances of one.

291
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:19,470
And I explained the menu at the bottom there and if it's complicated what I said there and I know I

292
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,300
threw a lot at you there.

293
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,180
Then all you got to do is just build upon it slowly.

294
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,780
OK.

295
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:31,170
Apparently I've done native 6 percent so I was messed up.

296
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,990
Yeah.

297
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,710
Anyway so it just kind of go through here.

298
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,360
And I encourage you to just delete things and see what happens.

299
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,220
And the reason I had flag and then asked is because I said well if it's that one flag is not grammatically

300
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,160
correct say that one flag.

301
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,690
So anyway that's why I did there that's that.

302
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:50,920
OK.

303
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,790
I want to make this course perfect for you.

304
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,440
So do I care.

305
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:54,930
All right.

306
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,910
And that is that and then I added a bunch of filters here.

307
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:04,140
But let me let me go back here to the to the Home tab because I think you've talked about.

308
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,890
OK good.

309
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,340
We're done with all this except for one more thing I want to show you this and I got this.

310
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,900
I used my complete crypto course is well.

311
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,940
And so what's thrown here is text.

312
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,720
And so before I show you how to cheat how to change what's here.

313
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,500
I want to first of all you how to change what's in this box.

314
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,110
Because you'll see it just looks like text is confusing.

315
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,540
So what we do is we go to

316
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:37,150
data data validation and then we pick it from a box you see here.

317
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,570
So it's on another tab called Master-Maid which I had I just had it for you here.

318
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,870
It's basically saying get a list and you got a choose list.

319
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:53,950
That's the only way to choose the dropdown now to get a list from this part here and show it in the

320
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,710
drop down box.

321
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,510
That's it.

322
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,500
And I could change I have alerts as well and put messages and errors but I don't want do that.

323
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,850
It's become a tech support nightmare.

324
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,600
OK.

325
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,600
And that's it.

326
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:11,410
And so what happens is you click here and then drop down here and you could have done this here if you

327
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,570
are a developer you can add this just to search online how to add this tab.

328
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,530
You don't see it.

329
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,440
But I could have also done the dropdown list as well.

330
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,670
Combo Box but it's a pain in the neck because a lot of times you have to use to use macros in.

331
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,710
I don't want to you know I don't want anybody to have security issues or viruses.

332
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,280
So.

333
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:38,720
So what you do is you just choose them here and then based on what's in here then this changes.

334
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,500
And this here is a hyperlink.

335
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:50,400
So right there it's basically saying get a hyperlink of whatever is in this menu here and whatever's

336
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,360
in that menu actually comes from here.

337
00:18:53,830 --> 00:19:02,070
So what we'll do is we'll go to the master menu here and then I will you can you can trace back where

338
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,070
the words coming from.

339
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,080
OK so Master menu here and you just use the command.

340
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,070
Open square box called square brackets.

341
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,650
So what we're doing is we're grabbing the data from here.

342
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,590
So it's basically looking up the view look up basically does this.

343
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,850
It looks a bunch of that and finds a match in a different column.

344
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:28,970
So we look up is basically coming over here and it's looking at all this stuff here at age 3 to our

345
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,550
two one for cash.

346
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,600
Massive amount at age 3.

347
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,750
And this is how we did the flags as well on the show later and all those custom links based on what

348
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,490
country you're from in hyperlinks.

349
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,180
So all I did was I got all this stuff here.

350
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,280
Kids look up and all that stuff it is saying go to the third column and find a match for B-6.

351
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:46,680
OK.

352
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,780
And so click here.

353
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,040
And then what I do is the first one always I make it just dummy data.

354
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,390
So I always say Click here for whatever.

355
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:01,030
And then what happens is click here will automatically throw in there just the default nothing.

356
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,150
Police like the resource and that looks like this over here.

357
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,570
Please like the resources.

358
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,410
And that if it's how to raise money for start startup it goes here.

359
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,170
That's it.

360
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,140
And that's just a youtube link.

361
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,040
It's just hyperlink.

362
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,580
And then you can click through here to understand where I got the information from.

363
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,640
I put all my links here just play around with this and it can play around with that's probably the best

364
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,820
way to explain.

365
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,350
All right.

366
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:33,030
So I'm going to stop and continue in the next lecture but this is a two part crescendo fishing up.

367
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:37,860
We've finished all of this here and then I'll talk about the stuff below here in the next lecture.

368
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,210
Thanks.
