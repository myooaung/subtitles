1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.470
Please click on the button called outputs here in step 4 and we will see exactly what we types earlier

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.790
and how it comes through here.

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.290
OK.

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:20.860
So I showed you how to make these images in the previous lecture but what you do now is you select which

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.080
management team members you want to appear on your final output for your business plan in order.

6
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.940
And so based on the names that you entered in earlier you can select them here and if you selected what

7
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.370
their title was their title will appear there as well.

8
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.340
I'll give you an example.

9
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.580
So for these people here all fictional.

10
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.980
I've got their title and their name.

11
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.860
If you did not have their titles in their name will show up only and vice versa as well so if you find

12
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.440
that this stuff is blank just go back to the previous step please steps in the course and complete the

13
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.680
appropriate data.

14
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:06.370
And if you're not sure where a data item might be then you can always click on here and find the appropriate

15
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.980
item so for sample day this is the sample that I put in.

16
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.800
So for example if I go to Sable first born advisor's bio I think this guy's name was Gates Bill

17
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.190
C. Gates William sort.

18
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.680
Yes.

19
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.620
And that's what that person looks like.

20
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.690
Please don't sue me Bill Gates.

21
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.540
Anyway let's go back here to it to management I think you get the idea but just select and whatever

22
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.200
you select here will automatically populate whatever bio you created there.

23
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.810
So for example if I were to go here.

24
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:50.300
Well it's sort of but if I were to go here and then click on Ryan not Reynolds then right here you'll

25
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.790
see that Ryan Reynolds bio and this is just dummy data.

26
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.410
It would appear there.

27
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.040
Tony shark go back here.

28
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.730
And then by the same token you do the same thing as well here.

29
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.940
So just select your employee and then whatever you select will automatically update the bio here if

30
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.660
it exists.

31
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.230
Otherwise it won't you'll have to go and actually update yourself and get great.

32
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.670
So just go down through the rest of this output document here and then select all the names in the order

33
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.330
you want them to appear and then you can go back and copy and paste the images here if you want to spell

34
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.970
out your call.

35
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.790
And you'll see why all this stuff well we'll make a lot of sense when we put together a final output

36
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.430
and or presentation slides as well.

37
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.120
If you want to do that and that that's obviously that's that's optional.

38
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.990
And here is Scarlett Johansson who's worked at the following companies.

39
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.380
And then here I have just other employees and this is all just dummy data based on who I picked.

40
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.650
Right.

41
00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.180
So if I were to select this person completely random but it will say the employee number here and that's

42
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.690
all just dummy data.

43
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.740
OK.

44
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.090
And then what happens is after you're done with your employees.

45
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.470
Right.

46
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.180
And I include up to 10 employees here and obviously you know have to include all of them.

47
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.830
You get down to the board advisors section and you don't have to selecting and here that pulls it off

48
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.990
automatically.

49
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.230
OK.

50
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.370
So here is your first born advisor if you entered them your second board advisor and your third board

51
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.290
advisor.

52
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.920
Let's say you're not sure where to get the third board advisors data from what you and I know that if

53
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.230
we go back here we can enter in information about our third board vizor and come sharper here.

54
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.170
BLITZER You're not sure where it's from.

55
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.780
You can if you want.

56
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.660
You can copy this hit escape to get out of that cell.

57
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.940
Get out of it and you can paste it here.

58
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.170
Hit enter and it will take you back to the third board adviser's name right here.

59
00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:03.920
So if I were to type in this sample and or name three then that will appear automatically over on on

60
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.970
this tab for our management output section or part of our business plan right here see sample adviser.

61
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.590
So I made a typo there and stuff but it's fine.

62
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.730
But I think you get the idea in here that the buyer will appear as well.

63
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.990
And this is just dummy data.

64
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.490
Here it comes over automatically and you can copy and paste the images which I explained in the previous

65
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.290
lecture and bring Laura here if you want and this will be really powerful later when we create our final

66
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.210
outputs can look awesome.

67
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.020
You'll love it.

68
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.550
Let's say you don't have border advisers in your business.

69
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.310
You don't want them.

70
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.380
So I wanted to customize this for everybody in the world.

71
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:43.410
So if you click here what that will do is turn off that page turn off turn on little button.

72
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.270
I had fun with that.

73
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.830
OK.

74
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.800
And then down here for the outsource part I wrote these we just are just pulled automatically.

75
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.670
That's my first outsource partner second third and fourth I used army days that's all the same person's

76
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.330
name.

77
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.400
And if you entered and these fields will automatically populated but let's say you don't want to have

78
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.850
outsourced partners or list them.

79
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.740
You don't to listen your business plans click that.

80
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.440
And that will turn it off.

81
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.930
And then here if you wrote something about employee recruiting strategy it'll show up here or this will

82
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.290
be the message if you didn't.

83
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.630
Interesting in.

84
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.700
Same thing with employee is incentivized action sort of word incentivising up here as well.

85
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.030
Yetta's otherwise spellcheck would have said no and then just additional information here.

86
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:37.970
If you want to get a higher level look at any particular section that has multiple parts you can always

87
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:38.660
click this.

88
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.780
It'll take a second it's kind of data intensive and then it'll update and give it a second here.

89
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.990
OK good.

90
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.890
And it looks like this.

91
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.830
Right so here we go from a high level perspective.

92
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.510
You can open this up if you want the menu to appear again or you have just a little sub menu there.

93
00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:05.120
And then we've got the four sections here within this section here of the dashboard.

94
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.050
And this will all update as well.

95
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:14.060
Now one thing I want to mention is if you use this feature and you close these these these boxes here

96
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.770
and open them up whatever.

97
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:24.360
I just want you to know that what happens is the images might not be be hidden.

98
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.370
And the reason that happens if you care I'm not sure if you do if you don't just skip the rest of this

99
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:35.450
Lesher please but it's because when you put in images in general if you need to right click on them

100
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.560
if you want to do this at all completely random are optional.

101
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.380
But if you right click on it.

102
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:49.590
And then here you select Format pictures and then properties you can say move in size it with cells

103
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.610
if you wants.

104
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.980
OK.

105
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:57.170
And this stuff doesn't really matter here but it'll move them if and when you get the idea.

106
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.610
OK.

107
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.810
So let's go back now to our management outputs.

108
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.140
And I think we have everything answered here which is great and this will come in very handy when we

109
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:14.740
create her final document over here which is the management section there's a lot still to cover.

110
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.330
And again we can just get rid of the sections here boarded by outsource partners.

111
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:25.700
If these are not helpful to list in our in our business plan so if you have any questions please let

112
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.120
me know.

113
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.860
Otherwise I will see you in step five we're making great progress here.

114
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.200
Thanks.
