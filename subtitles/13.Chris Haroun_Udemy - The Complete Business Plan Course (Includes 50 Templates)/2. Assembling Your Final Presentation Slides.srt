1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,530
If you're creating slides as well then please click this button here presentation slides.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,860
And when you're finished this click this Ill say 100 percent complete.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,550
Since this is optional it has no impact at all on the final total here.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:22,840
But here's what you need to so the best way to create a slide deck is to make 10 slides that are simple.

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,980
Less is more.

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,150
And I've listed them here.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,310
These are my 10 samples here.

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,840
BlueShield like usual.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,790
And this is just a guideline and I have the slide numbers.

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,890
OK so it's very simplistic.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,040
I've got the title slide which is just the name of the company and the slogan.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,490
And if you did that if you enter all that stuff will automatically flow through here.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,950
The second slide is a picture of the product.

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,800
If you don't have this picture push the price you can delete the slide and make your slide presentation

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,430
only nine slots and I'll show you where.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:01,310
Download the predations act the template your management and board advisor slide can look something

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,040
like this.

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,630
Three employees two advisors less or more whatever you want to do.

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:11,440
And I had this automatically flow through to hear if you do that if mission for slide is the industry

20
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,120
problem.

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,260
And if you wrote the answer you probably will show up here.

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,440
And then the fifth is Inchy solution which basically says why your product or services based company

23
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,950
fixes the problem and it will flow through right here.

24
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,290
If you did that then we have in the future milestone is the next slide.

25
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,180
And then the seventh slide is a total just one market sentence.

26
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,150
And this just pulls directly from earlier in the course.

27
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,450
This might be a bit too long though and so I'll leave it up to you if you want to make this shorter.

28
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,420
OK but I'll have this sentence appear here automatically.

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,070
OK.

30
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:52,970
And you can always click these blue hyperlinks to go directly to the source other than the second Slide

31
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,700
8 is financials.

32
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,830
And this is blank only because I'm using directly from your financial model I don't have one for me

33
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,570
here and this will just pull information from here directly and I'll show you how to get all this information

34
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,240
is it.

35
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,510
Then we have a slide on the competition.

36
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,590
And basically I wrote this here and I've actually created one for you here.

37
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,200
It will pull in all the information for you but I'll get to that in a second.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,260
So I think a lot more sense as I can make this as simple as possible.

39
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,900
Then I've got contact details and I'll just put in your contact details.

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,610
If you have them.

41
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:36,150
And so as you scroll up here and I can show you where to get the template and if you click here this

42
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:43,310
will go to your company name if you click here this will go to your company description or service product

43
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,110
description.

44
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,650
If you click here it'll take you to what goes here which is the picture of your product.

45
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:55,240
If you entered that show click here and because there's no picture in this sample here it'll link to

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,970
nothing which is right here but it tells us look it let's go back here to.

47
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:08,530
And so if we click here it'll take us to where you wrote about your management team.

48
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,300
If you click here it'll take you to where the problem is.

49
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,900
And Step Six click there and it will go there in a second there's a lot of detail in the spreadsheet.

50
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,210
OK.

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,200
Right here.

52
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,400
And it's tagged.

53
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:25,440
Let's go back to the same thing can be said about the entry solution.

54
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,250
If you click on it here.

55
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,250
Future milestone.

56
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,170
Click here we'll take you there.

57
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,550
Total just market same thing will take you there and then financials.

58
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,480
I'm going to show you how it is.

59
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,140
And second cat and then competition I wrote a sentence for you automatically and you can click there

60
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,690
to go back to that slide here.

61
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,910
Or if you want you can scroll over here to see what I wrote for you here.

62
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,150
OK.

63
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,850
Both ways work in this make more sense than act and then just contact details and you can click Bisson

64
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,900
it goes directly to where your contact details are if you'd entered in a phone number and also the e-mail

65
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,370
address.

66
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,700
It will automatically be populated here for you.

67
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,610
It's the code there of the code for the formula.

68
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,650
OK.

69
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:16,000
Now I want to show you how to complete this so what you can do is click here to go to my Web site and

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,040
you can download a number of different templates whichever one you think looks nice just for your company.

71
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,090
There are 10 blank slides and there's a bunch of them.

72
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,310
Can you can also see it attached to this lecture as well.

73
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,090
And here's how it's going to work once you download the template you want to use and I've got a sample

74
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,580
one here.

75
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,670
It's 10 slides first one is a cover page.

76
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,200
And as I run through them you could see here there's a description telling you how to complete each

77
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,220
slide and it's pretty simplistic.

78
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,830
And I think if you can't see this then just click down here to make sure that you see that bottom part.

79
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,620
And you may even have to go to View and show the bottom the notes in the bottom.

80
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,140
See here.

81
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:04,080
So what you're going to do is just like you did with the business plan template that you completed.

82
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:10,360
What you'll do is you can just copy this or copy this to go get the details on your company name so

83
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,010
I'll show you here.

84
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,890
I'm sure you've already seen it but just in case you're you've jumped forward to look at this Lesher

85
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,540
before anything else in the course of Russia.

86
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,870
So I paste that there and that will take you directly to where your company name is.

87
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:29,710
If you want copy it from there or you can just go here and then just copy the entire slide and then

88
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,990
paste special here and then change around the information.

89
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,720
Your call but I think it makes more sense to actually grab each one of these independently.

90
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,680
And if you have a logo grab that and throw in there as well.

91
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,670
And then the next slide here is a picture of the product.

92
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:52,600
If you have a picture of the product and the picture the product is is going to be if you click here

93
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:59,590
it'll take you directly there your product or service image can actually put that down here your product

94
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,750
or service image it will show you to your product.

95
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,000
Or service image.

96
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,890
And if you don't have this product or service image all then you can skip the slide and delete it and

97
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,840
you'll have nine slides only.

98
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,900
But if I went up here and I pasted that in the next you go to a blank cell pasted this in here it'll

99
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,770
take me directly to your product or service which is which is black.

100
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,300
But if you put it there it would show up there.

101
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,880
OK great.

102
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,660
Back here this is for your management and board advisers and completely optional might you want to set

103
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,350
this up.

104
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,960
But I did the Olympic ring process of three employees two advisers.

105
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,630
And they're right here.

106
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,920
That's employee one two three.

107
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:51,050
And then you visors he just copy to go directly there so your first name last name obviously you just

108
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,710
remember what that is but you can copy paste it in if you want.

109
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,780
Your job title copy that's pasted here.

110
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,510
And you can go and get it.

111
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,150
Whoops I'm sorry about that.

112
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,530
I pasted in a line there.

113
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,560
There you go.

114
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,330
It'll take you directly to where your job title is right here.

115
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,230
If you wrote it I wrote CEO and founder in that example.

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,610
But whatever is here will be picked up and you'll go here and you'll copy and then you'll whether your

117
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,960
job copy was you're going to go here and just paste special.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,400
You know and change the formatting.

119
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,620
You can if you want.

120
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,050
And for these images here you can go and get your image which you might have pasted in the course and

121
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,310
I want to show you how to make the images look cool and round like that's real easy.

122
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,210
It's kind of fun to backspace.

123
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,540
Make sure I just don't have any trailing spaces at the end.

124
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,650
OK so if you add an image there.

125
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,760
And I'll just get my image here.

126
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,730
If you paste it there it will show up and you copy and bring it over.

127
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,040
But let me just get my amateur.

128
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,630
So we got the from linked in as we discussed earlier in the course.

129
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:02,440
And so if I paste this and I want to get a circle what I can do is I can go up here first of all and

130
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,070
paint brush and then circle that or I can do is I can go up here to picture forment

131
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,220
and then crop to shape make it circle triangle whatever you want.

132
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,270
I guess that's how you do it.

133
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,150
OK.

134
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:23,040
And then you can add a little shadow if you want as well by going to quick styles and then you can add

135
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:29,860
a shadow like that if you want it to your call completely your call completely.

136
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,410
And the images you'll grab here if you put them in the course earlier on.

137
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,040
If you put them in your template you just paste.

138
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,870
Let's get on that image for a second sorry about that

139
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,450
spot.

140
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,200
OK.

141
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,700
And then you just paste here.

142
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,740
Get rid of the showing space.

143
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,090
Her paragraph mark and then it's going to pick it up here if you're interested.

144
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,150
There are other issues just like this copy and paste them and bring it over.

145
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,710
OK.

146
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,730
And rinse lather repeat with these board advisers if you want in every single presentation is different.

147
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,840
We have our own styles so you know this is just a presentation template sample.

148
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,430
You can download the other ones that look a lot nicer.

149
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,740
Again by going up to the top of the presentation slide section and then you can click here to go to

150
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,200
my website to download the presentation templates to use.

151
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,910
Or you can get it from the course attached to this Lesher.

152
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,640
OK.

153
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,540
Moving on what's your industry problem and what's the industry's solution.

154
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,970
And you can go here and get the details.

155
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,180
If it was brought forward here I just couldn't hear industry problems and you can just kind of copy

156
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,940
that or you can click here to go directly to the industry problem and then copy what's in here you go.

157
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,360
Copy and then you pay special over top of the problem here.

158
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:51,320
Just so you don't I say pay special is it because I don't want you to mess up or change the formatting

159
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,790
but keep text on your column.

160
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:00,300
Same thing in a solution future product milestone same thing if you had your future milestone written

161
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,980
in.

162
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,020
Can copy this.

163
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,210
Paste it here again make sure that there's no trailing space and it'll take you exactly in the course

164
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,660
where you wrote down.

165
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,230
If you wrote that down your future product or a mouse.

166
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,740
Here you copy and paste special.

167
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,440
So let's say I copy that.

168
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,720
Pretend that's us.

169
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:27,100
And then what I would do is I would highlight here pay special as text was a text like this and then

170
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,320
you might want to just prettied up move it over whenever a lead up to you and then what you do is the

171
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,240
same thing with the total just market.

172
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:42,230
And then I've got just 30 more seconds here and what you do is you're going to copy this.

173
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,160
These two here and it will pick up those two areas.

174
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,970
I'll show you what is going to look like actually the final output is going to look like this.

175
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,750
So right here these are two different sections.

176
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:04,990
This in this so one of two books like this.

177
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,850
And copy and then you're going to paste it as an image

178
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,080
and then you can make this bigger if you want.

179
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,120
And then I wrote at the bottom there you might want a crop.

180
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:25,530
And so if on the outside you got these lines here you're going to crop this by selecting crop right

181
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,580
here.

182
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,460
And then you're going to crop it and then do the exact same thing with this one here because you're

183
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,460
going to copy and paste this one here.

184
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,410
We're almost done here.

185
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,540
OK.

186
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:47,560
And then you're going to copy this here and then right here you're going to pay special again as a picture

187
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,930
make it the same size.

188
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,060
If you want just to make it a little bit bigger

189
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:00,960
and then you just want to make it roughly the same size so it lines up nicely like that.

190
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:12,400
And again you can crop it if you see those outside those lines in the outside like this.

191
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,080
It's a little finicky sometimes you have to zoom way way in to get it done.

192
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,340
OK.

193
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,760
Hold on try it again.

194
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,430
I think we're going to get here.

195
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,730
We do it all.

196
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,060
We we're so close.

197
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,190
OK.

198
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,920
And will widen it a bit.

199
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,310
There you go.

200
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,150
That's good.

201
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,170
That's good enough.

202
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:35,800
That looks great.

203
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,390
It's fun.

204
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,620
And these are just simplistic data points here so you can highlight both and drag them down.

205
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,750
That if you want at the bottom I wrote we're happy to provide you with detail financials.

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,880
Upon request please see our contact page on the last page here you'll do competition.

207
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:59,000
So what I did here is just highlight that paste up here and I'll take you helps take you back to make

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,460
sure that that's based there and he'll take you right here.

209
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,460
And if you want you can just copy this or copy what Tom Mackley put there for you and then you'll pay

210
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,190
special.

211
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:13,160
And because there's nothing written in for your stuff yet nothing will appear there.

212
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,020
You can even copy it from there if you want.

213
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,010
But here's what mine looks like just a bunch of fields so they'll copy yours not mine.

214
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,010
And then what you can do is go here and then you can pay special on top of here.

215
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:25,970
I'll show you that it looks like

216
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,730
it looks something like that's obviously you want to produce up.

217
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,780
Change the formatting around a lot if you want and then drag it up make the font smaller if you want

218
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,150
looks good.

219
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,780
I am a control zere controls that is I think.

220
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,210
And that's that's what it look like.

221
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,030
And then here you just put in your contact details make this a little bit higher up.

222
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,510
And so use whatever template you want.

223
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,670
And again you can take what you've done here and put all of these slides as I explained before in the

224
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,770
appendix parts if you want your final business plan if you have any questions about this please let

225
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,210
me know.

226
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,650
Thanks.
