1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,460
Please click on the button called inputs and analysis for Step 10 milestones.

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:13,110
And there's a couple of different sections here there's future milestones and past milestones.

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,000
And most people taking this course in reading your business plan are not going to talk about past milestones

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,010
because I'm anticipating that a lot of you are creating brand new business models but I included in

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,030
case you have a more established company and you're using this course as kind of a checkup so to speak.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,800
And so here I outline what the purpose is of milestones.

7
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:43,020
And it kind of helps you understand qualitative goals that you have and quantitative goals as well.

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:50,670
And I put this part of the business plan milestones closer to the end because I want to put it ahead

9
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:58,920
of and close to Step 12 where we have our financials because if you had a break even target date that

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,760
you want to quantify and showing your financial model.

11
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,160
But if you mention the milestones section or if you have a target revenue by a certain number of years

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,270
or a certain number of units you want to sell etc..

13
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,110
It makes sense to have it close to where the financials portion is here.

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,620
Okay.

15
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:24,390
And again we'll talk about how to build out financial models using units or or services based billing

16
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,500
per hour etc. when we get here and in this part of the cost step 12 I'll talk about how to model a product

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,550
based company and service based company or both at the same time.

18
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,990
So the first one here is what is your future revenue milestone targets.

19
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:47,120
And if you want you can set up your targets for revenue goals in 1 3 5 and 10 years.

20
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,440
And if you can't answer this now.

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,390
Don't worry because we'll cover more detail in Step 12 but it is a milestone worth mentioning.

22
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,590
If you come up with.

23
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,220
If you come up with these goals just take note of them remember what they are.

24
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,590
So later on in the financial section we can tie it in nicely to what you wrote here completely optional

25
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,970
at you at home.

26
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,300
And then here what are your future units sales milestones like how many units of the product if you

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,970
have a product are you planning on selling them 1 3 5 and 10 years and you can write that down here

28
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,540
if you want.

29
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,680
It's optional.

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,780
And then we'll tied into your revenue income statement later if you don't know much about financial

31
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,480
statements don't worry I'll start from scratch to Haaretz.

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,950
And then here I've got a future total addressable market percent milestones.

33
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,700
You know what percent of the market you want to own a 1 3 5 and 10 years.

34
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,550
Again this is this is optional here.

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:48,810
And then what's your future break even milestone if you can mention when you think you'll reach profitability

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,890
if you can't answer this yet.

37
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,760
That's OK.

38
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,750
And you might want to flag it here by selecting a flag and a red flag and then come back to it later.

39
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,060
Right.

40
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,850
So you can do that with all these questions as you know.

41
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,500
So a lot of these you might actually want to win a flag and come back to after you complete the financial

42
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,770
statements portion of your course in Step 12.

43
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,870
It's fine to flag it and not completed.

44
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,290
All right.

45
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,880
Now because there really is a lot to do in this course so I just had a two flags there just sample flags

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,170
whatever.

47
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,530
And then here.

48
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,540
What are your future product or service milestones.

49
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,050
You know what.

50
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,920
When is the product going to come out in the future for you if you have a platform solution.

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:36,940
Are you going to build upon that platform longer term with with different products or services etc..

52
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,330
Or if you run a strategy consulting company are you to branch out into technology consulting as well

53
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,580
that sort of thing.

54
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,630
Okay.

55
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,640
And here this is optional but do you have future Geographic milestones like are you going to open an

56
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,950
office in other markets.

57
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,780
And do you think that you'll get a significant revenue with certain markets over time that sort of thing.

58
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,110
Again this is all optional and I made another category here future.

59
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,850
Other milestones in case I don't cover other milestones get it's all optional.

60
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,260
And then here we've got what your future exit strategy if you plan on doing an IPO cetera.

61
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:19,110
You can comment on it optional of course and I'm going to talk now about past milestones achieved and

62
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,820
you can skip.

63
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,540
Yes you can skip the rest this lecture.

64
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,610
If you're if you don't have any past milestones but if you're a little bit more established or your

65
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,860
company was founded on a number of months ago or a number of years ago whatever you can answer in your

66
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,800
past revenue milestones achieved here your past unit sales milestones achieved maybe when you sold your

67
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:44,720
100 product or whatever it is or build your 1000 hour if you have a services business you know what

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,990
what's past a total addressable market percent so achieved if applicable.

69
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,870
It probably won't be for most people what your past breakeven milestone achieve if you've already had

70
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,360
revenue and expenses which of course means break even again optional.

71
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:06,750
And then you're past profit margin milestones etc. and we're going to talk a lot of boat about margins

72
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,350
profit margins and there's different types of margins as well.

73
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,810
We'll talk about gross margins net profit margins that sort of thing and we'll cover that in a lot of

74
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,540
detail here and there's financial ratios that are automatically to be created for you here and you'll

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,480
you'll love it.

76
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,810
He's close that down and if you go back to the homescreen and you scroll down you'll see that there

77
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:34,640
are some margin percent financial ratios that will appear there as you complete the rest of this course.

78
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,100
Okay.

79
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,900
And then here have you.

80
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,360
What are your past products or services milestones achieved if you released a product already you probably

81
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:50,190
want to talk about that in a it really gives investors or readers of the business plan comfort in knowing

82
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,090
that you've reached milestones in the past.

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,730
If not don't worry about it.

84
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,580
And then previous Geographic milestones like maybe you expanded to the east coast last year or West

85
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,270
Coast or whatever country or region you're in that sort of thing.

86
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,730
And then just other past milestones are here as well and so as you complete this the that the non-optional

87
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,720
questions again this will automatically update for you or you can just click here to override and then

88
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,530
it will mark has 100 percent which shows that we are well and making good progress.

89
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,480
Really it's a two thirds done 71 percent done.

90
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,070
I will see you in the output portion of step 10.

91
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,440
Thanks.
