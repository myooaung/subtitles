1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,570
Please click on the button called outputs for Step 5.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,570
I don't know if you have a product company or a service company.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,790
So I gave you this option here.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,380
So if you click this service only that title will change there.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:22,840
And if you click this one here at the de-select that it will say product and if you click both then

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,020
I'm sorry if you unclick both Ill say product and service description there.

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,630
OK.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,790
And so this is pretty self-explanatory.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:36,010
Everything you wrote in the previous input tab will be pulled over here and you can always look at my

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,190
example here.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,550
And then quality control if you wrote in the book quality control appear here.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:49,330
Same thing with packaging and then the same thing with production in your current price strategy and

13
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,720
your future price strategy if applicable and then whether or not you want to bundle etc..

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,860
And so there's a lot of great information here on your pricing strategy when it comes to distribution

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,050
which means your go to market strategy.

16
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,650
We will discuss this in more detail when we get to Step 8.

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,850
There's just some people that when they look at the description of your product and service they might

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:15,270
ask questions about distribution early on but we'll go into more detail later on there.

19
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,460
And then here's a return policy.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,390
If you have it's customer service is very important always because a company is only as good as its

21
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,060
customer services.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,550
And that wraps it up for this part of the Course Step 5 is done.

23
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,690
If you have any question as always please let me know and I will see you in step 6.

24
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:32,920
Thanks.
