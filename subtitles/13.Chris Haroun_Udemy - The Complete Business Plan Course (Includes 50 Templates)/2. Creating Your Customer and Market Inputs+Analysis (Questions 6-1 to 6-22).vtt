00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.680
Please click on the button called input's plus analysis for Step 6 where we talk about the customer

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.940
and the market.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.490
Now you're going to notice here that at the top there is no white shaded cell.

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.280
And the reason is because I want to pull forward some information which will help you a lot when answering

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.080
questions in this section.

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.140
So in Step Six we talk about the customer in the market now back in the executive summary which is step

7
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.430
three which of course is just a summary of the important stuff that's going to be in the document.

8
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:38.250
But back in step 3 we talked about the ideal customer in some customer characteristics.

9
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.190
And so I automatically pulled forward your answers here which will help you to answer the questions

10
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.480
below.

11
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.690
So if we look at my sample answers I wrote down what are the characteristics of the ideal customer.

12
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.500
It was just movie or video game fans.

13
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.270
I kept it simple was the location of the ideal customer within two years of launching the United States

14
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.030
and here is the ideal customer within five years of launching and I wrote down some other demographic

15
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.510
details.

16
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.690
Now if you completed those those boxes those questions in step 3 they will appear here which again will

17
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.940
help you to answer questions here in this part.

18
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.680
All right so next up weve got here an optional one k which is customer survey research.

19
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.050
And so what Ive done is it asks you a question have you done any sample survey research from who your

20
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.660
customers might be or your potential customers or your customers right now and what you can do is you

21
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.710
can go to survey monkey dot com ads you can conduct online research and you can include them if you

22
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.950
want at the back of your business plan in the appendix I wrote here that I included the results of a

23
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.270
survey there I actually didn't.

24
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.790
But if you were to do this for a real company not a fake company and include it in your business plan

25
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.730
it would not only help you to better understand who your customer is but will also make your reader

26
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.350
look like you've done a ton of research.

27
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.570
Most people never do this in business plans.

28
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.110
OK and that's optional.

29
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.640
Skips the next one now.

30
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.230
Who is the customer.

31
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.520
OK you're going expand upon a previous answer by writing a three cents paragraph of who your ideal customer

32
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.710
is and you can include the average age if you want where they live the language they speak their income

33
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.000
level and a bunch of other things.

34
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.620
OK.

35
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.130
This is something we'll go into a lot more detail line in Step 9 when we talk about sales and marketing

36
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.490
but it's important to mention here because obviously we're going to try and sell and market to our customer

37
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.220
but we have to talk about who the customer is here and the market a little bit more detail.

38
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.230
And so if you want what you can do is you can look at the answers that I pulled for a few here.

39
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.360
If you answered them to help you expand upon that here.

40
00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.250
And so here's an example of of what I wrote here based on our extensive customer research.

41
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.860
I put a little hype or little star here saying Please see the appendix which is it's not.

42
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.090
It's not real just pretend but it's also telling you where else to go within the document.

43
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.870
For more details.

44
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.960
But I wrote this you can write something similar if you want.

45
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.900
Or like always if you want you can flag this and come back to it later.

46
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.790
It's hard to complete an entire business plan in order.

47
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.970
Sometimes you have to jump around a lot which is why I had the flagging capability and the capability

48
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.130
to select any part of the document you want.

49
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.720
It's pretty cool.

50
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.490
It's fun.

51
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.370
OK.

52
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.710
So next up we have got customer concentration and I made this one a mandatory one because a lot of sophisticated

53
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.880
investors are people that analyze business models.

54
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.380
They get worried if too much revenue comes from one customer.

55
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.380
And when I used to work on Wall Street at Goldman Sachs and in the hedge fund industry and venture capital

56
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.600
industry I would always have the 10 percent rule question in the back of my mind which is do you have

57
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.810
any 10 percent plus customers as a percent of revenues which can be a red flag.

58
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.830
By the way just just right here and I wrote I do not have in this hypothetical example any customers

59
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:12.550
that are more than 1 percent of total revenue and this here is just an optional question on the profile

60
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.560
of your of your of your customers.

61
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.780
So I think it makes sense to collect information if you can from your customers especially since a lot

62
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.500
of sales in the long run for all companies will come from online sources.

63
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.600
And so I recommend having an email list I do it with my my students as well.

64
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.130
It's all optional whatever.

65
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.210
But you can do it in Survey Monkey which I used part of you can do it in MailChimp that's male S.H.

66
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.050
i m p doc.

67
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.670
And then later on when you want something more sophisticated you can use what I use which is a company

68
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.650
called active campaign.

69
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.440
So just write down what your strategy is or your strategy might be.

70
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.900
If you want it is optional you can skip that if you want OK this next one is not optional which is how

71
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.650
are you going to get customers what your customer attainment strategy is to just write down how you

72
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.090
plan to get them.

73
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.290
Don't talk about sales or March marking strategies yet because we're going to cover that a lot more

74
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.980
detail here in the sales and marketing portion in Step 9.

75
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.100
And you can read this the simple answer here if you want.

76
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.510
OK and then here other optional one if applicable Are you following your customers and potential customers

77
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.000
on social media accounts like like Twitter.

78
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.150
So it's just informational yes or no.

79
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:36.430
I just want a challenging challenge and in a good way to do as much as you can to learn as much as you

80
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.860
can about your customers or potential customers.

81
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:46.030
And I want you to also I want you to also follow your competitors or just go to your competitors I should

82
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.590
say don't fall.

83
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.140
But go to your competitors link your Twitter profile and find out who they fall in.

84
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:59.320
And I made a vlog on this too if you care which which will tell you a lot of information about who your

85
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.180
competitors are and so just watch this video here if you care.

86
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.370
It will basically tell you how you can lower in tone about anybody by just looking at who they follow

87
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.220
in Twitter.

88
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.590
Right.

89
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.860
And so a lot of your competitors that are salespeople they will probably follow their biggest customers

90
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.300
because their biggest customers likely follow them and it's rude not to follow or follow back.

91
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.340
A big customer for example optional of course.

92
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.580
OK.

93
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.850
Next up I've got this one here which is Google alerts if applicable.

94
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.890
Have you signed up for Google Alerts in order to get media in e-mails.

95
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.240
Whenever your customers are in the news and this isn't something that you have to document in your business

96
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.440
plan.

97
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.060
But I just I put it down here I thought I'd be helpful as well.

98
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.590
And so I actually monitor whenever any of my courses are in the news or whenever somebody copyright

99
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.940
with somebody puts it up on one of those downloadable you know pirated web sites I find out right away

100
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.450
so I can take action or whatever.

101
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.240
OK.

102
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.550
Actually you don't meet us for us which is cool.

103
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.650
All right next up customer service is mandatory but a company is only because of customer service.

104
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.330
So you could write down how are you going to ensure a high level customer service I wrote down here

105
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.120
that will have an FAA Q section on our Web site which is frequently asked questions.

106
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.250
You can read the rest of this if you care.

107
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.720
And one of my employees I mentioned here is going to be in charge of telephone support.

108
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.580
Next one is customer response time.

109
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.970
This is optional How long will it take you and how do you respond to customers.

110
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:39.460
And then you have a loyalty program like a Starbucks card for example if you if you sell at retail that

111
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.420
sort of thing.

112
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:46.090
I don't have that in this example here but maybe you do and then we talk about your warranty policy

113
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.090
if you have a warranty policy that is.

114
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.230
I wrote here with a fictional example.

115
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.100
We offer a one year warranty etc..

116
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.830
You can read that if that's of interest to you it helps you.

117
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:55.090
OK.

118
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.640
Next up I've got industry search trends if applicable.

119
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.170
Have you done research or search trends on the industry you're in.

120
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.710
And this is pretty helpful.

121
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.970
I wrote here see the appendix for more details although I didn't include in the appendix just an example

122
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.190
but let me show you this this is really powerful and it's actually free.

123
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.240
So if we go together here to Google Search Trends

124
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:28.130
You can look at the search history for anything and you can look at what's pertinent and what people

125
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.720
care about in certain areas of the world whatever.

126
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:40.240
And so if we were to search for virtual reality you can just find out where people are searching for

127
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:40.780
this.

128
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:46.690
You know I'd probably do research why it was such a big spike here around Christmas maybe it is because

129
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:53.680
a lot of people got the Sony PSA for virtual reality goggles for Christmas or whatever it is or or why

130
00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:00.310
is it spiking at certain times and you can see where there's there's interest by different regions.

131
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.450
You can download the information.

132
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.750
It's really really powerful.

133
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.360
For some reason this is a related topic maybe because people watched a version of the movie.

134
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.390
I don't really know.

135
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:16.450
But anyway check this out if you can't play around with it it's free and it's amazing to.

136
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:16.960
All right.

137
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.810
Next up we have got the Tambe sentence.

138
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.400
Remember we did this before we kind of covered it before I wrote here.

139
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.500
Read a sentence about the size and growth of the industry Tam.

140
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.190
Now in Step Three meaning back in the executive summary section we did cover this.

141
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:37.030
We wrote about this but we are and we also document the growth rate and if possible just provide a little

142
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.050
bit more detail on this.

143
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.940
If you want here I pulled that forward for you anyway.

144
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.100
I think it's important to mention it again.

145
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.690
So the executive summary is obviously a summary of all the important stuff and we talk about the TAM

146
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:54.460
there the total addressable market which is important but because this is the customer and market section

147
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.560
we have to talk about here.

148
00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:01.420
If you want you can talk a little more detail completely your call next up and our this one on purpose.

149
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:07.100
Have you attended local media events to network or learn more about the markets and the industries you

150
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:12.880
can go to meet up dot com and you can find a local meeting for basically every type of sector there

151
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.690
is out there and network in almost every company in the world so check it out it's pretty cool.

152
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:23.020
And so here this is optional but you can talk about in more detail the percent of Tam that you want

153
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.680
to have a restful market in five years.

154
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.810
We talked about before you can expand upon it here if you want.

155
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.140
The reason we talked about before was because it was in the executive summary.

156
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.600
You can expand upon it here if you want to and it might help you actually for later on in Step 12 when

157
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.270
we discuss the financials because if you mention that you want to get 1 percent or 5 percent of a billion

158
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:49.060
dollar mark then that equals $10 million or $50 billion in revenue which you can model in your income

159
00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.970
statement which is the yes don't don't go there yet we'll go there together later on the course.

160
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.250
Thanks so again the stuff are doing now is little bit more qualitative and quantitative stuff for our

161
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:03.340
our financial model or for a business plan General will largely be located here in Step 12.

162
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.290
We'll go there to get the okay.

163
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:13.220
And so next up is you can talk about industry trends or drivers and drivers means things that make your

164
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.730
industry do well and when you're doing the financial model we'll get to this later.

165
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.480
But most financial models have one main driver right.

166
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.620
So if it's a commodity you're selling Usually it's the price and maybe the supply as well that sort

167
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.820
of thing.

168
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:33.130
And then here you can talk about the problem and the solution as well that your product addresses no

169
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.680
cap.

170
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:39.960
And if you want you can go into more detail here on the industry problem energy solution as well.

171
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.300
We talk about this one already.

172
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.680
And then industry risks Okay.

173
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.600
And just talk about risks here.

174
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:52.940
If you can about the industry don't talk about the competition much as a risk though yet because we're

175
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.350
talking about the market in the next step which is Step 7 we'll talk about that the competition.

176
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.850
Here's an example I wrote here.

177
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.310
Where are the Beatty's meaning the barriers to entry.

178
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.340
You know what's stopping other people or other companies or established companies from doing what you

179
00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.380
currently do.

180
00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.920
Do you have a patent a copyrighted trademark that sort of thing.

181
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:19.280
And then last question here I included is seasonality and this is optional but a lot of companies see

182
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:25.940
their revenue spike every November around Black Friday holiday shopping the reason they call it Black

183
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:32.450
Friday is because from January until October most retail companies in the world are in the red.

184
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:39.200
Meaning they're losing money and they actually only break even in November by the third Friday in November

185
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.640
when Americans have Thanksgiving that's what they call it Black Friday.

186
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.380
Well a bit of interesting trivia for you there.

187
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.490
Anyway if there's seasonality in your business you know you'll want to talk about that.

188
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.730
Most companies have an uptick in Q4 meaning in the fourth quarter of the year which is Sept which is

189
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:58.670
October November December because it is year end there's holiday shopping into that sort of thing.

190
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.690
But this one here is optional in which you answered all questions.

191
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:08.780
You will see that you are 100 percent done here with customer and market you can always flag them and

192
00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:16.130
come back to questions later red flag them like we've talked about before or what you can do is you

193
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:23.330
can just click this button here to override and just mark this entire step as being done meaning 100

194
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:23.750
percent.

195
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.650
So let me just do that here.

196
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.870
I mean we can see the status of Step 6 is 1 percent done.

197
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:34.420
We have one flag which is just added now to come back to it later if you want the optional and the progress

198
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.990
in the courses we're almost halfway done.

199
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.280
Right we're making great progress so we're now 43 percent done.

200
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.510
And I will see you in the outputs step for step 6 next.
