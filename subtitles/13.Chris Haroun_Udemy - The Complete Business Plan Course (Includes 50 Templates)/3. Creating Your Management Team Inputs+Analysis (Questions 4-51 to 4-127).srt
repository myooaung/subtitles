1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,600
That what we can do is we can get some pretty cool images.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:12,400
I'm very visual and I love the visual process when we create these are these documents so that when

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,860
we show who are our board is I don't I didn't go to Harvard Law or work at those companies but just

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,820
an example.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,470
And this guy Gates William I'll show you down here.

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,450
It look like that.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,380
And for our final business plan output will be there as well.

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,830
And even for the presentation slides if you care and you want to create a presentation and you can always

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,960
put the presentation in the in the appendix section which I'll talk about later.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,380
But you can even put them on this one slide so that you have a slide that looks like this is like Olympic

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,380
rings right and it's got you know three people here that work at the company.

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:52,390
And then these are maybe two of the advisors you throw here and it just helps to assuage any concerns

13
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,810
your investors or readers of the business plan might have a boat do your background or any gaps etc.

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,830
which is why we talked about gaps in a lot of detail there in the previous question so let me go back

15
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,430
here to inputs for managements.

16
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,540
Okay great.

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,720
And you can go and just get a bunch of Logos as well if you want.

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:20,980
So let's say that person worked at these companies here you can go here and you'll see different different

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:27,310
logos so you can copy this logo if you want to copy the image and then just do the same thing I did

20
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,850
which was shoes and these weird this was just what I do pasted here.

21
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,740
Oh there it is there.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,990
Sorry.

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,580
I think it's going to work came through.

24
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,270
All right fine.

25
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,430
And you can make it smaller to whatever dimension you want to use so let's just go here just to tidy

26
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,300
it up and use this as a faster faster.

27
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,990
Drag it over and go one one.

28
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,950
There you go.

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,130
And then I can just kind of drag this over there again that's an easier way to do it.

30
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,740
Hold it there.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,420
OK.

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,710
And then you can add all those images here if you want to.

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,860
And I can use the same methodology used here so let's see what size they I point 3:8.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,020
OK so we'll do that again.

35
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,910
So I'll go here.

36
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:13,580
Zero point three OK and that will format the same size.

37
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,530
Just keep it consistent and I recommend throwing in two or three logos.

38
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,680
You don't want in a date your reader of the business plan or the presentation slides to me logo's you

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,110
get the ideas put in there.

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,630
All right.

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:32,310
And then he writes if you want with the strengths of that board member and just right here a little

42
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,310
bit about them as well.

43
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:39,990
This will go into our business plan mash output part here I'll show you in a future election coming

44
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,220
up.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,340
You can just write a little bit of I don't know a summary here like this guy here has a Ph.D. which

46
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,060
stands for plumbing heating and dishwashing where he was a Rhodes Scholar research scholar.

47
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,900
Sorry Dad I'm trying to be funny.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,260
Working.

49
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,530
I know.

50
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:55,770
All right.

51
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,480
So anyway just write all that stuff and then just scroll down and do the same thing for the second board

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,570
advisor if you want a second board adviser and a third one.

53
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,550
Say I don't have enough marking experience on my business plan.

54
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,940
There's this guy Seth Godin his real name going south and north.

55
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,600
He worked at gamble and Procter.

56
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,540
That's the real logo.

57
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,680
And maybe he worked at this company here all made up obviously.

58
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,110
See I don't have a market experience so I can get somebody using LinkedIn using the methodology I showed

59
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,200
you has something with me that will meet with me and we'll be a board adviser.

60
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,400
OK.

61
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:37,800
It's just copy and paste in the picture and that's Seth Jones actual picture there from a from from

62
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,540
from LinkedIn.

63
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,070
And every time you copy images from LinkedIn I know they look around initially but you copy and paste

64
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,560
and they actually end up looking square.

65
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,510
So you can get.

66
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:54,870
I mean anybody say we go here to this guy here who apparently looks a lot like Brad Pitt or George Clooney.

67
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,620
I've been told.

68
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,710
Just kidding.

69
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,690
But when you copy and it's probably work for mine.

70
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,320
That is me.

71
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:08,070
But whatever you copy anyone's name and image I should say what you'll see is it will appear Square.

72
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,200
So let's go here.

73
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,220
Let's say this person here.

74
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,610
OK.

75
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,480
I met her actually she used to chew you to me.

76
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,840
She's cool.

77
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,140
I met her down in Brazil.

78
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,960
So you click here and then you would right click.

79
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,440
And then if you were to paste it.

80
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,020
It would appear rectangular.

81
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,290
Right.

82
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,150
So you paste it and then we use the same.

83
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,470
What happens there takes awhile I guess.

84
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:44,510
And then what you do is you click it and then you'd go you know 1.7 five by 1.7 five and then you just

85
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,790
kind of drag that all the way over here for all your images.

86
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,270
And I know it's a little bit arduous it's kind of fun too but when I would just I recommend doing it

87
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,350
and you'll see exactly where we're going to put this in our in our business plan I shall take you there

88
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:56,670
now.

89
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,180
OK.

90
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,180
So our management team part.

91
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,280
Ill go right here and then we'll copy and paste it there.

92
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:09,010
Actually let me show you what's going look like so let's grab this and we say we're putting in this

93
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,750
person here as an advisor.

94
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,530
That would actually go in the advisor section on management put it down here right.

95
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,540
So he's the second adviser outpaced that there.

96
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,610
I would get the bio and paste it there as well as the the name of the person.

97
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,160
And then what we'll do later is I'll show you when we're formatting this in this part of the Course

98
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,290
here when we're formatting this rock what we'll do is we'll actually get rid of all those those lines

99
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,670
those borders as well.

100
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,500
It all look really clean and nice as well and you'll see what these fields mean as wanted to kind of

101
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,770
visualize and show you why we're doing all this stuff so we just back out of that.

102
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,450
OK.

103
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,320
OK so you'd enter in all your born advisors if you want to have them at all and you can just skip this

104
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,940
too if you want.

105
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,000
And I just put dummy data in here for all the advisors.

106
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,580
OK.

107
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,210
Then you write your own bio.

108
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,470
OK and so this is all just made up Tony shark is whatever this is his background.

109
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,920
Let's see.

110
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,470
That's the image of that person.

111
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,570
And in a couple of these images I showed you how to get them directly from from Linked In.

112
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,240
And of course you have to ask these people to if you're really going to put it on an official business

113
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,150
plan.

114
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,680
And that's actually really who works for me correct guy OK.

115
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,120
And we just go down here and you'll find that you click on this and we'll go back to the name of the

116
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,640
person earlier on.

117
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,350
OK so Ryan Reynolds it clicked that will go back to where we we documented that earlier in the course.

118
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,560
I'll call you quickly here.

119
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,860
So if we click here on this person's name you can change that person's name right here as well.

120
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,600
All right let's go back to Step Four crates.

121
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:00,350
And again the reason I clicked this instead of clicking up here is whenever you click on these buttons

122
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,560
it jumps to the very top of each of these tabs.

123
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,820
Nice one to save us time.

124
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,400
OK so.

125
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,430
So you you would.

126
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:14,040
Put the image of all of your employees here and I'll tell exactly when to put them in and then paste

127
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,150
some logos as well like the three logos I showed you above.

128
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:24,830
Rinse lather repeat this for all employees if you care to answer them in and for all board advisors

129
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,730
if you want as well.

130
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:32,610
And so I give you the option enter up to 10 employees and I think three board advisors.

131
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,880
Yeah.

132
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,060
So this is all the same thing all the scroll down I've dummy data here.

133
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,800
And if you have any questions about this please let me know as well.

134
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,130
OK.

135
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,060
We're done tenth tenth person done.

136
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,970
And again if you don't have data in here this will look different these these fields.

137
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,190
OK.

138
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:57,920
It'll basically it'll it'll tell you to skip or scroll down and skip over this one.

139
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,540
OK.

140
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,880
There we go.

141
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,380
We're almost done here.

142
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,240
OK.

143
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:08,540
And this one here is optional but if you want you can enter in more details like who you're looking

144
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,340
to hire and what in what sectors etc. or what kind of employees.

145
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,590
And if you if you document and weaknesses earlier on and I didn't and I did not in this example but

146
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,810
they would appear here care of the weaknesses of every employee.

147
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,910
So you know what kind of person you want to hire and you documented here.

148
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,340
OK.

149
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,240
We're here actually in the white part in that blue parts for for example.

150
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:30,600
OK.

151
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,060
All the weeks's will come through.

152
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,290
If you can.

153
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,370
OK.

154
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:41,730
And if you want you can write down or just kind of think about who's in charge of all of these and these

155
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,770
are the major functions that are roles in most companies.

156
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,950
Right you can just kind of right down here just you know who is who's in charge of what.

157
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,190
As you think about putting together your management team sector can.

158
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,070
And then as I mentioned I like to run a really lean company and I like to outsource a lot of stuff and

159
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,860
so if you get people that you outsource stuff to and I gave you the option enter in five of them.

160
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,250
OK.

161
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,730
So I didn't include an image.

162
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,800
There's no point in cleaning which is people that were just kind of outsourcing things here and they

163
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,920
will look like this here outsource partners here and say I've got five of them and then we'll just vanish

164
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,670
I'll show you how to put in just the name in the bio.

165
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,340
That's it.

166
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,800
But you can answer them here.

167
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,520
So I made the same person for all five is just an example.

168
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,940
But you have different people.

169
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,550
And again this is optional because it has a word optional here.

170
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,090
OK.

171
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,680
So the name of the person entering the company and everything is tagged so that it is pulled forward

172
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,990
later in the document when we create the final business plan and I'll show you in the letter after this

173
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,620
one what the output looks like as well.

174
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,710
It's pretty cool.

175
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,340
All right.

176
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:51,890
So you write the bio of the first outsource partner second outsource partner type their name here if

177
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,140
applicable where they work.

178
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,770
I know I not the same person just dummy data.

179
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,590
Their title and then a bio.

180
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:03,860
And when you write the BIOS for people that are on your board of advisors and and these other outsource

181
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,170
partners bios just think about what the gaps are in the skill set and the weaknesses of all of your

182
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:16,790
employees because you want to give a more cohesive high level overview of your entire management team

183
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,870
including people that work there meaning in your company and maybe it's just use to just include one

184
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,670
include up to 10 people here and then board advisors as well.

185
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,220
And then your outsource partners and you can see here where the other stuff is going to feed into and

186
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,530
it is extraordinarily thorough.

187
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,440
OK.

188
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,220
And by the way after you complete all of this stuff later on the course and I'll explain exactly when.

189
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,140
When you right click this and you click Update field the right names of the right people will show up

190
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,370
here automatically.

191
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,190
OK.

192
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,750
And the page numbers as well.

193
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,130
OK.

194
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,240
I didn't change these yet.

195
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,110
That's why they appear unchanged.

196
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,450
So this document the blank verse in this document is 62 pages.

197
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,100
It is very thorough.

198
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,490
OK.

199
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,750
And I didn't want to leave any stone unturned.

200
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,430
And a lot of the stuff you may not use so we'll just delete them later.

201
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,700
And there's just a ton more stuff that's in order of course like milestones financial success or a bell

202
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,420
make much more sense as we progressed through this course.

203
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,490
OK.

204
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,750
So a lot of this is optional optional optional.

205
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,490
It's a lot of questions but there's a lot of optional stuff too right.

206
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,720
OK.

207
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,210
And and that's it.

208
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:34,680
And so everything that you documented here will be used on the next output part as well as the complete

209
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,560
outport output I should say amalgamation portion as well.

210
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,940
And we'll get to that much much later.

211
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,830
But let me let me go back here now and this will take me to the top of that tab.

212
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,600
That's OK because we've And she had all the information hypothetically speaking.

213
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,170
And then as you answer the questions for the questions that are required.

214
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:01,160
Ill keep track and tell you what percent you've done of this and after you've updated all of this this

215
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,160
will change here to 100 percent done which will be shown here and the flags as well if you have any.

216
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:11,070
And a lot of the times you'll want to flag these things say you reach out to some people that you want

217
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,180
to put on your board or you're not sure about it yet or you might consider it.

218
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,950
So I would go over here and just flag some of these entries here.

219
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:25,260
OK so you just go here come back to this question and you can always filter it based on the ones you

220
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,410
want to come back to later right.

221
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,960
This is pretty comprehensive but you'll see a flag is created here.

222
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,780
Just like with the other tabs you'll see that we have a flag right here.

223
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,700
So when you're done with this tab you can click this as well which will override in 300 hundred percent

224
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,100
up there if you want to if you want to.

225
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,720
And then updates the course.

226
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,470
And it now shows that you are almost a third done between 9 percent and if you answered your name it

227
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,020
would you would read a little message there for you and try to personalize it for you.

228
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,910
There's the update and that is it.

229
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,610
And so what I'll do is in the next lecture I'll go through the outputs part of the mansion section meaning

230
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,600
everything we just typed in here will we pulled into here and I'll explain what it means and how to

231
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,740
customize it even more.
