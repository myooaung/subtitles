1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:05,710
OK now it's time to do Step 12 we're almost done men were making great progress here.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,700
Ok cool.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:13,970
So next step what we're going to do is make sure you're here directly on row 5:58.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,130
And if you don't know how to get there or you're somewhere else you can always highlight this.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,540
And then just paste in here it doesn't matter where you are.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,110
So say you're lost anywhere in the spreadsheet.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,260
If you paste this in here it'll automatically take you boom over here.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,480
And I recommend doing that actually no matter what.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,800
Even if you're right here with me I still want you to do that and I'll show you what I want to copy

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,720
this.

11
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,140
You'll see why in a second.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,410
Paste it in here.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,640
Enter because it's going to highlight exactly what we're going to pull over and this is a little technical

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,230
I don't care.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,600
But there's white cells here on purpose just ignore them just so I could get a nice looking copy and

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,180
paste for you.

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,770
So make sure before you hit copy.

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,910
If you don't see these rows and columns and by the way your numbers will be different.

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,790
If you started in year one and you called year one year one or 2000 9000 or whatever your numbers look

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:20,040
different from my cat and your your y axis here will differ from mine to number wise if you have different

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,390
numbers in your model so for mine I went up to I think $800000 in revenue and 34000 in revenue in the

22
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,950
fourth year which is 2012.

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,290
Your numbers are look for me.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,380
If you can't see any access at all that make sure that all these Step 12 tabs often and make sure to

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,630
hit the two or three.

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,720
And make sure everything is open up.

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,860
But I don't think anyone can have that.

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,990
OK.

29
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,380
And I only have five years worth of day I only put five years worth of dummy data in and not the rest.

30
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,870
That's why this appears like that.

31
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,520
So here's where you.

32
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,220
Yeah.

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,830
So after you pasted that in there now you get hit copy Control-C or Right-Click.

34
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,910
Copy and paste it here.

35
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,760
If it doesn't look good you can always pay special if you wanted to as well.

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:13,140
So sometimes Microsoft Office works really well allowing you to pay stuff between documents.

37
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:20,800
If it doesn't then you select Paste Special K so when I use it when I use Windows sometimes and I pay

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,530
special it doesn't work.

39
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:29,410
So now I just paste it as is and it's smart enough to grab the data directly so try pasting special

40
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,630
if it doesn't work then just try pasting as is in case it should work.

41
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,470
OK great so that's done.

42
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,890
Next up we have got this financial ratios and piu we did in the last the last step there so I'm going

43
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,080
to copy this and put it like this.

44
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,900
Copy over here.

45
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,990
The reason they got smaller.

46
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,470
Right.

47
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,190
Paste here just to tell me exactly what to copy and paste in case it's highly good.

48
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:01,060
This is page 2 right click copy and then get rid of this here and I paste on top.

49
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:08,290
This just hit paste doesn't seem to work out that well so what I can do in this case is pay special

50
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:14,510
one to or just drag that down there and it pulls all the data over and it's got those nice blue looking

51
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,890
charts there at Trape specials for fun.

52
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,430
Pases picture doesn't work.

53
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:20,930
All right.

54
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,700
So when you use it on Windows it works a little bit better.

55
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,130
So in this case just paste it as is.

56
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,690
OK.

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,050
I've tried this on Windows as well.

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,460
And then you can just kind of drag it down and make a little bit nicer there.

59
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,100
Sometimes you need a lot of manual work as well as kind of back that up.

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,570
It's going to have to you have to delete that cellar Pena.

61
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,420
All right.

62
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,710
See I just cut cut this out here.

63
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,910
Cut and I don't think I'll run of the same issues I'm having here.

64
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,660
But if you do then just do what I'm doing here.

65
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,140
Get the axe and you can even make an.

66
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,110
Lips.

67
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,750
That's good.

68
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,480
OK great.

69
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,330
That's done their Feitel ratios.

70
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,240
All right.

71
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,670
And then we're going to do financial ratios too.

72
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,470
You'll notice I highlighted in yellow because another page.

73
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,600
And so what I'm going to do is I can enter financial ratios up to up here it's going to automatically

74
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,520
go down here to page 3.

75
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,150
So watch this just because I want to be consistent with what you copy and paste too.

76
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,310
There you go.

77
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,840
And then we're going to

78
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,800
try to answer.

79
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:37,530
And then you can just do Control-C or command see if using Mac come over here and you can try to pay

80
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,250
special.

81
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,470
If that doesn't work pasting his image you can always just try pasting itself see if it works.

82
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,870
Looks like in this case doesn't work that that grates me.

83
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,810
We're missing some of the data.

84
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,640
And if that happens too you can even paste or copy and paste one image at a time or one of these at

85
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,370
a time.

86
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,510
He can come here and go copy and you have to select the cells like if you want.

87
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,690
You can even select this entire one here.

88
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,810
And I've tested the heck out of some windows on Mac.

89
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,990
I've been in this for years and I know Excel is kind of finicky.

90
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,020
You can copy them one at a time if you want to.

91
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,110
There you go.

92
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,280
So again you've got the option to pay special or to just paste it directly as is by selecting all that.

93
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,510
If it doesn't work then we'll just do one by one.

94
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,990
OK.

95
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,650
And different versions of Word and Excel opera a little bit differently.

96
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,080
There you go.

97
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,250
Looking good though.

98
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,420
OK great.

99
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,390
Let's move on now we've got the monthly revenue forecast this won't be a little bit easier to paste.

100
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,010
OK.

101
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,620
So run a copy paste it up here and it's just going to take us down there to the fourth page which is

102
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,840
going to take us down there.

103
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,740
But I'll show you how it works here.

104
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,950
You can get.

105
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,300
So it's going to grab all of it now because you see those numbers need to be a bit wider.

106
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:04,940
We're going to do is this you can highlight all the cells all over growth I should say drag it make

107
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,750
it a bit wider.

108
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,460
And then what will happen is it'll make them a little bit why are the reason I said Don't click as I

109
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,100
don't know if you've put a lot of data below this.

110
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm not sure if yes.

111
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,890
And he can paste that in again if you want select a good copy and then back here what we can do is pay

112
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,710
special has a picture great.

113
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,790
So this is just the old one underneath that.

114
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,130
There you go.

115
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,350
Looks like you didn't work for these.

116
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,000
So make a little bit wider.

117
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,040
Excel is finicky.

118
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,630
All right.

119
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,790
And if you just copy and paste it as is.

120
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,850
So it's already in my clipboard.

121
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,790
See what happens.

122
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,080
No way man.

123
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,280
No way.

124
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,550
So what we do is we'll make these up a bit wider here.

125
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,210
Go to the edge here.

126
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,570
Great.

127
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,960
And then I will select it again if I want to I can just go here get that field

128
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:19,020
copy Gary the old one paste special as a picture.

129
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,900
There you go it works great looks good.

130
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,430
And if you can't read that what you can do is you can even flip it over like this if you want it to.

131
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,820
It's fine for me I can see that fine I think.

132
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,620
And if you can't what you can do is just reformat this and even throw it in the appendix completely

133
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,820
or call or you can just copy certain cells if you want your call it is readable.

134
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,570
It's fine.

135
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,870
Uncap great that is that one.

136
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,260
And here's the next page.

137
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,710
So let me just scroll down here and if you don't see a line around the bottom you can always click it.

138
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,360
OK so makes you click the image first.

139
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,900
Watch what's going to happen up here.

140
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,170
He go up here to a picture format.

141
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,050
And then what you can do is you can put a nice black border around it's all make it black and then you

142
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,550
can select just thin weight if you want to make it look a little nicer.

143
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,310
Let's go to.

144
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:15,140
And you can even if you wanted to get all on our t c on me you can go here you can go shadow and throw

145
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,990
that in and if that looks nice and if you do that just be consistent with all of.

146
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,230
So obviously you've got the shadows there story for you it looks kind of nice.

147
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,080
Michael.

148
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,200
All right great.

149
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,290
Excellent.

150
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,200
See how we're doing

151
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,790
great.

152
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,470
All right let's see what's next.

153
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,820
All right well then here quarterly

154
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,230
which is here.

155
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,840
So when I entered here it's automatically highlight the quarterly numbers right there.

156
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,850
See and it should be fine when it comes to the width to the cells because we already widened it.

157
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,100
And this pulls everything or you've done already.

158
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,720
So here it's going to say quarterly for year 1 to year 3.

159
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,310
My first year 7:18 in this hypothetical example and my third year was there.

160
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,800
Okay.

161
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:07,170
And you're going to see here that I've got both revenue lines here.

162
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:14,010
So I own a copy and then let me just get rid of these because that's dummy data or replacing dummy data

163
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,040
with media.

164
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,920
And I paste it as a picture is one worked out a lot better.

165
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,780
Yeah it's fine.

166
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,020
And if you can't read that if you want you can turn that sideways and formatted differently till you're

167
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,210
caught.

168
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,290
And you can even narrow this if you wanted to.

169
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,700
I'll show you like this.

170
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,040
It's going to look messy for a second.

171
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,080
Copy it's.

172
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,250
And then you can paste it instead that way.

173
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,410
Let's show you.

174
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:48,410
Pay special as a picture bit easier to read.

175
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,230
And if you only have one revenue line item I have to you can get rid of that as well.

176
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,370
And you know if you only have one red line I'm I don't recommend including this just include the whole

177
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,880
income statement and you can do it if you want.

178
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,460
Whatever.

179
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,300
Or you can do is just kind of you can hide.

180
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,530
You can only copy certain cells right.

181
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:14,300
So if you want to just do revenue and you only one line and I'm not like me right to go here and you

182
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,350
can copy.

183
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,030
So then what you can do is you can paste it like this.

184
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,890
Pay special needs anything we just it pay special as a picture and then get rid of that.

185
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,430
And I will just be one revenue line item.

186
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,700
Not really that helpful.

187
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,660
But anyway to each their own.

188
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:38,300
And by the same token up here if you only have one revenue line item you might want to get rid of maintenance

189
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:38,740
down here.

190
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,940
That's a second revenue line item.

191
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:49,070
So what you can do is instead of copying this whole table you can just copy everything above that so

192
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:56,270
it'll look like this copy and then you're going to pay special and it won't show the bottom part.

193
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:02,150
So let's go up here and let's say that we want to just have one revenue line and pay special paste as

194
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,380
a picture.

195
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,450
OK.

196
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,460
And then you'll see there's no maintenance there right.

197
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,300
We got rid of it.

198
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:14,570
And if you don't have units then you can even try to make this course work for everybody.

199
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,450
So you don't have units.

200
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,270
It's just this.

201
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,730
Then you can just do this if you wanted to and just copy just the revenue here if you want to include

202
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,820
this at all or just even go right to here.

203
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,050
OK.

204
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,020
You don't have to though.

205
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,870
I don't know how much value this is going to have that one line item but it's always good to provide

206
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:39,250
a little bit more detail for your reader of the business plan the less you're called.

207
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:39,930
OK.

208
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,040
Next up we have got the next page.

209
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,290
Scroll down here.

210
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,030
All right.

211
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,240
We're done with that.

212
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:55,210
And you can delete the How to hear delete the how to OK.

213
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,090
I want to be fair to everybody taking this course and show you how to turn it sideways.

214
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,310
All how did this guy.

215
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,570
So this is a little bit advanced if you want to skip what I'm about to show you by going to landscape

216
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,630
mode from portrait to landscape than you can get to this part here in the lecture.

217
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,400
But I assure you.

218
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,640
How did this go.

219
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,740
So what's going to happen is you're going to insert a different section because you can insert a page

220
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:24,140
break or section Rick and I don't want the whole document to be in landscape mode only a couple of pages.

221
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,340
So what I can do.

222
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,020
Kill Let's go up here.

223
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:27,730
OK.

224
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,320
So what we'll do is just for the next couple of pages will have a different section.

225
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,530
So I'll go here and I'm going to go insert.

226
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,070
You can't do it.

227
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:37,610
Here you go.

228
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:45,040
Insert can break and then you to go to section break on the next page or right there will say next page.

229
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,280
Next Page new section.

230
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,920
Because they're OK.

231
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,870
This is a new section.

232
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,450
And then with this new section here it's going to look really different.

233
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,100
It starts at page 1.

234
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,610
We wanted to continue the page numbers in the previous section.

235
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:06,680
So what you can do is you can tell it to continue from the previous section which is Page 30 so you

236
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,160
want to appear as Page 31.

237
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,610
And so what you can do is you can go here.

238
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:24,160
Here page number and you format that page number and you say hey man start at 31 or continue from previous

239
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,530
section which will go to 31 directly.

240
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,360
So we got all right.

241
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,080
Now we're in.

242
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,860
This is complicated.

243
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,220
So.

244
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:35,110
So you can skip this if you want to but I've spent years trying to figure this out.

245
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,550
So Section 1 was last section and we're now on Section 2 and Section 2 is just going to be landscape.

246
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,330
So let me bring back that stuff.

247
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,700
OK we're still in section 2.

248
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,690
Okay good.

249
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:55,520
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to change the layout of section to OK time to go orientation.

250
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,810
I would make this landscape see just Section 2 because the different section completely.

251
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,960
This is Section 1 This is Section 2.

252
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:06,870
OK.

253
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,800
It's in landscape mode now.

254
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,750
And so I'm going to bring all that stuff over here.

255
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:21,510
Monthly revenue forecast Okay I turn up before members I can turn back ok we get dragged here and make

256
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,010
it bigger.

257
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,300
And if we want to be consistent just for fun I like to make these things look good.

258
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,340
You can go shadow as well and like that that's fine.

259
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,470
OK good.

260
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,000
How we look at OK.

261
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,250
Good.

262
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,230
That's a section a section break if I turn that off.

263
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,220
You can't see that anymore.

264
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,370
Pain in the gut.

265
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,080
All right.

266
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,360
And I get changed the next section too you'll see.

267
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,960
So going to stick with us for a while.

268
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,940
Looking good.

269
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,690
I want this to apply there the shadow so let's go paint brush that boy there.

270
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,480
Paint brush here.

271
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,550
Good.

272
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,250
All right.

273
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,000
Next slide.

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,030
Where are we at now.

275
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,600
Annual revenue forecast.

276
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,250
Let me get rid of this.

277
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,150
I'll get rid of the sample and I'm going to copy this here.

278
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,430
Final BP.

279
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:14,480
So you know we're good copy and then I'm going to pay this on top.

280
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,000
Here we go.

281
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,910
Pay special as a picture can.

282
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,860
And then we want to look the same.

283
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,120
We're going to go here and paint brushes again to get that bad ass shadow to show up here.

284
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,510
And you can even make these more narrow if you go back here and so he can just kind of select here and

285
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,200
make that little bit less narrow if you want.

286
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,340
Whatever it's up to you.

287
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,090
OK.

288
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,350
Looking good looking good.

289
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,910
And again if you don't have maintenance you can just highlight what you want to copy over and see just

290
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,840
kind of highlight the first couple rows or whatever.

291
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,490
All right so we're done.

292
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,750
What does next page next.

293
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,320
We have got the monthly operating expense forecasts.

294
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,580
And I'm going to copy this immediately.

295
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,100
This first cut this go back here paste.

296
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:07,000
Will select it there oh we've got to arrange this a little bit bigger ginks I mean it more narrow a

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,360
second ago OK that's good.

298
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,780
And if you don't have these items down here that's OK.

299
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,980
You can actually hide these if you want.

300
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:24,550
So you can right click and go hide it's fine and you can unhide them later if you want as well.

301
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,890
So it's going to take a second and pull up a couple rows there just hiding is not the leading.

302
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:37,090
There you got and then what you're going to do is you're going to select this stuff and copy it over

303
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,550
right here and then paste special has a picture.

304
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:54,360
Good and when I go up here and use the same paint brush stuff get great not just for year one if you're

305
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,560
year one is 7:19 will show up at 19 there.

306
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:03,020
And this is just as monthly operating expense that means SGA and R&amp;D and then depreciation as well.

307
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,100
And I can hit control-C Now just let it unhide that.

308
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:09,890
Okay.

309
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,340
And that's optional obviously.

310
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,690
And so the next one we're going to do is just go back here.

311
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,660
While it's thinking next page we have got the annual operating expense forecast back up pulled down

312
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,080
there so let me delete this and that's fine.

313
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,860
But yes we have annual song at least this guy here.

314
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,710
Cut this way.

315
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:38,340
We have all these fields of Pequod excels unthinking Paiste.

316
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:45,310
And here is annual K and again you can get rid of the stuff if you want but let me just pretend that

317
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,920
you had all of these then.

318
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,760
So I'm not going to hide them so I can select this again.

319
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,560
And if you only want a certain number of years you can go up to that year whatever totally up to you.

320
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:00,710
Copy paste special picture.

321
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,300
OK great.

322
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,100
I noticed the footer up there I'll change out in a second if you cut that picture format I can paint

323
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,470
brushes again or select here again a shadow like that.

324
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,820
Good.

325
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,630
And sometimes it actually makes it go to the next patient to do that.

326
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,040
So here's how to make this a little bit smaller and they'll pull it up on the previous page with it

327
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,230
right.

328
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:21,990
OK.

329
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:29,320
Now so inside the margin if you want to change this footer here make it a little bit wider.

330
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:34,140
Just make sure to go to a shape format OK.

331
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,600
And I'm going to make this easier for you.

332
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,360
Don't click up or down take forever.

333
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,950
Just use this here 9.

334
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,840
That's good enough.

335
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:52,360
The can go right to nine and then just get on there and you'll see as we scroll up it looks great.

336
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,210
Let's go to the previous s.c are still there.

337
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:54,970
Good.

338
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,540
We're doing well.

339
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,150
OK good.

340
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,850
And we can turn that off if we want.

341
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,730
Looking good.

342
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,670
Look at that formatting.

343
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,830
Man that's dope.

344
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,570
OK good.

345
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,890
Good.

346
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,210
All right.

347
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:05,670
All right.

348
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,140
And again if you don't have these here you already know how to hide those.

349
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,100
I showed you that.

350
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,840
And you can zoom out a bit too if you want.

351
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,580
You definitely have better eyesight than I do.

352
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,130
OK.

353
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,300
So zoom out.

354
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,080
OK.

355
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,270
And we're going to go get the quarterly and come say I'm glad I made this water now in landscape mode

356
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,840
is going to go up better.

357
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,860
OK so let's get rid of this and I'm gonna cut this thing and show you some really cool things I can

358
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,210
get.

359
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,320
So I cut that we go back here and we paste it and you'll find where it is.

360
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,210
Now watch this.

361
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,970
I'm going to zoom way out and zoom out to 10 percent or 25 percent.

362
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,450
Watch what happens when you zoom out.

363
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,650
This is really cool.

364
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,400
This will help you understand all the fields as well.

365
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,970
You see how the fields are here automatically.

366
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,860
Isn't that neat.

367
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,020
Ignore it over there those replace all me.

368
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,180
But you see all the other fields.

369
00:19:53,430 --> 00:20:00,110
So here's all 13 pages case where we're working our way through case so it's awesome.

370
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,620
I love that.

371
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,200
OK.

372
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,490
So that was page one that was page two page three page four page five page six seven eight nine eight

373
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,590
page now and you could see all the fields here.

374
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,060
That's the income statement forecast on a quarterly basis that's on an annual basis.

375
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,280
So I get to stay out this Farje for minutes for fun.

376
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,920
See if this works.

377
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:25,020
I signed copy and then here I'm going to pay special pases picture and we'll see how it works.

378
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:26,980
Good.

379
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:31,330
Every single thing was shown here and you can even make this a bit wire if you want to.

380
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,600
I think it's fine because it traps the margin.

381
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,710
Can we get to go back up here and paint brush this or we can just format individually like paint brush.

382
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,100
It's fun.
