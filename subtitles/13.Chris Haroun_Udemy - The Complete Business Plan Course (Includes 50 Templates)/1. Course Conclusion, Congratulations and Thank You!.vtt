00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.350
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.090
Hats off to you.

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.290
You've made it you've successfully created an incredible business plan.

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.950
It was a lot of work but it was fun and it was definitely worth it.

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.970
Now you only have to be right in business one time in order to achieve all of your dreams in life.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.620
And I want to thank you for buying this course.

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.810
You are the customer and the customer is always right.

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.770
And if there's anything anything that I can humbly do to add more value to your business model then

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.590
please join me on my weekly free webcast.

10
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.920
Office hours call that occurs every single Thursday.

11
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.250
And please click on the Q&amp;A image that you see here in your Excel document for more details in the call

12
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.370
and please ask me as many questions as you want to on this weekly call.

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.370
Now this call is supposed to be two to three hours every week.

14
00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.150
But I am happy to make this an eight hour call or longer every single week for ever as I want to humbly

15
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.500
answer every single question that you might have about your business model.

16
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.710
If you work for somebody else and you want to join my weekly webcast call and you're concerned that

17
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.700
they might see your user name on my weekly webcast which is replayed than what you can do is you can

18
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.250
create another YouTube account with your nickname.

19
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.810
And what happens as you type in the questions and I answer them in real time and I just want to say

20
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.030
that I've done I failed as your teacher and as your coach and as your friend.

21
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.600
If you don't one day use the contents of this course and launch your own company so that you are self-employed

22
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.100
and you are free to live your life on your own terms.

23
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.680
And I think that it's OK to work for somebody else at a couple of companies so you can learn what to

24
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.930
do and what not to do and you know what I mean.

25
00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.390
But I really humbly don't think that we were meant to work for somebody else for our entire lives and

26
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.650
it's never too early or too late to start your own company.

27
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.670
And the interesting thing is that the average age of somebody starting a company in the United States

28
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.090
is well over 50 years old.

29
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.440
And many young people start companies today because the cost of creating a company is the lowest has

30
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.880
ever been.

31
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.690
As you can access so many more customers and you can access online resources and other online stuff

32
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.850
at a low price or even free.

33
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.470
As explained in this course and the incredible thing is that the life expectancy now has increased by

34
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.310
26 years since 1950.

35
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.670
So that means that you are 26 years younger than you think.

36
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.670
So if you're 46 you're really 20 you're really 20 and so you're it you're you're young at heart by choice.

37
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.860
And so thanks again for joining on this fun journey that we have gone through together.

38
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.580
And my goal is to do whatever it takes to allow you to be independent and to live your life on your

39
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.510
terms by creating your successful business plan.

40
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.960
Thanks again.
