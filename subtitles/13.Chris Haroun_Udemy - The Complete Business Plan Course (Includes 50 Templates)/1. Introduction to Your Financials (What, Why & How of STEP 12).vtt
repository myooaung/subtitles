00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.630
Welcome to step number 12 of the course we're making amazing progress in terms of the why and how of

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.570
Sept. 12 are kicked off the what what are we going to learn.

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.760
We're going to create all of our financial statements by pressing this button here called I a in Step

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.710
12.

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.530
A stands for inputs and analysis as with the other steps in this entire course.

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:33.290
We only change what is in the white sheet of cells now in order to make the process easier to complete.

7
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.130
From a visual design perspective what I did was this I also made the font color in these white shaded

8
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.290
cells blue.

9
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.530
I did this so it's easier to see what to change and I architected the step 12 part of your spreadsheet

10
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.560
so that you only have to complete the inputs and analysis.

11
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.760
I mean the I a button here.

12
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.510
OK let's move on to why.

13
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.230
Why did I architect this step.

14
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.410
So all you have to do is change the contents of the data.

15
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.350
Because after you complete this IAEA or inputs analysis tab by completing the white Sheas cells with

16
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.810
blue fonts then what happens is this is pretty cool.

17
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.550
Then in the next five tabs you will automatically have all your stuff all of your financial statements

18
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.290
created for you everything meaning the revenue tab which is our Eevee the i s tab which stands for income

19
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.980
statement the biggest tab are the best.

20
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.330
Hi I'm 12.

21
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.930
The best ad which stands for balance sheet the C-f tab which stands for cash flow statement and you'll

22
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:52.950
also notice notice that there is a another tab a tab called all L L and L L all contains all of the

23
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.490
financial statements and all of the financial ratios that will be automatically created for you.

24
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:07.800
And I made this with a tab called all as it contains a one tab snapshot of everything that you will

25
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.140
include in the Step 12 section of your financials meaning your business plan.

26
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.690
OK.

27
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:23.100
Now why not include this other tab here called R E V which stands for revenue because the most important

28
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.450
thing the most important driver when you're forecasting the future by creating financial statement models.

29
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.430
The most important driver is revenue can revenue goes to the top of the income state.

30
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.780
That's why they call it the top line and when they say the bottom line that's profits which is the bottom

31
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.490
net income.

32
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.760
The bottom of your your income statement.

33
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.240
OK so what happens is when you're modeling financials and I've done a lot of this work when I worked

34
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.870
on Wall Street and the hedge fund sector and the venture capital sector.

35
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.870
But when you're doing financial modeling the most important thing to forecast is revenue.

36
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.160
Because a lot of other things on your other financial statements are all just simply a percent of revenue.

37
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.080
Financial modeling is a lot easier than we think.

38
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.640
OK.

39
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.570
Lastly how how are we going to complete Sept. 12th.

40
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.340
So I'm going to walk you through in a lot of detail starting in the next lecture on how to complete

41
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.680
every single cell in the I mean the inputs and analysis.

42
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.630
And I'm going to help you understand what's in the five tabs after the tap.

43
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.180
OK.

44
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.960
Meaning the revenue tab the income statement tab the balance sheet tab the cash flow tab and the all

45
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.370
tab as well.

46
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.160
OK.

47
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.110
Now if you already understand a lot about accounting and finance then just please skip to the next lecture

48
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.350
right now.

49
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.610
But what I want to do is I want to explain to you briefly what an income statement is what a balance

50
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.370
sheet is.

51
00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.390
A Cashell statement is and how all three of those financial statements are connected so that you can

52
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.970
enjoy completing this section OK.

53
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.400
So let me let me kick it off with the income statement.

54
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.770
OK.

55
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.240
So and when I explain this stuff to you.

56
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.090
Way to kind of think about what what if these statements didn't exist how would we keep track of all

57
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.480
of our the stuff we own the money we make the money.

58
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.900
OK.

59
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.450
So it's actually a really brilliant process so let me start off with the income statement.

60
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.140
Ok so like I mentioned earlier the income stay at the top is your revenue which is also called sales.

61
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.690
And sometimes you hear people say what your top line growth.

62
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.400
And basically what they're saying is what's the growth of revenue or sales.

63
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.350
And like I said earlier sometimes you'll people here.

64
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.330
You'll hear people say what's the bottom line and what's your bottom line growth.

65
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.850
Well at the bottom of the income statement is net income your profits.

66
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.640
That's YOUR BOTTOM LINE.

67
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.770
And so what happens is the income statements when you file taxes the income statement is the easiest

68
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.280
statement to understand.

69
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.890
And all it does is it basically calculates the cost.

70
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.590
How much money you're making minus all the expenses and costs you can understand what the bottom line

71
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.850
is what the profitability is.

72
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:21.910
Now does that mean that after we take revenue and we deduct all the expenses meaning salaries for people

73
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.320
cars whatever it might be to run our business.

74
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.250
Does that mean if we take all those expenses deducted from revenue that we know how much more Caproni

75
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.940
get in our pocket.

76
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.380
No because the income statement is kind of a lie.

77
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.270
Now explain what this means.

78
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.560
So what happens is governments from an accounting perspective don't fall asleep on me from an accounting

79
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.660
perspective governments what they do is this they allow you to depreciate certain items over a long

80
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.200
period of time.

81
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.290
I'll explain it this means and this will make a lot of sense why we have the cash flow soon.

82
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.930
But we're still the comes to market.

83
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.730
So let's say that you wanted to buy this.

84
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.320
OK.

85
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.950
And this costs a lot of money.

86
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.480
OK this is pretend but whatever.

87
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.940
And what the government does it allows you to finance things or buy things and then deduct how much

88
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.720
you use of this.

89
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.640
Every single year it's called depreciation.

90
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.140
So let's say that you bought this for 100 bucks and this will last you 10 years.

91
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:36.030
And every year you can depreciate or expense 10 percent in this case every year.

92
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.100
OK so 10 bucks that's 10 percent a hundred bucks every year.

93
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:46.510
And the reason that depreciation is awesome is because it allows you to pay less in tax because you

94
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.460
treat depreciation as expense even though you're not paying cash every year for that.

95
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.940
You already bought it.

96
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.490
OK.

97
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:59.200
I know it's a little bit elusive but the reason that governments do this also is they want you to always

98
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.080
have the best equipment and the newest equipment.

99
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.800
And so they kind of entice you to buy new stuff and it helps the economy too.

100
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.710
And depreciation is different for all products.

101
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:16.810
So in most countries when you buy a computer you can depreciate that over two years.

102
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.050
When you buy software you can appreciate that over one year.

103
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.750
OK.

104
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.180
So that's enough on depreciation when it comes to buying products.

105
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.820
There's also something else which is well outside the scope of this course which is amortization.

106
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.270
Right.

107
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:37.450
So if you buy a company and you pay a big premium then the premium that you paid can be amortized or

108
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.890
deduct each year.

109
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.470
That's not a real cash expense.

110
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.850
All right so now that we understand the income statement and by the way when it comes to financial ratios

111
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.310
just stay with me and watch the next couple of lectures and I'll explain how the financial ratios are

112
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.440
calculated and exactly what they mean.

113
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.000
Okay.

114
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.990
And I don't want you to please ever memorized accounting and finance.

115
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.530
I want you to understand it because if you understand it then it's lot more fun and if you understand

116
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.750
then you'll remember forever.

117
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:04.620
OK.

118
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:10.330
Now explain when they can save minutes and I explained how when you take revenue and you deduct all

119
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:15.780
the expenses the profitability doesn't mean the increase in cash in your pocket.

120
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:21.950
Each each each each quarter or each month or each year because depreciation is the non-tax expense for

121
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.360
example.

122
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.450
So what happens is we look at what's called the cash flow statement re if the income statement a and

123
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.430
it doesn't tell you really what the changes in your your.

124
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:37.620
Your cash in your pocket every month or every quarter every year then the cash flow statement corrects

125
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.300
it for you.

126
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:44.030
It tells you how much additional cash you have in your pocket that hurts each each.

127
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.600
Each financial period.

128
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:46.810
OK good.

129
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.680
Now that we under-staffed Mihailo perspective what an income statement is and what a cash flow statement

130
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.390
is.

131
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.520
Let's quickly talk about the balance sheet.

132
00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:02.460
So how do we keep track of what we own and what we owe meaning debt how do we do that.

133
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:08.070
Well it's not in the income statement the income statement just tracks what money what your revenue

134
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.100
expenses are.

135
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.800
The cash flow statement just tracks you know how much cash you're getting in your pocket at the end

136
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.520
of each period.

137
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.520
A ballot sheet will tell you exactly what you own and what you will.

138
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:21.060
OK.

139
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.960
So let me I'll use a different example this time.

140
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.990
OK I'll use this as this bad ass one here and I'm not going to peel off the stickers because it says

141
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.340
DTL which I think is another company.

142
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:31.680
OK.

143
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.570
Copyright infringement this is pretend.

144
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:34.840
All right.

145
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:43.950
So on a balance sheet and everything that you own everything in this world is either owned by you a

146
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.940
bank a government entity or somebody else.

147
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.020
It's all about cheap.

148
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.110
We'll tell you what you own and where you go.

149
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.200
OK and who owns your stuff.

150
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.290
And it's called a balance sheet for a reason.

151
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:56.950
OK.

152
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.610
And I'm going to humbly challenge you in a loving way to think about this a different way.

153
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:01.820
OK.

154
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.880
So a balance sheet has two sides.

155
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.840
OK it's got stuff you have right now and who owns your stuff.

156
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.780
OK.

157
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:15.600
So stuff that you that you have in your possession that you own is called Assets.

158
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.390
OK.

159
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.640
This is an asset.

160
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.310
OK so let's pretend that you paid 100 bucks for this.

161
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.050
OK.

162
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.880
And it was really expensive.

163
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.870
So you got a loan for half of it.

164
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.700
OK from a bank because you have this hundred or it on one side.

165
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:36.790
But now you've got a hundred here and the other side of the scale the balance sheet is not balanced

166
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:42.630
well on the other side is who owns this.

167
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:49.530
OK so because a hundred bucks and you have here is an asset and you only paid for half it you only own

168
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.660
half of it.

169
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.740
That's called equity equity is something you own.

170
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.420
So you have 50 bucks in ownership of the $100 thing is still not balanced.

171
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.700
And the other part is liabilities.

172
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.590
You've got a loan for 50 bucks.

173
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.020
OK it balances good.

174
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.690
Hundred bucks is the asset on one side and the balance sheet.

175
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:16.820
The other side is 50 bucks in equity you own invests in 50 bucks in a loan meaning you owe somebody

176
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.390
else for it.

177
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.320
It balances.

178
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.090
OK.

179
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:19.920
All right.

180
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:25.750
And as we walk through your financial statements this will make it a lot more sense to ask as well.

181
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.920
Anyway I hope you enjoy the next couple of lectures.

182
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:35.210
I spent a lot of time putting this financial model together for you based on stuff I've learned working

183
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.260
on Wall Street and starting companies et cetera.

184
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.620
And I made it as simple as possible.

185
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:45.440
So there's just one point of entry the button and then all the other stuff is automatically created

186
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.080
for you and this is really powerful especially when it comes to putting your entire business plan together

187
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.810
which will do very very soon.

188
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.420
Thanks.
