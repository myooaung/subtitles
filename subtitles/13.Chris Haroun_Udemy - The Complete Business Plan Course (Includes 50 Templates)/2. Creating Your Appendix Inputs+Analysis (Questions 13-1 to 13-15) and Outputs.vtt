00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.360
Please click on the button called inputs and analysis for step 13.

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.330
Appendix This is give me a short and easy lesson.

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.550
So I put a lot of yes or no questions here.

4
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:19.220
And so the first one here is just asking a basic question which is have you included your resume or

5
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.890
do you have your resume ready at Microsoft Word format if you want it can be in other formats too so

6
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.340
just like yes or no and just gather them up for yourself.

7
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.730
And if you have lots of employees list them all here so I've got SARL and Jozen which is automatically

8
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.970
brought across if you don't have a name of a person for an employee number one this will appear blank

9
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.350
and it will say Please scroll down.

10
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.370
Ignore this.

11
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.370
Same thing with Ryan Reynolds.

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.660
It's a Deadpool.

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.190
Part two is pretty funny.

14
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.410
OK.

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.170
Paul Parwan I think a lot of records for R-rated movie and cat.

16
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.480
All right.

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.630
So anyway it's asking you to pace all that stuff and I wrote here are not pacing just yes or no questions

18
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.830
or answers is really easy.

19
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.690
So I go here if you have any product or services brochures or PBS that you get to pinocle customers

20
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.070
just get it ready because we're going to paste it into our output soon okay.

21
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.950
So just say yes or no here or not applicable.

22
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.730
And then here if you want you can include financial statements in the appendix.

23
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.760
Not all of them in Step 12.

24
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.010
I recommend putting everything in where I told you to put it in.

25
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.110
But some people are different stylistically I get it.

26
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.610
Some people want some of the additional financial statements that you don't use that often.

27
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.900
Like maybe Cashell statement belge in the appendix your call your call I try to make it simple for you

28
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.920
and cater to everybody.

29
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.880
OK.

30
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.300
And just answer these questions yes no are not applicable.

31
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.890
And then here I just told you you can write down here if you have any other documents that you want

32
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.460
included you can make a note of it here.

33
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.060
And even if you wanted to you could actually go here and red flag you just to remind yourself to come

34
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.940
back to it later and you know do that so that will ultimately create a flight here in 13.

35
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.100
Once it updates which it should do please work it works ok.

36
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.810
I worked so hard on the spreadsheet.

37
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.670
It was fun though.

38
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.770
OK.

39
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.670
So we are now done with the with the appendix.

40
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.350
And you can always go over here to the right obviously and you can write down notes and then if you

41
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.430
flag something and go look at the notes there.

42
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.920
