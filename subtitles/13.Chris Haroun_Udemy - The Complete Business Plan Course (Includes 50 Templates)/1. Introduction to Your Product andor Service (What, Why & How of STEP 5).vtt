00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.430
Welcome to step 5 of the course in terms of what why and how of Step 5 are kicked off of the what are

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.680
we going to learn.

3
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:14.410
We will learn about how to create an incredibly impactful discussion of what our product and or our

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.280
service is including a description of the important things to discuss from a qualitative perspective.

5
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:30.280
If a couple like not only what the product or service is but our quality control procedures are how

6
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.020
we manufacture the product if applicable what our return policy is and other topics like warranties

7
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.470
distribution.

8
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.870
Is it scalable.

9
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.960
The business model that is the packaging strategy that we have now from a quantitative perspective we

10
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.590
will discuss your current and future pricing strategy as well as input prices volume discounts and and

11
00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.130
as always if applicable if you have a freemium or premium pricing strategy which happens with a lot

12
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:07.130
of people that create apps or software online Also we'll talk about other volume discount topics.

13
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.440
Do you want to bundle your product et cetera.

14
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.610
Okay let's move on to why why are we being so thorough with our qualitative analysis.

15
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.640
And as a side note.

16
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.110
The reason the financial section is way way in the back of the Course is because everything we discussed

17
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.880
before Step 12 can be used as an input into our financial section.

18
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.200
OK so a lot of what we discussed prior to Step 12 will be a little bit more qualitative and this will

19
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.010
all make a lot more sense to you by the time we get to Step 12 into our financials.

20
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.530
Lastly how how are we going to put together the step 5 product and services or services portion of our

21
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.210
business plan.

22
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.900
As with all steps were to answer a bunch of questions in the inputs and analysis as part of the course

23
00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.700
part of the business plan here where we can see if a couple simple answers from SHARC virtual reality

24
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.120
as well.

25
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.030
So Tony sharks helping us out we can always look at his sample answers if you want.

26
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.520
In our answers will feed from the input section into the step 5 outputs and you'll see that I included

27
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.280
a couple of checkboxes that you can disable items that are just not applicable to your business plan

28
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.920
including if you're creating a product or a service and vice versa.

29
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.340
Thanks.
