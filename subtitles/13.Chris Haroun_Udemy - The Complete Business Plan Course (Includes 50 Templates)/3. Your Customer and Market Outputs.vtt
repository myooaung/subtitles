00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:09.540
Please click this button here for Step 6 outputs and this is automatically populated for you as with

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.640
all the previous steps.

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.250
And there's a couple of different optional fields that I put in here as well we can turn them off so

4
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.770
most people won't do customer survey research.

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.800
I recommend doing it but you can always turn that off there which will turn off later on to automatically

6
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.090
you'll see this will filter through nicely by the time we create the final business plan.

7
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.160
Here you've got customer service you can turn on or turn off the customer response time based on whether

8
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.400
it's it's it applies to your business model or not.

9
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.400
Same thing with customer loyalty.

10
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.870
Same thing with customer profile documentation meaning your email marketing campaign how you collect

11
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.570
information from from potential customers and and current customers.

12
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.280
And then here you can turn off or on the warranty policy and on or off the search trends.

13
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.750
I recommend talking about industry search trends because it shows a quantitative perspective that you've

14
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.810
been really thoughtful with your analysis of the industry as well and documented it in your business

15
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.020
plan and a lot of people you meet with are more quantitative oriented instead of being qualitative and

16
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.910
they'll want data and they'll ask you about data.

17
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.130
And some investors are people that are interested in your business model or business plan.

18
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.020
I only asked about qualitative stuff we cover everything in this cautious in case.

19
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.450
Here's BT barriers to entry if you entry anything.

20
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.200
And as always you have my sample answers here at in yours as well.

21
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.880
Many people won't care about what the total addressable market is going to be in five years because

22
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.180
they're just kind of creating a business plan and looking one or two years instead of five or ten I

23
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.310
recommend looking longer term by just me seasonality.

24
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.080
Not every business has seasonality but I think it's important to document it.

25
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.230
If you do have seasonality and when we create your financial model to gather in Step 12 you're going

26
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.790
to see a lot of the stuff that we've covered will feed into that in seasonality is going to be a part

27
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.420
of that as well.

28
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.460
Meaning if you have higher revenue or sales which is the same thing sales revenues same thing.

29
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.220
But if you go higher revenue in sales in Q4 versus say Q1 which is usually seasonally quite slow if

30
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.150
you have any questions about this please let me know otherwise I will see you in step 7 where we'll

31
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.350
talk about competition.

32
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.790
Thanks.
