1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,910
Welcome to Step 11 of course in terms of the what why and how of Step 11.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,160
I'll kick it off for the one.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,320
What are we going to learn.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,080
This part of the business plan creation process allows us to talk about any material risks that we have

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,300
not discussed yet in steps 1 through 10 including future macroeconomic risks the emergence of future

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,140
competitors risk future changes in technology that could impact our product or service even if we're

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,290
not starting a tech company.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,860
I also included a question on what is your disaster recovery strategy just in case your Web site gets

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,100
hacked or there's a fire at your headquarters etc..

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,900
And I also included a question that I love asking CEOs and entrepreneurs which is optional.

11
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:59,940
But is this what is the most mis understood aspect of your business model by potential investors or

12
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,290
customers or employees or partners.

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:11,290
In addition I included a question on other potential risks in case we have not yet disclosed other material

14
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,010
potential risks in our business plan so far.

15
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:22,270
Now as a quick side note if there are other documents or items that you want to include like resumes

16
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,540
for exhibits etc. We'll talk about this.

17
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,670
In step 13 which is the appendix step.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,860
OK let's go back to Step 11 now let's move on to why.

19
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:39,550
Why are we discussing so many risks and other topics like disaster recovery because the reader of the

20
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:45,670
business plan will really appreciate this as it shows how thoughtful and thorough your business plan

21
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:53,740
is and this will give your reader and you as well more confidence in the success potential of your company.

22
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,250
Lastly how how are we going to complete Step 11.

23
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,390
Well after we answer the questions in this inputs and analysis tab then you will see in the output section

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:12,070
that I have also included the option to turn off the topic of the most undershoot the most misunderstood

25
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,730
aspect of your business model.

26
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,940
Although I do recommend that you include this in your business plan.

27
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,240
But I understand also that you know.

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,790
If you want to exclude it that's cool because we're all different stylistically when it comes to documenting

29
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,230
our business plans.

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,570
Thanks.
