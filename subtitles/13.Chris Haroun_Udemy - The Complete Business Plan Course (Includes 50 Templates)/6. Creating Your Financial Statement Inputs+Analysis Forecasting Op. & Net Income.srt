1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,510
Now we look at income or losses from operations and I'll just double click this thing I show you what's

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,360
inside.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:18,590
So our income from operations is revenue that C-8 minus what is c. 45 will go down here.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,990
The cost of goods sold.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,960
See it's red minus see 74.

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,000
Whoops the total for

7
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,650
this one here tonight.

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:42,160
It's right there don't I saw might but minus three or three way down there.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,410
I gave you tons of lines if you wanted to for S-G and a lot of other buckets there for you.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,620
You can leave a lot of them blank if you want but I could for you as well.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,420
OK.

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,820
So we got three or three Yeah right there.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,920
Again I don't know why it's not color but it's right there and then minus.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,380
One more thing which I think is going to be depreciation see depreciation.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:05,850
OK.

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:13,060
So we got revenue minus all of our expenses and now we have right here hit escape just to get to there.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,300
Right there you have got our total income or loss of operations so if it's a loss it's negative.

18
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,230
And notice that these are not white.

19
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,440
You cannot click and these cells are not blue either.

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,150
So let's take a.

21
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,530
We've entered a lot of data.

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,570
Now what I want to do is I want a close look on an annual basis just look at the future.

23
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,380
OK good so you can see here.

24
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,740
Let's just look at income OK.

25
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,460
We're looking at how much money we're making before taxes.

26
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,670
And we're not going pay tax if we're not making money.

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,820
So we lose two hundred twenty four thousand dollars this year we lose 100 25000 a year for that.

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,700
And then look at this.

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,490
We're going to break even in 2020 so for our milestones if you wanted to and this is all completely

30
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,740
optional but for the milestones you can talk about when your milestones being when you break even.

31
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,560
So in this hypothetical example it's 2020 and if you red flagged the milestone to come back to it for

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,460
the break even you can go and flag that and just enter and text them.

33
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,260
We will break even by 2020.

34
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,910
We anticipate breaking until spring and then here 2021.

35
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,220
Look at this.

36
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,200
There's leverage in the model.

37
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,430
That's a beautiful thing.

38
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,820
Look at me.

39
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,980
OK.

40
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,170
Now we're only percent of revenue.

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:34,980
And so this here is going to calculate our income from operations to as a percent of revenue.

42
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,680
So we looked at percent of revenue.

43
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:43,790
What we were doing the same thing here with income from operations operating income margin so negative

44
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,370
91 percent because this year is a bigger number way bigger number than our revenue.

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,190
And then this year it gets better.

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,290
And now it's positive.

47
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,670
Our operating profit margins are now 15 percent that divided by revenue is 15 percent.

48
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:05,920
DoubleClick and it says that yeah that's that line their current income or lost the by the by revenue.

49
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,600
And I put a dollar sign there to lock in the eighth row which is rampant and I could have also tagged

50
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,150
it and called it something else.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,870
OK.

52
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,610
Yeah I didn't tag this.

53
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,660
Oh I actually got the financials and put total income or all losses from operations so you can always

54
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,960
come back to here by clicking here dropdown.

55
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,110
I know the drill.

56
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,140
OK.

57
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:32,540
And now we've got some really healthy profit margins here so a lot of software companies get the profit

58
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,240
margins usually maximum 50 percent or so.

59
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,400
The good ones are around 30 percent.

60
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,500
If it's a services company usually 20 percent or 15 percent if you're Accenture because you don't make

61
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,890
as much money by billing people by the hour.

62
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,460
But you make a lot more money by selling software because you kind of sell it online and you have to

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,640
have manufacturing capabilities etc..

64
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,320
Just as an example.

65
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,050
All right.

66
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,070
So this is the annual numbers.

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,250
And then if we scroll over here over here there you go you can see the spark lines here.

68
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,550
OK.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,490
So here's our our annual income loss that's a loss loss loss or slightly positive here and then really

70
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,580
really positive.

71
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,130
And our operating margins just that the rate of change is there as well.

72
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,890
Okay great.

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,010
And if we open up all of these we can actually see it on a monthly basis.

74
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,840
I'm not going to come back to that.

75
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:22,500
Okay.

76
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:31,020
So moving on down we've got something called Ebbitt which is accounting for earnings before I tricked

77
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,710
dumb accounting.

78
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,710
Just kidding sorry that humor earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization.

79
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,770
And let me explain what that means.

80
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,180
You have these non-cash expenses like depreciation.

81
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,070
It's not fair to always account for it.

82
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,970
It's an accounting thing because you get tax breaks so the reason you account for depreciation is it

83
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,940
lowers how much money you have to pay in taxes because it's an expense that's a good thing.

84
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,800
However when you're thinking about how much extra cash is going to go in your pockets before I said

85
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,310
if you wash the first lecture in the section I said that the the the income statement is a lie.

86
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,630
And it doesn't really tell you the truth what real kashering says and that's why with Cashell say buy

87
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,510
through this in here would be helpful for you.

88
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,600
And people refer to these as margins.

89
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,420
So if you take earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization to out of those markets.

90
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,390
And so all I did here is you can take out depreciation.

91
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,010
So let me open this up so I can explain how this works in more detail so let's look at it for one year

92
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,370
here.

93
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:38,870
Can't let the screen refresh control left Carol I love using the up and down arrow buttons left to right

94
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,760
is better than using a mouse when you're modeling.

95
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,660
All right so even if I don't click and you show you what it means and looks like I've got a written

96
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,560
English up here.

97
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,530
So what I'm going to do is I'm taking our income or loss we calculate before the.

98
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,900
And we're going to add back depreciation because depreciation is a non cash expense.

99
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:04,860
And so that is going to be higher than what our income is from operations or loss of operations.

100
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:12,730
So here we have it's seventeen thousand seven hundred which is higher than this.

101
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,890
It's about a thousand bucks better.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,420
And so you'll notice that that is the reason we look at it that also which is earnings for interest

103
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:27,570
taxes depreciation amortization is so it more closely resembles what our tax or what our what our cash

104
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:34,770
amount is and what we do is in different countries there's different tax laws different interest laws

105
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,360
different depreciation laws so we're going to compare two companies from different countries with different

106
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,420
tax laws.

107
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,220
It makes sense to compare them on that basis.

108
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,410
That's one of the reasons you look at it as well.

109
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,730
OK so we're now done with it.

110
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:54,390
OK we'll wrap up the income statement input's discussion here and after this part we're going to move

111
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:00,030
down on the same spreadsheet to talk about balance sheet and you'll see that the cash flow statements

112
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,330
automatically created for you.

113
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,220
You have to enter anything because if I give you an income statement about sheet cash flows created

114
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,420
for you the statement entirely It's amazing but the balance we've got to do a couple thing but before

115
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,870
we go they're going to finish off the income statement here.

116
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,470
So now we've got what are called below the line items it's just nerd talk for items that usually don't

117
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:26,040
repeat that often because so if you have other places you're making money from make interest in the

118
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,470
bank IList here or if you're have other miscellaneous negative payments you haven't accounted for above

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,260
in expenses you'd make it negative which would be in brackets here.

120
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
So I'm going to skip that.

121
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,380
And then if you entered and you can look at this parklands of course and remember to keep all these

122
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,180
things open after you're done with this so that they all the charts can and can update automatically

123
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,440
and the data can be pulled in.

124
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:49,960
Okay.

125
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,640
So now we've got total income or loss.

126
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,040
If it's in brackets we've got a loss here.

127
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,030
All everything before taxes.

128
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,810
Okay.

129
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,890
And we're not going to pay taxes because of course we're not making money.

130
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:09,640
And so what happens is in a lot of countries you got to talk to your account and a lot of regions within

131
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,400
countries you get these awesome tax breaks.

132
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,460
And what this means is you calculate how much tax you would have paid that year anyway.

133
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,940
And it goes into a bucket and that bucket is called an O L which stands for net operating loss.

134
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,020
And you can carry forward those operating loss amounts.

135
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:39,470
So for example I keep a generic let's say here that normally you pay 50 percent tax and this is just

136
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:46,070
for an example that's obviously high but that would be about let's just call it at nine thousand something

137
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,780
so $9000 tax cap that you'd pay that if that was a positive number.

138
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,870
So we get $9000 and we put it in a bucket.

139
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:00,820
And when we had to pay our first nine thousand dollars in tax we don't because we have a $9000 credit.

140
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,280
And then when there's nothing left in that bucket then we start paying taxes.

141
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,220
So that's how you calculate it anyway a little bit outside the scope of this course.

142
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,780
But you can do it that way.

143
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,260
And so there's no taxes.

144
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:19,770
And then once you do break even your bucket is filled up or it's completely empty then you'd pay taxes.

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,300
And depending on what country you're in and your tax rate you'd enter it here.

146
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,030
And so every country is different.

147
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,910
Every region is different.

148
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,310
Some places 30 percent some it's 40.

149
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,460
I know some places like riced invest investments in software companies only in Internet years ago and

150
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:43,190
I remember when I invested in Checkpoint S.H. KP which which I think is in Israel in Tel Aviv you had

151
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,960
this tax break.

152
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,070
There was only 12 percent tax versus every other software company it looked like S&amp;P in Germany or Oracle

153
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,100
in California my troughing in Redmond Washington et cetera.

154
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,210
They had you know much higher over over 30 percent.

155
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:02,080
And Germany was a little bit tougher for me because I had to account for FX swings foreign exchange.

156
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,720
OK so now net income is calculated for us.

157
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,220
And at the bottom here I've got net income as a percent of total revenue.

158
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,470
That's important.

159
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,950
That's net income margins.

160
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,540
And you can see they're negative they're just terrible.

161
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,330
And then they get really really good soon negative negative Oh hello 2020 we're 15 percent now 49 percent

162
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,250
50 percent which is unheard of high.

163
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:25,850
It's amazing.

164
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,930
It's great that we have a great company right.

165
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,360
So anyway all that stuff is created for us.

166
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,770
And so we're now done with the income statement and I can I'll show you what the real formal income

167
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,220
statement looks here and then I'll show you really quickly and then we'll go in the balance sheet.

168
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,060
The next lecture.

169
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,360
So everything is pulled in here for you remember.

170
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,530
And these are not blue fonts with a white background so you can't type in looks.

171
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,780
It's actually gray but they're not blue.

172
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:57,350
And every time you got something green means it was pulled from another sheet.

173
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,060
This is not green because it's just to some of these I mean it's here but everything is pulled forward

174
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,520
automatically.

175
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,150
And so if we scroll down we could see everything is just pulled forward as GNAS.

176
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,100
There are inti a separate line.

177
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,120
I mean we did and this is on a quarterly basis.

178
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:17,730
Right.

179
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,630
So we did $3000 per month Bresciano our for R&amp;D.

180
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,270
And so that's there and you can look at the spark lines here.

181
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:31,130
It's just easier because you're looking at fewer buckets here and there's higher depreciation as well

182
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,050
which which we covered for that was a thousand bucks per month.

183
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,480
So $3000 per quarter okay.

184
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,450
And then you see everything as a percent of revenue.

185
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,770
Got it.

186
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:52,130
And you'll see that it is higher meaning less bad than income from operations because even that is just

187
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,340
adding back depreciation because depreciation is not a tax expense or per capita expense right.

188
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,450
It's back.

189
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,510
So anyway you can double click on things just to learn more about them and then you can just make this

190
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,100
little bit wider.

191
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,070
You can actually see the text below but this just feeds from the previous the screen wins from that

192
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,910
from the previous.

193
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,800
So we didn't do taxes as well.

194
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,220
So you can just open those up if you can learn more about it.

195
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,140
Malls can be a little bit different but I think I understand how it all works.

196
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,200
Then you've got your SPARC lines here.

197
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,860
And the reason it looks different is because some of these ones and twos are open and some are not.

198
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,980
OK.

199
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,260
So leave all that open so we are now done with the with the income statement which which is great.

200
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:42,100
But before we go from us I'm not going to click away because if I do it will go to the very top of it.

201
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:48,420
So I'm going to go down here and click here and puts her financials and I did that in Kiska last fired

202
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,140
click there right now which I won't take you right to the top.

203
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,020
Right.

204
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,800
So now we are done.

205
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,500
And before we move on and talk about balance sheet items which are below.

206
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,040
And we already know think of saving looks like it's great.

207
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,640
And we were interested in this guy revenue which he built.

208
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,960
What I want to do is you can go here and show you yes revenue.

209
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,060
This just pulls directly from the previous tab as well.

210
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,800
It's revenue that we calculate.

211
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,050
We had the two line items and look at this well I pulled it over KBR goggles.

212
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,600
It's the maintenance.

213
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,920
I pulled that name over here so this is green.

214
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,600
So you cannot change it.

215
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,110
I mean you can but you know me.

216
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,500
So that stuff is all here.

217
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,980
I want to break it out separately just because it's interesting to look at revenue in a nutshell on

218
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,260
itself because revenue is so important Everything is driven off revenue.

219
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,840
Pretty much everything in the financial statement almost everything.

220
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,750
That's why we spent so much time on revenue.

221
00:13:51,210 --> 00:14:01,980
Now I go back home and I'm going to scroll down and I'm going to show you it's it's so big that these

222
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,410
items have been updated every five years.

223
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,350
So you can see I'm going to zoom out a touch your sorry about this.

224
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,710
Your eyes are better than mine I promise you that.

225
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,240
OK.

226
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,210
Revenant.

227
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,130
So here you can mouseover and I should tell you the numbers well it's kind of it's pretty strong.

228
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,880
Awesome.

229
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,140
All right.

230
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,710
So revenue growth is amazing.

231
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,220
And then net income was.

232
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,470
We lost a ton of money and it got less bad than we broke even 2020.

233
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,030
And then there you we made those two years and here we've got the we got some of the formulas here.

234
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,330
So I did not do.

235
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,200
This is the one year two year five years ten years out.

236
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,340
And so I didn't update anything in 10 years but I did hear you.

237
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,820
So here's revenue.

238
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,180
And it just shows you what the numbers are here as well.

239
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,650
We got here it's 2000 2 4 9 1 6.

240
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,910
When I was 6 I was 19 is 4 four go to one.

241
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,720
Great.

242
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:06,910
And then 2022 is eight 3:09 That's the fifth year I go here 3:9 right there.

243
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:13,010
And then we got net income here which pulls forward and you always know exactly where from and I'll

244
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,990
go into the final pit slide and a little more detail very soon.

245
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,200
Net income we've got here is negative.

246
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,100
Two hundred and twenty four.

247
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,420
See mouseover then it goes to.

248
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,940
Are you going to show me or not.

249
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:31,580
Maybe you have to assume and get a little bit pay fine and then 2020 to our net income is 4 8 8 2 0

250
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,120
8.

251
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,900
See on the left there matches which is great and our gross margins for 2008 team.

252
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:43,480
Gross margin is revenue minus the costs get sold all that divided by revenue.

253
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,910
So in brackets revenue is Costco so close brackets divided by revenue.

254
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,110
Native 1 percent.

255
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,820
We're losing money the first year on stuff we make then we're positive and we're really positive.

256
00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:00,470
And I didn't do data for that 10th year there and there's a couple of other ratios like return on assets

257
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,300
and return on equity which we'll talk about in the balance sheets actually.

258
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,300
Most people don't care about that stuff or look at it closely initially in a business plan because it's

259
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,950
all about revenue growth initially and you know earnings and most companies are not profitable immediately.

260
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,930
So that's it.

261
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,160
We are done with the income statement and in the next lecture I'll continue with the Belge.

262
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,490
Thanks.
