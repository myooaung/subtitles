00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.280
All right this is the last lecture for the Excel how to section and what I'll do is I'll just show you

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.960
the miscellaneous stuff I haven't covered yet.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.930
I'll kick it off here with the checkboxes So the checkboxes don't work that well.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.060
They're a little finicky.

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.450
And so what I had to do was maximize this you've got to make sure you got the developer tab there.

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.260
If it isn't there on Windows or Mac version or Excel then do a search on line for your head at it.

7
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.150
And then what you do is you add these here.

8
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.860
So it's not perfect but ready.

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.240
So it's really finicky.

10
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.370
But and then when you start typing in there with the name you can't see what you're typing until it's

11
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.600
till you're finished typing it.

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.950
So watch this flight control for all.

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.140
And then I start typing.

14
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.220
Chris is here.

15
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.770
It's slow and Lot his first letter to the shop is finished anyway whatever.

16
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.030
So all this does is when you use a checkbox It adds.

17
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.770
True or false to itself.

18
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.090
So if you're right click Like always you right click to tell it what to point to.

19
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.850
So if you go to form a control and then what you do is you just tell it where to put true or false right

20
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.130
here Reyher other acts.

21
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.500
And then when you click it it will say true or false.

22
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.260
So if I click here what happens there you'll see true or false period.

23
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.380
True and then falsify turned off

24
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.590
a false look.

25
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.960
And all I did here was for this guy here.

26
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.370
I just basically set it so that if this box is checked it's going to turn off.

27
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.120
Boarded the ship there it's gone.

28
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.730
And then here if you click my performances off one's computer but if you click here and basically what

29
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:59.860
I did was I created this little cell way down below and I said if this thing here is false then make

30
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.170
whatever is here blank.

31
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.140
So I don't know if it's true make it blank.

32
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.170
If it's false make it that so basically because it's false it's that I'll start with the opposite.

33
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.950
And you know I'm getting it.

34
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.750
So what I'm doing is this I'm going to go down here to show you where I got it from

35
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.590
a painful.

36
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.750
OK so you're going peers very fast.

37
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.840
But if you paste it here it's going to go down below and it's going to grab it.

38
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.470
See here that's it is the board on or off.

39
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.410
And I name that Z the check Sept. 3 board.

40
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.780
I did that for an hour for milestone and product image.

41
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.270
That's it.

42
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.380
That's all I did.

43
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.780
And then basically it's going to point back down.

44
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.710
We find it real in here it's going to point back down to those pointers below and then switches on or

45
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:58.790
off ourselves if that checkbox way down there makes it true then do this otherwise do that and K3 31

46
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.800
is where I got the data from I guess right.

47
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.300
So yes you can copy that.

48
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.250
Ok cool smart.

49
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.290
All right.

50
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.560
And that is that's.

51
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.120
Let's see if there's anything else but something here in presentation slides.

52
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.650
This one here for the hyperlinks.

53
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.700
You can just you can right click and it's hyperlink or you can create a formula to hyperlink and then

54
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.880
basically what I did was I just made it link back to wherever wherever this came from.

55
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.280
By right clicking I.

56
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.660
This is hard coding but whatever.

57
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.820
It worked.

58
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.700
And then what I did was I put a hyperlink in and then the hyperlink was just pointing to a reserve word

59
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.650
so it would have gone back to your product or service description if you clicked it so alphabetical

60
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.180
thank goodness.

61
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.500
Go to your product or service.

62
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.760
Come on in.

63
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.800
I promise you it'll show your product.

64
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.980
OK.

65
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.480
So if he keeps scrolling here you'll see.

66
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.680
There we go.

67
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.210
Your product or service it pulls it up and I'll say here click to go to your product or service that's

68
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.580
it.

69
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.540
Pretty reichlich Insert Hyperlink and that's it.

70
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.030
And this is just a button to some YouTube video I did

71
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.740
and that is it's.

72
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.850
That's it.

73
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.510
That's it.

74
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.070
I think I've shown you everything.

75
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.390
If I haven't if you have if anybody has made it this far in this lesson if you have any additional questions

76
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.290
on this or if it's something I didn't explain that you're curious about please let me know.

77
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.750
But basically what I recommend is if you look at the formulas and if they seem somewhat complex then

78
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.330
just break it down by looking at one bracket the innermost set of brackets and delete everything else

79
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.520
and then build on that slowly build slowly and then that.

80
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.060
That should explain everything for you.

81
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:56.510
But I think I've covered every major topic on on how to make this now remember we had that made that

82
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.900
mistake there by the close bracket and that's basically OK if you have any questions please let me know

83
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.200
otherwise.

84
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.250
Thank you very much for this lesson appreciate.

85
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.530
Thanks.
