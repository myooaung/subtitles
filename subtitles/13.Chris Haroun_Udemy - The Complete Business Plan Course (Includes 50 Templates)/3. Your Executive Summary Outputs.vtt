00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.200
Please click on this button here called outputs for Step number three and everything we did the last

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.910
lecture will be fed directly into here.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.260
And so this is what the executive summary part of your business plan is going to look like.

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.900
Ok so I just want to kind of show you what it looks like here.

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.900
In case you want to go back and make a couple of changes.

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.270
OK.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.160
And a lot of what you typed will show up here if you're typing it obviously it doesn't always show up

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.600
and see there's there's little gaps you like John Smith which is the name of the founder I guess I put

9
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.510
in for sample data for your company founded the company in.

10
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.510
And then the year we put in that sort of thing.

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.650
And if you haven't answered all the questions in the previous steps you may have to go back and actually

12
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.760
do that in order for this to be populated if you have answered all the questions and you're doing the

13
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.430
course in order which I strongly recommend.

14
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.600
And this will be automatically populated and you'll see here that the executive summary pulls in everything

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.290
I've written came directly into here including a little footnote.

16
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.030
See that and that's for the size the total addressable market.

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.450
So all these things we wrote about are automatically pulled in here.

18
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.960
You don't really have to know about this but it's fun for me to show you this is just the the formula

19
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.460
behind it.

20
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.680
There's no coding this entire spreadsheet no macros just a bunch of fun formulas.

21
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.470
OK great.

22
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.500
So now here I've got the target customer and it just tells you here what the paragraph's cover.

23
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.940
In general what makes a fantastic executive summary.

24
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.760
Okay.

25
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.160
And then here I've got just what we wrote about management team and then board and advisors.

26
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.190
And if you don't have board people from board the board the board members or advisors whatever you can

27
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.800
always click here to turn it off.

28
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.570
Know that turned off pretty cool.

29
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.030
And that will filter all the way through to our final output in the final output of every single page

30
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.490
that's going to go to our business plan.

31
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.720
But for now we're just looking here to see how it looks for us and if we're happy with what we wrote

32
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.990
You can always compare what you wrote to what I wrote but don't don't.

33
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.090
Please don't assume that this is gospel or this is you know a hundred percent right as every business

34
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.960
model is different and stylistically we all have a different way of writing it.

35
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.850
And if when it comes to grammar and spelling or because when we put this stuff in the Microsoft Word

36
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.590
later.

37
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.530
Like for example here with business plan template one which is just one sample out of 50.

38
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.830
But when we do that we'll be able to spell check here and grammar check and all that stuff and.

39
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.180
And I'll guide you through every step of the way and here's the footnote that automatically get put

40
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.780
here.

41
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.170
Here's the problem the market solution.

42
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.480
When you see how it pulls in a lot of the stuff automatically.

43
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.550
So the problem with and then simple industry and simple problem and yours will be shown as your industry

44
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.450
and your problem.

45
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.430
All right.

46
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.660
And then you can turn off the milestone that we enter in here because a lot of people that are writing

47
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.240
business plans and taking this course have not started the company yet but some have.

48
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.140
So you can click this to turn it off and this will be turned off automatically as well when we do our

49
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.330
final output which port will we will port into Microsoft Word and cap and then here is just just paste

50
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.570
your product into here if you want just to visualize what the section will look like.

51
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.320
And if you don't have the product image yet you're getting it made.

52
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.000
You can always you know go here and then red flag it and then come back to it later.

53
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.020
OK so let's just say for fun that we want to do this we can flag it for later you just click this and

54
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.670
go come back to question and automatically add a red flag.

55
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.290
Not just here but also up in the menu here.

56
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.660
OK so we've got two flags now to come back to later and you can even write down document Y or Excel

57
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.110
or whatever you want here and this is an optional text field here.

58
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.140
Say I am getting a fiver.

59
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.140
Whoops.

60
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.260
I'm getting fiver

61
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.410
to do this.

62
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.210
Sorry.

63
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.810
The older I get the better I was I don't type as well as they used to.

64
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.820
All right great and we go back here to outposts wants and you can click the button if you want as well.

65
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.680
And we can turn project image off.

66
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.880
So if you have a service in your home that product image or you want to show a service diagram you can

67
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.520
click that and it'll be gone.

68
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.400
OK.

69
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.760
And then here if you want you can.

70
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.950
I mean this here you can click to go back where you paste in the product image so it'll take us directly

71
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.860
that field so click there automatically just a hyperlink right.

72
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.000
We'll jump back right to here where the product images if applicable at all.

73
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.860
OK let's go back to see if I'm missing anything at all.

74
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.400
And you can always minimize it's a bit slower.

75
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.790
It takes a couple of seconds to minimize that but you can do it if you want more real stay here and

76
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.550
screen I'll do it and I'll show you it looks like your takes a couple of seconds.

77
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.700
I leave them all open just to speed up how fast things go.

78
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.080
But there you go it wasn't about right.

79
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.960
OK.

80
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.150
And when we when we minimized the top toolbar to get more real estate here we can see and if you entered

81
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.430
in your name in the settings button earlier in the course you name the list of he'll say awesome job

82
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.740
John or Sally or whatever.

83
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.950
And then if you'd entered in who is going to be assigned to a certain step it'll show up here if you

84
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.210
don't see that that's OK don't worry about it because you didn't enter in somebody is going to be doing

85
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.770
this step here.

86
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.760
And I created this here so you can always click here to go back home.

87
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.110
If you're lost and you forget to make that bigger that sort of thing so it'll look like this you know

88
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.060
it goes back to your home screen and you'll notice that now that we're on the home screen you'll notice

89
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.870
that a lot of the stuff that you put in the first couple of steps will appear down here as you scroll

90
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.430
down.

91
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.400
You can always click on the button so the side to go to the point in the course where you enter that.

92
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.080
So for example here and this is just sample data.

93
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.350
There's no company name that's been entered in yet.

94
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.300
That's why it's blank there.

95
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.500
OK.

96
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:12.850
But to end on yours you will see a company name is different but you can always click here to go back

97
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.780
to change the name of your company or wherever it was in the course you click there.

98
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.040
It's going to go to that field there.

99
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.280
See your company name which is because the shade of green in this tab here.

100
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.760
OK.

101
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.880
Let's go back to executive summary and you can always click here if you just want a quick little refresher

102
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.210
on on how to complete a certain section I did a lot of fun making this.

103
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.330
OK.

104
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.740
And I think we're done.

105
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.460
Yeah I think we're done with this.

106
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.600
