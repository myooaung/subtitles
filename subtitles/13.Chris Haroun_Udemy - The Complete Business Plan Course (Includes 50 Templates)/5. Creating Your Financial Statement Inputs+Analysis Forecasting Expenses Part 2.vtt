1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.350
All right we're making great progress.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.660
I just finished my my weekly call it was four and a half hours today.

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.510
Today's week number 12 of my weekly called join me on my weekly calls every Thursday.

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.840
And just because I want to humbly help you grow your business follow it's every Thursday for free forever.

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.580
OK.

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.070
So now we're done with the cost of how to make this stuff.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.990
Now we're in a deal with all of our expenses and a lot of companies will have it as sales and marketing

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.170
and then general administrative expenses.

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.680
But for us we're in a group at all in the one called s DNA sales general Ministry of expenses.

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.800
Some companies do this.

11
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.620
I want to simplify the process for you.

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.900
And so the expenses that we're going to do here below are not involved directly in making the product

13
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.480
but it's for running our company how to operate our company.

14
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.590
And that's why we call this part here operating expenses.

15
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.000
And later on we look at the ratio and actually let me take you there number over here we have that little

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.780
chart I created for you to scroll up will get there that we again get so gross margin was based on the

17
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.610
cost of goods sold.

18
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.870
We talked about right now we're going to look at operating expenses and we're eventually going to take

19
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:14.410
operating profit divided by revenue and operating margins involves not just the cost of producing the

20
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.980
good but also encompasses the operations expenses on a daily basis.

21
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.700
So make a lot more sense to you soon.

22
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.960
And then we're moving our way downwards in the bench who will move to the bottom of our income statement

23
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.240
called net profit margin.

24
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.720
Okay.

25
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.630
And all this stuff will be created for you automatically try this in the process.

26
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.090
Okay.

27
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.210
So let's go back down to sales.

28
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.790
General and administrative.

29
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.490
And this year I named it for you.

30
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.770
So here input salaries for employees expenses.

31
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.030
So it doesn't matter where you are you can always click here and find out where you are.

32
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.820
Okay.

33
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:57.120
And I'm going to keep this really simple and I'm going to assume that our expense is $10000 per month

34
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.130
every single month for salaries.

35
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.030
So I'm just going to answer that in here if you wanted to you could you know at the bottom of the spreadsheet

36
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.690
had a couple of lines like the number of employees you have how much you pay them that sort of thing.

37
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.260
But don't keep this simple.

38
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.450
So let's say that it's $10000 a month.

39
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.080
And I'm doing Canadian dollars.

40
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.480
Whatever your currency is do whatever you want so I can go here.

41
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.380
And I'm just going to go on High-Speed now and put in 10000 for every single month just to put data

42
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.780
here.

43
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.790
Great.

44
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.330
Done.

45
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.440
OK.

46
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.960
All hypothetical of course.

47
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.500
I just want explain to you how these models work and you can skip this too if you already know how to

48
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.040
build out an income statement.

49
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.260
OK.

50
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.590
Moving down here if we had contractors or part timers we would enter in that data here and just notice

51
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.230
here that this is just the percent of total revenue 84 percent which is ridiculously high for us for

52
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.130
salaries but that will come down to percent of revenues here comes down a lot because our top line scoring

53
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.180
lots we got nice margin expansion and leverage in the model.

54
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.880
Now you will notice that.

55
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.830
Let's see our growth is not as great here gets worse it's because we had returns in those four months.

56
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.850
Hypothetically speaking we had a bunch of product returns and you can always just scroll up there in

57
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.470
this column and you'll see it there.

58
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.160
In this example all right.

59
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.200
So actually you can't see it because I'm doing this so I will scroll up and show you that case it's

60
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.300
going to go up here all the way up here and see what our returns were for that goggles product.

61
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.940
Here we go.

62
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.500
So here we got returns just for a couple of months or just because I want to show you the inventory

63
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.730
stuff.

64
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.640
Okay.

65
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.540
So we entered in the first line item and you'll see that these spark lines will be updating for you

66
00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.530
as well right here as well and it's constant because it's 10000 every single month hapax being if I

67
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.200
made this $2 a year just for fun whatever happens here.

68
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.300
See there you go see the spark light update and then if you look all the way on the right the school

69
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.970
the all the way over the right you'll see the annual basis Sparke lines getting up to it as well.

70
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.270
Mike I showed you before.

71
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.980
Okay.

72
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.980
And if we had part timers or contractors we'd entered in there I would to keep this simple so I can

73
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.010
leave as is.

74
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.530
Benefits like if you.

75
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.680
I don't know.

76
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.920
Maybe you paid for their employee education for their kids or whatever it might be.

77
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.720
And usually this is zero until later when you grow the business or maybe you offer free coffee that

78
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.160
there if you want to then you got payroll taxes whatever the taxes are you would you would you would

79
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.290
enter it here and it all depends on what what country you're located in and you always have to talk

80
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.510
to a real account in your country when you file taxes anyway.

81
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.130
But you can find out what payroll taxes are.

82
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.780
And when I used to work on Market Street in the Tenderloin District in San Francisco payroll taxes we

83
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.340
got a big tax break because that wasn't an ISIS area.

84
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.460
And so their office equipment supplies and you could put it wherever you want here.

85
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.320
I was going to put in some dummy data so I'm going to assume it's 500 all the way over again.

86
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.990
I'll go up sorry about that.

87
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.900
Now you know what day it is copy and I get to go to High Speed Mode.

88
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.480
I'll come back and the cyclist is done.

89
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.100
Thanks great.

90
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.860
So we entered in office supplies.

91
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.530
I'll just do one more line I'm somewhere telecommunications you can enter and if you want to be as cheap

92
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.350
as possible you know you skype if you can accelerate.

93
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.330
All right.

94
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.720
Or whatsapp or whatever it is overseas travel entertainment.

95
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.910
If you you know if you travel make sure you keep all your receipts obviously and just put everything

96
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.410
into a bucket and give it to your account at the end of the year and say Here are my receipts please.

97
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.440
I mean tax breaks utilities if applicable.

98
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.210
If not leave everything empty marketing and advertising.

99
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.010
Let's say it's on two grand a month.

100
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.660
Hopes is 20 at INS.

101
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.890
Earlier I spoke about how to write content yourself and I want to be thought of as a thought leader.

102
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.020
OK so when you're creating content online that's free advertising for you.

103
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.900
And I want people to apps.

104
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.580
I want people think of you as the expert in the in that area that you're in right now.

105
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.600
So you're in a lot if you can on LinkedIn I explained resources on on how to do that before.

106
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.940
And then you're also if you want you can do YouTube videos that are Instagram's big now as well and

107
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.060
it changes a lot and follow people like Gary Vaynerchuk Gary V.

108
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.210
Just from on line.

109
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.550
He's really on top of what social media trends matter most he's better at that.

110
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.140
So just just follow him and Hila he'll help a lot if you follow him.

111
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.680
OK.

112
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:45.700
So now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to paste in that amount to give him mouth helps

113
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.630
how I copied the wrong one I don't care.

114
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.240
Going high speed won't get on the way it worked.

115
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.400
OK great advertising and marketing is done.

116
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.500
I spelt advertising with a z instead of an s it correct me.

117
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.510
Full disclosure always insurance if you want you can have there.

118
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.630
When you speak to a lawyer it's going to help you to register your company you can ask your lawyer about

119
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.830
insurance giving the employee insurance etc..

120
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.420
OK.

121
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.120
Legal fees as well you can put it there and I put in all stuff that I think you might have.

122
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.400
But I also gave you a bunch of other lines.

123
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.440
You can change you can even change these if you want to.

124
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.060
I recommend leaving them as is.

125
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.470
Because when I highlight watch happens up top says legal fees.

126
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:34.060
So they're just you know it's tag later on if you want to come back to that furniture if you rent whatever

127
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.580
automobile expenses.

128
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:42.830
You know some countries give you you can lease cars and get a tax deduction license fee that suffer

129
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:48.190
a car that's a license to run your company like financial services because you pay a fee.

130
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:54.290
Same thing with health care as well if they're regulated government markets postage fees employee education.

131
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.230
No bias there.

132
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.400
And here's my other.

133
00:07:59.400 --> 00:07:59.710
OK.

134
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.750
And you can just type directly on top of this here.

135
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.110
On top of the blowsy is intact.

136
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.260
You can do whatever you want.

137
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.110
Here's what I recommend actually I can teach out to tag something.

138
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:18.300
So if you want you can say you're calling this I don't know Coca Cola expense.

139
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.420
I just look at my coke can that's why I thought it.

140
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.520
I'm very creative.

141
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.560
Then what you do is you do it highlight it and go here and you say Coke expense whatever.

142
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.880
Oh sorry it didn't work.

143
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.310
You can't put a space in between.

144
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:36.230
Coke and ice caps doing coke underscore expense.

145
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.560
And you can enter and that is done.

146
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:43.180
And whenever you want to go there you can just click here and scroll down.

147
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.740
Where was my coke expense again.

148
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.270
And it's right there.

149
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.530
Every company has a coke expense skit.

150
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.630
I mean it controls me to undo that again.

151
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.070
There you go.

152
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:52.940
It helps.

153
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.400
To me it seems there are no control that anyway.

154
00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.190
So that's how you tagline you can do it if you tag I recommend that you keep it consistent with what

155
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.900
I've done.

156
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.310
So I recommend that you.

157
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.060
You call it financials inputs and then Coca-Cola expense after that or whatever it is.

158
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:17.040
No disrespect to Pepsi ok what's going on here and we're done actually with this.

159
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.030
Now we have all of our operating expenses.

160
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.580
And I just threw in a couple dummy lines a beta of data.

161
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.650
OK it's good to hear.

162
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.370
And we're done now with Junee.

163
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.120
That's it.

164
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:33.740
OK.

165
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.510
Now I I put R&amp;D in here separately.

166
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.990
So our is usually a different line that's research and development.

167
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:47.440
And you want to talk to a local account please and a tax attorney where you get up and running.

168
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.570
That's because a lot of times you can actually get a lot of credits and tax deductions from your local

169
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.620
government depending on where you're located not just based in the country but where in the city you

170
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.640
are located.

171
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.340
Again speak with a lawyer please on this.

172
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.080
It's a worthwhile expense to hire a tax lawyer and an account to help you out because they will save

173
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.040
you a fortune.

174
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.090
Ok it's painful to pay it but you get the idea.

175
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:16.240
So R&amp;D is going to make up a number I'm going to say it's 3000 every month to and I'm going to go on

176
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.670
my own copy this all the way across for R&amp;D OK.

177
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:26.040
We are done with R&amp;D and the spark lines up dramatically and the annual spark lines we go all the way

178
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.850
over here.

179
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.090
You'll see that it updates Whoops sorry a little bit more you can tag things here if you want or part

180
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.150
you can mark them as read if you're not.

181
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:38.450
And when I close all these if I click one there these will all be grouped together.

182
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.250
This is an annual spark change.

183
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:47.190
And so here we look at the annual charge and obviously we know that the annual expense is the same every

184
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.560
year the same every month.

185
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.490
Right and so it's unchanged on a percent basis.

186
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:57.410
The line here Blut is the percent change and here it drops obviously because you know it enter data

187
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.730
for those last couple of years.

188
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.990
Okay kickback back here escaped to make sure I highlighted 25 percent of revenue.

189
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.680
And then as always we look at percent of revenue month over month year over year changes and we look

190
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.450
for patterns in the data when your forecast in the future and everything becomes kind of a percent of

191
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:14.770
revenue longer term anyway.

192
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.910
That's why we do it that way.

193
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.490
I'm going to.

194
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:23.040
I don't think you're going to I don't think anybody taking this course or many people say what we'll

195
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:28.150
have depreciation expenses initially but you might if it's a very complex intensive business and you

196
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.920
know depreciation.

197
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.460
I label that separately because it's not a real cash expense.

198
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:40.030
Okay it's not like you don't lose money in your pocket and pay an expense for for depreciation.

199
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:47.440
It's just as I explained before it went over in the first lecture in this in the section what depreciation

200
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.760
does so what I'll do is I'll make it a thousand bucks.

201
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.670
I'll go in high speed mode and let's do this all the way and because it's going to change something

202
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.070
called Epatha and I'll explain what it is.

203
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:57.620
In a second.

204
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:05.260
High speed and now it's OK we don't want depreciation which was a non-tax expense or non-cash expense

205
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.490
Hauptman that means soon.

206
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.650
So everything we look at as a percentage of revenue obviously depreciation which I put a thousand bucks

207
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.540
per month.

208
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.290
Speaking is coming down as a percent of total revenue because revenue is growing but depreciation expense.
