00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.900
Welcome to Step 4 of the course in terms of the what why and how upset for are kicking off with the

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.870
what where are we going to learn.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.510
We will learn how to create an incredibly detailed management section of your business plan including

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.870
the strengths and weaknesses of all employees.

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:25.860
If you have employees that is so that we know how to address potential weaknesses or gaps in our skill

6
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.990
sets that the reader of our business plan might be worried about and we will always anticipate all questions

7
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.310
that our readers of the business plan.

8
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.900
And we'll address them in a very detailed fashion and we're always preemptive when we make our business

9
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.000
plan as we don't want our readers to ever feel like we haven't addressed all issues.

10
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.530
And so if we're very very thorough and thoughtful with our business plan right up then this is a reflection

11
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.240
of how amazing our execution might be which will make our readers more likely to approve of our business

12
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.590
plan.

13
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.980
Now step four will really help you understand if there if there are material gaps in the skills of your

14
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:19.290
management team and we will cover exactly how to address all weaknesses by giving or creating or making

15
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.290
a group of board advisors to help you out.

16
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.130
And we'll discuss exactly how to get a board of advisors for free.

17
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.300
OK.

18
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.760
And this will really really help you feel confident about the overall quality of your business plan

19
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.260
and your management team.

20
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.160
And this will really really impress the reader as well.

21
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.000
And I'm going to teach you exactly how to network to get these board advisors.

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.930
Again it costs you nothing.

23
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.330
And we will also discuss having consultants or contractors or people that we outsource certain business

24
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.790
activities to and we'll call them partners and we'll include that if we want to it's optional in the

25
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.410
management team section.

26
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.250
And this will make your business plan management section look incredibly thorough.

27
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.610
Now every battle is won before it's been fought.

28
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.400
And we're always incredibly preemptive when we create our business plan and what we do is we anticipate

29
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.210
every single question that our readers might have.

30
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.250
Now there's several or several optional questions.

31
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.460
In Step Four like what is our recruiting strategy.

32
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.080
You know what is our employee retention strategy etc..

33
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.270
And you can always skip these questions because their label is optional.

34
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.000
OK let's move on to why.

35
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.800
Why are we making an incredibly detailed management section and why is the management section this early

36
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.310
in your business plan.

37
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.550
Well the reason is because most successful investors and entrepreneurs and business ikons know that

38
00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.470
ideas are commodities but execution is not and they don't ever invest in or approve of a business plan

39
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.120
unless they're very confident and comfortable with the management team.

40
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.550
Lastly how how are we going to learn about these management concepts together.

41
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.490
Well as with all steps in the course we will start with the inputs and analysis by answering many questions

42
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:24.420
together and you can always look at my sample answers if applicable from shark virtual reality.

43
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.260
Then after we are done answering the questions and we are done with the inputs and analysis part then

44
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.840
what we'll do is we'll move on to the outputs part where you will also be able to see images of our

45
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.890
employees of a cabal and the logos ads where they worked or went to school etc. and I can't teach exactly

46
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.940
how to get these images and how to customize this section.

47
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.210
And for those of you that might want to also make a presentation of this business plan what you document

48
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.940
in your answers here for Step 4 will automatically be added to your slides.

49
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.120
And as always I'll explain exactly how to do all of this.

50
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.090
Now you'll see that I included a couple of checkboxes so you can disable items that are not applicable

51
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.090
to your business plan including turning off the board slash advisory section of your business plan and

52
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.790
turning off the outsource partners options part as well.

53
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:29.970
And I architected Part 4 of the spreadsheet so you can have up to 10 employees in your output and I

54
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.200
will elaborate upon this in much more detail in the next couple lectures.

55
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.590
Thanks.
