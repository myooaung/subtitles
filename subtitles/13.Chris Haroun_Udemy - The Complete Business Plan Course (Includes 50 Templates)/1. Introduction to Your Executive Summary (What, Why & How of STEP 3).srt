00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,510
Welcome to step three of the course in terms though what why and how of step three.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,860
I'll kick it off with the what.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,290
What are we going to learn.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,180
We're going to learn how to make an incredible executive summary which is basically a short summary

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,800
section of the important highlights from your entire business plan.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,960
Now we're going to answer a lot of high level brief questions together in the inputs and analysis part

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,610
of step 3 about your business model including really important details on who the customer is.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,460
What is the size and growth of the market.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,080
Who is the competition.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,150
What is the problem with the industry that we are in and the solution.

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,260
Meaning your product or service.

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,410
We will also discuss your exit strategy meaning an IPO etc. if applicable.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Moving on to why why are we answering the aforementioned questions in the executive summary.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:59,570
Part of the course and not much much later in the business plan because many people that will read your

15
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,890
business plan might not read the rest of your business plan.

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:10,250
If they don't have time or if they don't think that our executive summary is amazing now our answers

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,320
will be brief as we will discuss in much more detail.

18
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,560
The concepts that we're going to cover in step three when we do Steps Four through 13.

19
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:26,770
OK lastly how how are we going to learn about these executive summary concepts together.

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,970
We will answer the many questions together in the inputs and analysis section and then what we'll do

21
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:38,920
is in the outputs part here in step 3 our executive summary will automatically be created for us.

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,300
Now please note that I created checkboxes like these ones here.

23
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:50,210
If you want to turn off certain parts the executive summary output if they're not applicable like the

24
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:58,910
inclusion of a board a recent milestone and a mock up or a real image of your product as these details

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,650
might not be applicable to all business plans.

26
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,180
Thanks.
