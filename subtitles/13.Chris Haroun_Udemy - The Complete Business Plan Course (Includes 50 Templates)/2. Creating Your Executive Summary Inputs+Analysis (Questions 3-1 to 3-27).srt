1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,540
Please click on the inputs and analysis button for Step 3 which is the executive summary.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,720
Now these questions are very high level and we can keep mostly answers pretty short for now and will

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,560
go into much more detail on some of the questions in the future steps here later on the course so the

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,810
reason we have an executive summary and just go here to what your final look like depending on which

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,460
template you chose.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:31,180
But the reason we have the executive summary is a lot of times executives or potential investors or

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,930
the readers of these these reports only have time to read this section here.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,620
And if it's really good they'll read the rest of it.

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,070
Sometimes they won't even bother and so I keep it very high level so in this section we talk about a

10
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:50,920
company and the overview of the market the target customer the national team the board if applicable

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,470
the problem and the solution with with your company.

12
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,840
Meaning what the industry problem and how does your product or service solve that problem.

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,800
And then if applicable We'll talk about a significant company milestone it will give a picture of the

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,460
product or markup of the product design if applicable and so you'll see that later on when we discuss

15
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,230
how to make these these final or business plans here.

16
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,160
You just click anywhere here in your table contents and it jumps directly there.

17
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,360
So this is going to be a relatively short section maybe a couple of pages and that's it.

18
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,850
And so it will end right here again I'll explain how to put this together later on in the course.

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,540
Okay so let's go through these questions now.

20
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,130
I mean keep them pretty short please because this is just a summary section.

21
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,630
OK so what is the ideal customer.

22
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,920
I kept mine short here in the answer for Tony shark movie and video game fans.

23
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,500
And you'll see which ones are optional which ones are not so obviously that's optional because it says

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,870
optional.

25
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:57,070
And then in the first two years where do you want your customers to be based in the United States.

26
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,440
This is just a fictional example that's all.

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,400
And then the ideal customer in five years will be in other countries.

28
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:10,890
And then here you can put other demographic information like the age and other details if you want.

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,550
And then here I've got the total addressable market in the s.a.m stands for total addressable market.

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,430
And you usually want to start companies in markets that are massive in what you can do to find out the

31
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,740
size the total addressable market is you can do a search online and see if there is a reputable source

32
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:36,670
like a great consulting firm like McKinsey or the Boston Consulting Group or Accenture etc. or Gartner

33
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,090
in the tech sector for example in Forrester just to tell you the size of the market lot of times you

34
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,630
get these reports of the headlines with the ports for free.

35
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,620
Every sector is different so I'll keep this answer quite generic but a lot of venture capital firms

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,230
only want to invest in companies that have a market size of over $20 billion.

37
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,790
And if you're having problems getting the size of the total addressable market then what you can do

38
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,400
is get the top 20 or 25 companies in your sector.

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,610
And if they're publicly traded just add up the annual revenue for all those companies and that's a decent

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,200
proxy for the size of the total addressable market.

41
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,080
Okay.

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,640
And the total adjustable market is how much revenue the entire industry makes each year and so in this

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,750
hypothetical example since my Tam is the video game industry and also the movie industry I've got the

44
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,110
TAM for both of them listed here.

45
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,680
Okay.

46
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,750
And then you want to find the growth rate of the industry is well if you can have two industries here

47
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,050
I'm targeting So I've got different growth rates.

48
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:44,110
And then moving down here we've got the source and it's always great from a credibility perspective

49
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,800
to show the sources that you have and put them in your report.

50
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,570
And there's a place in the first section here the executive summary section I to say where there's going

51
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:01,130
to be a footnote that's going to be fed and you see this oil field here this field here is is what's

52
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,460
going to be pulled from from here.

53
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:03,750
OK.

54
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,060
And I'll explain how later on when we look at the final business plan.

55
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,540
Okay.

56
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,230
Okay.

57
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,040
So you want to name your sources or source.

58
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,020
For me it's IBIS World but the movie industry data and this artist for the video game industry and every

59
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,730
industry is different.

60
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:24,550
And then here I just put in the hyperlinks to those two sources which we will put in our report.

61
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,210
Alschuler OK now the next question here is optional.

62
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,300
What percent of the market do you want to capture in five years.

63
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,960
It's optional.

64
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:40,400
But I asked this because when we're doing our financial model later in the course if you wanted to kind

65
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,730
of figure out in five years what your revenue is going to be and if you're at 1 percent here then this

66
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,200
would be 1 percent of the market that sort of thing for revenue in five years.

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,300
And don't worry we'll discuss that and a lot more detail later now.

68
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,530
A lot of what we're doing in this entire business plan process is qualitative.

69
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,360
Okay.

70
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,930
And here is where we do the quantitative side.

71
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,420
And a lot of the stuff that we do in steps 1 through 11 will really help us to create the financials

72
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,480
part of the model and this will make a lot more sense to later on.

73
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,770
OK.

74
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,040
So I wrote here who my largest competitor is my second largest my third largest.

75
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,620
And these are three companies that make virtual reality equipment and software.

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,720
Again my company Tony Sharq virtual reality is just pretend company.

77
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,890
And then I put optional here you can list the fourth and fifth largest competitors here again only entrance

78
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,210
stuff in the at the white cells.

79
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,990
Please and then here write down what your competitive advantage is.

80
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,080
I wrote were the lowest cost producer and we have an exclusive contract with Disney which is pretend

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,660
of course.

82
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,170
Why now.

83
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:47,830
Why now.

84
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,340
Why are you starting your company now.

85
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,260
Why is now the right time.

86
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:56,330
And I wrote here that theater sales are weak and studios need a new higher margin platform to sell their

87
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,540
content too.

88
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,710
And then how are you planning on selling the products.

89
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,250
So this is all about what's called go to market strategy and we have an entire section on that step.

90
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,030
This is just a high level answer right now.

91
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,380
How so.

92
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:15,050
Hypothetically I wrote the heart always will be sold on Amazon Wal-Mart Target and Best Buy big retailers

93
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,530
in the U.S. and then the media will be sold on that pretend Web site there.

94
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,510
Why you why are you the right person to do this.

95
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,990
And I wrote here because Tony has previous work experience just pretend of course in the Oculus virtual

96
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,820
reality division of Facebook where he created the content platform software distribution business model

97
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,920
certainly makes him credible.

98
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,840
And don't worry if you don't have great skills because your investors or readers of the business plan

99
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,840
will be impressed by because once we get to Step 4 of the course what we'll do is I'll tell you how

100
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,340
to put together an incredible board of advisers it costs you nothing that makes you look really really

101
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:52,920
good.

102
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,380
And just for a quick overview here let me go here to the presentation slides part of the course which

103
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,840
is completely optional.

104
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,730
So if I were to scroll down here to the management team and this will be filled in all the non picture

105
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,770
stuff for you as you complete each section in the course this is all just pretend data.

106
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:17,100
But you see here that I have three people that work in my company some logos that make them look good.

107
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,080
It's all pretend.

108
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,050
And then here's my board of advisers some guy named Gates William I don't know if you know him and then

109
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,450
some guy named Goeden Seth.

110
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:31,910
Anyway so I'm going to teach you how to get really good advisors have something in common with you.

111
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,080
Maybe they went to the same high schools you are university or maybe they're from the same hometown.

112
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,250
I teach how to network to get advisors.

113
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,160
Ken it's a lot of fun and it's free to do.

114
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:48,380
And actually if you go to my Web site Harroun ventures dot com that's all lowercase Harroun or un venture's

115
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,790
dot com you can download a networking book for free which is 200 pages which will teach exactly how

116
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:59,000
to network and get board advisors or get a meeting or get a customer or or an interview whatever that

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,790
sort of thing.

118
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,900
OK now let's go back to executive summary so I'm clicking here and again like I mentioned before when

119
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,490
I click these buttons it takes me to the top so if you don't want to go to the top but where you were

120
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,880
you can just click on the tabs down here.

121
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:24,260
All right next up scroll down here we've got the why you isn't here.

122
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,150
This is where you write down skills that your employees have.

123
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:35,340
OK if you have more than one person and I wrote here and this automatically pulls the data from your

124
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,200
step one in step one for you just for fun what I did.

125
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:46,730
Let me click here is I entered in the names of your employees has superheroes you have superhero employees

126
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,010
right.

127
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,320
So they're right here.

128
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,820
You might recognize these from certain certain movies like Scarlet and Jozen.

129
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,570
I changed that name just so that I can't get sued by the person whose name is not exactly Skaro Hinduism.

130
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,340
Just kidding.

131
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,770
I've got a bunch of others as well but but I put that there directly in this step for you.

132
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:12,930
When I pulled the information over from this cell for you so it's easier for you to think about how

133
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,660
to answer this next question here.

134
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:14,860
OK.

135
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,170
So it's just a field that you really need to know especially anyway quickly.

136
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,920
So all I did in this field was I pulled all of your employees names directly in here.

137
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:29,630
If you answered that men in the White cells back here in in step one you can just ignore that.

138
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,660
OK thanks.

139
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,650
So I wrote here.

140
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:37,740
If you have more than one person your company list the impressive skills that they have that will help

141
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,810
your business succeed.

142
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,860
I pulled in all their names and I made this up to pretend company.

143
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,260
But I wrote experience at Marvel studio the former CFO of high profile Soffer company an engineering

144
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,230
experience at Google etc..

145
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,970
And then here and this is optional because I don't know if we're going to have a board or not but I

146
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:04,150
wrote here write down some of the skills that your board has and we'll put your board together later

147
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,370
and if you while you can always come back to this question by just flagging this.

148
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,040
OK so let's just flag this for fun and during step for all.

149
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,620
I'll come back to that flat.

150
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,310
So you can see there's a little flag that's been created down there and then it appears here.

151
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,290
We know it to come back to this park.

152
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,970
OK.

153
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,250
So let's scroll down here another optional question is how much do you intend to raise.

154
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,040
If you plan to raise money enter it here as well.

155
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,050
Where did you use the proceeds.

156
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,820
And we want to raise that money.

157
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:40,600
It says to hire two software engineers and to open an overseas office in Bollywood.

158
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,000
OK and this here these two questions here are important.

159
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,800
And I kept it simple.

160
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,190
What is the problem that your company addresses and what's the solution meaning how does your product

161
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,560
or service address that problem.

162
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,530
This is important and I will try this new a couple of answers in this course.

163
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,260
And I also put it directly here on the presentation slides.

164
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:09,460
If you plan on making a presentation down here is the problem is the solution on this page here.

165
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,950
You can always click here to go back it's all hyperlinked and I'll take us back to exactly where we

166
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,760
are right now.

167
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,160
Here it is.

168
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:16,550
OK.

169
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,360
So the problem here and you write in one sentence so I wrote here.

170
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,920
The problem with mood Mark is that it is that the growth of the market is anemic and large media companies

171
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,250
are looking to reignite revenue and profitability growth.

172
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:38,130
And the industry solution which is based on our product our pretend product we believe that our company

173
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,660
solves the problems that large media companies are having with slow growth as our company has high margin

174
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,910
and scalable revenue model.

175
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,860
Yada yada yada.

176
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,240
That sort of thing OK so enter your answer there.

177
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,530
Next up we've got industry risks and we're seeing a list this from a high level perspective.

178
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,120
And later on during the other part of the Course here Cisco there I'll show you.

179
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,520
We're going to talk about other potential risks with this industry and your industry in general like

180
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,850
future competition macroeconomic future tech development.

181
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,640
It doesn't matter if you're Korean tech products or not technology will impact your industry later on.

182
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,930
OK.

183
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,070
So let's now go back to where we were.

184
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:19,430
The executive summary and now I have to scroll that's where it was.

185
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,550
Again you can click just on the bottom links here if you don't want to have it jumped to the top when

186
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,730
you push one of these buttons up here.

187
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,820
And these are just images.

188
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,480
By the way not real buttons will teach you how to create all this stuff.

189
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,360
At this point in the course in this lower third here OK if you're interested that's optional obviously.

190
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:42,210
And so if you want and this is completely optional of course you can put your image here of your product

191
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,680
towards the high level no data flow diagram of your service if it's applicable.

192
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,280
And if you don't have a product and a lot of people talk about MVP which stands for most stands for

193
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:58,020
minimum viable product you can always put the minimum viable product image here or you can go to five

194
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,820
or dot com and get somebody to create a wireframe sample of what your product will look like completely

195
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,430
optional.

196
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:10,470
To understand how to use 5 or dot com to get images done for you or mockups in general like I did with

197
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,110
my logo just.

198
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,080
You can go there directly by.

199
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:21,060
If you go back here to cover page you can you can actually just click on this link here and it will

200
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,670
take you to a video I made on that topic.

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,140
All right back to executive summary I'm going to click down here this time.

202
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,550
So I remember exactly where I was there.

203
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,600
All right.

204
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,080
And then here this is optional.

205
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,110
But what's your exit strategy if you have one.

206
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,650
OK so you're going to put everything here in the White cells.

207
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:46,350
So it might be an initial public offering or selling the company or something else that's similar to

208
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,120
an IPO or not a placable at all.

209
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,510
And as I write this down because a lot of times when you create these business plans you're trying to

210
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,610
raise money in a lot of the investors that might invest in your company are thinking OK if I give you

211
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,850
this money what's the exit strategy going to be.

212
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,890
Again it's optional and it's all based on whoever your customer is.

213
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,140
And if you can't remember what you wrote down for customer.

214
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,500
You just go here.

215
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Who's the target reader of your plan and that sort of thing.

216
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,630
If you answer those questions earlier on the course.

217
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,090
If not don't worry but just ignore that.

218
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,430
And then here if you have a milestone meaning if your company is already existed for a while write down

219
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,230
a big milestone that's really really impressive.

220
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,770
In this cell here again it is optional.

221
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:34,160
And after you answer all of these questions especially the non optional ones then this will automatically

222
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,830
update as 100 percent done.

223
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,130
Or you can override that as always by clicking this button here which will not only update here but

224
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:47,040
also your total progress in the course and so assuming that we're done all three of these steps that

225
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,370
shows that we are now 21 percent done with the course I will see you in the next lecture where we will

226
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,350
talk about the outputs for the executive summary.

227
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,720
Thanks.
