00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.220
Later in this course,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.275
we're building this application,

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:10.005
where the user can search for an artist or a song and they displayed as a grid.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:14.025
For example, if we type in an artist inside here,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:19.635
just like this, and then hit "Search" will then present it with a list of songs.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:23.805
We'd also an audio player to play a preview of these.

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:27.195
We'll build this later in the API section.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:30.480
We have the album artwork, the artist,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.310
song title and this music player at the bottom,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.565
which we'll play the first 29 seconds.

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:44.500
All this music information will be provided by connecting to iTunes using an API.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.140
If you're not sure what an API is just yet,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.480
don't worry about it.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.330
We'll cover all you need to know later on.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.060
But we're going to get started on this application by creating

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.220
the HTML and CSS we need include the CSS grid layout.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.700
Then we can ask the functionality in a later section.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.305
We're going to do this a little differently to over practice exercises.

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:12.860
I'm going to go through this project setup and also

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.590
the HTML code together with [inaudible] ,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.155
this is how we have the same HTML.

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:23.350
Meaning we can do the same things when we add the JavaScript later,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.425
so there's no confusion.

00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:28.625
Then I will leave you to go ahead and complete the projects

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:32.390
CSS by yourself to give you some extra practice,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.119
applying in the grid properties.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.315
Let's begin by creating the project folder.

00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:43.130
Let's close this down and then create a project folder.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.680
Again, you can add this anywhere.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.150
I want to call mine, the Song Finder open this up in the text editor.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.770
I'll drag this project folder into there.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.990
Then we can go ahead and create a new file called the index.html.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.350
To begin, let's add the HTML structure.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.580
I'm going to be using the HTML five shortcuts

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.765
and then hit "Tab" to groove this our structure.

00:02:16.765 --> 00:02:21.195
The document title, of Song Finder.

00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:24.570
Then down to the body section.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.150
Let's begin with the header area,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.900
then assign title in h1 of Song Finder.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.480
Let's open this up inside the browser and check everything is working okay.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.590
There we go, there's our song title in the index page.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.805
Then we need an input area to type in the song name of the artist.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:55.505
Let's start with a label,

00:02:55.505 --> 00:02:59.220
and let's call this the search input.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.130
Then the text of search for your favorite artist,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.225
and then close this label off at the end.

00:03:15.225 --> 00:03:18.449
Here we can also add our input,

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.190
with the type of text.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.070
Then the id which matches this search input.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.845
Then after this we need a button.

00:03:37.845 --> 00:03:42.905
This is going to be the button which goes ahead and completes our search.

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:46.560
Just add a simple button into there.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.790
Then a horizontal line at the very bottom just to section off these header.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.980
Reload and see how this is looking.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.870
That's our label or text box and the button,

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.950
scrolling down below this header section.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.275
Let's create the main section.

00:04:07.275 --> 00:04:11.300
This is going to be the area where all of our songs appear.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.660
For now let's give this an id of songs.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.865
Then inside here we can add an article.

00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:25.580
This article is going to be the wrapper for each one of the individual songs.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.525
Each individual song needs an image.

00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:32.480
For now I'm just going to add some dummy or

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.385
some sample data just to see how it'll look on the screen.

00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:39.514
We can go ahead and style this with the CSS.

00:04:39.514 --> 00:04:42.710
All this text and images will be replaced

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.445
later with some data which are pulled from iTunes.

00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:51.290
We can see this image, I'm going to add a width of 100 pixels,

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.805
a height of 100 pixels too.

00:04:54.805 --> 00:05:03.480
Then add a style property just so we can see this image, background of blue.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.495
Now we should see a blue square on the screen.

00:05:08.495 --> 00:05:10.845
Next we can add the p tags.

00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:14.115
This is going to be for our artist name.

00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:20.390
Any artist and song is fine so just add anything inside here.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.830
Then a second set of p elements for the song name.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.375
Then finally, we're going to look at a new element which we've not seen yet,

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:34.860
and this is the HTML5 audio element.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.935
This will allow us to play our music inside the browser.

00:05:38.935 --> 00:05:43.455
It needs a source attribute which you can leave empty for now.

00:05:43.455 --> 00:05:46.330
Also the text of controls,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.400
which will give us some controls to work with,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.110
such as our play,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.030
which also turns into a pause,

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.525
the timer, and also the progress bar.

00:05:56.525 --> 00:06:02.105
Now let's copy this article and paste in so we have six of them.

00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:06.200
So two, three, four,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.740
five, and six and then save and then reload.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.345
Now I have six different items on the screen.

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:19.000
Remember this HTML, is just placeholder text in images.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.060
All of this data will be pulled in later from our API.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.730
For now though, I will leave you with you to create a link to an external style sheet,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.505
apply some styling and also a grid layout to the songs.

00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:36.680
There is no right or wrong way to do this,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.720
just style however you like.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.140
But I would recommend at least applying the grid.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.585
It doesn't need to be anything complex.

00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:49.670
Just a simple grid with free columns and a grid gap will be fine.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.940
Good luck. I will see you in the next section.
