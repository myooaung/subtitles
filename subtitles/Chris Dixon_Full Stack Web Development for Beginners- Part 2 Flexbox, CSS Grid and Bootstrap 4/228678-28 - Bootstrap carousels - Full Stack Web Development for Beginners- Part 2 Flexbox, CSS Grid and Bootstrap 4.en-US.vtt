00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Just like the navbars we've seen at the beginning of

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.555
the last video in the bootstrap documentation.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:10.170
Back over in these components section on the left hand side,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.140
we also have a link to carousels too.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.455
So click on the carousel link on here.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:18.270
Then again, if we scroll down,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.600
we can see various examples from the code.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.525
So here's a simple example here,

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.195
which is just the code below it.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:31.334
If we scroll down to the version which says we've captions.

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:33.600
So here is indicators here,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.355
which will be added soon.

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:38.550
But we want this version here with the captions,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.875
solves a little bit of text about each image.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.050
This is going to be similar to the one we are going to be building.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.759
So we how these captions,

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:51.460
and also these indicators to click between the various slides.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.180
So let's go over to our index page.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.675
Then at the top of this header elements,

00:00:56.675 --> 00:01:00.350
let's make some space for our carousel.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.280
So first let's add a surrounding div tag.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.150
Then inside here we're going to add some Bootstrap classes.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.450
The first one is going to be of carousel and then the second one of slide.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.805
We also add a data ride attributes.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:22.264
This is going to be equal to Carousel.

00:01:22.264 --> 00:01:26.675
The data ride attributes of carousel tells Bootstrap to

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:30.800
automatically play the carousel once the page is loaded.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.345
Inside here we're going to add a second div nested in the middle.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:39.450
This is going to have the class of carousel-inner.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.950
This class of carousel-inner is going to act as a wrapper for our slides or images,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.540
which we're going to add now,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.575
Let's add our first div for our first slide.

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:57.080
This is going to have a class,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.240
and this is carousel-item.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.415
Then inside here we can add our image that we want to display inside the carousel.

00:02:07.415 --> 00:02:10.295
The image also has a class two,

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:13.825
and this is going to be w-100.

00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:17.700
W-100 is a Bootstrap utility class

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.090
to set the image width to be 100 percent of the container.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.310
We can then add the source for our image,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.665
which is our images folder.

00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:32.670
Then the image of carousel.jpeg.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.810
Then an alt attributes with some text.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.740
I'm just going to set the text to be first slide for now.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.285
So that's our first div for the first carousel item.

00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:50.120
If we copy this section,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.255
we can add one more images just below.

00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:55.894
This is going to take in the same classes,

00:02:55.894 --> 00:03:01.500
but all we need to do is changes to be our second image of carousel2.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.395
So over to the browser and then index page.

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:09.935
If we refresh, we don't get anything shown on the screen.

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:15.625
This is because one of our images needs to have the active class added.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:18.625
This will enable the slideshow to appear.

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:24.985
And it will begin with the slide with this active class rather than in the source order.

00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:27.115
So back over to the code.

00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:29.575
Just after one of these carousel items,

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:31.734
we can add active,

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:36.065
save that, and then refresh.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.990
Good. So this is the first slide that we see here.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.790
Now we can see straight away that this is working.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.040
When we looked at the examples on the Bootstrap website,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.445
we also mentioned adding captions to these slides.

00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:54.715
We can add these in for each image section.

00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:58.480
So back over to our carousel item.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.540
Then we can add this just after the image.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.400
So let's make some space under here.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.240
Then we can add div,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.145
which is going to surround our caption section.

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:16.170
This needs a bootstrap class and this is descriptive, this is carousel-caption.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:22.430
Remember if you want to know exactly what CSS any of these classes is applying,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.040
just head over to the browser and go into

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.890
the developer tools and you can see in more detail.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.430
Let's add a level 5 heading.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.430
This is going to be for the title or the caption.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.035
So I'm going to add "Made to order" for this first image,

00:04:41.035 --> 00:04:48.770
and then below just a standard p tag with some text of using only the finest ingredients.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.250
Good. Let's make it a little bit more space here.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.730
If you do see any issues when going through this bootstrap section,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.290
just make sure that all the nesting is done correctly.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.980
Make sure that, for example,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.060
this carousel caption is just below the image and this section

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.695
is all nested inside of this carousel item and so on.

00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:16.580
This is usually the biggest cause of any coding problems when working with

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.320
Bootstrap and also the classes being applied to the wrong elements.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.535
So now let's go ahead and scroll down to the second image.

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:29.165
So the second image inside of this carousel item,

00:05:29.165 --> 00:05:33.005
we're going to add the surrounding div just like before.

00:05:33.005 --> 00:05:38.520
This also has the same class of carousel caption,

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:47.400
a h5 to keep this consistent with the text of over 50 types on our menu.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:57.540
Then below this, our standard p elements with the text of "Or build your own".

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.425
There's our two captions for our two images.

00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:06.730
Let's see this in action over the browser.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.740
Good. There's our mates order level 5 heading and the textures below.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.450
If we move off this,

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.200
hopefully we'll see a rotation.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.040
There we go, says our second one with the caption down at the bottom.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.135
Good, this image carousel is now working and stand to look good.

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:29.180
In the next video, we'll add some left and right

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.970
buttons so we can skip through these images.
