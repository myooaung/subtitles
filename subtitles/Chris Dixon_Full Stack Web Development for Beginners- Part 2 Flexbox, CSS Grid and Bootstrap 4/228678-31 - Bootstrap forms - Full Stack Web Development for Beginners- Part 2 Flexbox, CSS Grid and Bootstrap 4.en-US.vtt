00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
We know all about using forms from early on in the course.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.675
This video should not throw up any surprises.

00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:11.880
However, we're going to look at how Bootstrap handles these forms.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.765
It uses exactly the same elements, as we already seen,

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.885
but then add some nice styling positioning,

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:21.510
by adding the bootstrap classes.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.855
Our modal now pops up, on the screen,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.930
when we click on the sign upon and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.410
inside this modal is where we're going to add our sign-up form.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.980
First we can add some text to the modal header section,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.020
which is this top part here.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.465
Let's go. Actually before we do that if we click off the modal, we'll close it down.

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:45.075
Then over to the text editor,

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:48.470
let's scroll down to our modal header section here,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.580
and inside here I'm going to add a level 5 heading with

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.870
the text of sign up for exclusive offers.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.615
Bootstrap also has some classes available too and

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:11.140
this time this one is called modal title, so save that,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.490
and then go over to the modal pop-up,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.470
click the button, and as our text at the very top,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.545
then to add in our form inside this middle section,

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:25.260
which is the body, so back over to our modal.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.350
This time inside this modal body section we're going to add a form,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.210
this form is going to have a div nested inside with the class of form group.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.150
This groups together all of the form section include any inputs enables.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.790
We add each input enable inside

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.705
this form group to add some structure to your form elements,

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:56.750
such as any margin to space them out.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.110
Let's begin with a label and this label is going to have the usual four attributes.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.650
This is going to link to our inputs.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.765
Let's call this a name input because we are going to add

00:02:09.765 --> 00:02:15.070
a name section and then the text of your name.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.855
Then after this label can add our input,

00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:25.985
this is going to have the type of text and then some classes,

00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:29.970
so the bootstrap classes of form control,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.550
id and this id is going to be name input,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.205
which matches this label so id of name input.

00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:42.785
Then after this we can add

00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:46.700
some placeholder text and this can be anything of our choosing,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.340
I'm going to simplify, enter your name.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.265
Before we added this bootstrap class of form control,

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:59.870
this is used on any text-based inputs such as the type of text,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.210
select, and text area.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.200
This will apply any style such as colors and also sets

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.845
the input to be 100 percent wide, if we save that,

00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:14.180
we can see what effect this has inside the modal so click on

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.850
the button and there's our 100 percent

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.590
lied inputs in the middle with the label of your name.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.920
This is how our form looks by default.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.715
We have the label, an input, on separate lines.

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:32.165
Bootstrap applies the display type of block

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:36.340
and wait for 100 percent to most form elements.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.365
If we wanted this label and input to be in line there's a class for these two.

00:03:42.365 --> 00:03:49.380
We can add this to the surrounding form container and the class is called form in line,

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.639
save that, and then reload,

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.424
click on the modal,

00:03:55.424 --> 00:03:58.685
and now our label and input is in line.

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:03.230
But I'm going to keep this as it originally was without this class of form in

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.940
line that should remove this for now and then onto our email and address form groups,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.750
so just like this name section here,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.920
we also surround other inputs with this class of form group.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.730
Let's copy this and then paste in just below.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.440
This one is going to be for the email,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.500
so lets change your name to be your e-mail.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.485
This is going to have the input type of email too.

00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:40.085
We also need to change the label for attributes to be email input,

00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:42.940
which is going to match this ID here.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.455
Also change this to be email inputs.

00:04:46.455 --> 00:04:49.325
I think everything else is okay.

00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:56.245
Just a place holder, so enter your email and that's looking good.

00:04:56.245 --> 00:04:58.820
Just below this email we're going to paste this in

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.105
one more time and this is also going to have

00:05:02.105 --> 00:05:04.130
the surrounding div with a class of

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.800
form group but this time it's going to be for your address.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.100
This time we're going to have a text area,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.650
rather than the standard inputs.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.685
Let's delete this input from here.

00:05:17.685 --> 00:05:21.760
After this label we're then going to create the text area.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.740
Remember the text area has an opening and

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.345
closing tag and the input just has the self-closing tag.

00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:35.210
The text area can have a class of form control,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.585
which is the same as these ones above because it's a text-based input.

00:05:40.585 --> 00:05:46.825
Then an ID, which matches this label of address.

00:05:46.825 --> 00:05:50.150
Remember from earlier with a text input,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:57.210
we can also specify how many rows we want to add and we set it to 3 by default.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.530
Then a placeholder, with the text of enter your address.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.850
I think that's all done for the free inputs so let's see how it's looking.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.625
Activate the modal.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.685
Good. We've got the name,

00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:19.375
the email, and also the address,

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:21.130
which is a text area.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.610
Now we can drag this open down to make it bigger or smaller.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.660
This just leaves the footer area down at the bottom.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.510
Inside it here I would like to add some checkboxes to ask if the user wants to be

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:40.685
contacted by email or post then a submit button too to send the form.

00:06:40.685 --> 00:06:43.725
First let's add this checkboxes,

00:06:43.725 --> 00:06:51.930
so down to our modal it should be modal footer so make sure let's changed.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.980
We've got the body,

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.445
the header, and then the footer at the bottom.

00:06:57.445 --> 00:07:00.725
Let's start with our email and post inputs.

00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:05.700
The surrounding div, with Bootstrap classes of form

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:12.555
check because this will be a checkbox and then form check in line,

00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:22.480
keeps these elements in line then we can add our inputs with the type of checkbox,

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:28.510
the Bootstrap classes of form check inputs.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.465
After the class, we're going to add an ID,

00:07:34.465 --> 00:07:36.935
which is gone to link up to our label.

00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:41.250
This ID I'm going to call this the email check.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:51.150
Finally, a value which is going to be equal to option one and then close this off.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.070
Remember the value is the text which will be sent to

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.100
the server once this form has been submitted.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.500
After the input, we need to add our label.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:10.270
This label is going to have a class of form check label.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.360
The four attributes, which are going to link to

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.670
our ID of the checkboxes and this was email check.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.180
Finally, check inside of contacts by email.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.755
Let's make a little bit smaller so we can see on the screen.

00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:35.410
Then I'm just going to copy this to speed things up so make sure you copy

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.010
this full surrounding div paste it in just

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:44.390
below and then we can just simply change this one to be contact by post.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.115
The classes all the same,

00:08:47.115 --> 00:08:50.550
we just need check the IDs difference.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.035
The ID this time is going to be post check.

00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:57.685
The form attribute can be post check too,

00:08:57.685 --> 00:09:04.050
contact by post, and I should add a question mark after each one of them.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:09.530
Finally, let's wrap up this modal with a button to submit the form,

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.600
the text of submit,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.810
the type of submit too,

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.015
the Bootstrap classes of btn,

00:09:21.015 --> 00:09:25.010
and then btn-primary, which will

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.880
give it the blue color for the button so that should be all now for the footer,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.785
I will go with two checkboxes here then our submit button.

00:09:33.785 --> 00:09:36.245
Let's take a look at this in action.

00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:38.425
Activate the pop-up.

00:09:38.425 --> 00:09:43.550
The footer content is now there but it looks a little out of place.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.930
We can quickly fix this with a little flexbox.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.320
Rather than adding all flexbox in our CSS file,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.050
Bootstrap also provides us with some utility classes.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.075
We can use flexbox in really quickly.

00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:07.855
Over to our code and then we can add a flexbox CSS helper inside this modal footer div.

00:10:07.855 --> 00:10:10.175
Just after modal footer,

00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:14.220
we can add justify content between.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.950
This works exactly like justify content between we did in our CSS.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.850
Bootstrap provides it inside of a CSS class,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:30.690
so save that and over to our modal. There we go.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.010
Now things are nicely spaced out in the footer.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.590
This is just like what we've already learned.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.700
We can also replace between with center,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:44.015
start, end, and around, for example two.

00:10:44.015 --> 00:10:48.505
The only difference is here we're using a class provided by Bootstrap,

00:10:48.505 --> 00:10:52.550
under the hood, it's still applying a CSS style property,

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.055
just like we did earlier in the course.

00:10:55.055 --> 00:11:00.915
If we were to open up the developer tools and then scroll down.

00:11:00.915 --> 00:11:06.905
If we then inspect this footer area of the modal, click on this,

00:11:06.905 --> 00:11:10.730
we can see this class of justify content between,

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.400
which we added just here,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:19.490
is simply applying the justify content flexbox property to these elements.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.500
Let's close this down.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.290
Now if we go back over to our HTML,

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.590
if we take a look at the surrounding form,

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:32.750
inside the modal, so the form element that has the closing tag,

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.810
and there's the opening tag.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:40.325
You notice that this form element needs to be moved to surround all of all form elements.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:46.150
At the moment it only surrounds this body content of name, email, and address.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:52.575
Let's cut this closing form tag out of here and then if we move this down,

00:11:52.575 --> 00:11:55.275
let's move this right down to the bottom.

00:11:55.275 --> 00:11:58.815
Make sure it has the button with the type of submit,

00:11:58.815 --> 00:12:02.765
and now we can add this in just after the footer section.

00:12:02.765 --> 00:12:05.990
Now all of our inputs are now inside this form elements.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.725
Just to finish things off I'm going to add a button on the form,

00:12:09.725 --> 00:12:14.580
which is just going to be an x so the user can click to close the modal.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.250
You can also click off the screen to close a modal like we've seen before.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.190
But sometimes the user may not know that they can do

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:27.260
this so a little cross in a corner of the form will really benefit.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.010
I'm going to add this in the modal header section.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.000
Let's scroll up to the modal had a part here,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.420
and then we can add a bottom.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.110
Just after this H5,

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:45.615
let's add a button then we can add a HTML entity,

00:12:45.615 --> 00:12:49.410
which is going to be a symbol of times,

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.590
and this is going to be a little cross,

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.525
which we'll see in just a moment.

00:12:53.525 --> 00:12:56.940
The bottom needs a type of button,

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.860
a class of close,

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:06.605
and then data dismiss of modal.

00:13:06.605 --> 00:13:13.540
Data dismiss modal will declare we want this bottom to close a modal when it's clicked.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.955
Give that save and we can try this out over in the browser.

00:13:16.955 --> 00:13:19.655
Reload, open up the modal,

00:13:19.655 --> 00:13:21.350
and there's our HTML entity,

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:22.745
which is the cross,

00:13:22.745 --> 00:13:26.725
click on this, and now this closes down our modal.
