00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
This grid layout is now how we intended.

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:09.870
But what if you wanted to nest our 12 items inside the main section as a grid too?

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.095
Let's give us a go and see what happens.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:18.075
If we go back over to our projects and then reinstate

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:23.325
our 12 items. Let's

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:28.440
uncomment out this section here and also remove the class of item one.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.420
Then we can go ahead and cut these items out and then place them

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.660
inside of our main section. Cut these outs.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.885
Then we can remove the texts of contents.

00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:43.485
I'm pasting this inside this main section.

00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:45.620
We have the header at the top,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.054
the main section with 12 nested items,

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:51.250
the sidebar and the footer.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.800
Let's see how this initially looks inside the browser.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.885
The items are all there.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:00.475
But if we scroll down they are not in a grid layout.

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:03.840
Items are just displaying as block-level elements.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.190
The main element is apparent for these items.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.200
We can change the display type to be grid of NCSS.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.050
Let's go up to the main section and then change the display type to be grid.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.380
Also we can give this a grid gap too,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.385
let's add five pixels for the gap.

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:34.005
Let's see what happens now this in place, we got to refresh.

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.900
Goods now have our grid gap here.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.520
Then we need to define how many columns and rows we want just like we would normally do.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.615
This again is within the main section.

00:01:45.615 --> 00:01:49.630
Let's add the grid template columns.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.635
Let's go for repeats.

00:01:52.635 --> 00:01:57.010
We have four columns, one FR.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.110
Then the grid template rows just below.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.490
Repeat these too.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.710
Then we just add one FR to add as many rows as necessary and keeps them all even too.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.380
Over to the browser, refresh.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.275
Now we have nested our grid inside of the main content area.

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:22.925
Just like earlier when we looked at Flexbox,

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:29.250
the grid also allows us to have finer control over how individual items are aligned.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.490
This is what we will cover next.
