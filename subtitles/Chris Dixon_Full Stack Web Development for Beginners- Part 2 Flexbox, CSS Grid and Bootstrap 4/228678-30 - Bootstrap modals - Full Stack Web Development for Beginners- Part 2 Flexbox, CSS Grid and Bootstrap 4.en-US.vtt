00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.665
Now is the time to look at another useful Bootstrap components,

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:06.600
which is called a modal.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.570
A modal is a pop-up Window which can give any information to the user.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.390
In our case, we're going to be adding a sign-up section at the bottom of our site.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.360
Then when the user clicks on the sign up button,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.165
this will then activates a modal Window,

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:26.835
where the user can sign-up using a form.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:29.265
Once the modal has popped up,

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:33.165
we can still click off it and return back to the original page.

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:38.055
Let's now head over to our index page and see how to add modal.

00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:40.290
To begin at the bottom of the page,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.620
I'm going to create a sign-up section.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.515
This will basically be a row which some texts on one side.

00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:49.395
Saying "sign-up" for exclusive offers.

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:52.480
Then a button on the right-hand side to click on,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.325
which activates the modal.

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:58.280
Right at the very bottom of our HTML.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.570
Scroll right down.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.595
I'm going to add a new container for this section.

00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:05.900
This can go right at the very bottom.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.124
Just above these JavaScript,

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:10.260
let's create a new div,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.980
and this is going to have a new class of container fluid,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.645
which makes the fluid full-width of the page.

00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:25.755
Then also bg-dark to give it a background color.

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:30.590
Inside here we can add our div with the class of row.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.440
Close this off. Then we need to add two new classes,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.365
follow left section and the right section.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:41.275
The left section is going to be a div.

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:43.930
and this going to have the class of

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.995
col-md-7 which you make it seven parts wide on the medium sized devices and above.

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:55.480
Then a second section just below,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.855
which we'll take up the remaining five parts.

00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:03.670
This needs to have the class of col-md-5,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.170
giving us our 12 column grid.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.960
Now this grid is in place,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.895
we can first add some sign up text,

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:15.505
which is going to go on the left-hand side inside these p tags.

00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:23.745
Sign up for exclusive offers, dot, dot, dot.

00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:26.480
Then we need to add a button on the right hand side,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.380
which will activate our modal pop-up.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.750
Inside the five section on the right,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.710
let's add a button with the type of button.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.750
Then some button classes.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.870
The first one is btn, and then btn-success,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.195
btn is the standard base styles for a button,

00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:57.305
then btn-success will give it the green background color.

00:02:57.305 --> 00:03:00.755
If we save that and check this out in the browser,

00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:03.280
this is right at the very bottom.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.085
We can just about see our text on the left hand side here,

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:09.290
and then the button here.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.885
This doesn't look too good at the moment,

00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:14.720
but some Bootstrap classes should fix this.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.170
We also need to add some text inside the button too,

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.670
let's do that first.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.710
We can add the text of sign up here.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.800
Inside this row we can add the class of text center,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.475
and this pushes all the text to the center of the div.

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:36.575
Let's see how this is looking.

00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:40.280
Refresh, good, our button and also

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.425
the text is in the center of each one of the containers.

00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:46.365
Let's make these texts now,

00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:49.170
light and also italic.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.255
This at the left-hand side.

00:03:51.255 --> 00:03:54.300
We can add it in this, div just here.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.170
After md-7, we have the utility class of texts light.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.915
This is also provided by Bootstrap and also form italic.

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.800
These are pretty self-explanatory.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.060
If we save and see how this is looking,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.225
good, now our text is now is white color and also italic.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:24.005
We'll also improve on this later by adding some margin and padding.

00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:25.820
We'll do this in a later video.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.110
But for now, let's move on to constructing our pop-up modal.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.320
This can be added anywhere inside of our code

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.430
but I'm going to add mine just under the sign-up section.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.860
Back to our code.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.485
Then again right at the very bottom,

00:04:42.485 --> 00:04:45.440
below the sign up div here,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.755
we're going to add our modal section.

00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:50.840
Let's add a comment.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.320
Now we need to add our surrounding a div.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:04.780
This is going to have a class of modal and also fade.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.115
This fade class is a fading effect provided by Bootstrap.

00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:12.330
This will make the transition nice and smooth.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.940
Inside here we'll add a new div.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.180
This should be fairly familiar,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.205
we're just basically constructing divs with Bootstrap classes to add our nice styling.

00:05:24.205 --> 00:05:28.960
The class of modal dialog.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.755
This class of modal dialogue makes a modal narrower.

00:05:33.755 --> 00:05:37.520
If we remove this, it makes a modal the full width of the page.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.760
I'll just keep modal dialog in place to keep this nice and compact.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.540
Then a new div nested inside.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.530
This is going to have the class of modal-content.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.380
This is the content we want to have inside of our modal,

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.120
and this is split up between a header section,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.955
a body, and a footer.

00:05:58.955 --> 00:06:02.635
Now we add up three new divs at the same level.

00:06:02.635 --> 00:06:06.015
This is the first one for the header.

00:06:06.015 --> 00:06:09.670
The class of modal header.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:18.520
If we copy this section here and paste this in, two more times.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.600
There we go, so that's our header.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.965
The middle one is going to be for the body,

00:06:24.965 --> 00:06:28.440
and then the last one is the footer.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.710
Make sure it is footer,

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.755
body and header section is all nested inside of this modal content div here,

00:06:36.755 --> 00:06:40.015
otherwise things won't look as intended.

00:06:40.015 --> 00:06:43.505
Let's see how we're looking so far over inside the browser.

00:06:43.505 --> 00:06:47.615
Let's refresh and click on the "Sign Up" button.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:52.255
We can see straight away that the pop-up doesn't happen when you click on the button.

00:06:52.255 --> 00:06:57.145
As you may expect, we need to link this button to the modal for it to work.

00:06:57.145 --> 00:07:01.155
First, we include an id on actual modal.

00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:03.570
If we go to the top,

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.445
this id is going to be any name of our choice.

00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:09.415
I'm just going to call this modal.

00:07:09.415 --> 00:07:12.380
Then we need to add two attributes to the button,

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.015
which will activate it.

00:07:14.015 --> 00:07:16.360
The sign-up button just here.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.355
We tell these buttons activate the modal by first add in the data toggle attribute,

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:24.785
and set this to be modal.

00:07:24.785 --> 00:07:31.630
Then we set which modal we wanted to activate by using the data-target.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:39.870
Then sign this equal to the id of the modal, the hash modal.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.625
This is the same id which we gave to the modal just below.

00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:48.245
If we save and try this out in the browser.

00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:51.470
Now let's click on the "Sign Up" button here.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.480
The button isn't quite working.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.600
Let's should go over to our code and check everything here.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.085
We've got the id of modal and then the button,

00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:06.284
we need to add data-toggle on this and make sure it's spelled correctly,

00:08:06.284 --> 00:08:09.435
reload, click on our button.

00:08:09.435 --> 00:08:12.835
There's our pop-up, which is in fact our modal.

00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:16.460
But remember we didn't add any content to the modal header,

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.610
the modal body and modal footer section.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.950
This is why we see free empty sections on the screen.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.380
This is what we'll move onto next when we add our form to this modal,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.930
so the user can add their sign-up details.
