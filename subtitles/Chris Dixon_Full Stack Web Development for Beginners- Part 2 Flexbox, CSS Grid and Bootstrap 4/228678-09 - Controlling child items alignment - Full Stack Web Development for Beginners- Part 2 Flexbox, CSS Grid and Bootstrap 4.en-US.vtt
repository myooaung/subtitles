00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.760
Earlier in this section,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.620
we aligned the full group of items in various ways. This works fine.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.350
But sometimes, you may want one particular item to be aligned differently than the rest.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.025
But this case we have the align self property.

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:21.405
To begin, I'm going to remove the inline styles which we just added before,

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:24.360
and this is the four items below.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.860
Remove the inline styles,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.000
which is a flex shrink values.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.275
Before font 2.

00:00:35.275 --> 00:00:38.825
Align self works just like align items,

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:40.955
which we used on the container.

00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:43.430
But this time, we add it to the item,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.700
we want to control the series in action.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.095
I'm going to set the container to be the full height.

00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:53.145
Scroll up to the Style section,

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:58.415
and then let's set the height to be 100 vh,

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:01.860
which remember, is the height of the view port.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.590
If we go to the browser,

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.175
just like we've seen with align items,

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:09.515
the default value is stretch,

00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:13.435
which is why these are placed on the top to the bottom of the page.

00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:16.445
To control one of these individual items,

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:20.605
we can add align self and changes defaults.

00:01:20.605 --> 00:01:25.625
Let's go down to the products and add this to any of these.

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:28.115
Let's reintroduce the style.

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:31.360
This time, we can add align self,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.305
and let's begin with center, then refresh.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:42.595
Now, we're controlling one individual item rather than the whole group of items.

00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:45.800
We also have some familiar looking properties too,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.420
such as flex start,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.625
which we should know what happens now if we refresh.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:56.095
This now places this at the start of the axis.

00:01:56.095 --> 00:02:00.330
If we want to distribute placed down at the bottom or the opposite end,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.465
we also have a flex end,

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:04.535
which we've already seen before.

00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:07.720
This gives us some expected behavior.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.880
We also have baseline two which we looked out for overvalues.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.195
Let's change flex end the baseline, refresh.

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:22.595
These will now align up with the baseline of the text from over items.

00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:26.300
This is it now for our look at the CSS flex-box.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.035
You can see how useful it can be for laying up websites.

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:33.245
Next, we're going to cover another layout technique

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:37.320
called the CSS grid. I will see you soon.
