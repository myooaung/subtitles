00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Welcome to Full Stack Web Development for Beginners.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.780
This course is designed to take you from beginner to

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.525
a web developer capable of building not only front-end user interfaces of a website,

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:17.070
but also design and build the back-end to interact with too.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.335
So who am I? My name is Chris,

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:21.925
and I will be your instructor for this course.

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:23.505
I'm a web developer,

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:26.670
and also the producer of lots of tutorials,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.520
teaching thousands of students the skills they need to build websites and applications.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.240
This is a second part in the full series where we'll continue building on your HTML, CSS,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.700
and responsive web design knowledge,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.670
and introduce you to the CSS Flexbox,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.405
the Grid, and also the Bootstrap 4 Framework.

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:51.740
This course is all about creating flexible layouts,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.365
beginning with the CSS Flexbox,

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:59.845
to allow us to have amazing control over how elements are laid out on a page.

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:02.510
We then move on to the CSS Grid,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.590
which is one of the most powerful and modern techniques to learn.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.020
The laying out full web pages,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.215
creating almost any type of layout you can imagine.

00:01:12.215 --> 00:01:16.535
We finish off with the popular Bootstrap 4 Framework,

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:20.209
where we'll build a burger restaurant website.

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:22.645
This will give you the chance to learn,

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:24.180
and put into practice,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.939
the Bootstrap grid system,

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.910
images and text, navbars,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.050
rotating carousels, models, forms, and so much more.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.880
We also look at the utility classes Bootstrap provides for easy styling.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.995
Along with how to override any of these styles and make your projects completely custom.

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:49.220
I hope you're excited to learn all about Bootstrap and

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.370
laying out websites in the second part of this course.
