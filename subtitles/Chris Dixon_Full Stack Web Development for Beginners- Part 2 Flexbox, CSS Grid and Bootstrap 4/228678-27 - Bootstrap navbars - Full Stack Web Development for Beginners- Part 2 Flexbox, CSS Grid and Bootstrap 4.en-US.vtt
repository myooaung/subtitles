00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.210
One of the really useful components,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.240
Bootstrap provides is Responsive Navbars.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.395
If we head over to the documentation in the component section,

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:13.035
if we scroll down to the Navbar tab,

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:16.485
we can go through some examples of what Bootstrap provides.

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:21.045
If we scroll down, we can find out some more information about how these work,

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:22.890
the classes we need to apply,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.070
or we could scroll down to some nice examples.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.180
This is going to be a one which is similar to what we're going to build in.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.370
It's going to have our site title in the top corner,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.235
then some various links.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.565
We can even have a drop-down if we want,

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:40.715
a search box, and a search button,

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:42.705
this will also be responsive.

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:45.395
So if we were to shrink the browser down,

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:49.510
this would turn into a nice drop-down menu like this.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.255
Let's get to work over in our index page.

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:56.645
Inside of our index.html,

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:00.240
let's give this a little bit more space.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.265
To begin at the top of the body section,

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:08.060
we're going to get this started just like a normal header section.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.460
Let's use the HTML header tags and then inside here we can go on to construct a nav,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.675
inside this nav, we're going to add our a tag and this is going to be for our site title.

00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:27.250
We can add our Gourmet Burgers title insider here,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.675
and we can just keep the href as an empty attribute for now.

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:37.100
That's fine. There's our site title inside of here.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.770
Then just after we're going to create div,

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.050
which would be container follow links.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.935
Just add these in for now,

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:48.740
we're going to go ahead and add some Bootstrap classes soon.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.520
But for now we just want to show you the structure.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.815
Inside this div we have an unordered list and this is going to be for our list items.

00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:01.460
We're going to have home and also locations.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.075
Let's add the li tags and these are going to be links too,

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:09.365
so nest a link inside of here.

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:14.975
The first one is home and then a second list item,

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:18.560
again with the a tag nested inside,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.660
and this is going to be for locations.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.619
There's our links, our unordered list.

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:27.530
Then after this unordered list,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.985
we're going to add a form.

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:32.015
This is going to be for the search box,

00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:34.895
so the form just here.

00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:38.330
Make sure this is still within this surrounding div.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.310
So just for this closing div tag.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.000
Then we can go ahead and add our input to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.435
the form and then I will put in just afterwards.

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:50.960
This is going to be the button with the type of

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:58.205
submit and then close this off with the text of search.

00:02:58.205 --> 00:03:02.905
Let's save that and then open this up inside the browser.

00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:06.605
There's our standard looking header section,

00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:08.570
the title, the links,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.705
and then the search below.

00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:13.205
Now, all we need to do is go ahead and add

00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:17.965
some Bootstrap classes to make this look nicer and also be responsive.

00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:20.460
Let's start right at the very top,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.050
inside the nav section. Let's add the class.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.634
The first we need is navbar,

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:29.400
because this is a navbar,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.160
and then also a second class of navbar-expand-md.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.050
This will make the navbar expand on medium-sized devices.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.285
Then navbar-dark, this is for the darker theme.

00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:49.710
Then the fixed-top, so it's fixed at the top of the page.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.515
Then bg-dark.

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:55.820
Let's give that save and go over to the browser.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.600
If we reload, we can instantly see a dark background color.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.285
But let's go into the developer tools and see what

00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:05.455
each one of these classes actually does in practice.

00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:11.920
Let's make a bit more space and then inspect our nav.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.090
This fixed-top was one of the things which we added.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.580
This adds position to be fixed and it also sets it right at the top of the page.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.665
We have background dark,

00:04:22.665 --> 00:04:25.830
which sets this dark background color we see here.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.995
Remember we also added navbar-expand-md.

00:04:28.995 --> 00:04:35.029
This kicks in inside the media query with the minimum width of 760 pixels,

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.865
just like we looked at in early videos.

00:04:37.865 --> 00:04:40.385
Back over to our code,

00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:43.865
and let's start with the a tags.

00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:45.950
We have the empty href.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.940
Let's go ahead and add a new class to here too,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.215
and this one can be navbar-brand.

00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:56.010
Remember, these are all classes provided by bootstrap.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.085
Save and then refresh,

00:04:59.085 --> 00:05:01.890
and now we have this white color link.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.965
Remember from before we added

00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:08.230
a surrounding div container which surrounds all this section here.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.240
This is a section which collapses on the smallest greens.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.270
Therefore, bootstrap provides us with some classes we can add

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.645
called collapse and also navbar-collapse.

00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:25.230
This will keep the collapse section looking nice.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.375
Down to the unordered list,

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:35.040
we have the class of navbar-nav and then a second one, which is mr-auto.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.480
Mr-auto applies auto margin to the right of this unordered list.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.225
This pushes this search bar over to the right-hand side.

00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:50.515
If we refresh, this now applies automatic margin on the right of this unordered list.

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:53.480
Keeping this section over on the right-hand side.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.685
We will talk more about margin and padding in more detail later on in this section.

00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:03.260
But for now, let's go over to the list items and add our classes here.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.175
The first one is nav-item,

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:11.195
and then we can do the same for the second list item,

00:06:11.195 --> 00:06:14.130
the same class of nav-item.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.740
Then there's also some links.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.550
We add the class for the link of nav-link,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.550
and then the second one, which is just here.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.180
This is also nav-link too.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.430
Save and go to the browser and now we

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.210
have a little bit more spacing and also some different coloring.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.140
Again, we can go into the developer tools and

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.500
see what each one of these classes does individually.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.025
Over to the nav-link.

00:06:45.025 --> 00:06:51.030
We have this navbar-dark and also the navbar-link, which gives you this color.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.065
We have some media queries which apply some padding of various sizes.

00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:58.635
The same with this nav-link which we added.

00:06:58.635 --> 00:07:02.270
It has a display type of block and also some padding.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.975
This will make sure our navbar is nicely all lined up,

00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:07.870
with some spacing around.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.460
If we shrink the browser, it closes down.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.530
We don't yet see the button in the top right-hand corner on

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.255
smaller screens like we've seen in the Bootstrap demo in the documentation.

00:07:22.255 --> 00:07:26.185
For this, we need to add a button to our code.

00:07:26.185 --> 00:07:31.705
Just underneath the Gourmet Burgers title and just before this div,

00:07:31.705 --> 00:07:33.400
which is a collapse section,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.260
we're going to add a button.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.030
Then inside this button,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.580
this is going to take in a class of navbar-toggler.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:52.610
This is going to have the type of button and then the next part is going to

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:59.760
be for data-toggle and we set this to be collapse.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.560
This makes the button a toggle button,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.400
which expands and collapses the content of nav element.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.310
The other elements which we're referring to is

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.545
this div below with the class of collapse and navbar-collapse.

00:08:14.545 --> 00:08:16.875
To link this button to this div,

00:08:16.875 --> 00:08:21.615
we need to add a id to begin with and we can call it anything we want,

00:08:21.615 --> 00:08:25.345
but I'm going to call this the navbarCollapse.

00:08:25.345 --> 00:08:28.110
Now this has a unique reference.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:35.510
We can go ahead to our button and add a data-target and give this the same name.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:40.970
So I'll add a hash because it's a id and then we have navbarCollapse.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.520
Now, let's go to the browser and then refresh.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.175
Now, if we shrink the browser down,

00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:53.030
we can see we've got the button in the top right-hand corner,

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.565
but it doesn't stand out too much at the moment.

00:08:55.565 --> 00:08:57.910
So let's just take a look.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:02.340
Actually inside the buttons we need add the icon for the button.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:09.694
We do this using the span elements and then add some classes of navbar,

00:09:09.694 --> 00:09:13.230
and this is navbar-toggler-icon.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:20.010
Save that, and then shrink the browser down, and there we go.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.120
This is the span elements with the icon inside.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.995
We can now see our button,

00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:29.380
and this also drops down because it's linked to the separate div section.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:35.380
The div it's linked to is this one here with the id of navbarCollapse,

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.840
which will introduce data-target just here.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.910
This is now the section complete and we'll have

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:47.600
a nice looking navigation bar by simply applying some Bootstrap classes and helpers.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.370
In the next video, we're going to be adding a image carousel to this homepage.
