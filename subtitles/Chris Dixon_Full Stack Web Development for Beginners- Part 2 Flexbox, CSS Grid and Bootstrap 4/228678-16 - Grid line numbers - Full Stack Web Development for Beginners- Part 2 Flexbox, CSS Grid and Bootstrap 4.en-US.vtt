00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Each of the tracks which we create,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.725
even in a row or column has these numbered grid lines between them.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:10.350
These grid lines begin at one,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.435
which is the start of the track,

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:16.980
then continue along the grid direction to the end of the track.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.945
Here we see we have our column tracks numbered from 1-5,

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:27.435
and the rows numbered from 1,2,3,4.But why do we need to know this?

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:31.620
Well, we can use these grid line numbers to position an elements,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.620
exactly where we wanted to be on a grid.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.080
We use grid row starts,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.580
grid row end, grid column start,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.905
and grid column end to specify starting in end positions across each axis,

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:48.460
where we want to place an elements.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.940
Here we have an elements between lines two and three on the row,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.645
and then between lines three and four for the columns.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:01.410
Let's go over to the text editor and give this go ourselves.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.320
To begin I'm going to replicate this grid from the slides,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.080
open the grid template columns,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.370
let's add a repeat,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.965
let's remove the min-max,

00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:20.650
and then this time I'll repeat and simply add four columns at 1 fr each,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.665
and then for the rows we can repeat three,

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:28.290
at 1 fr too and these can be all equal.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.010
By seeing this in action, we also need some more items.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.009
Let's copy one of these divs, the items,

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.780
and then paste in, and let's go for 12 items.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.959
8, 9,10,11, and then 12,

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.305
and there as our 12 items on the screen,

00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:59.030
positioning with these grid lines will be the first properties we have covered so far,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.755
which apply to the item rather than a container.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:06.695
I'm going to change the class on one of these items.

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:09.290
Let's go over to the items,

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.525
and let's go for this one,

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:13.930
and change it to be item one,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.015
and then change the background color and the CSS,

00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:19.610
so this stands out a little bit more.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.140
Item one I'll go for the background color,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.265
this can be anything but light blue is fine and refresh,

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:32.820
and now we have one item which turns out, great.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.815
We now go to start working with this one item,

00:02:35.815 --> 00:02:38.455
started with the example from the slides.

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:41.740
If we go to our item one CSS,

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.735
we can begin with grid row starts,

00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:46.755
which we've seen in the slides,

00:02:46.755 --> 00:02:49.480
and this is the starting position on the row,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.345
so let's go for opposition two,

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:58.250
and we need to also add grid row end for the end position.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.270
Again, going through the slides,

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.965
this is position three,

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:05.680
and then the same for the columns.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.495
Grid columns start, position three,

00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:19.240
grid column end, position four, and opposite the browser.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.845
Notice how this item one is moved

00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:26.505
and all the rest have adjusted and still stayed in order.

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:31.725
These grid lines can be any number to place it's item anywhere on the grid,

00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:35.230
or it can even span multiple rows and columns.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.980
If we wanted this blue item to also take up the row below it,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.615
we could go into the CSS and change the grid row end,

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:47.305
this time to be number 4.

00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:52.905
Reload and now we spans across two grid rows,

00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:55.200
same with the columns two.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.990
If we wanted the items to also span across the column to the right of it,

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.540
we could just simply adjust the numbers.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.890
The grid column end, to be number 5,

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.610
and there we go, and still all of items will flow and also keeping order.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.415
There is also some shorthand syntax too,

00:04:16.415 --> 00:04:18.430
to make this even simpler.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.650
Rather than having four lines in our CSS,

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.080
if we comment this out,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.705
we can use grid row.

00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:31.005
Again this grid row, we can add our two grid row values,

00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:32.670
of two and four,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.325
separated by a slash,

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:39.695
and then we also have a shorthand for grid column,

00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:41.150
which as you may have guessed,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.060
is a two grid column sizes of three,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.505
and then five, and if we now take a look at this,

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:52.280
after reload, everything still looks the same,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.835
but instead we now have this over two lines.

00:04:55.835 --> 00:05:01.925
Finally, there is an even shorter version too called grid area.

00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:07.230
Let's also comment our these two lines here,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.270
and then below this we can and to grid area,

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.790
but this time we add our four values.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.860
We do need to be careful a lot because

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.260
the first two values are our two start subdivisions.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.370
The first one is the row start,

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.995
and then we have column start,

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:32.580
so the first two values are two and then three.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.905
Then the last two are our two ending positions,

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:42.370
which is this one, four and then five.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.790
Again, we should see no difference inside the browser,

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.940
but this time the CSS is just on one line,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.125
but do be careful of the order of which to add the four values.

00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:01.175
Grid also provides us with the span keyword tool.

00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:05.120
This allows us to specify the line we want to start on,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.415
then how many rows or columns we want to span across.

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:15.320
If you want to double example to also take up this bottom row two down here,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.900
we could start our position two,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.430
as we already do.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.695
Then span across our three rows,

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:24.445
so one,two and three.

00:06:24.445 --> 00:06:27.240
Back over to our grid area.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.720
Instead of the row end to be set to four,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.070
we can then say span across three rows.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.640
See how this looks, good.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.180
Now we start at the same position and span,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.185
one, two and three.

00:06:44.185 --> 00:06:47.210
Spanning across multiple tracks like this is

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.560
really be useful for laying out our web-pages.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.805
For example, we could span across the top row,

00:06:53.805 --> 00:06:55.440
to create a head area,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.830
or section off an area for the sidebar,

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.735
and also main section.

00:07:00.735 --> 00:07:03.095
This is it now four line numbers,

00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:05.700
and I'll see you in the next video.
