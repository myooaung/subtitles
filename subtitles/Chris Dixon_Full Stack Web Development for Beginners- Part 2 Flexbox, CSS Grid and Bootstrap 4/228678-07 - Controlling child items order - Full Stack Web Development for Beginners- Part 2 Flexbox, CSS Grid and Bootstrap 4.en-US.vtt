00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.750
All of the Flexbox properties we have looked at so

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.275
far have been added to the parent container.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:11.100
This allows us to control the items as a group.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.360
Both in this video and also the remaining Flexbox videos,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.380
the properties will be applied directly to the individual flex items.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.405
This gives us greater control over individual items.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:27.240
First, we're going to look at setting an order,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.575
which our items will appear.

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:37.530
Let's go back over to our index page and we can return back to our six original items.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.790
Let's delete these last 12,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.290
leaving items one through to six and in fact,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.870
we can also remove the heights,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.924
which you set earlier.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:56.540
Let's delete this line and also we can comment out a line content from the last video.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.470
By default, our six items will appear on

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.475
the screen in the source order so we see item one,

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:08.620
right through to item six across this main axis.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.670
The order property will allow us to rearrange any of these items.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.515
I'm going to begin by creating a new class of in the CSS.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:25.830
I'm going to call this the order and then we can add the order property.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.605
Let's begin by setting this to be one.

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:31.880
The order property will allow us to rearrange any of

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.705
these items so all we need to do is add this order class to any of these items.

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:42.480
Let's go for item two and order in as a class.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.720
Out of the browser and then reload.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.535
This now moves our second item to the very end.

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:54.005
This is because all of items have a default order,

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.100
which is this property here of zero.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.100
This means that our item two now has a weight of one,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.260
moving it to the very end.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.470
This number can be anything such as 10,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.150
15, or even 30,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.925
for example and they will still appear in the order in which we set.

00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:18.365
Negative numbers are also allowed too so we set this to negative one.

00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:20.495
This will now place item two,

00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:26.125
right at the very start since all of your items have an order of zero.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:30.790
This is particularly useful for change in layouts with responsive design.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.175
The order can be changed in a media query.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:35.840
They have different layouts for

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.375
different screen sizes so it's a really useful tool to have.

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:44.215
This is how we can rearrange the order by using Flexbox.

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:47.030
It is really simple and just one line of code,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.570
but you can see how effective this can be.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:56.400
Next, we'll cover how to allow the items to grow and shrink with the available space.
