00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.140
We now know some basics about flexbox.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.880
Both seen inaction will really help us to understand how things work.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.365
To begin, I'm going to create a new project called flexbox.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:18.825
Right-click "New folder" and name is a flexbox.

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:26.880
Then we can go ahead and open this up in our text editor. Drag this over.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.900
Then we can create our familiar index.html.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.590
Then I'm going to use the shortcut of html Column 5 and then hits up,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.700
set the title and this can be flexbox and get that save.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.680
For this example, I'm going to set some elements to the screen to work with.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.590
Within the body section,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.110
let's go ahead and create a div.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.800
This is going to have an id of container.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.645
Inside here, we can also add some more divs.

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:16.560
This can be Item 1 and then a class of item.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.270
I want to create five more of these items.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm going to copy this section here and then paste it in five more times,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.900
leaving us with six different items within our container.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.390
Item 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.200
and 6 and they can also have the same class name of item for each one of these.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.710
Then let's hope we can open up the style tags within the head section.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.095
To begin, let's target this item with dot item,

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:53.405
and then we're going to add some colors.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:58.200
The backgrounds, let's go for lightcoral,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.060
some padding of 30 pixels,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.225
some margin of 10 pixels,

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:10.225
and the text-align of center.

00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:15.230
This is just to give you some basic styling so we can see the elements on the page.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.560
Now if we open this up in the browser,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.910
let's go to the index.html and open this up.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.515
There's our six items on the screen.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:32.030
We're just seeing the default behavior at the moment.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.324
Because these are block level elements,

00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:36.740
so they'll all be on the online.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.945
To begin to use flexbox,

00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:42.080
we then need to set the display type to the flex.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.825
This is done on the parent elements and the parent elements we gave an id of container.

00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:51.550
Let's go back up to the style tags.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.060
Then at the top, use the harsh because it's an id,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.575
and then we can target the container and then set the display type to be flex.

00:03:02.575 --> 00:03:09.270
Gives us save and then reload the browser and we now have a change.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.120
The reason we are now seeing them in a row like this,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.065
is because as we've seen in the slides in the last lecture,

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:20.210
the default flex direction is row.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.595
Let's take a look at row-reverse.

00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:33.735
This is also on the parents and we said that with the flex direction of row-reverse save.

00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:40.070
Before we had Item 1 on the left and Item 6 on the right, refresh.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.200
Now the first item begins on the right-hand side and it moves over to the left.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.795
We also have a direction of column,

00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:50.795
the stack these items on top of each other.

00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:53.330
Change row-reverse.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.375
It'll be now a column and there is a stack from top to bottom.

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:00.620
Again just like before,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.655
if we want Item 1 to be the opposite and down at the bottom,

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:07.890
we can set this to be column-reverse,

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.240
flex direction say column-reverse,

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.695
and now our items switchover from bottom to top.

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:23.195
This is a four flex direction options we have available to us.

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:25.865
Remember when sign flex direction,

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.280
this is considered the main axis.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.815
We have row, row-reverse,

00:04:30.815 --> 00:04:33.100
column, and column-reverse to.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.950
That's now our first look our flexbox and next we'll

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.490
take a look at how we can use flex box and justify content.
