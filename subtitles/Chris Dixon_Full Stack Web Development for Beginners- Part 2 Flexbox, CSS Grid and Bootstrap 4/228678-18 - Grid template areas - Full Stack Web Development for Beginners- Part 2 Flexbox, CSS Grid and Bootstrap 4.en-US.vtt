00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
Along with positioning elements with these grid lines,

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:07.875
we can also create full areas such as header,

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.980
content, sidebar, and footer.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.395
Grid provides us with a property called grid template areas to do this.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:19.395
First of all, we need to think about how our grid

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.560
will be structured using rows and columns.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.765
Looking at the diagram here,

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:27.090
we have a header on one row,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.835
content and sidebar on the next row,

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.775
and finally a footer on the third row.

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:36.645
Therefore, we no need three rows of the grid.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:40.625
We only need two columns for the content and sidebar.

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:45.440
Remember, the header and footer areas will span across these two columns.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.370
This is how our grid lines will look once we set the free rows and two columns trucks.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.280
Let's head back over to the text editor and see this in action.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.670
Let's get to work with setting this up.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.290
We're going to be working with these grid areas to begin with.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.680
We can comment out all these 12 items.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.125
Let's remove all these for now with the comment.

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:15.845
Then inside the container we can get to work with adding our header.

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:20.930
Add the sub header elements and the text of Header 2,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.870
we also had a main section for the content,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.000
then sidebar, with the side elements,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.580
and then down at the bottom we also had a footer.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.410
We can see these areas better,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.260
let's add a border to all four.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.300
Within the Style section,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.610
let's go for the header,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.860
the main, the side, and the footer.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.700
Add the border property of one pixel and then a dashed line.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.430
Over to the browser, hit refresh and there's our four content areas we just added.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.060
Then back over to our grid template rows and columns,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.205
and we can begin to set this up,

00:02:14.205 --> 00:02:16.145
so up to the top.

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:18.035
Remember, for the columns,

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:23.020
we need two, one for the content section and one for the sidebar.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.735
Remove the repeats and the first one can be 3fr,

00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:30.510
on the sidebar can be smaller,

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.775
so 1fr is fine.

00:02:32.775 --> 00:02:35.560
Then onto the rows.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.265
We need three rows,

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:42.105
one for the header, one for the content and one for the footer.

00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:47.399
The header can be 1fr, 3fr for the main content,

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.395
and then 1fr for the footer.

00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:52.850
If we now reload the browser,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.900
this is how all four sections will now look.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.975
Since we set two columns,

00:02:57.975 --> 00:03:02.465
the four elements are arranged on the two rows, like you see here.

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:07.120
Let's get to work with change in this with our grid Templates area.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.495
Let's add the CSS property in, grid templates areas.

00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:14.820
Remember the S on the end.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.105
With this property, we setup names for each section.

00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:22.150
These names are arranged like a table.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.135
We have two columns and three rows,

00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:29.330
so our names are arranged like a three by two table.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.240
We adds the quotations for our first row and then we can

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.195
add our second row and then a third row in just below.

00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:43.610
Remember to add the semicolon right at the end too.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.895
We want the header area to span across these two top columns.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:53.995
We add header in the first column and then header in the second column too,

00:03:53.995 --> 00:03:57.355
to cause this to span right across the row.

00:03:57.355 --> 00:03:59.260
But our second row,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.480
we want the content to be on the left and then a sidebar on the right.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.735
Then the bottom, just like the header,

00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:13.360
we want the footer area to span both of the columns.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.680
If we save that, we won't see any difference in the browser just yet, but we refresh.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.535
We first need to place our items inside the sections.

00:04:22.535 --> 00:04:26.405
We do this with the same four properties we've already used.

00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:28.925
If we go down to Item 1,

00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:30.875
we used grid row, starts,

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:32.855
row end, columns start,

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:37.820
and column end, or we can use a shorthand of grid row and grid column,

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.890
which we've already looked up.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.470
Let's set this up. First of all,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.790
we can target the header.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.590
We set the size this header by using grid row and grid column.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.565
First of all, grid row,

00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:58.590
this can be the header section which we set to up at the top,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.525
so which is just here and then the same for grid column.

00:05:03.525 --> 00:05:10.285
Just below this add grid column and also set the header area which we created.

00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:13.795
We then repeat this to the main aside and footer.

00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:18.250
The main section we set the grid row to be

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:28.300
the content and then the grid column to also be the content too.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.450
We also created an area for the sidebar and we'll give this a name of sidebar here.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.100
Down for the sidebar section,

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.605
which was the aside elements.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:47.695
Just like before we do grid row and set this to be the sidebar grid column.

00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:50.415
This is the Sidebar 2.

00:05:50.415 --> 00:05:53.890
Then finally, the footer area.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.870
Grid row, the name of footer and

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:09.315
grid column and this is the footer too.

00:06:09.315 --> 00:06:13.125
Save that and then Oh to the browser and refresh.

00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:14.870
Good just to recap,

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.795
we have our header spread across the top.

00:06:17.795 --> 00:06:21.650
This is because we've set the header to have grid row and

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.990
grid column of this header template that we set above.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.780
Just here which spans across our two columns of the first row,

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.015
we then set the second row to be divided between the content,

00:06:35.015 --> 00:06:40.905
which is going to be the 3fr section and then the sidebar we'll be 1fr.

00:06:40.905 --> 00:06:43.180
We define these below,

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.515
again using grid row and grid column for the aside and the main section.

00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:53.690
Then at the very bottom we set the footer area and just like the header,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.785
this also spans across the two columns.

00:06:56.785 --> 00:07:00.455
Setting the footer and the header to be the full width of the page.

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:06.680
Good. This leaves our layout now complete and how we intended using grid template areas.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.590
Next, we'll take a look at nesting grids.
