00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.315
In this video, we're going to look at some ways to have better control over our tracks.

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:10.335
First is how to repeat tracks that have the same sizes.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:15.705
If we wanted all of our columns to be 200 pixels wide, just like this.

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:18.220
Rather than setting all free,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.900
if we had 200 pixels,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.380
we already know the sane one value like this,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.595
will only result in one column being displayed.

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:31.350
To help with this, grid providers will repeat,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.205
so we can add this inside of our columns.

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:40.550
Let's add repeats, and then we can add our value inside of the brackets like this.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.185
We still keep the size of the truck here,

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:47.270
but before this we add the number of times we want it to repeat.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.920
If wanted four columns,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.190
we would do four at 200 pixels,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.345
and reload, and items of four columns with equal width.

00:00:57.345 --> 00:01:03.155
We still free to add more individual tracks to either before or after.

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:06.439
If we wanted the first one to be 100 pixels,

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.259
and then repeat before or afterwards,

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.785
we simply add a new value in before this.

00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:17.880
100 pixels and then I will repeats afterwards.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.060
This gives us our first column at 100 pixels wide,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.370
and four repeated columns at 200 pixels each.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.555
If we wanted a fifth track to take up the remaining space on the right-hand side,

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:34.460
we could also do this.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.155
We could add a fixed size or we could reuse the auto property,

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:41.365
which we have seen before,

00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:46.130
refresh and now we have a extra item at the end.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.270
Or alternatively, if we know how many columns we want to use,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.375
we can also set this auto to,

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:56.570
select remove auto from the end,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.110
and the first value,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.680
and let's say we want free columns.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.580
We could also use auto inside of the repeats. There we go.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.055
There's our three columns and now the tracks automatically resize to the content.

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:21.500
Next, I want to show you a new unit of measure called the fi unit,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.065
which is short for fractional.

00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:28.255
This unit relates to one part of the available space.

00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:31.550
It works like early what we looked at, flex values,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.160
where a value of one is one part of

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.765
the available space and value of three is three times bigger.

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:42.540
Let's add it to our columns and see what happens.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.505
Whenever you create template columns, instead of auto,

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:51.050
we can add one fi, and refresh.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.215
Now the width of our columns don't depend on the content.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:58.865
They all take up the same available space, and of course,

00:02:58.865 --> 00:03:02.180
adding a new column into fi,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.225
will take up twice the available space.

00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:08.540
Add a fourth column, refresh.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.170
This is now twice the size of these three, as you would expect.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.320
Repeat can also be applied to rows too.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.365
Just below, we can also add repeats.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.230
Again inside the bracket,

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.585
we add how many rows we want,

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:26.030
and then the size,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.145
and then remove our last column from the top.

00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:34.515
Now for reloads, get three equal-size rows too.

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:38.810
Again, our rows can also be mixed with other size tracks too,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.880
meaning this is really flexible to use.
