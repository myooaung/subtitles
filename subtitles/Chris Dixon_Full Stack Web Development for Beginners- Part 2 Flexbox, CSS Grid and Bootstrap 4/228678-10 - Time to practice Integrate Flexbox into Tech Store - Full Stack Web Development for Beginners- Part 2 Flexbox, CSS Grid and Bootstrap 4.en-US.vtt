00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.275
Before we jump in to learning about the CSS grid,

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:07.230
while flexbox is still fresh in our heads,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.010
I would like you to go off and now get some practice using this flexbox.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.550
This flexbox is a really useful way to lay our websites.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.070
But just like when learning anything new,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.360
they can seem a lot to take in at first It does become easier with practice though.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.420
This is what I would like you to go ahead and do now.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.090
I would like you to use some of the flexbox techniques you've

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.025
learned and then go ahead and apply them to our textile projects.

00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:38.830
You don't need to go crazy and completely rewrite all the CSS.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.279
But just try to change a few things to include this flexbox,

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:48.865
some ideas, qubits to make the products automatically fill the container.

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:51.110
Or you could go even further and use

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.590
flexbox to change the layout for different sized devices.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.900
Go head and give that a go and then comeback to learn all about the CSS grid.
