00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.565
Welcome back. We have a working slide show display now, which is nice.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:11.775
We can make this even better by adding some controls to skip between these slides.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:15.660
To do this, I'm going to add some buttons to the carousel.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.690
One on the left-hand side to skip to the left,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.180
and then one on the right-hand side, to skip forward.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.015
These added at the bottom of our carousel div section.

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:31.095
Down, if we locate the opening tag,

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.045
which is carousel slide,

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:35.345
and then scroll down to the very bottom.

00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:38.730
We're going to add this just before the closing tag.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.620
Let's begin with a,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.510
a tag because it's going to be a link.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.460
This is going to have the class of carousel control-prev,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.320
which show of our previous.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.995
A role of button,

00:00:55.995 --> 00:00:59.265
and then also a data-slide.

00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:02.224
This is going to be equal to previous,

00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:09.405
which is P-R-E-V. Data-slide will specify which slides to go to,

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:12.720
the two values you can add is, previous or next.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.430
This one is going to go back,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.695
we want this value of previous.

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:19.185
Then we're going to add our span tags,

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:21.425
and this is going to be for the icons.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:24.590
This works in a similar kind of way to our drop-down,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.210
where we add the span and then we add some classes to display the icon.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.160
The class we want to use here is carousel control-previous-icon.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.045
This is going to be the left arrow,

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:44.665
just like one of these opening hedge wall brackets here.

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:50.535
This is our icon and then we're going to add a second span just after this.

00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:53.620
This is going to have the text of previous.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.910
We won't actually see this on standard browsers.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.990
This is going to be for screen readers only.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.220
Now we declare this is for screen readers by adding a class of sr only.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.645
If we save that and then reload,

00:02:09.645 --> 00:02:13.925
we can see over on the left-hand side that we don't have the text of previous.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.990
We just have this little icon just there.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.575
Then we can do exactly the same,

00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:25.580
let's copy this a tag and then do the same for our next.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.065
Just line all this up.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:34.899
The a tag is going to have the class we need to change this to be next.

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:39.430
The data-slides can also be next too.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.455
The icon who needs change previous to be next.

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:48.875
Then finally the texts of next for the screen readers,

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:52.445
save that and then reload the browser.

00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:55.700
It's a little bit hard to see, but we have the right arrow just

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.015
here and the left one just here too.

00:02:59.015 --> 00:03:00.620
But if we click on them,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.720
they don't seem to be working.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.610
This is because we need to link them to our slide show.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.725
These bonds are links using the a elements.

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:11.675
But like with all of the links,

00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:14.105
we need to specify where to link to,

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:16.180
with the href attributes.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.285
First we add a id to the carousel wrapper div.

00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:24.195
Let's go up to the opening tag.

00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:27.470
This div with the class carousel slide,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.000
we can add an id.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.560
This id of carousel controls.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.630
This name is totally up to us.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.120
We just need to make sure this id will match the href for the two links.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.880
Copy this carouselcontrols.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.830
We can use this id just below as href.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:59.425
The first a, let's add a href and use a # this time and paste in carouselcontrols.

00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:02.550
Then for the second link down here,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.550
the href attributes, again with the # of carouselcontrols.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.230
These two images now link in to our main carousel.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.594
So hopefully if we save and then go to the browser,

00:04:16.594 --> 00:04:19.760
these two links should now work.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.085
Good, so we can go back and forward through our images.

00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:27.975
Great, this is all working and this is it now for our carousel.

00:04:27.975 --> 00:04:30.470
In the next video, we will look at another one of

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.990
Bootstrap's components, which is the model.
