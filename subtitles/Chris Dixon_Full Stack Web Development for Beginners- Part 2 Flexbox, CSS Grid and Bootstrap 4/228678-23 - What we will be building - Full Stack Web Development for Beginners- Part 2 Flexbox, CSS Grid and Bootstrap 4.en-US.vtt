00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
As we go through this section,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.595
we're going to be building this Gourmet Burgers website.

00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:08.460
This project will allow us to learn how bootstrap

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.655
works and how we can use various components,

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:17.535
as well as different utility classes and also how the Bootstrap grid system works.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:20.820
We begin up at the top with our header section,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.905
which is a navigation bar,

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:24.600
including the site title,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.860
various links, and also a search box in the corner.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.000
Scrolling down, you can also see we have a rotating carousel.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.455
Each different image has its own caption.

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:44.705
We'll also use controls to allow us to scroll left and also write through these images.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:48.980
This rotating carousel is one of the Bootstrap components,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.095
as is the navbar at the top.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.810
I'm might look at various forms of these and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.005
how all the classes work during this project.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.120
If we scroll further down,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.180
we then have information about our burger sites.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.560
This will teach us how to use the bootstrap containers, rows,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.245
and grid system to align and arrange our items on the page.

00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:17.000
This website will also be fully responsive so for go ahead and shrink down, the browser.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.589
We'll see a layout change for different screens sizes,

00:01:20.589 --> 00:01:26.160
including our navbar tending to a drop-down for the smallest screens.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.450
Let's make this full size once again.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.190
Then if we go even further down,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.115
we have a sign-up section.

00:01:33.115 --> 00:01:37.085
If we click on this will then introduced to a modal components,

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:42.100
which is basically a pop-up where we can add some information for the user.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.720
In this case, we're going to take a look at how we can use

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.145
Bootstrap form components to make our forms look really nice.

00:01:49.145 --> 00:01:51.710
Here we'll have a name, an email,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.405
and also a text area,

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:56.695
along with some checkboxes down at the bottom.

00:01:56.695 --> 00:02:01.510
Then finally, we finish off with a footer area down at the bottom.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.230
By the end of this section,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.510
you'll also have this fully finished website

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.920
too and also some knowledge about how to use bootstrap components,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.910
bootstrap utilities, along with how we can use containers,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.400
rows, and columns to create grid system.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.580
Along with the knowledge of how to override

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.845
any bootstrap classes to make this fully custom.

00:02:22.845 --> 00:02:25.355
Okay, good, so hope you look forward to this.

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:28.950
Now let's move on to get our project started.
