00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.195
Starting a project using Bootstrap is really easy.

00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:07.720
To begin, if we go over to getbootstrap.com,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.700
which is a Bootstrap homepage,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.235
and then go down to the "Get Started" section here.

00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:16.920
Remember though, websites like this can often change

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.040
layouts so if yours looks a little different when you visit,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.945
just have a little look around for the Installation or the Getting Started section.

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:28.375
There are a few different ways to get going.

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:31.270
We can download the full startup folder

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.580
by clicking on the big "Download" button in the top corner.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.890
This is great, but includes lots of things we don't need at this stage.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.025
We can also go over to the Download section on the left.

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.125
Then if we scroll down,

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:49.385
we can go ahead and download the CSS and JavaScript files.

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:52.370
Then drop these into our project folder.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.695
All the way I'm going to do it in this project is by using a CDN.

00:00:56.695 --> 00:01:01.630
Let's go back to the Introduction and then scroll down.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.925
A CDN is a content delivery network.

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:07.610
This basically means, rather than adding

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.905
the CSS and JavaScript files into our project and then linking these in our HTML.

00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:20.785
Instead, these files are hosted on an external server, follows to link to.

00:01:20.785 --> 00:01:24.810
Here we can see we have our CSS and JavaScript sections.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.510
We can copy this link for the CSS.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.710
We also have some JavaScript links here too,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.745
where we can link our script tags to the CDN.

00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:35.780
If we scroll down even further,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.940
we have a starter template,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.170
and this is a really convenient place to start.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.750
This has all the basic HTML structure we need,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.125
along with any links to the required CSS and also the JavaScript too.

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:56.320
Let's begin by copying this starter template with the "Copy" button in the top corner.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.560
Let's grab hold of that.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.580
Then if we go over to the desktop and create a new folder called Gourmet-Burgers.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.875
Open up Visual Studio Code,

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:14.660
and then we can drag in this project folder to begin.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.330
As always, we create our index.html,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.280
but this time we now have a bootstrap starter,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.340
so we can paste in the skeleton structure.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.380
Give that a save. Then we can go ahead and open this up in the browser.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.130
Let's double-click the index.html,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.854
bring up the browser,

00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:41.360
and there's our hello, world example.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.390
That's all working fine.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.330
Back over to the project,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.600
we can now start to add our own customizations.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:57.540
We can change the title to be Gourmet Burgers, and then save.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.690
Our change is now reflected in the browser.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.175
This text of hello world may look like a standard h1 element,

00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:12.500
but it has a little default Bootstrap styling like all the other elements will have too.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.515
We can see this if we command out the CSS link in the head section.

00:03:17.515 --> 00:03:21.630
The Bootstrap CSS is just here.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.190
If we command out this line and then refresh,

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.300
we see the Bootstrap default styles have now been removed.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.140
Let's just remove these commands and add this back in.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.425
To see what's going on behind the scenes,

00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:39.725
we can take a look at the CSS provided by Bootstrap.

00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:46.635
If we copy this link inside the href right to the very end,

00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:51.225
copy that, and then over to the browser,

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:55.635
we can paste this in just like a normal URL.

00:03:55.635 --> 00:04:00.365
This is the style sheet which is linked to at this URL.

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:04.750
It's a little hard to read because currently it's minified.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.785
This means all the white space has been removed to keep the file size smaller.

00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:11.330
To see this even better,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.060
if we select all and then copy.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.770
I'm going to search for CodeBeautify.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.545
This is what we need, codebeautify.org, so select this.

00:04:28.545 --> 00:04:31.470
The one we need is the CSS,

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.210
so select this link here.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.710
On the left-hand side, we can add the CSS input.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.900
Paste in our Bootstrap code and then click on "Beautify" in the middle.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.125
Over on the right-hand side we can see the outputs.

00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:51.975
We can make this the size of the full screen.

00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:55.359
This is all the CSS which Bootstrap provides.

00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:59.155
It now looks formatted in a way which looks familiar.

00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:02.185
If you scroll through it, there is quite a lot.

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:04.835
If we press "Command" or "Ctrl" "F",

00:05:04.835 --> 00:05:07.545
this will search through the code.

00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:11.895
Let's search for the h1 and hit enter,

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:16.865
then we can see all the CSS which is applying to this h1 elements.

00:05:16.865 --> 00:05:20.960
First we have h1 right through to h6,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.725
which applies on default margin bottom,

00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:25.885
a font family of inherits.

00:05:25.885 --> 00:05:29.395
We also have a font weight, a line height,

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:34.015
and also inherits the text color. Down to the next one.

00:05:34.015 --> 00:05:38.335
We can also see the font size is 2.5 rem,

00:05:38.335 --> 00:05:41.595
which is why when we remove the Bootstrap style sheets,

00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:44.045
the h1 then appeared smaller.

00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:47.615
We can also scroll through and take a look at some more styles too,

00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:52.465
if we wanted to, but hopefully you get the idea of what is going on behind the scenes.

00:05:52.465 --> 00:05:55.520
We'll also take advantage of a lot of the

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.805
class' created photos as we build this projects.

00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:01.880
This would also be the same as a CSS file if

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.075
we were to download it and add it to our project folder.

00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:08.300
The final thing I would like to point out is that while

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.395
all these styles are great to use and make our project look better,

00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:17.485
we can still override any of these base styles with our own style sheets.

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:20.945
We do this by creating our own CSS file,

00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:24.020
just like we've done in previous projects and

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.610
link to it in the head section below this bootstrap link.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.950
It is actually encouraged to add to or override any of these default Bootstrap styles for

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.350
the simple reason that a lot of websites use

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.155
Bootstrap and we don't want all the websites online to start looking the same.

00:06:41.155 --> 00:06:43.730
It is a good idea to use Bootstrap though,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.915
for quickly building websites and components with best practices,

00:06:47.915 --> 00:06:50.974
consistent styling across different browsers,

00:06:50.974 --> 00:06:54.115
and also an excellent foundation to build on.

00:06:54.115 --> 00:06:56.190
Now we have our project setup.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.080
Next, let's move on to understanding how the Bootstrap grid works.
