00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.705
Let's begin this video by going back to our six original items in the index page.

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:11.220
Let's delete these last six that we added in early

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.465
on and then reload and now back to our original six items.

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:20.235
First, we want to begin by looking at a line items.

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:23.535
In the last video, we looked at justify content,

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:28.080
which aligned or items and also determined the space in between them.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.410
All this was done across the main axis.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.065
We have the main axis set to row.

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:40.570
This means all of the alignment and spacing was across the page from left to right.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.200
Align items also works with these same items too,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.995
but this time on the cross axis.

00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:50.645
Currently, with our current setup,

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:55.535
the cross axis would be vertical or from top to bottom.

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:59.705
For this demo, we can add some different heights to these items.

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:04.175
This will help us see better how align items works.

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:10.060
Let's go over to our six items and then let's add some style,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.755
so the style attributes.

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:18.709
Let's add the height and let's go for 300 pixels,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.985
then copy this section.

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:26.290
We can add this in a couple more times.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:35.715
I'm going to go for 250 on this one and then 320 at the end, and then refresh.

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:38.105
Now this looks a little strange.

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:41.765
We've only set the heights of three of these items,

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:44.540
but it looks like they've all changed.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.315
This is because the default value for align items is stretch,

00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:53.870
so the flex items will stretch to the height of the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.380
tallest one to fill the heights of the container.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.040
So back over to our styles at the top of the page.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.635
Again, this is during the parent container.

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:07.655
We can add align items and as we just mentioned,

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:09.790
stretch is the default,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.085
so adding a sign won't cause any changes.

00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:16.470
Let's begin with flex-start.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.190
flex-start will start the items on the starting edge of the cross axis.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.620
So for those this would be the top of the page and then working down.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.355
Now we see the three items which height we've changed,

00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:37.000
and the right-hand still, as originally were.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.135
If we want changes to start at the bottom of the page,

00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:44.070
we would then use flex-end.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.700
Remember these flex-start and flex-end position is dependent on which axis,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.815
is our main and cross.

00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:58.630
If I went ahead and changed the main axis to be column,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.345
so rather than row,

00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:02.745
if you change this to be column,

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:07.925
refresh and now this sets the main axis to be vertical,

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:14.060
meaning the flex-end, which sets a cross axis would now be over on the right-hand side.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.895
If we change it back to row and then reinstate.

00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:22.520
Also, there is option to center the items too.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.170
Again, using align items,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.490
we can change flex-end to be center.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.380
You can probably imagine what this does.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.460
This adds a line right down the middle of the container

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.020
and all items will be spaced evenly above and below this line.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.380
These type of layouts used to be a lot more complex,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.925
but with flex box,

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:48.385
this allows us to do all these with just a few lines of CSS.

00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:54.120
We can take things even further too by aligning to the baseline of the text.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.585
This text which is in-between each item.

00:03:57.585 --> 00:04:04.260
Let's change center to be baseline, refresh.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.145
Inside the browser on first glance,

00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:10.520
it looks no different from the flex-start option.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.900
Remember, though this is a line into the baseline.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.100
The baseline is the bottom line of the text and this is what we see here.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.455
To see a change, we'll need to move the text outer position.

00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:26.870
Horizontal line should do this for us.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.305
Let's go down to our items and inside this first div we can now add a horizontal line.

00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:37.360
Let's see what effect this has over in the browser.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.435
Now we have more content inside here.

00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:43.600
This pushed down is item one text and

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.380
all the other items still aligned to the bottom of this.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.445
If we move the text outer position on another element too,

00:04:51.445 --> 00:04:53.425
it will also still align.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:57.860
This time add two horizontal lines,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.430
this is inside of item three and then refresh.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.555
Now, we can see that all items still aligned up,

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:09.095
even though I've added two extra pieces of content.

00:05:09.095 --> 00:05:12.905
This is how we can use align items in flex box.

00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:14.285
In the next video,

00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:21.029
we'll take a look at another cross axis alignment method called align content.
