00:00:05.200  -->  00:00:07.200
All right, so now we move on to generics.

2

00:00:07.700  -->  00:00:10.700
Wikipedia describes generic programming as the following.

3

00:00:11.500  -->  00:00:14.800
Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which

4

00:00:14.800  -->  00:00:19.000
algorithms are written in terms of types to be specified later

5

00:00:19.250  -->  00:00:20.950
that are then instantiated

6

00:00:20.950  -->  00:00:24.150
when needed for specific types provided as parameters.

7

00:00:24.650  -->  00:00:28.850
And the link, you can see on screen there is also in the resource section, so grab that if you want more detail.

8

00:00:29.250  -->  00:00:31.250
Basically, it stands from this definition

9

00:00:31.250  -->  00:00:33.450
that a generic class or generic method

10

00:00:33.450  -->  00:00:36.750
would then contain at least one type to be specified later.

11

00:00:37.250  -->  00:00:40.550
Genomics were introduced to Java in SE 5.0

12

00:00:40.550  -->  00:00:42.950
to support just such a class or method.

13

00:00:43.550  -->  00:00:47.550
So, in the next bunch of videos in this section, I'm going to start discussing generic classes,

14

00:00:47.550  -->  00:00:50.350
generic methods, and using wildcards when using them.

15

00:00:50.350  -->  00:00:52.350
So, let's move on to the next video.
