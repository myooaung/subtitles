00:00:05.360  -->  00:00:07.510
So, which IDE should
you use in this course?

2

00:00:07.890  -->  00:00:11.880
Well, I use and recommended
IntelliJ IDEA, created by JetBrains.

3

00:00:12.429  -->  00:00:15.949
Specifically, I'm using the community
edition which is free to download

4

00:00:15.950  -->  00:00:17.209
and use with no restrictions.

5

00:00:17.690  -->  00:00:20.150
But feel free to use any other IDE.

6

00:00:20.540  -->  00:00:25.420
Almost any IDE that supports Java and
specifically JDK 11 should work ok.

7

00:00:26.090  -->  00:00:29.909
Now, occasionally if you're using a
different IDE to me, you may have to

8

00:00:29.910  -->  00:00:33.120
figure out things like the command
line, or runtime arguments, etc.

9

00:00:33.360  -->  00:00:35.020
But I don't expect you'll
have any real issues.

10

00:00:35.539  -->  00:00:37.480
All right, so that's the
housekeeping out of the way.

11

00:00:37.780  -->  00:00:40.190
Let's move now onto section one
and get stuck into the course.

12

00:00:40.550  -->  00:00:41.720
See you there.
