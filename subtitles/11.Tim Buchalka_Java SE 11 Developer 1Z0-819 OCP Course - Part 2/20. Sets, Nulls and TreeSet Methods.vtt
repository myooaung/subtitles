00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:12.040
Protests are continuing on the last video, how it was evaluated when testing the quality of sets of

2
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:19.150
previously stated that hash sets and link test sets contain those and the trace set does not carried

3
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.270
and will test this out.

4
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.470
So here, what you can say I've done is added a now to the set height and I'm comparing it to the linked

5
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.290
hasset, which doesn't contain.

6
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.340
Now we're checking for equality.

7
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.390
So let's actually run this.

8
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.740
The airport confirms that a set with a now will not equal a sit with the same families without an.

9
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.530
Let's look at several methods that differentiate the sets to trace.

10
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.840
It implements an interface called Navigable Set, which provides additional functionality to the trace

11
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.050
it.

12
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.030
So we're going to do is a pin simple code and look at these additional trace methods.

13
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.820
So let's just get back up to the top.

14
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.490
Standing alone, 40 items were posted in so this case demonstrates the usage of the lower the higher

15
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.040
the floor and the ceiling methods.

16
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.020
So you could say we've got to lower being invoked, starting a line fifty six.

17
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.510
Well, this looks for an element that is directly less than an element passed to the perimeter looking

18
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.110
backward.

19
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.730
So it would return the greatest element that is less than the element specified.

20
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.720
And it returns.

21
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.960
No, if no such element can be found on the floor, as you can see, being used here starting on 65.

22
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.590
It's the same as lower, except it returns the greatest element that is less than or equal to the element

23
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.660
specified or null if it doesn't exist.

24
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.480
Also got higher standing on line eighty three, this looks for an element that's directly greater than

25
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.970
the element passed to the perimeter looking forward so that it would return the element that's immediately

26
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.700
greater than the element specified and it returns null if no such element can be found.

27
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.600
And finally, we've got ceiling study online, 74.

28
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.750
It's the same as higher, except it returns the element that is directly greater than or equal then

29
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.160
the element specified or null.

30
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.890
If it doesn't exist, it's from this code.

31
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.070
We could see the results.

32
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.650
They're using lower floor ceiling as well as higher.

33
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.510
So this video and the previous two covered many of the features the collection interface provides using

34
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.300
the set implementations to test the methods in common, they've also covered the three common implementations

35
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.220
of set Peche set preset and linked hasset.

36
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.630
So it's important to remember the attributes of each how which is ordered, whether those are valid

37
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.930
elements and whether duplicates are allowed in the set.

38
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.210
In the next video, I'll be reviewing the interface briefly, which I actually discussed in greater

39
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.000
detail in Section ten of the one zero eight one nine part one course that I've got here on YouTube to

40
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.200
refer to that if you need to.

41
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.850
And in addition, moving forward, they're going to be reviewing the Q and DEC collections.

42
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.570
So let's move on.
