00:00:05.270  -->  00:00:08.760
So, why use Java 11 when there
are newer versions available?

2

00:00:09.309  -->  00:00:11.860
Well first and foremost, the
current java certification

3

00:00:11.860  -->  00:00:15.050
exam, the 1Z0-819 uses Java 11.

4

00:00:15.339  -->  00:00:17.380
So, that's your primary
reason right there.

5

00:00:17.949  -->  00:00:21.230
But looking into it a bit more,
Oracle releases a ton of versions

6

00:00:21.230  -->  00:00:25.740
of Java, but only designates one
version as their LTS version,

7

00:00:25.920  -->  00:00:27.650
LTS being Long Term Support.

8

00:00:28.230  -->  00:00:31.740
Java 11 is the version that
Oracle designate as their

9

00:00:31.740  -->  00:00:33.630
long-term support version of Java.

10

00:00:35.100  -->  00:00:37.170
We've got a link on screen as you
can see there, if we have a look at

11

00:00:37.170  -->  00:00:40.010
the Oracle Java roadmap table here.

12

00:00:41.480  -->  00:00:46.030
Again, we can see only one version is
marked as LTS, that's Java release 11.

13

00:00:46.740  -->  00:00:50.570
And you can see that version 11
became available in September 2018.

14

00:00:50.990  -->  00:00:55.730
It has Premier Support until
September 2023 and Extended Support

15

00:00:55.800  -->  00:00:58.699
until at least September 2026.

16

00:00:59.920  -->  00:01:03.680
Note also that many of the versions
they got released after the version

17

00:01:03.680  -->  00:01:08.110
11, namely 12 through 14 have
effectively no longer got support.

18

00:01:09.339  -->  00:01:12.370
Premier Support has expired
and Extended Support

19

00:01:12.370  -->  00:01:13.430
is no longer available.

20

00:01:14.750  -->  00:01:17.449
Even version 15 released
only in the same month I'm

21

00:01:17.450  -->  00:01:22.969
recording this video has Premier
Support until only March 2021.

22

00:01:24.210  -->  00:01:25.600
So, that's how Oracle roll.

23

00:01:25.960  -->  00:01:30.160
They effectively release an LTS
version and support that for the

24

00:01:30.160  -->  00:01:34.200
longer term and then incremental
versions with new features, but expire

25

00:01:34.200  -->  00:01:35.750
fairly quickly in terms of support.

26

00:01:36.680  -->  00:01:39.480
So what many, perhaps most
commercial companies using Java

27

00:01:39.480  -->  00:01:44.249
will do is, use the stable LTS
version of Java which is version 11.

28

00:01:45.049  -->  00:01:47.460
No company is going to want
to release a version of its

29

00:01:47.460  -->  00:01:51.620
software using features from
an unsupported version of Java.

30

00:01:52.410  -->  00:01:54.100
And I think if you use the
search engine to search

31

00:01:54.100  -->  00:01:55.890
around for this, you'd find
this is pretty common advice.

32

00:01:55.890  -->  00:02:00.080
I've got one link on screen
here I can show you talking

33

00:02:00.080  -->  00:02:04.079
about don't ever put a non-java
LTS version into production.

34

00:02:04.900  -->  00:02:07.680
And the development teams
should avoid non-long-term

35

00:02:07.680  -->  00:02:09.369
support releases at all costs.

36

00:02:09.650  -->  00:02:11.720
Pay attention to the Java
release cycle to make sure

37

00:02:11.720  -->  00:02:12.760
your updates are supported.

38

00:02:14.220  -->  00:02:18.160
Larger companies using Java
certainly wouldn't be looking to

39

00:02:18.679  -->  00:02:22.380
release software from versions
of Java that have got no support.

40

00:02:23.750  -->  00:02:26.680
Right, so another question that
I do get though is, what about

41

00:02:26.680  -->  00:02:30.260
future LTS versions of Java,
because presumably at some point,

42

00:02:30.650  -->  00:02:33.899
Java version 11 will no longer
be the long term support version.

43

00:02:34.650  -->  00:02:35.149
Well, that's true.

44

00:02:35.150  -->  00:02:40.089
If we check out this java version
history link here, scroll down, you

45

00:02:40.090  -->  00:02:45.070
can see that Java SE 17 is the next
long-term support version of Java

46

00:02:45.410  -->  00:02:48.400
that's due out in September 2021.

47

00:02:50.450  -->  00:02:51.610
But don't be too concerned.

48

00:02:51.700  -->  00:02:55.290
Companies won't immediately
rush to upgrade to Java 17

49

00:02:55.580  -->  00:03:00.289
because they have support for
Java 11 until 2023 at a minimum.

50

00:03:00.799  -->  00:03:03.185
Sure, at some point, you'll
probably want to upgrade your

51

00:03:03.240  -->  00:03:08.260
Java certification to Java 17,
but realistically, you have for

52

00:03:08.309  -->  00:03:10.779
at least two to three years before
you have to worry about it and

53

00:03:10.780  -->  00:03:13.370
before Java 17 becomes mainstream.

54

00:03:13.860  -->  00:03:16.859
I mean look at Java 8 to see
what's happened in the past.

55

00:03:17.209  -->  00:03:19.489
It's still used by many
companies today and is

56

00:03:19.930  -->  00:03:21.350
still supported by Oracle.

57

00:03:21.850  -->  00:03:25.030
Oracle realizes that companies
investing in Java for their software

58

00:03:25.030  -->  00:03:28.780
development don't want to chop and
change versions on a regular basis.

59

00:03:29.059  -->  00:03:32.480
This is why the LTS versions only
come out every few years and are

60

00:03:32.480  -->  00:03:34.600
then supported in the long term.

61

00:03:37.240  -->  00:03:41.300
And remember, the Java certification
exam is all about Java 11.

62

00:03:41.650  -->  00:03:43.430
For now, Focus on Java 11.

63

00:03:43.780  -->  00:03:46.660
And hopefully, you now know why
we're using Java 11 in this course.

64

00:03:47.559  -->  00:03:49.500
So download and use Java 11.

65

00:03:49.640  -->  00:03:54.680
Now, if you're confused as to which
JDK to download because many vendors

66

00:03:54.680  -->  00:03:58.369
including Oracle, Amazon, and
others have their own JDK version.

67

00:03:58.730  -->  00:04:00.100
Well, in general, it doesn't matter.

68

00:04:00.180  -->  00:04:03.489
Just choose a reputable one,
a company that you recognize.

69

00:04:03.760  -->  00:04:07.540
So long as it's a JDK version
11, you're good to go and it'll

70

00:04:07.540  -->  00:04:08.769
certainly work in this course.

71

00:04:09.349  -->  00:04:11.480
But if you want to know what
my recommendation is, watch

72

00:04:11.480  -->  00:04:14.930
the Which JDK to download
video later in this section.

73

00:04:15.460  -->  00:04:17.690
Alright, so let's move
on now to the next video.
