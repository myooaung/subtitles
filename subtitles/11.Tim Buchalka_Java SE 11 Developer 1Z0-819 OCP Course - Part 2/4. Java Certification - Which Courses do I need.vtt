00:00:05.340  -->  00:00:08.140
So as shown in this course
title, this is Part Two.

2

00:00:08.440  -->  00:00:11.409
So that implies that there's a
Part 1, which there is on Udemy,

3

00:00:11.730  -->  00:00:15.010
and yes, you need that course also
if you want to be covered for all

4

00:00:15.020  -->  00:00:19.340
the topics that will potentially
come up in the 1Z0-819 exam.

5

00:00:20.130  -->  00:00:23.689
Previously, you had to sit for
two exams to get Java certified.

6

00:00:24.370  -->  00:00:28.130
I had an already released course for
the first exam and a work in progress

7

00:00:28.130  -->  00:00:30.500
course, this one to cover Part Two.

8

00:00:31.290  -->  00:00:34.220
Oracle decided to switch from
the requirement of passing two

9

00:00:34.220  -->  00:00:36.240
exams to just a single one.

10

00:00:36.719  -->  00:00:39.980
Now, that's great for you because
a new exam is the same length as

11

00:00:40.060  -->  00:00:43.360
each of the two previous exams,
meaning it's going to be easier

12

00:00:43.360  -->  00:00:47.220
for you to pass because there'll be
fewer questions per topic [as they

13

00:00:47.259  -->  00:00:51.029
have to cram the equivalent of two
courses into this one single exam].

14

00:00:53.400  -->  00:00:57.599
The actual material or topics covered
haven't changed, other than a few

15

00:00:57.600  -->  00:01:01.270
things being removed, so I decided
to fix what needed to be fixed

16

00:01:01.270  -->  00:01:04.940
in part one of my course and then
finish off and release this Part two.

17

00:01:05.340  -->  00:01:07.699
So, yes, you will need to enroll
in both of my courses, Part

18

00:01:07.700  -->  00:01:12.940
one and Part two of the Oracle
1Z0-819 Java certification

19

00:01:12.940  -->  00:01:14.460
course to cover all the material.

20

00:01:14.830  -->  00:01:18.360
Collectively, in fact, they
cover 100% of the material that

21

00:01:18.360  -->  00:01:19.860
can come up in the new exam.

22

00:01:20.330  -->  00:01:23.330
So, think of Part one as the
essentials collection and Part

23

00:01:23.330  -->  00:01:24.710
two as the more advanced stuff.

24

00:01:25.549  -->  00:01:29.320
So note that Part two contains
little to no content from Part one.

25

00:01:29.699  -->  00:01:31.720
They are completely different courses.

26

00:01:32.160  -->  00:01:34.950
I recommend you start with Part
one for obvious reasons, then

27

00:01:34.950  -->  00:01:39.000
complete Part two at which time
you're then ready to sit the exam.

28

00:01:41.210  -->  00:01:44.070
The only other thing I want to mention
is that these courses are designed

29

00:01:44.070  -->  00:01:46.409
to assist you in passing the exam.

30

00:01:46.760  -->  00:01:48.660
They're not actually
designed to teach you Java.

31

00:01:49.200  -->  00:01:52.480
Now, yes, you'll learn a lot of new
stuff, particularly weird syntax and

32

00:01:52.490  -->  00:01:54.330
stuff that you'll use rarely, or ever.

33

00:01:55.010  -->  00:01:57.649
But if you've previously never
used Java, you'll most likely

34

00:01:57.650  -->  00:01:59.310
struggle in both of these courses.

35

00:01:59.710  -->  00:02:03.329
Fear not, though, because if you're
in this scenario, I've got an 80 hour

36

00:02:03.330  -->  00:02:07.320
Java Masterclass also on Udemy, where
you can learn Java from scratch.

37

00:02:07.960  -->  00:02:09.170
So, grab that if you need it.

38

00:02:09.410  -->  00:02:11.800
Go through a good portion of that
course and you'll be ready for these

39

00:02:11.800  -->  00:02:14.010
two Java certification courses.

40

00:02:15.980  -->  00:02:19.239
But if you have some exposure to
Java, and you focus on getting Java

41

00:02:19.239  -->  00:02:22.510
certified, you're good to go, so
let's now move on to the next video

42

00:02:23.109  -->  00:02:27.260
where I want to explain briefly
these ridiculous codes, acronyms,

43

00:02:27.260  -->  00:02:30.480
or whatever you want to call them,
that Oracle use for their exams and

44

00:02:30.490  -->  00:02:31.860
what specifically you need to know.

45

00:02:32.420  -->  00:02:33.560
See you in the next video.
