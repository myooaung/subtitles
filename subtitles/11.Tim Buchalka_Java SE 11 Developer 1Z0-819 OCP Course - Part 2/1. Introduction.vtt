Welcome to this course and
thank you for investing in it.
1

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.520
My name is Tim Buchalka, and
I’m the course instructor.
2

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.140
So, I'm assuming you're here because
you want to get Java certified.
3

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.450
That's what this course is all about.
4

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.870
Oracle, the owners of the java
language, and the company who create
5

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.740
the exam that you will ultimately
need to pass to become Java certified,
6

7
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.430
like messing with you in various ways.
7

8
00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.169
I said exam and not exams because
only very recently have they swapped
8

9
00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:37.050
back to a single exam to become
Java certified instead of the two
9

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.940
exams you previously needed to pass.
10

11
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.910
That's a huge bonus for you.
11

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.250
Oracle often use tricky, rarely
used syntax in their exam
12

13
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.370
questions to try and trip you up.
13

14
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.460
But don't worry, I've got you back and
we'll be carrying over all that tricky
14

15
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.440
stuff and the regular stuff you need
to know in order to pass the exam.
15

16
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.000
We'll be using Java 11 in this
course and not the just-released
16

17
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.620
Java 15 [as of September 2020
when I’m recording this].
17

18
00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.350
If you don't know why
Java 11 is being used.
18

19
00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.710
I urge you to check out the Why
Java 11 video in this section.
19

20
00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.839
As you can see by the name of
this course, this is Part 2 of
20

21
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.080
my Java certification courses
for the 1Z0-819 exam.
21

22
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.110
Why have I got two Java
certification courses?
22

23
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.420
Well, technically three if
you include the now outdated
23

24
00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:26.169
Java 8 certification course.
24

25
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.760
Well, there's a reason for that.
25

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.279
Check out the Courses to
take to get Java certified
26

27
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.230
video, again in this section.
27

28
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.380
Now, what's the deal with all these
weird codes Oracle uses anyway?
28

29
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.020
I'm talking about the 1Z0-819,
1Z0-816, 1Z0-808, etc.
29

30
00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.799
Yes, I've got a video for that.
30

31
00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:48.420
Check out the which Oracle
exam do I need to take
31

32
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.850
video, again in this section.
32

33
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.450
So, you could go and hunt for
all those videos I've just talked
33

34
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.620
about, or just watch them because
they're coming up, in order,
34

35
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.390
starting with an overview of what's
in this course, in the next video.
