00:00:05.370  -->  00:00:08.170
In this section, we'll cover
some Java fundamentals

2

00:00:08.170  -->  00:00:12.100
from the point of view of
Oracle's 1Z0-819 exam.

3

00:00:13.000  -->  00:00:14.209
Specifically, we'll be coveringâ€¦

4

00:00:14.299  -->  00:00:16.040
Creating and using final classes.

5

00:00:16.500  -->  00:00:20.650
But we'll also take a closer look at
nested classes and anonymous classes.

6

00:00:21.230  -->  00:00:23.870
And finally, I'll be discussing
the use of a type called enum

7

00:00:23.950  -->  00:00:26.720
[Enumeration], which you're
probably already familiar with.

8

00:00:28.509  -->  00:00:33.710
So, note that my 1Z0-819 Part 1 course
covered most of the Java fundamentals

9

00:00:33.710  -->  00:00:37.460
needed to pass the exam, including
class modifiers and their meaning.

10

00:00:37.800  -->  00:00:39.380
i.e. All the basic stuff.

11

00:00:39.500  -->  00:00:41.280
I'm not repeating that content here.

12

00:00:41.950  -->  00:00:44.540
Rather, the videos coming up here
assume that you've watched those

13

00:00:44.540  -->  00:00:47.880
other videos and/or have that
basic knowledge so that we can

14

00:00:47.880  -->  00:00:49.020
get into the more advanced stuff.

15

00:00:49.650  -->  00:00:51.960
This is as I've outlined in the
introductory videos â€“ we are

16

00:00:51.969  -->  00:00:55.080
not duplicating content that
exists in the other course.

17

00:00:55.590  -->  00:00:58.850
Now, if you need a recap on the
basic fundamentals, refer to my

18

00:00:58.850  -->  00:01:01.330
1Z0-819 Part 1 course on Udemy.

19

00:01:01.800  -->  00:01:06.030
Specifically, Section 6, Defining
the structure of a Class, as well as

20

00:01:06.030  -->  00:01:08.620
Section 8, Applying Access Modifiers.

21

00:01:09.190  -->  00:01:10.739
With that said, let's get started.
