00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.120
A collection is a type which represents a container for a group of objects, the objects stored in a

2
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.220
collection are known as its elements.

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.360
The collections framework in Java supplies, interfaces and built in support for various types of collections.

4
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.190
The collection interface is the base for all the other interfaces in the framework.

5
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.590
With the exception of a map, all interfaces in the collection framework are generic.

6
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.920
They've got a diagram on screen there, and the link is in the resources section as it is on screen,

7
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.220
but that's an overview of the core collection interfaces.

8
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.490
So the collection's framework consists of interfaces of which the main ones, the shower in this table.

9
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.700
So from left to right, we start up with a list that's ordered, as you can see there, and duplicates

10
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.910
are allowed now are allowed by an entire index.

11
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.120
The Element X is by an integer index, and it's sometimes also known as a sequence.

12
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.520
The map interface is not ordered and no duplicate keys are allowed.

13
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.940
A key cannot be now, but a value may be no.

14
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.470
The element accesses by key value pairs usually accessed by the key.

15
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.360
So this map's keys to Veliz a key can only map to what value at most.

16
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.370
Next one set is not ordered and 90 packets are allowed.

17
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.650
Only one at most nodes are allowed and you access the elements by using an iterator.

18
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.240
Next, we've got queue.

19
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.570
It is ordered and duplicates are allowed now not usually allowed, although linked list is a queue that

20
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.230
does allow it.

21
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.500
First in, first out usually is the element access priority queue is the exception.

22
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.740
So it is used to hold multiple elements prior to some type of processing.

23
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.850
Every queue implementation must specify its ordering properties.

24
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.780
And the last word on screen is Dick.

25
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.890
Yes, it is ordered, duplicates are allowed, those are not allowed.

26
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.360
The limited access is first in, first out, as well as last in, first out.

27
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.250
An attack is a double ended.

28
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.730
Q.

29
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.200
In the next few videos, we're talking about the collection interface in more detail, as well as the

30
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.020
interfaces that extended set list.

31
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.230
Q and Dick and some of the implementation details of each, after which I'll review the map interface

32
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.490
and its implementations.

33
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.910
So let's get started in the next video.
