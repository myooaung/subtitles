00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.390
Unlike part one of my one zero eight one nine course on Udemy, this part two was released as a work

2
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.150
in progress rather than waiting for me to complete it.

3
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.170
Many students were fairly desperate to get started with this course.

4
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.110
So I conducted a poll asking students to vote on whether I should release it as a work in progress or

5
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.340
wait until it's completed.

6
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.850
So switching over to a browser here is a result of the votes.

7
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.650
OK, here's the location, they can see the result there was fairly tight, but I can say I had the

8
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.130
two options.

9
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.170
They release it now as a work in progress.

10
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.110
Eight hundred and three votes finish it first before releasing seven hundred and sixty nine votes.

11
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.160
The link I leave in the resources section of this video if you want to chase that up.

12
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.130
I'm not sure if the page will eventually get deleted as it was a free service, but as you can see,

13
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.040
release it now got more votes than wait until it's completed.

14
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.590
So I've released it now.

15
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.560
Now, want to confirm to you that we'll be giving every priority to complete this course as soon as

16
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.970
possible, you'll see regular videos added to this course each and every week.

17
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.720
The expected completion of all 17 sections is December twenty twenty or January twenty twenty one.

18
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.660
Now, I hope I haven't shot myself in the foot by releasing it early and giving myself the possibility

19
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.470
of bad reviews.

20
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.770
Of course you can and should be the person who decides how to write my course.

21
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.840
I'm not suggesting anything to the contrary.

22
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.790
There is already a decent amount of material here for you to get started with and with the updates coming

23
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.840
through, I hope that you'll be happy with the course as it sits now and with the updates.

24
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.640
If you have invested in both my Part one and Part two courses, thank you and this might be a good opportunity

25
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.210
to swing over and complete part one, since that is 100 percent completed and uploaded and as a prerequisite

26
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.430
for taking this Part two each week, I'll send through an announcement letting you know what's been

27
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.750
added.

28
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.580
So note that unlike other course updates, I won't be waiting for a section to be completed before releasing

29
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.730
it.

30
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.930
I'll actually literally update videos as soon as they're recorded and edited.

31
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.580
So you should see regular updates through the week, not in a big chunk once a week or something like

32
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.840
that.

33
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.710
Or the piston happy string cheese timber late October twenty twenty.

34
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.430
And I better get back to updating the videos now.
