00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.850
In this lesson, we'll continue customizing our 2022 theme site by creating a blog page that shows the

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.340
latest blog posts, you'll create a page template from scratch, adding the blog posts layout with a

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.070
sidebar from a block pattern provided by the theme.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.270
And make sure the header and footer is included on the page by the end of this video.

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.960
You'll see how you can add a brand new template that you can use on any page.

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.080
Let's go back and work with the 2020 theme a little bit more and get to know the template site editor

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.070
and template parts to create some different customizations on our website.

8
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.910
So log back into the sandbox and go to the dashboard where you've got your 2022 theme that we've been

9
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.530
working on activated.

10
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.210
And let's go ahead and right click Visit Site, and I'll open it in another tab, and let's just review

11
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.380
what we have here.

12
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.100
We've got a home page that shows a particular header that's exclusive to the home page, and it's showing

13
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:06.560
the latest posts in reverse chronological order in a kind of full width layout with big featured images

14
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.030
and titles that are clickable to the blog posts and a standard footer.

15
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.090
And then we got three subsequent pages.

16
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.640
The About page uses a very large header with an image and an a big heading, as well as a block pattern

17
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.400
that shows a grid of blog posts.

18
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.580
And then there's a view all button that we created.

19
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.310
And we also have a call to action with potentially a room for an opt in form right here and that standard

20
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.690
footer.

21
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.620
Once again, the event page, if you remember, we created a special template that eliminates the page

22
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.160
title.

23
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.720
And again, the kind of standard header and footer on there.

24
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.550
And finally, a landing page without a header for the film page, which has a different background color.

25
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.860
And we also set up a footer which is actually embedded in the page content with that matching background

26
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.880
color and a menu item at the bottom with the home link.

27
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:20.510
And so the first thing we'll do is go back into the site dashboard and let's open up appearance editor

28
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.310
once again and take a look at what we have and what we've customized so far.

29
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.370
So since I was on the homepage, it opens that up first and we can look at templates.

30
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.270
You can see that I created and hopefully you created a new template with that was called Page No title.

31
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.780
The rest are templates provided by the 2022 theme.

32
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.690
And then there are four template parts that are a header and a footer and then a header.

33
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.590
Two other header options the dark small header and the dark large header that are incorporated into

34
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.980
existing templates.

35
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:07.580
And so for this next project, let's go in and for the site here, let's create a blog page that has

36
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.900
its own sidebar, something that's different from a full width blog post layout here and also different

37
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.140
from what we have on the about page with that grid layout.

38
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:27.110
And so if we go back into the site dashboard, one thing we can start with if we want to create a blog

39
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.680
page.

40
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.060
And this will be called that blog archive because it's going to list the last three posts or last series

41
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.350
of posts in reverse order.

42
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.240
Plus, we'll provide a sidebar that we can customize for that page.

43
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.350
And so I'll go to pages all pages and I don't have a blog archive page created yet.

44
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.340
So I'm just going to add a new page and we can call a blog and and I'll go ahead and publish that page

45
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.690
for now.

46
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.570
So it's saved.

47
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.530
And then over here, we don't have a blog page template, and that's what we're going to be creating

48
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.400
in this lesson.

49
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:12.800
So let's click new and we're going to create a custom template called blog and just hit create.

50
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.620
And now what we have here is, you know, kind of a standard template.

51
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.620
It doesn't show anything except the page title.

52
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.570
There's nothing in the content area.

53
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.720
It has, you know, a header that doesn't really look right.

54
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.700
And then there's no footer on there, either.

55
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.530
So I'm going to click Update and what I'd like to what I like to do is get out of this kind of, you

56
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.790
know, template editing screen that's within a particular page and click back and then I'll click the

57
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.530
logo at the top left again to get back out to the to the WordPress dashboard.

58
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.270
And so now I can go to appearence editor, and that new template should appear in my templates list

59
00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.020
if I click the logo again and then under editor click templates.

60
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:07.430
Now I have a blog template created by me, and I can click blog there to take a look at it in the in

61
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.260
the blog template editing screen.

62
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.440
So now I have some resources I can use.

63
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.430
Like this list?

64
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.000
View right here to see what's already existing as a part of this template, as well as this plus button

65
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.250
or over here, as you remember, I.

66
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.720
Can get two blocks and patterns.

67
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.240
And also, we have patterns to choose from here.

68
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:36.440
And we're going to utilize this to create this blog post archive template with a sidebar.

69
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.870
And so first of all, I'm going to just close that and open the list view again.

70
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.490
And you know, this header is the wrong type of header.

71
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.800
And so really the first thing I'll do is just I can select that and I'm going to go ahead and bring

72
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.650
in a header pattern.

73
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.760
And it just says there's the default header right up at the top and it creates it right here.

74
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.240
And you can see that it's already added blog, and we're going to discuss that later in this section

75
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.270
where this is actually bringing in.

76
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.440
We just close that right here and look at the list view that's bringing in just a page list.

77
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:23.180
So every page that's within the site is going to be listed up here in the navigation and we'll customize

78
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.690
that later.

79
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.990
But for now, I just brought in a group, which is my page header.

80
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.780
Of course, I have this extra group up here, which I could just click the three dots and remove that

81
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.080
group.

82
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.780
So now I have a standard header right up at the top of my blog post archive page.

83
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.120
Just click Save and Save.

84
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:48.090
And then when we go down to the next section, we've got, you know, just post title and post content,

85
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.640
whether that's a page or a post, this is just going to bring in whatever it is, you know, the single

86
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.010
title and content for that page.

87
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.840
But what we need is a query loop with the blog posts there.

88
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.320
But what we want to do is, you know, put a sidebar in there.

89
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.680
And so, you know, I have this group selected right here.

90
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.080
Doesn't matter really what I have selected.

91
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.660
We can always move it around, but I'm going to click.

92
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:19.110
Plus, I'm going to look at patterns and let's use the explorer window so that they're a little bit

93
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.530
bigger.

94
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:26.010
And in 2022, under pages, I know that there's a number of different page designs that we can use,

95
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.650
and we're going to leverage that in order to do what we need right here towards the bottom.

96
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.830
You can start to see what we have now.

97
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.290
Here is a list of blog posts with a left sidebar.

98
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.880
Here's a list of blog posts with a right sidebar, which is what I had in mind.

99
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.560
So I'm just going to click that.

100
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.250
And now this is looking pretty good, isn't it?

101
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.950
It's already pulling in the three posts that we already have with their featured images, and it has

102
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.440
a sidebar on the right side.

103
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.130
It's got a few different sections.

104
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.710
It's got a list of categories.

105
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.570
It's got a list of tags.

106
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:08.010
And it has, you know, there's an image at the very top, the name of the site and the tag line of

107
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:08.550
the site.

108
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.880
And we can just leave that as it is for now.

109
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:20.250
Just below here now you can see that it's actually brought in its own header, which doesn't contain

110
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.240
the page title.

111
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:26.130
So I'll go back to the list view so I can figure out what I'm controlling here, and I could see that

112
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.100
within this group that was in the block pattern.

113
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.010
It's got its own navigation.

114
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.310
I'm just going to go ahead and get rid of that.

115
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.350
So I'll just go to that row and go to the three dots and remove that group.

116
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.680
So now I also have a spacer right here that I probably don't need doesn't look like I need that space,

117
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.730
or so I'll take that out.

118
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.040
And now this is looking pretty good.

119
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:51.510
OK.

120
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.560
So what else do we have down here on the page?

121
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.920
We also have this left over separator line.

122
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:06.300
Let's go to the bottom and look at what that is down here, separator and then a group which is the

123
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.280
old post title and post content.

124
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.760
So I'm going to get rid of the separator.

125
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.640
I'm going to get rid of this whole group.

126
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.230
And at the bottom, we also do need a page footer down here.

127
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.740
So don't forget you can add a block right here.

128
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:29.880
You can go and say, now, is there going to be a footer block when I start to search for a block over

129
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.220
here within the editing area?

130
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.560
It does give me a few options.

131
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.850
It'll give me a template part.

132
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.590
It'll give me a footer.

133
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.370
And then there's some blocks that come with the theme footer with the logo and the citation and footer

134
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.980
with the navigation and the citation.

135
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.170
And so what is it that we want to use?

136
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.210
It's kind of up to us.

137
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.780
We could use a template part that already exists.

138
00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.650
And what that means is that when we have that template part here, it can be used on multiple pages

139
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.250
of the site.

140
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:09.540
And so if I want to edit the footer template part that is site wide, it'll change it on every page

141
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.910
of the website, including this blog archive page.

142
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.590
So right down here, you could either either create a new template part or let's choose an existing

143
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.860
one.

144
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.510
And so for the area of the footer, there's just one footer template part.

145
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:27.840
If you remember and there's three header ones, let's just use the footer template part, which is that

146
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.710
standard template part and that's been inserted in the page now.

147
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:37.650
And so from here, I think I have a nice looking blog archive page.

148
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:44.160
We'll click Save Save again because it's just verifying that we're going to save to the page template.

149
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.300
And let's go back to the WordPress dashboard.

150
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.100
We can go up here and let's let's refresh the home page.

151
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.590
And as you remember, it added another page link right here, and this is going to open up our blog

152
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.010
page.

153
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:05.520
And now we have a nice header and we have, you know, a great archive page.

154
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.490
The footer looks great, but there's something wrong with the header, isn't there.

155
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.490
We need some spacers in there, I believe.

156
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.230
So let's go back.

157
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.580
Let's just fix that very quickly.

158
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:25.280
Go back into the the site, Ed, and what we want are the templates, and we're editing this blog archive

159
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:31.040
and you could see that it's kind of busted up here in what I might do is go back.

160
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.520
And so this group right here is kind of messed up.

161
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:46.310
If I just select that group, I might just go ahead and add a I'm going to just add the header as a

162
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.500
template part the same way that I did before.

163
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.990
And so let's see.

164
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.210
I just start typing header.

165
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.770
I can add a template part.

166
00:11:55.250 --> 00:12:00.470
Let's choose an existing template part and we're going to put the standard header in there that looks

167
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.010
much better.

168
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.750
So this group up here I can oh, I put it actually within that group.

169
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.730
So it's this group here.

170
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.740
Remember, the blue line shows what you're editing.

171
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.900
And so I'm going to go ahead and remove the old header there.

172
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.500
Now that's looking right.

173
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.560
Let's see what it looks like on the front end.

174
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.030
If I save that.

175
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.450
Much better.

176
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.520
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

177
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.150
Let's see if I go back to the homepage.

178
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.710
There is something different.

179
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.980
This is actually stretched out to the outside.

180
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.620
How's it look on the event page?

181
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:41.050
Yeah, stretched out to the outside, but I look at the blog page now this is it's not all the way to

182
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:41.750
the outside.

183
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.960
So there's one more thing we need to fix.

184
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:52.300
This group right here does go to the outside, but the header itself looks like it's not stretched to

185
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.260
the outside.

186
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.690
Yeah, so if I click that block, let's see what I can find.

187
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.180
Maybe we want to inherit.

188
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.710
No, we don't want to inherit the default layout that kind of messed it up, didn't it?

189
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.350
And so this is sometimes there are things there's the footer things that you.

190
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:19.150
That you need to kind of play with and figure out.

191
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.820
Yeah, so let's see.

192
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.190
You know, I'm going to go back.

193
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.530
Let's close that oops.

194
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:34.480
Let's go back to the list view here, and I think it's this group that I had previously messing me up.

195
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:41.500
So, you know, I could just add that template part in again instead of having it be within the group

196
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.670
using this plus sign.

197
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:47.290
I mean, go ahead and use this plus sign and let's see.

198
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.240
If I just start typing template, I'm going to put a template part in here now that's outside of this

199
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:53.630
group.

200
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.460
This probably will work much better.

201
00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.140
Yes, there we go.

202
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.910
Choose an existing template part.

203
00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.910
Let's choose the traditional header.

204
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.540
Yeah, it does look a little bit messed up, doesn't it?

205
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:12.400
But let's see how how that's going to work for us and we'll get rid of this group at the top.

206
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.980
And let's see what else is happening here.

207
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:28.190
So this is going to this, it affects pages and it affects the blog template, but it also affects the

208
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.490
header template part.

209
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.300
But that does look messed up, doesn't it?

210
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.500
Well, here's what we can do.

211
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.210
I have an idea.

212
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.080
We'll save that.

213
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:40.790
And now let's go back and look at the template parts and this header.

214
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.820
We really didn't want to change that, the template parts.

215
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.060
And so we'll clear the customizations right there.

216
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.110
Now we might be able to go back into the.

217
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.170
Into the blog.

218
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.380
There we go.

219
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.460
Much better, I have it.

220
00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:07.140
I have the the header looking right and a sidebar as a part of the blog archive page.

221
00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:12.430
Now there's one more thing you might have noticed about the blog page here, and that is that the content

222
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:17.110
is extending outside of the content container.

223
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:25.720
That is kind of a standard width on all the other pages right here on the event page, you can see and

224
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.780
on the about page, the content container is a particular width, right?

225
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.440
And so let's look at that blog page again.

226
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:43.510
You can see that while the header is at the right with the content of the blog archive page is extending

227
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.840
outside, and that's something that's just a design choice.

228
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.240
But let's go ahead and try to fix that.

229
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:56.230
Let's go to the blog template once again and just take a look at what we have here.

230
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.250
So this group?

231
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.580
We might want to inherit the default layout because here we have content width.

232
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:09.640
It's either, you know, content in pixels and wide customize the width for all elements that are assigned

233
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.590
to the center or the wide columns.

234
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.060
So I have a group and then there's a set of columns right here.

235
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:21.670
And of course, this block pattern has two columns and we can adjust the spacing and everything as we

236
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.990
will.

237
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.260
But as far as this group, let's see what happens if I inherit the default layout and then save.

238
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.750
This is just an experiment.

239
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.430
There it was.

240
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.490
So that's inheriting the layout and the right width.

241
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.040
And now we have the right with great.

242
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.720
That's something that you can play with and get back to where you like.

243
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.470
So I've saved that.

244
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:50.980
I'll go and get outside of the site editor again, and we're in a nice place.

245
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:57.580
Now let's go to the about page next and we'll check out this view all button and make that point to

246
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.170
our new blog archive page.
