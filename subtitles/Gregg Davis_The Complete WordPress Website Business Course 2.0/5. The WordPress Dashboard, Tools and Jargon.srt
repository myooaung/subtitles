1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,810
In this lesson, I'll give you a high level overview and define some of the concepts, jargon and functions

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,090
and tools that WordPress users need to know to understand and leverage WordPress to the fullest extent.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,900
These include themes, plugins, blocks.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,320
Block patterns.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,920
The Classic editor and classic widgets.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,770
Plug ins and the customizer in case you're newer to WordPress.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:31,320
I'll use one of the default sandbox sites here to define some terms jargon and define how WordPress

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,310
is organized.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,030
Just to get you some familiarity with the way that it works.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,280
And I mean, use the sandbox site here.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,740
And also, I also have another site that I've created using local the local development environment

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,770
that you'll learn later in the course so that I could show you how to install a couple of classic WordPress

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,290
plugins that you might want to use to enable an older theme in WordPress and show you the difference

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:06,000
between classic themes and newer, block based full site editing themes like the twenty twenty two theme

15
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,050
right here.

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,910
Anyway, let's go inspect the WordPress dashboard right here.

17
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:18,330
Going down the left hand side, you know below the dashboard, the first thing you'll see is posts and

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:18,930
pages.

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,330
And just to define what those are, pages are static pages on the website.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,630
Those are things like the about page, the home page.

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:36,540
You'll you'll find that there's always an initial sample page within WordPress that is a page type or

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,320
post type within WordPress called a page.

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,750
And now pages are a little bit different because by default, they don't have a category and they don't

24
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,040
have tags enabled like the other post type called posts.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,680
It can be a little bit confusing at first because pages are very similar to posts.

26
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,770
Now you can think of posts as another type of page on your website, but really just designed to be

27
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,180
used for a blog.

28
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:09,090
And so a blog usually has posts in it that are defined by their date.

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,820
The categories and tags and they are usually listed in reverse chronological order on a blog or a blog

30
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,230
page on the website.

31
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:26,400
So that's the difference between posts and pages, and each of those is a post type in WordPress speak.

32
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,080
You can also create custom post types, which we'll talk about later in the course.

33
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,950
Like for something like projects or photographs, if your site is for a photographer or something like

34
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,410
that, you can create another post type that's different from blog posts and also different from pages

35
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,890
on the website that you can use for any purpose, like photographs or services for a service based business

36
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,370
website.

37
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:57,540
In any case, the next thing down is media, and it's called the media library because it has your images

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:57,980
in it.

39
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,520
Media is generally images.

40
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,000
You can also upload things like PDF files for download, but is generally where all of the images are

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,050
found in the website.

42
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:13,200
Of course, you can use the Add new button and you can click select files or you can drag an image in.

43
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,320
And we're going to be talking later in this lesson about the proper way to resize and compress images

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,190
for WordPress.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,700
But this is where you upload and manage the media inside of the WordPress in a general sense when you're

46
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,530
inside of a page or a post.

47
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:36,420
You can also just insert media or an image inside of that page and choose from the media library from

48
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,500
that editing screen.

49
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,630
So another thing you'll find in WordPress is under this appearance menu.

50
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,450
There are the themes a theme is defined in WordPress as the look and feel of the website.

51
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,810
There's thousands and thousands of themes available for WordPress.

52
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:58,230
We're going to use learn how to use a few different themes in the course, and when you click appearance

53
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,650
themes, you'll see that there is a list of available themes that are already installed in WordPress.

54
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:10,020
And if this weren't a sandbox site, you would also have an add new button up here at the top, where

55
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:17,100
you could browse the themes that are available freely in the WordPress repository and look for different

56
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,030
themes in that way.

57
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:24,270
I do recommend that you go for a popular and well used theme, especially the ones that I recommend

58
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,820
in the course because there are a lot of themes, and even though they are vetted for malware or anything

59
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,020
like that, you never know what you're going to get, whether they're supported by the developer on

60
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,760
an ongoing basis and being updated and what kind of code they're using.

61
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,480
And you know how good or how fast and performant that code is.

62
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,390
And so themes being the look and feel of the website kind of the opposite or the other side of that

63
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,980
coin are plug ins.

64
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,910
Now, plug ins determine some functionalities on a website, for example, in the sandbox.

65
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,900
Initially, you'll see there's a forms plug in and.

66
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,600
There's also a Maps plug in now, plug ins, again, if you weren't in the sandbox, you could click

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,670
Add New and you can browse plenty of free plug ins in the WordPress repository.

68
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:16,370
There's also a lot of paid and premium plug ins available in the ecosystem, and we'll be talking about

69
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,630
that later in the course too.

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,130
But just think of it this way.

71
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,610
Themes are for the look and feel of the website and control the design as far as colors, typography,

72
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,210
things like that.

73
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:35,330
And plug ins control some functionality on the website and things like forms, maps or really any kind

74
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,950
of functionality that you can think of.

75
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,990
There's probably a plug in for that.

76
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,950
And so that's some of the, you know, the terms, terminology within WordPress and jargon that you

77
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,550
might hear.

78
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:54,050
And as we go through the course under tools, you know, there's import and export and available tools.

79
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,750
You can you can have an importer that you can use.

80
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,100
And then, of course, delete site is there under the sandbox.

81
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,160
You won't have that in your single WordPress installation.

82
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:11,090
Import and export is really not a backup or a migration tool for a complete WordPress website.

83
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,000
It really is just for the content of the website.

84
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,160
So it's important to know if you import or export using the WordPress importer tool here.

85
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,300
You're just importing the posts, the pages and the media.

86
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:29,900
You're not importing or exporting the themes and the plug ins or any of the backend code that runs WordPress,

87
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,010
but it can be easy to move content between sites using those tools.

88
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,820
Under settings, you'll have some things like the name of the site and the tag line, the different

89
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:47,030
options for reading and writing, and will be going through some of these as we customize websites as

90
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,960
we go through.

91
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,990
And that's about it for what we'll look at in the sandbox next.

92
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,770
Let's just take a look actually at appearance themes and click editor right here.

93
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,850
Now I want to point out that in the sandbox, when you have the 2022 theme or another block based full

94
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:16,490
site editing theme enabled, this editor will come up as one of the options under appearance.

95
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:23,870
And now this brings you to an area which controls the site templates, which controls things like the

96
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,600
header and the footer and the navigation menu.

97
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,960
And this is what the big difference is that I spoke in a previous lesson about where a block based full

98
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,410
site editing theme gives you this site editor area and a classic theme doesn't give you this.

99
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,110
It gives you something called the customizer instead.

100
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:48,680
And so if you're in the dashboard here in in the sandbox can see that a under appearance themes, we've

101
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,700
got this editor.

102
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:56,450
We do also have the customize, but there's not much available under Customize, just the site identity,

103
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:02,150
which gives you the title and the tagline line, and also a site icon that you can choose to replace

104
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,610
this W up here in the tab.

105
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,440
And the way that the browser would display a logo for your site.

106
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,630
And then if you hit back here, that customizer also gives you the homepage settings.

107
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:23,550
Now, both of these settings are available under Settings Reading and Settings General.

108
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,410
And so that's just kind of a duplicate.

109
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:35,360
Now, when we look at a theme that is a classic theme and not a block based full say editing theme,

110
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,130
things will change a little bit.

111
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:44,780
So if we enable this 2021, the default WordPress theme that came before 2020 to if we just go ahead

112
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:50,480
and click Activate, some things will change in the main thing being over here on the left side under

113
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,140
appearance.

114
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:58,220
We now have customize and we have three more selections background being determined by this theme.

115
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:05,150
But the two main default sections here that are gone when you're doing a full set editing theme are

116
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,140
the widgets section and the menus section.

117
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:15,950
And so that's the biggest difference between a full site editing theme in WordPress moving forward and

118
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:21,680
the new way of working with WordPress and the classic way of working with WordPress themes where you

119
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,570
have the customizer, the widgets area, four footer areas and sidebars, as well as the menus area

120
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,030
where you control navigation menus here and you'll see the way both of these work as you go through

121
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,100
different lessons in the course now.

122
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,890
Lastly, lastly, if we open Customize now, we have a lot more selections.

123
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,340
The theme itself determines what items over here are available for customization.

124
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:59,150
And so when we work with, you know, more developed and extensive themes like cadence in the course,

125
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,930
you'll see that there's a.

126
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,840
A lot more features and selections over here.

127
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:09,140
This particular theme has a few things like colors and dark mode and background image, but some of

128
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:15,140
the things you'll see over here are again another place to work with the menus and the navigation.

129
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,680
And another place to work with widgets as well.

130
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:26,690
And so that gives you an idea of the differences between a full set editing theme and a classic type

131
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,980
of theme in WordPress.

132
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,590
And that's really all we need to define as far as the different jargon and terms that you'll need to

133
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,360
know before we move forward.

134
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:42,440
Learning WordPress itself moving over to another installation of WordPress that I have powered by a

135
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,880
local development environment called local that we'll learn about later in the course.

136
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:55,550
I have just a single WordPress installation here where, unlike the sandbox sites, I have under themes

137
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,420
and add new button as well as under plugins.

138
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:05,210
If I look at plugins, there are no plugins currently installed in this fresh WordPress installation,

139
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,190
but I have an add new button and I just wanted to show you under add new.

140
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:16,580
If you go to the right hand side and click Search, you can search the repository for the many thousands

141
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,380
of plugins that are available, but right on the welcome screen here there are two plugins I wanted

142
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:28,250
to point out that sometimes are necessary for enabling older themes in WordPress that don't use the

143
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:34,600
block editor or the new block based widgets editor inside of WordPress.

144
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:42,140
Yet now, themes that don't use the block based editor and the block based widgets editor are eventually

145
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,860
going to be going away and these plugins will become irrelevant.

146
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,740
But at this point, it's good to know that these two plugins exist, and they're made by the makers

147
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,990
and volunteers and contributors of WordPress.

148
00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:03,470
The first is the classic editor, so if you install the classic editor and then activate it, it allows

149
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:12,680
you to use the original editor, which we call the classic editor, also known as the tiny M.C editor

150
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,030
inside of WordPress instead of the new block based editor.

151
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,860
Some themes, if they're not using blocks, require the use of this classic editor.

152
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:27,800
So when working with old WordPress websites to make them work correctly, you may need to activate the

153
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,160
classic editor when you're using newer versions of WordPress.

154
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,820
The way it works here is under classic editor if you click Settings.

155
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,910
One thing you can do is you can choose the default and right here we're just under settings writing

156
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:46,430
here and you can see you can choose whether you use the Classic or block editor, and then you can allow

157
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,320
users to switch editors.

158
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,890
And if we click Yes, here and then save the changes that will enable me to show you the difference.

159
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:05,300
So if we look under pages, all pages and just look at the sample page that comes up pre-made with WordPress,

160
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,220
I'll be able to show you the difference.

161
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,630
And it'll tell you now whether it's using the Block editor or the classic editor.

162
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,450
There are there are two buttons here edit with the Block editor or edit with the Classic Editor, or

163
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,430
you can click the title just to edit it with the standard editor that it's already used with.

164
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,140
So we'll look at it with the Block editor to start with.

165
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,340
Of course, there's a welcome.

166
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:35,270
You can go through a few different tiles to read about the Block editor a little bit, and this is the

167
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:40,340
new modern way to work with WordPress, and it's preferred if the theme works with it, which most do

168
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,910
these days.

169
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,730
But the block editor you'll see works like this.

170
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,440
You click an area which is defined by, you know, an outline there.

171
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,560
This is a text block, a paragraph block, and then there's another kind of block right here if I click

172
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:54,830
down.

173
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,220
This is a quotation block or a quote block.

174
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,640
And then there are image blocks and all kinds of different blocks.

175
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:09,260
You can go and you can just click plus to take a look at what blocks are the different blocks here.

176
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,280
And these are the default blocks that come with WordPress.

177
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:22,340
And depending on the theme that you have activated, you can actually that theme can add many more blocks

178
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,940
available.

179
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,910
And I also wanted to mention block patterns because when you're working with the block editor, block

180
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:34,160
patterns are something that are going to be used more and more within block themes and classic themes

181
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,000
for that matter, where patterns are actually just sections of website content that are like pre-built

182
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,320
sample sections.

183
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:48,770
And we're going to be using some of these patterns that you see here in the 2022 theme as we go through

184
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,840
and build out a site using the newest theme with WordPress 20 22.

185
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,470
And so you see, there's some patterns here under the featured category.

186
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,630
There's also a series of.

187
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,680
Footers that you can use, you could see that there's all kinds of different, different block patterns

188
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,980
if you click Explore.

189
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:13,580
You can get a larger display of all of those different block patterns in their different categories.

190
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:20,930
Some of these looking familiar, this is the one that is being used on this standard homepage in 2022.

191
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,290
And there are full pages that are designed as block patterns.

192
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,300
These have been shipped with the 2022 theme, and they match the design.

193
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:35,210
And more and more block based themes are going to ship with patterns so that you can easily bring in

194
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:40,580
pre-designed template templating and different designs that have been made for you to give you a head

195
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,710
start on making custom websites.

196
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:52,940
But let's go back into the sample page here, and let's go back into the page all pages area and edit

197
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,830
this with the classic editor just to take a look at what it looks like when you're using the classic

198
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,440
editor and the tiny MSI plug in.

199
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,550
There's a little toolbar toggle here that opens up everything that's available.

200
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:10,340
This is the original way that we worked with WordPress pages and posts for years and years.

201
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,310
And so you may already be familiar with the way this looks.

202
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,550
Basically, the content is in one big area and then you can define different ways of working.

203
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,940
Similar to working with, you know, a document editor like Microsoft Word or, you know, something

204
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,390
like that.

205
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,810
And so that's just the classic editor.

206
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:37,010
The last thing I want to show you is, you know, under if I just go ahead and go under appearance themes

207
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:45,110
and because Twenty Twenty Two is a block based theme with full site editing, it doesn't have widgets

208
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,620
anymore.

209
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,110
And let's talk about the classic widgets plug in.

210
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,860
So if I enable either twenty twenty or twenty twenty one, these are two default themes with WordPress

211
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,800
that often come preinstalled, not necessarily activated, but pre-installed with WordPress when you

212
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,900
install a single site of your own.

213
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,180
Now that I have 2021 activated, you can see that I have widgets over here.

214
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:15,770
On the side, widgets are used for site wide areas like sidebar and footer areas.

215
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:25,370
This one in particular, this theme 2021 has a footer widget, and it's being used with the new block

216
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,900
based widget area.

217
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:33,170
Now, as we move forward in the WordPress ecosystem with block based full site editing themes, widgets

218
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,580
themselves are kind of going away because you don't really need them when you're working with the full

219
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,100
site editor, site editor feature.

220
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,650
But this is a block base.

221
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:49,190
You can see the blocks works similarly to the way that I showed you when the page was being edited.

222
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,210
Each of these blocks.

223
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,270
You know, this is like a it's a group.

224
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,760
I look at the list view and we'll explore this in the next few lessons in detail.

225
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,190
But this is a group that has some things in it.

226
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,340
It has a heading and it has a latest posts widget.

227
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:10,670
And so you can add different widgets in here by clicking the Plus and seeing what kinds of widgets you

228
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,300
might be able to add for the footer of the website in this case.

229
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:22,670
Now, in the case that your theme is older and doesn't use the block based widgets system, you can

230
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:29,150
yet, you guessed it, you can go to add new plugins and you can use the classic widgets plug in.

231
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:37,220
So if I click Install now and then activate under classic widgets plug in, now what happens when I

232
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,320
go to appearence widgets?

233
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,260
You'll get the original widgets area back.

234
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,980
And if you've worked with WordPress before, you're probably familiar with this area.

235
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:53,630
And so for this footer widget area, these are the blocks that were already present by default in the

236
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,390
2021 theme, but you can use any of these available widgets that have been available for a long time

237
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:05,060
in WordPress, like an image widget or a recent posts or something like that, and you just drag them

238
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,410
across and stick them in like that, and then they'll open up their settings panel.

239
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,260
Of course, you can also use the customizer, as I showed you a few minutes ago, to work with widgets

240
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,240
or navigation menus.

241
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:24,770
And so under widgets, if you have the classic widget plug in enabled, it'll show you that the widgets

242
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,080
are working in that kind of classic way.

243
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:32,930
So if you click Add a widget, it'll show you the original widgets interface instead of the new block

244
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,310
based widgets interface.

245
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:41,390
And so that's if you're new to WordPress potentially a little complicated, but will be working with

246
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,340
WordPress in all these different ways.

247
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,880
Moving forward as we go through the next few lessons.
