1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,820
In this lesson, we'll delve into the types of content containers in the DV visual builder, how they

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,840
nest together and how to use them in designing and editing the page content.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,540
You'll see how the editing window works, how to arrange it to your preference while seeing the page

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,910
content below, and look at the options for saving content types to the DV library.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,350
By the end of this video, you'll understand the content types in DV as far as sections, rows and modules,

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,690
and how to use the visual builder to control them.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,410
Let's look at the next section divvy design tools, and we have already covered some of this in the

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,950
previous couple of lessons the visual builder in the wireframe view what sections, rows and modules

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,160
are.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,060
But let's delve into the editing process for going in there, whether we're editing the content, the

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:57,240
design or the advanced editing within each one of those sections.

12
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:05,310
And so if we open up that same example site, the agency layout and we open the Enable Visual Builder

13
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,770
on any of the pages, I'm just going to look at the case study page here as the first example.

14
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:18,030
Now, as you roll the mouse over, as you saw, you've got some different types of content areas here

15
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,260
and there, all always nested within each other in the same way.

16
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:29,400
So blue means that a section and then within sections, you always put a row layout, even if there's

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,970
no changes or backgrounds or anything.

18
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,800
That's where you determine the columns.

19
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:41,190
And so this little column icon only exists within the green or teal row layout editor.

20
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,160
So if you open that little, you know, layout selector, it'll show you a whole bunch of different

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,560
column layouts that are available to you.

22
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,790
And so you can use a single column as often is used.

23
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,850
But then, of course, a 50 50 column, you know, thirty three percent all the way up to six columns

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,630
and then different combinations of widths and how they're arranged.

25
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,610
And so you'll see that that's quite useful, you know, in the future as you go.

26
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,410
So here we have the three, the three different types.

27
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,730
One thing I'll show you here is also without editing using the gear icon.

28
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,000
Of course, every time you press the gear icon, that opens up a little modal window.

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,160
And that's what we'll be exploring in this lesson.

30
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,940
But before we do that, you can see another graphic opening up some of the time as I roll over.

31
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,530
And that's when I get close to the top or bottom edge of a section.

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,580
Top or bottom edge of a section here shows the padding at the top and bottom.

33
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,780
And so this is a convenient way to control that.

34
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,580
This is set at 67 pixels and it may or may not be locked to the top and bottom.

35
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,670
So if I have the little up and down arrow, I can move that up or down.

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,800
It looks like it's unlocked in this case, and so down here it's staying at 67 something.

37
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,730
Now, if I go back up here, I can really just I can click the lock.

38
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,790
Now they're locked at 73 top and bottom, and all I have to do anywhere in here is move the mouse up

39
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:22,020
and down, and I can just customize that visually without having to decide, you know what amount that

40
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,890
I want in there.

41
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,780
And you know, that's true.

42
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,900
Row rollouts as well, rollouts can have.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,370
They usually come with this.

44
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,490
I think about 10, right?

45
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,310
Ten pixels.

46
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,150
Where is it?

47
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,490
Twenty, whatever it is, you know, it has that ability to do it.

48
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,100
And so let's click the gear icon.

49
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,630
And looking at this, once you get this model window above your content area, sometimes it covers up

50
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,130
what you want to edit, right?

51
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,480
And so you can move it around.

52
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,430
Maybe I want to move it over here and then edit that part of the page when I'm working over here and

53
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,310
take a look at my results.

54
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,160
But you can also use this little dock button.

55
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,360
This little icon right over here will dock the modal the editing window to one side or the other left

56
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,690
side.

57
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,920
And then you can even control the width of the editing window here, and then the entire website is

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,500
visible in the larger content area.

59
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,350
So I end up working kind of both ways.

60
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,760
Also, when this modal window is drag able, you can use this little corner piece to bring it to any

61
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,680
size you like to fit your working style.

62
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:45,360
And then you can either click the X or you can save it by clicking the green there, as well as let

63
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,150
me show you the these before or excuse me, redo, undo and redo buttons.

64
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,960
You can undo change a change that you made there, and you can redo a change that you made right there.

65
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,220
And then there's some settings.

66
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,850
Right here, this is kind of a right click menu and so on any of these, if you right click anywhere,

67
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,280
you'll get some settings that you can use.

68
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,830
And that's quite powerful there.

69
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:18,510
This icon right here just makes the editing window larger and brings it to almost full screen as large

70
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,530
as your browser with a little bit of border on the outside, so you can bring it back again.

71
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,190
That's if you're so you're in here and the content of this section.

72
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,830
Let me go close that and look at, say, a text section here.

73
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,380
This is a text module.

74
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,640
The title of the type of module is always at the top.

75
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:42,450
And as you go down and look at it, you know, sometimes there's not a lot of room, especially if you

76
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,520
have a lot of text inside of a text area here.

77
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,290
You might just bring it bigger to to give yourself more working room there.

78
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,840
And then finally, you don't actually have to open up the model to edit text.

79
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,020
Suppose I just wanted to edit this text I can actually.

80
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,370
You can see the cursor change into a text cursor.

81
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:12,420
Once I click there, you can see that I can actually begin editing the text, and it gives me some standard

82
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:18,210
text editing options up here, you know, like bold, italic, underline centered and things like that.

83
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:26,340
So oftentimes you'll come in and be like, Oh, this is text of the printing and type setting, you

84
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,900
know, change that word.

85
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:38,370
Process, anyway, if you type there, that change will persist and then to make that change, you know,

86
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:45,600
save to the page, you do have to save the entire page the same as if you were to go into here and go

87
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,670
ahead and change that back.

88
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,870
To industry now, you can see it reflected here.

89
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,360
And you do have to hit the green button to save it and then save your changes to the page.

90
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,490
And so that's a good overview of how the visual builder controls work.

91
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:10,470
Not the page controls down here that we saw in the last lesson, but the individual item controls here.

92
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,780
And then you'll see right down here, there's actually a new color, an orange color.

93
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:24,270
And that's the only other color that defines these different types of content editing areas within the

94
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,960
visual builder.

95
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,540
So like I said, blue is for a section.

96
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:35,780
You know, teal green is for a row and then gray is for the individual content modules.

97
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,020
So those are modules.

98
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,130
And of course, if you click any of the plus buttons, it'll add one of those.

99
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,840
The modules you might have seen in our content outline are very many.

100
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,460
You know, these are all the modules that are available to me right here.

101
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,500
You can also add modules from your library if you had saved any.

102
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:03,990
And so like I said before, if I go into an existing module and I just hit that down button, you know,

103
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,550
this might be called.

104
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,360
Sent Oops!

105
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:19,060
Center text centered text module, and if I save that to the library now, when I go over here to the

106
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,500
Divi Divi library, you'll see that it's saved here and here.

107
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,190
You should note under tape, it'll tell you what it is.

108
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,980
So this agency home was an entire page, which is called a layout.

109
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,700
And then the one I save just now is called a module.

110
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,640
So if I was in a page editing something and I wanted to come down here and I wanted to add some centered

111
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,020
text down here.

112
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:46,690
Of course, one thing I could do would be to duplicate this, and that would actually just duplicate

113
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,180
it, and I could edit the text and there's the trash.

114
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,590
That's one way to do it.

115
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:56,680
But what if I wanted to go down here and I know that, you know, I want to put a maybe I'll do it in

116
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:03,880
the same spot, put a new module here I could add from library, and it shows me all the modules that

117
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,420
exist within my DV library that I could place there.

118
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,640
Once I click it, it puts it in there.

119
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,830
And so that's easy enough.

120
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,280
As well as giving you a good idea.

121
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:21,010
Now the orange, let's go down to where there's a different type of layout here.

122
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,240
Here's here's where it is.

123
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,730
Orange means it's a special layout.

124
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:31,420
This section let's see if I were to go here to the blue, to the bottom of this upper section and click

125
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,860
Add a new section.

126
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:40,810
The orange refers to a specialty section, and all that really means is that you can now have columns

127
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,070
arranged in a little bit more complex of a layout if you need to.

128
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:53,320
And that means that you could have is a, you know, a single column section on the left and an additional

129
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,350
type of section on the right hand side.

130
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:03,250
And so what that gives you is, well, there's no row layout on the left, but on the right, I could

131
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,360
make a two or three column layout on the right there.

132
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,170
And so let me just get rid.

133
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,270
That's what the Orange actually labels.

134
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,050
And so if I delete that and we inspect this section right here.

135
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,780
So within this section, there's both a single column that has just one module in it.

136
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:30,310
And then over here there's a row and then below that row is another row.

137
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:37,720
And so that's where you can have a single column layout above and a dual column layout below.

138
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,820
And that's how they built this nice looking layout here that has the images.

139
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:49,750
If I exit the visual builder here on this case study page, you can see that that was the way they built

140
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:57,220
this nice gallery, where each of these images can open up in a light box and it has an X here, or

141
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:07,120
if you click away, it closes it back up and it animates that pick out into and out of the image gallery.

142
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,740
And so that's kind of a custom built gallery using a specialty section.
