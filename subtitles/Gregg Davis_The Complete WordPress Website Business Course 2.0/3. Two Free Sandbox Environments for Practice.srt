1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,970
I've created two special versions of WordPress for you to create your own practice and experimentation

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,060
sites that I call WordPress Sandbox Environments.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,830
Both of these are free for you to use for one year and for students and new users.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,940
I created an expiring trial account of one full year on them, so I have a way of deleting old, unused

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,070
sites that students create over time.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,150
The first sandbox at leverage WP Sandbox XCOM is designed for you to try out the default WordPress themes

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,220
and experiment with the most recent versions of WordPress and the other at leverage divvy.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,610
Dotcom is for learning the paid theme and page builder tool called Divvy without the Divvy Sandbox Environment.

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,170
You would have to pay for your own license to use the DV theme and builder for WordPress.

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,630
And this allows you to freely experiment and try it out as one of the possible methods of building custom

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,230
websites.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,470
It's important to note that the sandbox environments are built on a type of WordPress called multi-site

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,240
that allows more than one website to be built within a single WordPress installation.

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,360
Multi-Site is a controlled environment that doesn't allow for site owners to install just any plugins

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,930
and themes.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,910
Only the ones that the multi-site administrator that's me has pre-installed.

17
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,870
So just so you know, the curated WordPress.com version that I referred to in the last lesson is an

18
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,660
example of a multi-site installation of WordPress in the next several sections of the course.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,330
We'll be learning WordPress by creating sites in the two sandbox environments at Leverage, WP Sandbox,

20
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,850
XCOM and Leverage Diwekar.

21
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,590
Each of those allows you to create up to 10 sites for practice and experimentation.

22
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,760
Let's get to it.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,400
Signing up for a free sandbox account is easy enough.

24
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,020
Just go to leverage WP Sandbox Dotcom and you'll see a register link up at the top right.

25
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,430
If you already have your sandbox account, you can click Login at the top right as well.

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:03,270
But once you click register, you can go ahead and choose a site title and then a URL for your site.

27
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,090
Your first site will be whatever name you choose.

28
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:13,980
Dot leverages WP Sandbox dot com and has to have at least four characters no spaces or dots or anything

29
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,490
like that.

30
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,350
But just choose a site.

31
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,550
Just choose a name for the site.

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,770
That's just the WordPress site title, and I'm just going to put Greg to.

33
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:34,400
Leverage any name you like is fine, and you'll be able to create nine more sites as well to keep practicing

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,540
with WordPress if you like.

35
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,580
Then you just click Continue to the next step, and that's where you'll choose a username for your sign

36
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,300
and credentials.

37
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,780
Put your email and then choose a password and type it once again.

38
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,250
I'll pass the video while I do that.

39
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:55,600
Now, just click Create Account, and it will come up with a logged in welcome screen.

40
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,580
Well, logged into my new site.

41
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,630
So at this point, I've got a welcome to a WordPress screen.

42
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,070
I can dismiss that.

43
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,480
And of course, you can control how your screen looks up here with the screen options.

44
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,600
That's the welcome screen that I just dismissed right there and then a little bit different from a normal

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,770
web WordPress site.

46
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,110
You'll see that you have an account menu item over here on the left, and then that's the same as this

47
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,800
button here.

48
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,270
Account summary And it gives you a few stats about your account in the sandbox.

49
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:33,070
You get 365 days to use it for free, and if you click account summary, it'll tell you how many sites

50
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,330
you have and what they are.

51
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,930
Down here at the bottom left and so you can use the Add new site button here and these buttons to either

52
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,560
visit the dashboard or visit the site on each one of your sites.

53
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:52,690
If you go up to my sites and then you'll see this master site leverage WP Sandbox, there's nothing

54
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,080
really here except a user account for the entire network.

55
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,060
But if you go to the site, you create it and click Visit Site.

56
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,280
I'll click Right Click and then click Open in a new tab.

57
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,800
Then you'll see that it's just a default 2022 theme powered website.

58
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:16,630
There's just a single post home page and a sample page there, and you can go on in later lessons of

59
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,960
the course and begin customizing that site for yourself.

60
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,070
That's all there is to it.

61
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,930
You'll see that it's the same process with the device sandbox.

62
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,380
Just go to leverage divvy dot com and you'll see on the Welcome Home page.

63
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,330
Here there's a sign up button, and there's also a register button up here at the top right.

64
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,920
If you already do have your sandbox account, you can go ahead and use the login button here at the

65
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,840
top or log in right here.

66
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,750
So if you click sign up, you'll see that there's a register page that looks very similar to the leverage

67
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:52,810
WP Sandbox dot com signup page with a logo here and you go through the same steps.

68
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,170
This time, when you get your new site set up at Leverage Divvy Accom you have the same welcome screen

69
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:07,250
and you do have the original 20 22 default theme enabled, so there's one more step you need to do.

70
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,100
Just go to appearence themes and go ahead and choose Divvy and click Activate.

71
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,120
Now your site will be a just a default installation of Deivi.

72
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,860
If you open it in a new tab, you'll just see it looks like a pretty plain blank site with a single

73
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,010
post, a standard divvy menu at the top and a standard footer, which we're going to be customizing

74
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,620
in detail in the two divvy lessons.

75
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,950
Coming up, we're going to be customizing this standard divvy layout and bringing in some free designed

76
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,830
layouts from the extensive Devi library.

77
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:51,140
We'll make a site that looks like the original site at DV at leverage DV dot com.

78
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,920
If you click Visit Site at Leverage DV dot com, you can take a look at what this nice looking site

79
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,640
looks like, and we're going to learn all the features about how to go ahead and build a site just like

80
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:11,120
this and learn Devi by matching the design and bringing some pre-designed layouts into your own site.
