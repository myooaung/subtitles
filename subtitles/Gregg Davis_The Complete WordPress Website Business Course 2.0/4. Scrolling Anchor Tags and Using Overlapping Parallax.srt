1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,620
In this lesson will assign a custom CSI ID to a section and use that as a navigation tag attached to

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,040
a button.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,780
You'll learn how TV allows for custom CSI IDs in the advanced tab of a module, and also how using overlapping

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,660
images can create a unique scrolling visual effect.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,930
By the end of this video, you'll understand how DV provides the tools for both intuitive user experience

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,920
and beautiful design using transparent images and parallax.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,330
Let's do a couple more customizations to this layout pack dealing with just a couple of really neat

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,160
effects that happen in this travel agency layout pack from DV.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:49,710
First of all, we've done this using different theme in the past, but looking at the Learn More button,

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,190
if we look at the link for that, where could that go with that?

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,860
Go to the about page or something.

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,220
What if we made on this home page that learn more button?

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,660
Just go ahead and scroll down past the image gallery and end up down here at this section right here?

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,830
Could you figure out how to do that yourself using anchor tags?

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,030
That's something that would be a nice challenge for you to try out right now.

16
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,860
And if you'd like, pause the video and see if you can figure out how to make this, learn more button.

17
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,810
Scroll the user down to this Discover Unlimited beauty section.

18
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,950
How'd that go?

19
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,490
Well, let me show you how I might go about it, so we're on the home page here.

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,540
And of course, I've showed you before with the Disney Visual Builder.

21
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:45,510
Instead of going back to the WordPress dashboard, I'll often just edit sections of the content at looking

22
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,810
at the main website and using this Enable Visual Builder button.

23
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:56,970
And so I've just clicked Enable Visual Builder, and as you can see, I've got my control controls down

24
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,320
here.

25
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:04,740
The first thing I'll do is just label this section, so I'll go ahead and click the gear icon.

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:11,520
And then under advanced and under CC ID and classes, we want to add a CSI ID.

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:20,550
And so, you know, I'm just going to call it LearnDash more just so that it's easy to remember and

28
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,930
click save on that.

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,770
And then as we go up here, there's a module right here and this is where the button is.

30
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,470
And so here's an example of where we have an overlapping header that's transparent.

31
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:41,590
And because of it, I can't really get to this module editing editing bar.

32
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,030
You could see that gray bar right up there that I'm trying to get to now.

33
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,980
Every time I try to pull the mouse up to that gear icon, I can't click it.

34
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:56,160
And so it's preventing me from clicking into editing this module where I want to add that little piece

35
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,190
of learn more CSC so that this button will scroll the user down down to here.

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,770
So if you remember, you could use two different things to get to that module.

37
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,270
Let's show you both here at the bottom and on the page editing area.

38
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,790
The first thing what I will usually do is I know that this is at the very top.

39
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,160
It should be easy to find.

40
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,270
So I'll just go to the wireframe view here.

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,290
And when I click the Wireframe View now, I've got a representation of all the nested sections, rows

42
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,980
and modules so that I can find what I need to.

43
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,590
So at the very top, of course, I have the hero section.

44
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,430
It's a gray module so I can click this gear icon now.

45
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,200
Don't forget, the second way to do it would be to look at the layers view right here, and that can

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,890
open up.

47
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,760
And while you're actually looking at the, you know, desktop view here, you could look at this layers

48
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,080
panel and open up the Hero Section module right here.

49
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,610
And so either way, works.

50
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,080
I'll often go to the wire frame and then click the gear icon here.

51
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,040
Opening it up and what I want to do is find that button.

52
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,710
So the button number one is right here, and as I scroll down, I can go to link.

53
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,010
And because this is a full width header, it gives me different areas to put items.

54
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:24,570
So as far as text, there's a title, a subtitle, a button one and a button two and a body text area.

55
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:31,440
And then as far as images, there aren't any images in this full width header, but the images would

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,650
be images that sit on top of the background image.

57
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:41,040
Because if I look at content here and look at the background, there's there's a background color that

58
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,120
is transparent.

59
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:49,230
And then there's a background image here, and that's the image that that I that this looks like.

60
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,560
And, you know, while we're here, we might as well brighten that up.

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,710
I really can't see that beautiful mountain scene and you could see what it looks like right here.

62
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,320
So how do we brighten up that image?

63
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,520
Well, we could go to overlay and look at the background overlay color, and you could see that's a

64
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,830
point eight six of transparency.

65
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:13,650
But if we just bring this transparency slider back down, we can maybe brighten that up just enough

66
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,590
so that it's a little more visible.

67
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,970
But the white lettering is still visible.

68
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,110
Maybe point five?

69
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,490
That looks great.

70
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,170
OK, so back to content.

71
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,710
We just go to the text in this for with header module and then button.

72
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,910
No one says Learn more down here under link.

73
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,700
We could say button number one, link URL and what we would do is use the hashtag or no sign button

74
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,740
to indicate that this is a seaside.

75
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,680
And then we would type in the ID that we chose for that section.

76
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,400
Below it was LearnDash more so click the save button here and then over here, if you find that it has

77
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,510
an exit at one point, that just means that it is doing an auto save.

78
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,950
The DV visual builder doesn't auto save once every few seconds, it seems like, maybe even once every

79
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,640
10 seconds.

80
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:11,100
And so you just have to wait for that to complete until you have a save visible and then you can go

81
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,260
ahead and save it and you'll see the progress icon and then the checkmark showing you that you've saved

82
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,670
your changes right there.

83
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,340
So now if we exit the visual builder, it brings us right back to the live web site and we can click

84
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,210
Learn more.

85
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,590
You could see the URL down here at the bottom left in.

86
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:35,010
From when you roll over a button or link, it says the URL and then slash no sign.

87
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,550
Learn more.

88
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:41,280
When I click that, it scrolls down smoothly to the next section that I had to find.

89
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,870
So that's awesome.

90
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,980
That's a really nice way to have a button from a header image or a full width header or a heroes section

91
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,450
at the top of a page.

92
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,880
Scroll down to a section.

93
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:00,450
And so it's easy to do in Divij because of those advanced CSX access sections that you have there in

94
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,380
the module editor.

95
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,020
And so next, let's take a look at some of these interesting images.

96
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:17,100
There's two places here in the travel agency layout pack that have some interesting parallax overlapping

97
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,550
images.

98
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,960
Can you see how the front image with the people is overlapping the background?

99
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,670
And as I slide the scroll bar up and down, you can see it makes it into kind of a 3D action called

100
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,450
parallax.

101
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,050
And that's something that's included in the divvy design elements.

102
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,690
And it's also visible on the about page.

103
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:43,590
If we look at the about page in the hero image here, you could see that guy standing on the hill is

104
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,460
sliding up and over the background parallax.

105
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,920
And that effect is really interesting.

106
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,750
It's a nice visual effect, if not overused.

107
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,690
It's a really nice look.

108
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,290
So let's see how they did that.

109
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:06,630
And at the after we do that to on the home page and several of the pages, well, that has let's see,

110
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:14,040
I didn't click on here that shows at the bottom of the page with a call to action button, as well as

111
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,310
the page ending with this parallax finish.

112
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,630
Now we can get rid of this footer with these widgets.

113
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:29,580
Anyway, this is the old style footer and the footer bar by placing this section as a global footer

114
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,740
on the entire website.

115
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:38,790
And so let's go ahead and take a look at this layout first and then place this area as a global footer

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,020
in the theme builder.

117
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,700
And so what we'll do first is just take a look at the visual builder on the home page here.

118
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:53,340
And I just scroll down to the bottom and take a look at what is going on here, so here's what I have.

119
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's see you can as we roll the mouse over.

120
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:02,840
Yeah, I've got a section that goes to the bottom here, and there's also a row that goes to the bottom

121
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,060
here, and it looks like a single column row.

122
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:12,470
If I click the columns chooser, you can see that it's a single column here and let's just see what

123
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,210
we have for background images.

124
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:21,020
So in the section, first of all, which, as you know, is behind the row, the section background

125
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:27,110
has a doesn't have a color, but it does have a an image.

126
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,150
And that image is just a blurred background image.

127
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,660
And it says use parallel parallax effect.

128
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,140
Yes.

129
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,120
And what type of parallax effect a true parallax or a CC parallax?

130
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,590
The difference is a true parallax actually moves.

131
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:56,450
It moves up and down slower than the content that is in front of it, and a CC parallax is a just completely

132
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,010
fixed background.

133
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,050
And so they work differently.

134
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:08,180
You can experiment and see what kind of a parallax you would want to use and what works for what you're

135
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,610
trying to do as far as the two different things.

136
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,820
If you use no parallax, then you can still have a sliding image.

137
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,810
If this front image had parallax and it would slide over the next one.

138
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,390
You see, now that these are lined up with each other and there is no parallax effect, it just looks

139
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,710
like a single image.

140
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,590
That's because both of them have no parallax.

141
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,920
And so I'll just put it back to what it was true parallax.

142
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,150
And then let's look at what the section.

143
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,290
Excuse me what the row looks like as far as the background.

144
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:49,850
Now on this background, it looks like we again don't have a color, but we do have a gradient and it's

145
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,800
a very faint gradient.

146
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:59,870
You can see there's just kind of echoes from white down to transparent, and you could see that it just

147
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:05,060
it's very faint, but you can see it's happening right at the top of this representation square right

148
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,360
here.

149
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,960
So the direction is 180 degrees that's up and down and the end position, it starts zero percent at

150
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,910
the very top and it ends at twenty two percent, not very far down the page or down the image itself.

151
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:23,240
And so basically, that's blending this image into the white background of the section above.

152
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,640
And so by looking, I could see that the background image is not present here.

153
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,380
Well, where's the background image?

154
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,540
It's in the column, I'll bet.

155
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,580
And so that column, as a part of this row has a background image.

156
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,050
No, no, it doesn't.

157
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,300
Now where's that background image?

158
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,940
I know where it is.

159
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,230
It must be in the module and not actually in the row.

160
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,270
And so inside this single column is an image module.

161
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,130
So let's close the row layout and let's look at this module.

162
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,880
Now here it is.

163
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,260
Here's the module, which is an image module.

164
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,110
There's that image, right?

165
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,070
It's just an image module that most likely does not.

166
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,950
It doesn't have a background, so it doesn't have a parallax or anything going on with it.

167
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,400
All it isn't is an image.

168
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,400
But you can see that the background is showing through.

169
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,410
Now this takes a little bit of graphic design, and you might just take a look in the media library

170
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,700
at this image.

171
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:34,280
And actually let me just close out of that and go to the WordPress dashboard and look in the media library.

172
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,140
Let's find that image.

173
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:36,740
Here it is.

174
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,900
Right here and now is shown just like in Photoshop and other design programs.

175
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,620
The gray and white checkerboard pattern denotes a transparency.

176
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,160
And so this is a PMG file, a transparent image.

177
00:12:52,370 --> 00:13:00,380
And so using Photoshop, we're using --, which is a free Photoshop type program, or Canva is a great,

178
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,110
free program that does this type of thing easily.

179
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:11,210
You can erase the background and then use a file type that supports transparency, which PMG is one

180
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,390
of.

181
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,320
So dot PNG.

182
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:18,860
It's not a JPEG like this would be, but you convert this to a transparent PNG file using Photoshop

183
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:25,160
or Canva, and then you can use this to let the background show through.

184
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:33,560
And while that background was a parallax image, that's what gives us that interesting effect.

185
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:40,020
And so you just use these two images on top of each other, and we've got this interesting effect.

186
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,700
So let's do two more things.

187
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,300
Let's remove this widget area.

188
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,370
And actually, we don't really even have to do anything when we take this section here.

189
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,380
This there's actually this bottom section, including these different modules.

190
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,440
There's a text module, there's a button module, and then there's the image module showing those are

191
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,360
all contained within the row, which is contained within this section right here.

192
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:12,470
And so like we did in the last chapter, DV Part one, let's go ahead and save this whole section into

193
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,230
the div library so we can use it elsewhere.

194
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:15,920
OK.

195
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:23,300
And so once we use this in the theme builder as a global footer that will just replace the digitized

196
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,140
footer that's present right now in that grey bar and the bottom bar as well.

197
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:36,170
So I'm going to say this is the footer, I'm just going to call it, let's just call it parallax footer

198
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,150
and you can call it anything you want.

199
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,030
You can even have a space in the layout name that's just for your reference.

200
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:47,960
And then I'm not going to click make this a global item because we're going to control that within the

201
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,580
theme builder itself, whether it's globally controlled or not.

202
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,710
And so let's just click Save to library, and that finishes that part.

203
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,720
We can exit the visual builder here.

204
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,270
Sure, I can save and exit just in case I had made any changes, but I didn't, so I could have said

205
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,100
this card on that one.

206
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,720
And now what we'll do is bring that layout.

207
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:19,760
That was a section that we exported into the DV library and place it in the theme builder.
