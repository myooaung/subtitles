00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:07.020
In this lesson, I'll show you how to use the provided FTP credentials at managed and self-managed hosts

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.850
like flywheel and grid pain.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.470
You'll also learn how to download and set up to free FTP programs, files, zila and FTP client light.

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.140
By the end of this video, you'll know how to access files on the server when your host doesn't provide

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.820
an included file manager.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.210
Let's talk about how to access the files on a host that doesn't have an integrated file manager, and

7
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.870
you'll be forced to use an FTP or secure FTP program on your computer to access those files.

8
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.420
I'll show you how to set that up and how to access the credentials that your hosting company so that

9
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.600
you can access the files easily at your hosting server.

10
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.530
And once it's set up, it's easy to turn on signing sign in and then download or upload files if you

11
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.040
need to.

12
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.070
And so here you see me logged in to my flywheels hosting account flywheels, an example of a managed

13
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.030
WordPress host that doesn't offer an integrated file manager, even though you've seen they offer an

14
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.630
integrated database manager under each of your sites.

15
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.700
Now, in Flywheel, in order to get your FTP credentials, it's not under the site itself.

16
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.170
You won't find the FTP credentials under the site dashboard, but under your account dashboard up here

17
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.830
at the top.

18
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.900
So a click account right here.

19
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.210
And then that brings up on my account page.

20
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.990
The FTP access that just stands for secure FTP, which means that the data is encrypted going back and

21
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.440
forth.

22
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.350
And so here are the credentials.

23
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:50.130
There's a SFP dot, you know, address telling me what port to use and gives me a username, and it's

24
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.620
telling me to use my flywheel password.

25
00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.750
OK, so if I open my FTP program, the one I generally use on my Windows computer is file zila, and

26
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.510
I'm going to show you how to download that without getting any of the extra advertising or bundled software

27
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.160
that sometimes inadvertently comes with it when people download files zilla.

28
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.100
It's not got any malware or anything like that.

29
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.980
File Zila is an open source, free FTP program for my Mac.

30
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.760
I tend to use one called FTP Client Lite, which is an extension for the Chrome browser.

31
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.700
It's called SFP Client free to use, and you can click Add to Chrome from the website there.

32
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:43.270
But if I go back to the flywheel site right here and I will open up my File Zilla program, file zilla

33
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.820
and all FTP programs generally give you a window a side on the left where you can navigate to your computer

34
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.830
and on the right, depending on how you have it set up, where you're navigating to the server, and

35
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:03.180
then you can drag your items over or to upload, and you can drag them back to download to and from

36
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.900
the server.

37
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.550
And so I'm going to go here up to where I have my site's management area, and I'll just click new site

38
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.420
and I'll choose the credentials that flywheels given me.

39
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.330
So I'll pause the video and put those in now.

40
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:27.460
So what I've done is I changed the protocol from FTP to SS FTP so that it is secure.

41
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.690
I pasted the hostname here and put Port 22 in.

42
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.520
I put my username and my password for my flywheel account, and now I'll click Connect.

43
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.090
So it gives me a message up here and tells me what's going on.

44
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.900
It looks like I'm connected, so here's where the files are located.

45
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.710
This is just I can navigate to folders if I want to.

46
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.870
And then this is the one site.

47
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.490
If you had more than one site at your flywheel account, they would all be listed here with different

48
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.000
folders.

49
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.860
And so I can double click this folder, which is called G.E.D. Flywheel.

50
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.520
And now I'm navigating to the actual files on the Flywheel server for that website.

51
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.270
And so it looks like I have the WP content folder.

52
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.190
There's a flywheel config.

53
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.380
You can see that there's a little bit of a different structure here with Flywheel.

54
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:23.830
The one the really hidden the rest of the WordPress files in a different place.

55
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:33.340
So Flywheel Config contains some plugins that Flywheel uses to customize your managed WordPress hosting

56
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.850
area.

57
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.930
And so back under flywheel, I do have access to the WP content folder, which is where all my content

58
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.730
and files like the media library and importantly, plugins and themes are located.

59
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.030
And so if I needed to deactivate a plugin, I could just go under plug ins and rename it like we did

60
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.870
in local.

61
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.740
Now, in this fresh WordPress installation, I don't have any plug ins up.

62
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.690
Let's see if I have any themes.

63
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:07.570
Now I have the three themes in 2020 to 2021 and 2020, and so that's how I set up the FTP access.

64
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.840
If I needed to, I could drag any file or folder from here over to my computer or vice versa, from

65
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.860
my computer over to the right hand side and upload it into the server itself.

66
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.370
One of the things to note is that in flywheel, because it's a managed WordPress host, they take control

67
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.600
of the WP config file and you actually have to ask their permission if you want to add or remove anything

68
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.000
from the config file right here.

69
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.430
You can download a copy of it and take a look at it, but if you upload it, it won't actually take

70
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.910
effect.

71
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:49.600
And that's something they do to protect your websites and your website files from any kind of mistakes

72
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.210
that you might make, and they just take control of it.

73
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.870
It's one of the effects of the managed WordPress space.

74
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.320
Now let's take a look at grid pain.

75
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:07.780
I'm at my grid pain site here, and it works just a little bit differently if I wanted to log in to

76
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.340
a grid pain website.

77
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.230
I don't get access in one FTP account for all of my grid pain sites.

78
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.410
I actually have to go in and find the system user that gets created when I create a new site.

79
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:29.770
So if I go under sites just to show you if I was starting to select, you know, a new site, it opens

80
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.440
up this area where it's telling me what I want to do as a with a system user.

81
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.770
And it's a best practice to create a new system user every time you create a new site with grid pain.

82
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:49.870
And what that means is that each system user in each site is separately accessed and so you can actually

83
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.450
separate your client sites all separately from one another, even if they're on the same server.

84
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.320
And you need a different FTP account for each site on that server.

85
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:07.560
And so to find my credentials for an existing site in grid pain, I could go to sites and say I wanted

86
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.820
to, you know, look up one of my sites under the leveraged WP brand.

87
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:19.030
If I want to go to leverage DV, for example, that site exists at this IP address.

88
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.180
And so basically for file zilla, I would set up, let's see if I just hit the button.

89
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:31.150
I'll disconnect from Flywheel here, and I'll open up this accounts site manager again.

90
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.360
And let's look at Leverage Divvy.

91
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.960
This is the existing site that I've set up, and so it already has the credentials.

92
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.850
I change it to FTP.

93
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.940
I put that IP address that I just showed you right here.

94
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.720
That's the IP address for my own dedicated server.

95
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.060
Put that into my file zilla.

96
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.760
It'll do the port automatically, but I could choose Port 22 if I want to.

97
00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:00.220
Then I have to find the user and the password that was auto created for that site.

98
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.320
And so here in grid pain, that's not located here under the site itself.

99
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.220
But if I look under leveraged TV, I can see that the user name is here.

100
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.640
It's the user two oh, nine four six.

101
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.170
Let's look here and file zilla.

102
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.980
There's my user leverage div two oh nine four six.

103
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.930
And to find the password, it's.

104
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.650
Quite easy.

105
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:27.550
I just go into grid pain and I go under system users, and then I can see all of my system users down

106
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:35.260
here so I could go ahead and look for leverage and I could find the leverage device system user that

107
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.410
I need the leverage div two oh, nine four six.

108
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.080
Now it's the one on the array of dedicated server, not at this one.

109
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.860
This is an old system user that I was using before when I was having this site installed on a different

110
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.960
server, so I need to choose the correct one.

111
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:57.100
And then I would just use this little AI and it comes up with my details about that system user.

112
00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.720
This is part of the password.

113
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.090
I'm not going to reveal it here, but I could scroll this scroll wheel over and copy that password and

114
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.580
then paste it into file zilla here.

115
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:13.270
And then when I connect, that connects to the sites and you can see it's a little different structure.

116
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.040
Then Flywheel was using.

117
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:21.850
But under sites, I just have access to one site per system user, as is a best practice and I can go

118
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:22.840
to leverage DV.

119
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.190
And now I have some proprietary grid pain things.

120
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:35.110
But I also have the HDD docks and that is where I have all of the WordPress files, including the WP

121
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.220
config file.

122
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:43.120
That is actually it's one level higher here in great pain, but I do have access to it if I click.

123
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:50.080
This can see the WP config is right here and in fact, over here I am accessing the leverage.

124
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.670
Oh, this is for leverage WordPress.

125
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:57.490
But I have edited the WP config file for certain things I've needed to do, and you can easily edit

126
00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.510
it and use that using FTP when you're using grid paint, unlike Flywheel.

127
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:08.680
But then Docs has the rest of the of the files and the folders, including WP content.

128
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:14.770
So under WP content, here is the plugins folder and there's a list of plugins here.

129
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:22.540
If I needed to turn any of them off, I could just simply click and rename one of those to regain access

130
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.990
to the website if it was a plugin conflict or something like that.

131
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:32.530
Let me show you how to download files zila without any of the bundled software, as well as to how to

132
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:37.750
find and install the FTP client software for the Chrome browser.

133
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.180
Either work for Windows or for Mac, and I'm just familiar with File Zila.

134
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.510
It's always been free and a great FTP program.

135
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:52.930
However, it is supported by a little bit of advertising and bundled software, so I'll show you specifically

136
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:56.710
how to get file zila all by itself without any bundled software.

137
00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:03.730
And so if you're on the file zilla home page, when you click Download File Zila Client, that's the

138
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.740
one we're looking for.

139
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:10.900
We're looking for the FTP client, which, like an email client, is just an FTP program, like an email

140
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:16.060
program, you know, like Outlook or Mac Mail or Thunderbird, something like that.

141
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.470
So download the server is not what you want.

142
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.770
That's if you're going to make files available for others on your own computer.

143
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:30.010
And so the client is what you want, but you want to look at the different platforms and download the

144
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.420
right one for your platform.

145
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.080
You can also get to this next page by File Zilla.

146
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.410
Download this download button at the top left here.

147
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.020
But if you click either one of those, you'll be brought to this page where it detects the computer

148
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.020
you're on and it gives you the appropriate kind.

149
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:54.010
And so it's important to look that you want Windows 64 bit if you're me, but whatever you have here,

150
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.020
that'll be the one that you want to download.

151
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:02.290
But now here's the important part Instead of clicking the green button that says below, this installer

152
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:07.560
may include bundled offers, you can check below for more options.

153
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:14.770
I would suggest that you check below for additional download options here and choose the one that it

154
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:15.970
chose for you up here.

155
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.820
And so I'm looking for Windows 64 bit.

156
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:26.670
When I click that, it gives me all the plain vanilla file zilla versions with no bundled software.

157
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:32.460
And so there's all these different versions, and so I would click this one right here.

158
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:39.540
Files Zilla win 64 setup dot ICSI and then go through the process of clicking the buttons to install

159
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:44.610
the program, you know, and approving that you're installing a program from a trusted source.

160
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.900
Just make sure you're on the File Zilla Dash Project dot org.

161
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.380
That's the correct website if you search Google for files.

162
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.080
This is the first couple of things that'll come up.

163
00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:01.380
Just make sure you're downloading it from this trusted source and that you go in and don't get the bundled

164
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.740
software, but go in and get this whatever version you want.

165
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:11.040
Dot ICSI and it'll begin installing right away and then you can go ahead and set up and use it.

166
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.120
Very easy to use.

167
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.860
Now, as far as the FTP client, this is the Lite version.

168
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:24.090
The free version it is an extension for Chrome, although it opens as a separate program when I use

169
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.210
it on my Mac.

170
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.430
It's just easy to use.

171
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:31.380
I open Chrome and I can find FTP right here in my toolbar or over here.

172
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:38.820
If you can't find it there under more tools or under extensions, you can find it there.

173
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.110
Now, do I have it installed here?

174
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:41.790
I do.

175
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:48.510
As FTP Client Light, it shows as installed as a Chrome app, and it is a great program that can be

176
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:48.900
trusted.

177
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.400
You just click Add to Chrome and it'll install it as if it's a program on your computer.

178
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.120
Leveraging the power of Chrome and the Chrome browser.

179
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.400
And so that gives you an idea of where to get to free FTP programs.

180
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.360
There's also one called Cyber Duck.

181
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.830
There's a number of different free FTP programs available out there.

182
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:13.590
If you like, just use the one that you're most comfortable with, and if you already have one, just

183
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.820
keep using that one.
