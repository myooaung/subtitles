1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,730
In this lesson, we'll export the database manually and import it into a new WordPress site using the

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,750
database manager.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,720
You'll learn how to perform a manual site migration from any host to another using only the database

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,070
export file and the WP content folder from the existing site.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,220
You also see how it's necessary to modify the URLs in the database after a migration to make the site

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,480
work at the new address.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,580
By the end of this video, you'll understand how migrations work in the background and be able to do

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,690
it yourself manually.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:39,540
So I'm still going to take a site from local and migrated into another environment, still on local,

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,260
on my computer.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,870
But let's add one level of complexity here.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,970
Instead of just doing the automatic, you know, export import from local to local.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,120
Let's act like this could be a different place.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,490
Doesn't even have to be local.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,570
What we're going to do is a manual site migration from one environment into an existing site that is

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,540
happens to be in the same environment.

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,200
And so we're going to import this Kadence site and migrate the cadence site that you saw before.

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,290
And let's look at it again.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,330
It's just the real estate starter template using the cadence, theme and cadence plug ins.

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,060
And I also have a site created in local.

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,180
That's just a, you know, I just called it migration site original.

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,990
It's just a sample site.

23
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,200
That is a default site using the 2022 theme.

24
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,170
All I did was in local.

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:38,270
I created a site in local using the plus button here, called it migration site original and know,

26
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:44,340
gave it a name and my login credentials, and I clicked open site here and this is what I've got.

27
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,850
It's just a regular WordPress website and it's basically empty, except for the default.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,400
You know, the default sample page.

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,890
It's got a default blog post and it has, you know, a user account.

30
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,000
And that's basically it.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
It doesn't have any plug ins.

32
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,420
It just has a few default themes.

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,700
So it doesn't have cadence in it or anything like that.

34
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,680
It's just an empty WordPress site.

35
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:15,600
And so let's do a manual migration to illustrate what it takes to take and you know, the bare minimum

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,310
that you need from the original site and bring it into a new site.

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,710
And in that way, manually migrate the site to a different environment.

38
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,810
And so this will work in any environment, whether you're using local on your computer or whether you're

39
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:37,830
migrating from a live host over to another live host or from local to a live host.

40
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,310
Basically, you just need to access the files for the original website.

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,990
And so if I look at cadence, you know, the one thing I did was I went like this.

42
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,990
I right clicked and exported a file that contained the whole site, including the database, right?

43
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,500
Well, I can also just go and find that in local if I wanted to.

44
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,170
But let's go to this folder where I saved that zip file and then I unzipped it.

45
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,590
You know that that contained, like I said in the last lesson it contained under app and public, the

46
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:17,760
WP content folder, which is the minimum that you need for migrating a WordPress website because all

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,020
the rest, the other two folders and all the files are really going to be unchanged from one WordPress

48
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,890
site to another.

49
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:33,690
And so you just need to get the WP content folder and you need to get the Dot SQL file, the local SQL

50
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,500
in this case.

51
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:42,030
And so if we, you know, like I said, I could find that in my desktop slash cadence folder, another

52
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:49,830
way to export a copy of the database in a single file format is to navigate using the database navigator.

53
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,950
Now I've just created a new site called 20 22, just a default installation using local.

54
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,440
And when I set that up, let's look at my file explorer under my local sites.

55
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:10,100
If we look under 20 22 under the app, the Dot is the sequel folders not there right now.

56
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,140
All that we have is the WordPress files and we don't have the SQL folder.

57
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,470
And so I just want to show you a different way that you can get a sequel file of the whole database,

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,710
no matter what kind of database manager you're using.

59
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,190
This could be from a live host or from a different local development environment like my AMP or desktop

60
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,420
server or something like that.

61
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,310
You can get these from exporting the database through the database manager.

62
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,870
And so in local, we are using the database manager called admin.

63
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,630
So I'll go to twenty twenty two here and with the site turned on if I click open admin or.

64
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:57,830
Now that opens this database manager and I can check that it's local, say twenty two and now if I just

65
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,750
go over here and click the export button.

66
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:09,210
What that does in my browser is it brings up an export function and you just leave the default settings,

67
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,950
I want the format to be Eskil and just leave these all the tables selected and click export.

68
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,460
And what that does is it opens up the actual SQL file in my browser.

69
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,020
It is a called a dump of the database, the database dump.

70
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:33,070
And so since I have this in my browser, this isn't resulting in a file, a SQL file.

71
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,750
And so to create that file, you can use your code editor or your text editor.

72
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,380
And so what I'll do is just click anywhere here and click Control A to select all and then control C

73
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,220
to copy.

74
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,230
And now I've copied all the text and code for the school file.

75
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,710
Now, if I open a code editor like Adam, I have another one that I export it open right here, but

76
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:06,700
I can just file new file, open a new file and I can just control V and paste that entire file into

77
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,930
the code editor.

78
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,430
So this is a dot SQL file, and it's untitled yet.

79
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:23,050
But if I just click File Save as let's go down here and click Save as and then I can navigate to desktop,

80
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,040
let's just create a new folder called Twenty Twenty Two.

81
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:36,590
Into there and now I need to name it, and when we name the file, we need to name it with a ce que

82
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,530
l'extension.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,250
And so I'll just say 20 to 20 to Dot s QOL.

84
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:55,670
And when I save that now, that saved as a dot school file and you could see the context syntax coloration

85
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:02,630
change within my code editor here, signifying that it knows this is a school file and it knows what

86
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,900
kind of code each one of these lines and different things are.

87
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:14,840
And so if we look in the in my browser now, not in not in the local sites folder, but where I saved

88
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,310
it in desktop and 2022, you can see that there's my folder.

89
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,500
It's a school dot school and it has a different icon here.

90
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:33,890
So I can use that along with the WP content folder to import this site as a complete site into any hosting

91
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,470
area or local development environment that I need.

92
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,580
Let's go ahead and look in another window in the File Explorer.

93
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,100
And you can do this on your Mac with the Finder just open to windows.

94
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,980
And now I'm going to go over here and find the files that are associated with the other website with

95
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,350
this one, the migration site original.

96
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,970
And so let's see.

97
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,930
Let's go over here.

98
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:06,710
And so I'm just going to this will be done in a live environment by doing either using a file manager

99
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,040
to move the files and then import the database.

100
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:16,100
Or you can use an FTP program like we learned in the last section in order to move the files.

101
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,930
And then again, import the database file into the existing database.

102
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,660
And we'll do that in a live environment here in a minute.

103
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,730
But let's just do it locally for now.

104
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:33,170
So I'm looking at moving the files and the database from this cadence over into the other side, and

105
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,140
so the other side is still in local sites.

106
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,470
So I'll go here in my computer to local sites and I'm looking for migration.

107
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,520
I look for migration site original.

108
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,620
This is a working site and under app and public, I can see that I have the set of files under public

109
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,030
and the WP content folder is right there.

110
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,020
So I'm just going to go ahead and click that once and hit Delete.

111
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,670
I'm just going to delete the whole WP content folder out of this migration site.

112
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:17,330
Original, and I'm going to go back to the Cadence app under public and WP content here at Kadence.

113
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,920
I'm just going to move it over and hold control and copy it into that folder.

114
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:30,980
And so that is basically replacing the WP content folder on the, you know, WordPress site.

115
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,950
That's just a default site with the WP content folder that came from the cadence site.

116
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,230
And so that's one part of two.

117
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:48,470
Now I need to bring the Dot SQL file into the site over here in some way, and the way we need to do

118
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,440
that is through a database manager in this case.

119
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:58,700
So go back to local and what I'd like to do is just on this card and say I'm going to go ahead and stop

120
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,770
the site from running on the server because what I want is to make sure when I go to the migration site,

121
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:11,420
original and the database, I want to open admin or in my browser, and that will make sure that I'm

122
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,670
browsing to this migration site.

123
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:21,170
Original If multiple sites are open and you're navigating to the database tab in each one, when they're

124
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:27,340
when they're running, the browser can confuse those two and that can happen.

125
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,680
And so it's a good idea to turn off the original site once you've exported the database and turn on

126
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,370
the news site and navigate to the database tab and open admin here and do it in that way while at one

127
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,870
site is running that way.

128
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:47,750
When you're in here and looking at the database, you can look here and see that the local site is migration

129
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,740
site original.

130
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,480
And that's the one that I want.

131
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:56,450
And so what I'm going to do is similar to when we were installing WordPress manually.

132
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:02,930
I'm going to go ahead and select all the tables, and I want to just drop those tables.

133
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:09,260
I want to just erase all the tables of the database and bring in a whole new dot SQL file with all new

134
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,740
tables.

135
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,860
But instead of having WordPress create them like we were installing a fresh site before, I want to

136
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:25,580
import a SQL file and so I can click choose files I can choose in the folder that was exported under

137
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,680
app and sequel.

138
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,120
That was where I exported an unzipped that zip file.

139
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,400
I can click local and hit open and then click Execute.

140
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,180
And what that's going to do is bring in and import those that database.

141
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,710
923 queries executed.

142
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,640
OK, it says.

143
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:51,890
And so I can click the name of the database, I can click local.

144
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,190
And now it's showing me the tables are in here.

145
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:03,530
And finally, because this is at a new domain name, a new URL lets you go into WP options in the database

146
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:09,980
here and click Select Data, and we want to change this to the new You URLs site instead of the old

147
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,800
one, the one that's for migration site original.

148
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,920
And so I'll just go back to where I have it open in the browser.

149
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,620
Click that to highlight it and click Control.

150
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,740
See to copy.

151
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,490
And in here you can click Edit.

152
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:29,240
And under WP options, you want to replace the URLs with the New York URL to do a manual migration.

153
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:38,150
And so this will be the final step under site URL and home rows in the WP options table.

154
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,010
I've selected and saved those.

155
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:48,380
So now let's see what happens when we go back to the URL of the original site and refresh, or I'll

156
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,280
just press enter.

157
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,620
Let's see what the site looks like now.

158
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,480
As it opens, hey, look at that.

159
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,870
It's brought in a version of the site now.

160
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,200
There is something wrong with this.

161
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:07,690
You probably notice there's a few images missing from this homepage and so we can figure out what's

162
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,010
going on with those.

163
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,140
There's some images that are working.

164
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,460
And I think I know the reason for that because we need to do one more step.

165
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:23,620
As you saw some of these, the URLs for the site URL and the home we're already, you know, we migrated

166
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,500
the database in and it was an exact copy of the database from this Kadence site, right?

167
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:38,530
And so some of the URLs, particularly for these images, they might be saved in the database as the

168
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,550
other URL.

169
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,060
And I'm sure that's what's going on here.

170
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:51,430
And so one thing we can do is just let's go into local and we'll go to the migration site original and

171
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,110
click admin to go to the WordPress dashboard.

172
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:02,770
And here in local, you know, you could use the one click admin selection right here.

173
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:09,130
But one thing to note when you migrate a web site and bring the database over and just copy the database

174
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:14,830
over and imported into a new database, then the user credentials are stored in that database.

175
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:21,910
And so the user credentials are going to be the same credentials from the original site, not the credentials

176
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,290
from the new site that you had just created as an empty site.

177
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,700
And that's one thing to note.

178
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:34,870
So I would use the credentials from the original site and that should log me in.

179
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,010
Great.

180
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:43,240
OK, so one thing I'd like to do is just show you as we finished this manual migration, an easy plug

181
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:50,410
into use in order to take care of this problem that you might have with a manual migration, which is

182
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,300
to go through the entire database, changing the old URL to the new URL.

183
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,610
The migrated URL is the wrong one.

184
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,290
And so there's a great plugin called Better Search Replace.

185
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:10,000
By delicious brains should come up if you search for better search or better search replace.

186
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:18,340
And it's this one right at the top, yet the better search for a place plug in works really well, so

187
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,590
I'll just click install now and then.

188
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:26,110
When that finishes installing, I can click activate and this is a great plug in.

189
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,490
I'll show you as we finish this lesson, how to use it, and then we'll complete this manual migration.

190
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,550
And so let's go in here under tools better search replace.

191
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,290
And what we're doing is we're searching for the original URL.

192
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:50,380
So I just control C to copy that, and I'll put it here is included in the FTP, and then I want to

193
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,510
replace it with the new URL.

194
00:15:53,080 --> 00:16:00,430
And what this will do is it'll go through the entire database and it'll look for this old one and it'll

195
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,570
replace it with the new one and we can run it as a dry run to start with.

196
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,020
One thing to remember is you have to select the tables you want to use.

197
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:14,980
So what I usually do is select the first one, scroll to the very bottom and hold down shift and select

198
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,200
the last so that I've selected all the tables.

199
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,940
And then first, always run as a dry run to see what's going to happen.

200
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:28,270
So it goes and looks at the entire database, and it will show you the progress as it goes.

201
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:33,130
Here's my result 12 tables, 36 were found that need to be updated.

202
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,630
Now, zero changes were made because I had the dry run checkbox checked.

203
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:43,660
But now that I'm like, OK, thirty six cells, one of those was probably this background image right

204
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,540
here and other images around the site.

205
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,850
So now I'll just leave it the same and uncheck the dry run and run the search and replace.

206
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,930
Now it's showing me what it's doing there.

207
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,570
It says 36 updates.

208
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,500
Let's see what happens if I refresh the page on the home page.

209
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,820
Is the are the images working again?

210
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,410
Yes.

211
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:14,210
All right, so now I think this is a final working migration all the way across the entire web site.

212
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,600
And so that's a manual migration.

213
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,890
And let me just reiterate.

214
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:24,710
You don't have to do that just between local installations.

215
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:31,040
You could bring a live WordPress website from one host over to a different host, which is something

216
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,600
I've used often in my business.

217
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,140
You could develop a site locally and then use this technique to migrate the site to a live host when

218
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,670
you're ready to take the site live.

219
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,100
There are a lot of different uses for migrations.

220
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,900
Manual migrations are a good way to learn how everything works in the background.

221
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,060
But next, we'll get into some easier ways to do migrations using plug ins.
