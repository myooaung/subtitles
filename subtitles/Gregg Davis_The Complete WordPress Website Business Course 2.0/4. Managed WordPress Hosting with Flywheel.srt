1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,000
In this lesson, we'll look at Flywheel managed hosting and discuss what business models are most appropriate

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,680
for its pricing and services.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,310
You'll see how to sign up and set up a site with SSTL using a temporary domain and some of the features

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,130
and benefits that come with a managed WordPress host.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,500
By the end of this video, you'll understand why some situations are best served with a managed WordPress

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,250
hosting plan and get an idea whether Flywheel would work for you.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,960
Let's talk about managed WordPress hosting and tours the Get Flywheel dot com website, as well as my

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,280
area at Flywheel, where I've lost a client sites and my own sites before.

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:47,820
So we've used Flywheel just a little bit in this course to create and make a 60 day demo site with Flywheel

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,600
in order to play with the cadence, theme and cadence blocks free versions.

11
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,570
And so you're a little bit familiar, potentially with Flywheel already, but let's just tour around

12
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,110
a little bit.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,620
One of the things that I that I love about Flywheel is that they're one of the only managed companies

14
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:10,650
that offers a plan for a single site that's less than twenty five dollars a month.

15
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,500
And so the tiny is a great place to start.

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,530
If you do want to go with managed WordPress hosting, which takes care of a lot of things for you and

17
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,190
can make sure that you have a high speed, high performant website for your visitors.

18
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,510
When you start out, if you are going to have 10 or more sites or even up to 10, starting with freelance

19
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:38,700
is a great way to go because you can get your sites down to under $10 per month per site, something

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,360
which you should be charging at least $25 a month, if not 50 or $100 a month per site for when you're

21
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,700
when you're hosting client sites.

22
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:56,130
And so I'll just click the login button and go ahead and log into my own site control panel at flywheel

23
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,440
hosting and we'll take a look around.

24
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,830
So here are my dashboard page.

25
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:09,950
I'm logged in to Flywheel, and I have my one site here, which is a demo site setup, and you can see

26
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,900
that I have 14 days left.

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,520
I just created this demo site.

28
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,640
This is at my old flywheel account where I used to host client sites and my own, and I've since moved

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,150
to grid pain and using self-managed hosting.

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,330
We'll talk about that in a different part of the course, but for now, let's take a look.

31
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:35,180
If you did sign up with Flywheel through the link on the resources page, then you likely have a 60

32
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,990
day time period to play with your demo site at Flight Flywheel.

33
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:48,020
And I should also let you know that if you let that expire, or if you delete that site and then renew

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:55,640
and build a new demo site for free, of course, you still get 60 day periods on all of your demo sites

35
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,770
that you set up, so you can keep practicing with flywheel in a live environment that's really, really

36
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,310
fast.

37
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:07,820
And so for for building this site, you know, it took just a couple of minutes for it to set up.

38
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,440
And now let's just look at the control panel a little bit again.

39
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:20,930
Managed WordPress eliminates the need for a few things like using caching plugins, separate like site

40
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,060
ground uses or a lot of hosts.

41
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,730
Recommend you use WP Rocket, which is a good caching plugin, but a lot of the things that managed

42
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:35,360
WordPress Web's WordPress hosting does for you is taking care of those types of things at the server

43
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,500
level, which makes your websites either even higher performance because at a server level, things

44
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,640
happen before the traffic hits your web site instead of after.

45
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:54,320
And so security plug ins is one of those things where Flywheel recommends that you do not install any

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,590
endpoint security plugins like Word Fence or I themes security plugins.

47
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,350
Those are endpoint security plugins that manage security on your website if needed, and they're great

48
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,920
plug ins.

49
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,060
However, everything there happens after the person or the attacker hits your website or your login

50
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,820
page, and so manage WordPress.

51
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,730
Hosting and self-managed lets you take care of those things and also website caching, security and

52
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:29,420
caching at the server level, which is much, much better for high speed and more secure website hosting.

53
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:38,150
And so on this managed website control panel screen, there's a few tabs across the top could see that

54
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,760
I'm using a temporary domain that I chose, which is a subdomain of flywheels sites dot com.

55
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,940
It also says that the DNS is pointed so it it is working.

56
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,780
In fact, if I go over to WP admin, I will be able to log in to the site.

57
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:01,490
Over at, you know, in in my browser right here now, of course, because it's a demo site, it sets

58
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:09,500
up HTTP authentication, which means I've got to put in a username and password in order to navigate

59
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,700
to anywhere on the website, even the front end, but especially to the WP admin WordPress dashboard.

60
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,740
And so I'll just cancel that.

61
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,090
It'll give me the privacy mode indicator and tell me that I need a password.

62
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,550
So if I just look down here on the right hand side for this particular one flywheel and then Fortunate

63
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:40,790
Glove with let's see, that's I use flywheel and it gives me a password that's easy to remember with

64
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,450
a hyphen.

65
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:51,110
And then so every time you visit, it needs to authenticate you as kind of a password protection, so

66
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,350
both, you know, Google and the search engine bots or visitors can't find your site and so that won't

67
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,100
be listed in the Google directory or anything while you're working on it.

68
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:10,970
Now I'm getting a browser message here, and this is because this site is not at HTP, but it's an excuse

69
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,530
me, it's not secure, it's not an HDTV s, but it's at HTTP.

70
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,590
And so it's saying I'm submitting information and you could say, go back.

71
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,240
But I know where we are here.

72
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,290
I'm at my own web site.

73
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,260
I'm setting up at Flywheel, so I'm going to click Send anyway.

74
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:35,810
And now that's taking me to the WordPress dashboard login page, and I chose my username and password

75
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,960
when I set up this site.

76
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,180
That's something that you would want to remember for each and every one of your WordPress sites.

77
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,640
And so let's change something, though let's this does not secure.

78
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,640
Which means that any information like a like a username, a password that you pass back and forth or

79
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:59,960
in the future, any content of a contact form or an email address that you might pass for signing up

80
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,340
for an email list or anything like that is not encrypted.

81
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,890
And so if it's intercepted on the way, it can actually be read.

82
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:14,480
And so it's a it's a best practice that you use HTTPS on all your life websites.

83
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,890
Make sure you're doing that.

84
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,320
Flywheel makes it easy right here under the domain, under the Overview tab.

85
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,450
You can just click Enable SSL.

86
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:31,400
What this is doing, similar to what we saw at ground, is that it's installing a Let's Encrypt free

87
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:39,440
SSL certificate, which can and does encrypt any information sent from the user's browser to the website

88
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,410
and from the website to the user's browser.

89
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,890
So I get this message your SSL has been enabled.

90
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,800
It says that it's got the little green lock symbol.

91
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,410
That's great.

92
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,520
Now, if I refresh the page here, you can.

93
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,470
Now it's it's not showing me.

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,290
That's just because it's a cached page, potentially.

95
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,660
But let's see if I go back to WP admin.

96
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,160
Oh, good.

97
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,730
There we go.

98
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,800
And you can see that I have the lock symbol now, and it says that this connection is secure.

99
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:19,190
So anything passwords, credit card numbers even is private and cannot be unencrypted when it's in transit,

100
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,240
going back and forth.

101
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:29,090
So I just have a fresh WordPress installation here that I can now play with at a secure SSL with my

102
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,660
address, which is a temporary domain at WordPress.

103
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:41,270
And so if we go right click Visit Site, this is just going to be the default 2022 theme with a single

104
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:50,000
blog post on the home page, and I can play with WordPress over here easily in my flywheel hosting account.

105
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,800
But let's take a look a little bit deeper into the managed WordPress hosting and what the advantages

106
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,220
are here.

107
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:02,840
One of the things that we have are plug ins in the Plugins tab.

108
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:11,780
You can in this control panel, it will detect what plugins are activated on the site, and you can

109
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,100
actually let them auto update for a small fee if you like.

110
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,770
Not something that I do, but again, this is a done for you type of hosting scenario, and you can

111
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:26,810
have them keep your plugins updated at the server level from here, if you like.

112
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,630
And then there's a performance tab.

113
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:36,740
Again, another adding performance insights to your website is something that Flywheel can charge you

114
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,830
for if you like your stats for visitors.

115
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,280
Visitors to the website, et cetera, are right here.

116
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:52,940
Automated backups is a very powerful, automated backups and backups trimming system where there's restoring

117
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,880
all backups performed all day, every day.

118
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,220
And so if there's any issue at any time, you can use your backup system here.

119
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:09,140
And then under advanced, we have just a few different things that you may use down here, like flushing

120
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,920
the cache.

121
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,010
If when you're using a caching system, sometimes when you update your website, the browser shows you

122
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:21,740
an old version of the page because it has it's it's it's being served from the cache.

123
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,190
And so sometimes you want to manually refresh your cache.

124
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,250
There's a login attempts.

125
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,430
This is part of the flywheel security system.

126
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,220
You can reset the login attempts.

127
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,800
And so, you know, if you fail too many times and you can set this inside of your settings, you,

128
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,140
you might get locked out.

129
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,120
Or if?

130
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:50,620
Course, you want any kind of hacking attempt to be locked out if they're attempting to address or access

131
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,650
your login page one after the other.

132
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,320
You can eat up your resources in your web site.

133
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,990
And so but if you get locked out, you can reset your own attempts so that you can get back in.

134
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:09,640
You can export the logs from here and then, you know, there's some site options you can disable caching

135
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,740
at the time when you're developing the site.

136
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,560
That makes some sense from what I just mentioned up here.

137
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,930
You can clear the cache manually, but you can actually disable the caching while you're developing

138
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,150
a website, which makes it easier to see your changes instantly without running into that caching issue

139
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,540
at all.

140
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,010
And so there's a few other things that you can set down here.

141
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:38,230
The IP version, the the database prefix is something that is customized here so that you're not using

142
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,690
just the standard WP underscore for each database, table and database.

143
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,860
Part of your database that manages your WordPress website, but you have a random string right here

144
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:59,710
and you can change the database prefix right here easily, which makes it easy to do a security item,

145
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,940
which is to change your database prefix.

146
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,400
That's something that I do very often.

147
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,080
But if you suspected any hacking attempts, you could go ahead and do that.

148
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,810
And then similar to phpMyAdmin in the site ground site tools.

149
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,860
This is a proprietary and customized database manager that you can use.

150
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,200
And so this is the database.

151
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,880
And then there's import and export.

152
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,500
And if you were doing some site migrations, you have 100 percent access to your database.

153
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,780
These are all the database tables.

154
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:39,070
So, for example, under users, you know, this is something that will play with when we look at files

155
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,590
and database details in a WordPress website a little bit later in the course.

156
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,830
But for example, I can look at my user here, I can edit this.

157
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:55,990
And for example, it's not usually possible to change the username, which is called user log in in

158
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,800
the database.

159
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,500
That is a that is a permanent thing in WordPress in your profile page, but you can change it in the

160
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,120
database if you wanted to manually change the password, for example.

161
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:07,870
Yeah.

162
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,390
Of course, this wasn't my password.

163
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:16,540
I used a password that was memorable to me, but this is an encrypted version of the password that is

164
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,200
using it using the MD5 hashing method.

165
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:26,610
And so if you do change the password in the database, for example, if you couldn't get into your WP

166
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,960
admin WordPress dashboard and you wanted to change your own password at your hosting company here,

167
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,440
you could access that and you would want to select empty five.

168
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,470
And then, you know, type of password that you'll remember or paste, one that you can remember and

169
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,820
then use the MD5 dropdown here and click Save.

170
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:52,120
That's how you can do that, but it is easy to manage your entire database here using their database

171
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,900
manager.

172
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,150
And so that makes it easy.

173
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,850
You know, you can go I can go back to advanced using these breadcrumbs right here and then if I click

174
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:08,080
sites, that'll give me a flywheel dashboard, which will give me a list of my websites that I'm hosting

175
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,320
here.

176
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:16,330
I often use it used the freelance bulk website hosting plan to get my client websites under $10 a month

177
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,230
per site, with everything done for me in Flywheel here.

178
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,420
One of the things to note, and it's something that I mentioned when we were talking about WordPress

179
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:32,050
hosting in general, is that it's a best practice that you don't host your email at the same place as

180
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:38,560
your website and that you also don't host or register your domain names at the same place.

181
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:46,720
Flywheel and many of the WordPress managed hosting companies for this reason, because they're more

182
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,450
advanced and more in line with best practices these days and into the future, they don't even provide

183
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,480
email hosting, and they also don't provide domain registration.

184
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,050
It's not their level and their zone of expertise.

185
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,890
And so if you want to have email addresses, you've got to go to email hosting like Safe with Google

186
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:12,430
Workspace or with Rackspace or another email hosting provider and connected here.

187
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:21,700
And so this is strictly for your website, and that gives you a nice little tour of of flywheel.

188
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,580
Manage WordPress hosting a few other little things.

189
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:32,110
You can have organizations if you have different people that need to access certain websites or different

190
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,330
levels of access of your websites that you're hosting.

191
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,020
You can manage different people in your team or in your business.

192
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,920
Blueprints are a really powerful way of having a standardized word.

193
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,770
Press installation that has potentially the general themes and plugins that you always use on all websites

194
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,560
and have them prebuilt for you so that when you create a new WordPress website, it installs everything

195
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,070
for you.

196
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,790
OK?

197
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,300
And then there's some add ons and then get help.

198
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:08,730
There is great support for both WordPress itself and for your hosting plan available 24-7 at managed

199
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,260
WordPress hosts like Flywheel.

200
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,480
And so that's great.

201
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:21,420
That gives you an idea of everything within the Get Flywheel XCOM control panel here.

202
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:27,480
And a good idea of what managed hosting is and the kinds of things that you would use it for.
