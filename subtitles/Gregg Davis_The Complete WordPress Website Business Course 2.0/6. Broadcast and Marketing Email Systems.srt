1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,400
In this lesson, we'll explore email lists and broadcast e-mail and how it's made up of systems that

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,300
include an opt in form, a hosted database, a way to create outgoing email and a way to send many emails

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:12,780
at once.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,260
You'll learn the three ways to set up broadcast email using MailChimp, a plug in for composing email

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:26,310
and blog posts together in WordPress, and the advanced method for leveraging Amazon six as a transactional

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,440
and broadcast email system together.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,570
By the end of this video, you'll understand the different options for setting up WordPress to collect

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,220
emails into an email list and sending out broadcast email in different ways.

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:47,010
Let's talk about broadcast, email or marketing email, also known as bulk email or email marketing

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,770
systems and so for broadcast email.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:58,680
As you've learned, it's an outgoing only email system that sends from a person or a computer to a group

12
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,670
and also referred to as bulk email or marketing email.

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:11,580
It's really what you know of as building an email list, and so while there's no hosting of emails really

14
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,240
necessary, a service is required to be able to power the outgoing email and the database itself, which

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,040
is the email list.

16
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,280
And so as a diagram to go over what is really involved as far as your WordPress website.

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,770
Building the email list, designing outgoing emails in order to go out to a group and being powered

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,060
by a service.

19
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,790
We're going to talk about and I'm going to recommend the MailChimp service as a good place to start.

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,790
MailChimp is a good place to start because for one, there are many different services that integrate

21
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:55,170
with MailChimp for WordPress plugins that are available to be able to easily set up a web form or collect

22
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:02,160
email addresses as a part of your eCommerce store with WordPress and add those people to your MailChimp

23
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,220
email list very, very easily with no programming, nothing to do very much, except for just set it

24
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,690
up and turn it on.

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,040
The other reason is that MailChimp has a free level up to 2000 contacts where you can send an unlimited

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,200
number of emails out to your contacts all at once at any time for up to 2000 contacts or less.

27
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,140
And you know, when you get above 2000, that's when I would recommend either, you know, growing to

28
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,680
a certain extent, but then changing your service, potentially in order to save some money on broadcast

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,160
email.

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,910
And we'll talk about those systems and how they work in the next couple of lessons.

31
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,430
But for now, let's just look at this diagram here.

32
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,480
As far as broadcast email, you know, the first thing that might happen is on your WordPress site and

33
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,020
opt in.

34
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,570
You know, the the person's got a fill in their email address, potentially their first and last name

35
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,410
or or anything else you want to collect, but they've got to fill out a form and press submit.

36
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,910
And so then what happens when they press the submit button down here in the corner?

37
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:17,250
Their email address and any other information is added to a database and that database generally as

38
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,280
far as the system we're talking about now is managed by your broadcast email tool.

39
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,320
In this case, MailChimp.

40
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,210
And so MailChimp does the rest of these things in this case, but you've got an email list, which is

41
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:41,610
the database, and then you need some way to to create either an HTML or plain text, email or both

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,260
to be able to send those out.

43
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:51,330
And so a tool to be able to create a nice looking email with a header image with the proper spam law

44
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,660
compliance like having an unsubscribe button and a real business address at the bottom of the email

45
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:04,020
is required by law when you're sending out marketing or broadcast emails, and MailChimp provides all

46
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,680
that for you.

47
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,400
And so MailChimp also takes on protecting the sending IP address similar to the transactional email

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
systems we've been talking about.

49
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,550
And so you've got this inclusive system powered by MailChimp in this case, where then that system sends

50
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:26,580
out multiple emails, one to each person on the list all at once.

51
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:34,230
And so it enables you to do marketing or provide a service to a group of people as a part of a membership

52
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,580
or something like that.

53
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,900
And that is generally the gist of broadcast email.

54
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,430
Now let's just take a look at a few different systems, starting with number one, easy with the MailChimp

55
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,110
and a MailChimp plug in.

56
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:57,750
Like, there's a few different plugins that allow you to easily embed a MailChimp form on your WordPress

57
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,730
website and have it join the.

58
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,960
MailChimp list, again, you can have up to 2000 contacts in your free MailChimp account.

59
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:15,310
And so MailChimp powers the database list and it powers the email creation and then it creates the emails

60
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:23,530
that and it sends the emails through its system to the group easy and free and a great place to start.

61
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:30,340
Secondly, this is just an extra layer that you can use.

62
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,290
You can provide this functionality to client sites, or you can use it yourself.

63
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:42,190
If you want to have a newsletter type of scenario where maybe you want to create a blog post and then

64
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:49,390
you're also going to send an email to the email list with either some or all of that blog post content

65
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,050
formatted nicely in the person's email.

66
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,470
Right?

67
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:01,300
And so there's a plugin called Newsletter Glue that allows you to connect to MailChimp or other suppliers,

68
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
and it basically replaces this layer of the system here.

69
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,990
The newsletter Glue Plug In has a free version and also a paid version that has a little more functionality.

70
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:19,060
But Newsletter Glue takes care of the designing an email so that MailChimp can then take the responsibility

71
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,490
of sending out those emails to the group.

72
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,150
And so that's easy and another easy way of doing it.

73
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,310
Again, free up to 2000 contacts.

74
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:34,810
And if you're going to be doing a newsletter that's connected to a blog newsletter, glue is a great

75
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,610
plug in and a great way to go.

76
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:45,850
A more advanced way to go is to take on the hosting of the database of all the email list subscribers

77
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:55,330
inside of WordPress and then using your transactional email provider as the power to send the bulk emails

78
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:55,750
out.

79
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:03,250
Now this is the most advanced, I would say, but also the least expensive as your email list grows.

80
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:10,630
And we'll talk about that when I talk about my setup with leverage WP Dotcom because, you know, after

81
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:19,720
you get above 2000 on your contact list, MailChimp say up to say 10000 on the contact list costs upwards

82
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,490
of $100 a month.

83
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,210
And while the business may support that, you may have been collecting emails for a free newsletter

84
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:34,900
and you're not necessarily able to fund $100 a month expense or you just want to get rid of that expense

85
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:40,360
and take the power of WordPress with a good host and a good contact.

86
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:49,660
Customer relationship manager called a CRM installed into WordPress to take over, and the AWB system

87
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,540
that we talked about in the last few lessons is a good way to go for being able to send out broadcast

88
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:02,590
email not from your WordPress website directly, but being powered by the database in your WordPress

89
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,130
website.

90
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,750
And so there are two CRM that really these days works super well with WordPress.

91
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:16,750
One is called autonomy by the same company that makes woo funnels, a checkout experience and funnel

92
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,930
creation plug in for four WooCommerce and WordPress.

93
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,670
But they also make this autonomy CRM, which is super powerful.

94
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:32,170
Now, the same makers that made the fluent SMTP outgoing email plugin that we used in the last lesson.

95
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,090
They also make something called fluent CRM, which does almost the same thing.

96
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:45,010
It enables you to manage your customers or your contacts inside of WordPress using the database power

97
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,330
that WordPress has.

98
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:53,980
And so really, you really get to cut out the middleman as it were as far as MailChimp or other suppliers

99
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:02,140
like a Weber or drip or constant contact is another example of an email marketing broadcast email provider.

100
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,810
But you can do this all in WordPress.

101
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:12,790
If you have a more advanced host because you may be hosting a very large database of contacts, but

102
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:19,060
you really place the opt in forms in WordPress powered by the CRM program.

103
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:27,880
And then those contacts go into your WordPress database and they are hosted and managed with your CRM

104
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,140
plug in like auto NAMI.

105
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:37,060
And then these two, especially autonomy, provides a great way of designing custom emails just within

106
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,750
WordPress.

107
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:47,140
And then you use your transactional email supply provider like Amazon says to be able to send bulk email

108
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,930
to your group direct from Amazon through your WordPress website.

109
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,270
And so that's more advanced.

110
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,410
The last thing I'll do is just go over the pricing a little bit only because.

111
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,490
There's a big difference.

112
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:10,150
These providers for a large email list will be, you know, something like maybe $100 a month, whereas

113
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,950
for, say, the same amount.

114
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:19,750
If you have, you know, 10000 contacts and you send to them maybe four times a month, that only costs

115
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,800
$5.

116
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,860
And so you could see there's a big difference as your email list grows in using something like Amazon,

117
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:33,610
a simple email service instead of a company like MailChimp now, MailChimp is a great way to start,

118
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,580
and it's very convenient if you keep your email list, trim and and keep cleaning it.

119
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,530
It can be used for a good long time for that, and it has great features and it's easy to use.

120
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:54,400
But I'm going to show you in the final section of this email systems part of the course how to set up

121
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,820
Amazon.

122
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:02,110
See us not only as a transactional email provider, but also as your broadcast email provider.
