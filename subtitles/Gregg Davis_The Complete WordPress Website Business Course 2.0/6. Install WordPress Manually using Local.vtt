00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.760
In this lesson, we'll set up an empty server using local and install WordPress manually.

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.850
You'll also learn how the files connect to the database by using the correct database user credentials

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.680
and use the WordPress included installer script to set up a fresh new site.

4
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.110
By the end of this video, you'll understand more about how WordPress works by installing it manually

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.290
on a working server starting from an empty database.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.170
Let's do one more thing that's pretty fun and very educational, especially if you're working locally,

7
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.640
but you can also do this at your existing host if you as long as you have access to the files and to

8
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.750
the database, and that is to install WordPress manually.

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.500
WordPress used to have to be installed manually.

10
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.500
These days, pretty much every host and every local development environment will install WordPress automatically

11
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.980
for you.

12
00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.090
It's pretty easy, but it does give you a good insight into again how WordPress works and how the files

13
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.290
connect to the database.

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.130
It's pretty rewarding to set up a site on your own totally manually, so let's just create an empty

15
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.570
server space to install WordPress locally using local, and so just click the Plus button and install

16
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.560
a new site.

17
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.560
I'm just going to choose a name for it, like WP Manual install something like that.

18
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.880
Click Continue.

19
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.050
Preferred is fine and then a user name and a password.

20
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.330
No, it's not something you really need to remember.

21
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.750
You just need to put it in there so it will create a site.

22
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.380
And as it's doing that, I'll explain that we're doing this so that local can connect the database with

23
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.720
the files, and it creates a database area and a working database that we can leverage and use to install

24
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.470
WordPress.

25
00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.830
And that's just the way local works in different local development environments like map or desktop

26
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.180
server or something else.

27
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.990
There may be a different way to create an empty database that you can let the WordPress installer populate

28
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.160
with tables later.

29
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.450
You'll see how it works.

30
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.640
So now that that site is installed, let's just go ahead and open up the files by clicking this little

31
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.020
button.

32
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.770
And here I am at her local sites, WP Manual Install, go to the app folder and then under public.

33
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.170
You can see all of the WordPress core files.

34
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.210
Now I'm just going to select them all and hit delete and then my computer will just delete that whole

35
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.510
thing.

36
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.380
So I have an empty public folder as a part of this installation.

37
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.780
And now let's go to the database.

38
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.160
And it already says I can't find the database information in the WP config file.

39
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.240
Of course, we just deleted that.

40
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.770
So that's OK.

41
00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.010
We're going to open admin or though so that we can access the database and all the tables that local

42
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.000
created for us.

43
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.570
Let's go ahead and click the checkbox at the top, which selects all the tables and then click Drop.

44
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.680
That is code for delete in my school land.

45
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.580
And so in that language, you know, when you hit drop that my SQL command to drop all the tables.

46
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.400
So now we have an empty database called local.

47
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.080
It has no tables.

48
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:32.240
And we also have an empty folder in the public folder for this application in local.

49
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.480
And so now really, all we have to do is populate this with the WordPress files.

50
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.200
Now you could go back to WordPress.org and you could download the files from here, but I already have

51
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.090
them downloaded.

52
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.310
Let's open my files explorer.

53
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.360
Is this where I have it?

54
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.630
Yep.

55
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.290
And so WordPress 5.9 and in the WordPress folder, I unzipped it, as you remember, and I'm just going

56
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.410
to take all the files and copy them over into the public folder right here.

57
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.920
Now, that should just take a couple of seconds.

58
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:15.590
And while that's doing that, we're going to have to go in and use either a text editor or a code editor

59
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.240
to go ahead and create a WP config file.

60
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.580
And we're going to have to edit the database credentials right here to connect it to that database.

61
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.730
And so here's an example of that WP sample TCP IP.

62
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.740
What I'm going to do is just close the things that I was working on before so that, you know, I don't

63
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.790
get confused.

64
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.870
But if we go back into the public folder, here it is now.

65
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.410
I could go to WP config dash sample and the first thing I'm going to do is just rename that by deleting

66
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.630
the dash sample part and letting it rename to WP config.

67
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.470
And that's Dot P.

68
00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.330
It's not showing in my File Explorer here, but I know that's a file, and so I want to open this in

69
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.450
the Adam program or a text editor.

70
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.310
And so that's opened here in WP config.

71
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.930
I can see that it's in the right place and I'm going to edit the database credentials.

72
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.750
And now, if you forget what those are, you can just go back into local and it doesn't tell you what

73
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.260
they are here.

74
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.810
But in another of your websites, it's always standard in local.

75
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.060
They use local host for the host.

76
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.210
And then the user is root and root, and then the database name is just local.

77
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.900
And so we can use that as a reference when we go here.

78
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.050
The database name is local.

79
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.290
The username is root.

80
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.300
And the password is route.

81
00:05:52.930 --> 00:06:00.490
And the database host is local host, so click Control SE to save a little asterisk disappears.

82
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.940
And now what I have in local is and here's my files in public.

83
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.850
I have a WP config file that is configured to attach to the existing database.

84
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.840
And so really, that's all I need to do if I just hit open site here and I have to go to the correct

85
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.200
site.

86
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.400
This manual install site, if I go up and say, I wonder if it sees the database now.

87
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.780
Yeah.

88
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.780
So now it sees the correct database credentials, and all I have to do is go to the open site button

89
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.080
is trying to open the site and the WordPress program hasn't been installed yet.

90
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.360
So what you'll see is the WordPress installer script running inside your browser.

91
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.530
It first starts with a selection of the language that you want WordPress to use.

92
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.890
And so I use that and then you just choose the site title and username password and an email.

93
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.390
So this is the welcome to the famous five minute WordPress installation process.

94
00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.770
It is pretty easy.

95
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.460
And so this was called what was it called again?

96
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.400
Let's look WP manual install.

97
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:15.880
Just so don't confuse myself the VPI manual install, and I'll give my my name for a username.

98
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.340
You can use any password you want, but I'll just use one that I can remember.

99
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.380
It doesn't have to be very strong because this is just a local site.

100
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.530
Now the email, it's important if we want this to work in local for receiving email addresses that we

101
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:37.860
use the standard local email address that's used within this local development environment.

102
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.490
And we've used that before in one of the previous lessons.

103
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:48.540
But you can find it by going up here and looking at preferences and then under new site defaults, the

104
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.070
admin email that's a standard email address for local installations is this.

105
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.740
So I'll just use Control C to copy that and then go back to my installation here.

106
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.980
Paste it right in there, and I don't need to use this search engine visibility discouraged checkbox.

107
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:10.290
You might use that if you're developing a site at a live host, but I don't need that, so I'll just

108
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.760
click Install WordPress.

109
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:18.750
And then while that's happening, what's what it's doing here is it's going through a script included

110
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.760
in WordPress now that it's connected to a database.

111
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:29.400
It's going to create all the tables within the database and populate them with the rows that are needed

112
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.830
for a fresh WordPress installation.

113
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:32.760
And there we go.

114
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.810
Success.

115
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.520
So it tells me my username.

116
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.240
It tells me I had a chosen password that I needed to remember.

117
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:44.010
So if I just hit log in and put in my credentials.

118
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:52.390
That should log me into the WordPress dashboard and a fresh and clean WordPress website.

119
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:53.570
Great.

120
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.220
There it is.

121
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.690
I can see it's under this name that local had given us before.

122
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.390
Now, if we go back to admin, which is our database manager and just refresh the page, that should

123
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.860
show us all the tables.

124
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:06.820
Now here they are.

125
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.420
These are the tables that WordPress installed as a part of this site here under local.

126
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:18.040
And if you click right, right click and click View Site.

127
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:25.240
Open it in a new tab, you can see that it's a fresh WordPress installation using the default 2022 theme

128
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.210
and seems to be all working.

129
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.720
That looks great.

130
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.020
The dashboard was somewhere I could log into.

131
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.180
Here's the sample page.

132
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.370
Yeah, that looks great.

133
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:42.700
All right, well, we've just installed WordPress manually, as long as you have a working server where

134
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.850
you can have files and a database connected.

135
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.200
You can install WordPress manually locally or anywhere you want.
