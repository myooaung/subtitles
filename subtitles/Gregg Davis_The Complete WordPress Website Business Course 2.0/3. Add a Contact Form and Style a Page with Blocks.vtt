00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.930
In this lesson, we'll create a custom contact page using a block pattern provided by the theme and

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.180
style it to match the look and feel of the site.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.600
You'll activate a forms plug in and add a contact form, embedding it on the page using a short code

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.340
block by the end of this video.

5
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.370
You'll learn how to install a working contact form and modify the layout of a page using the Block editor.

6
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.430
Let's create another custom page.

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.850
How about a contact page for this website?

8
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.230
If we go into dashboard, you could go to pages, add new and we'll put a title.

9
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.240
Just contact should be fine and click Publish.

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.320
And let's just take a look at what that page is going to look like.

11
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.690
With the default template we'll have.

12
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.380
It'll have a under permalink.

13
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.410
I could just click right there to open a new tab.

14
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.790
You know, have the standard header and the standard footer and then contact with a divider and then

15
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.520
some contact content in white.

16
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.240
So that looks good.

17
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.270
Let's see what the block patterns.

18
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.490
Are available to us.

19
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.280
Let's see some pages.

20
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.180
Yes, different page types here.

21
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.980
We could use a different color.

22
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.860
Some about page links.

23
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.210
It looks nice.

24
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.240
Page layout with image and text.

25
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.000
Yeah, this has.

26
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.440
Some images that match there's some there's a large image and buttons almost think the page layout with

27
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.250
image and text might be a nice looking layout for a contact page.

28
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.580
Sure.

29
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.570
What about text?

30
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.200
Let's see.

31
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.500
See what text layouts we have.

32
00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.690
There's some columns.

33
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.520
His image and quote on a background.

34
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.270
Image on a solid color with the description over on the right hand side.

35
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.300
We could do that, you know, a nice image on the left hand side with the contact form on the right.

36
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.890
Something like that.

37
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.270
Let's check that one out.

38
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.630
So that's under the text pattern.

39
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.600
Before we do that, though, let's look at featured to see what else we have available to us.

40
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.500
There's a large a wide image with there's an introduction and then there's some buttons there.

41
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.090
Just taking a look at all the black patterns available to me here inside the 2022 theme.

42
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.150
There's that image on the solid color.

43
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.130
And a simple call to action.

44
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.940
All right, I'm going to choose that image with a solid color image on a solid color.

45
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.510
And then some text over here on the right hand side.

46
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.890
I'll update that.

47
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:19.000
Next, we're going to want to replace or add a contact form near this text block over here.

48
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:30.520
Maybe we have the text block at the top and then the contact form below, but it looks like this is

49
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.340
a column layout right here.

50
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.780
Let's see this that's that has two columns.

51
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.380
And then here is there's a paragraph and another paragraph.

52
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.260
Let's take a look at what we're looking at here.

53
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:53.500
So there's a single column that's right here and that has two paragraph blocks within it, and it's

54
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.240
got a specific column width.

55
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.750
So that'll be nice for for a contact form.

56
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.760
Often when you put a contact form on a full page, those fields don't look as good when they stretch

57
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.630
across the whole page like that.

58
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.330
So a contact form is something that is functionality and not visual design.

59
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.770
And so we'll need to use a plug in to insert a contact form here and then make sure it's working.

60
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.360
So let's get started with that.

61
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.400
And while we're here, we could just edit a little bit of the text here for the contact form.

62
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.680
But should we put here, it's just a little heading in bold.

63
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.370
So.

64
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.130
Just contact information and then here might look best if you have.

65
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.790
When we go.

66
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.990
All right, so we have a nice text block there.

67
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.730
He put a call in here.

68
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.120
And what is maybe just below we could have the contact form there.

69
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.320
It looks pretty good.

70
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.570
Let's see what else.

71
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.900
Maybe make this a little bit bigger by using the typography information.

72
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.660
Why does this look smaller right here?

73
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:53.200
Let's see.

74
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.830
This stuff.

75
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.960
Have that says to and then this one size to.

76
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.490
Here we go.

77
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.000
And now with the line height.

78
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.000
Yeah.

79
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.620
Like tightening that up a little bit.

80
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.000
Let's see.

81
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.600
What else we have in here?

82
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.880
OK, so is this is a.

83
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.110
Single paragraph.

84
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.830
Oops!

85
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.330
There's a paragraph the line on this paragraph is point five.

86
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.540
But this paragraph doesn't give us a line, right?

87
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.110
Maybe we need.

88
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.450
So there's a custom size.

89
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.940
OK.

90
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.480
That was at one point five by default.

91
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.940
We open up.

92
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.930
Here we go.

93
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.470
Under typography, you can open up the line height settings for any of these text blocks.

94
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.770
Oh, one point five, that looks fine.

95
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.880
All right, so let's go ahead and update that.

96
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.890
And what to do next is to go back to the dashboard.

97
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:35.610
So we've got this contact page and let's go into plug ins and let's activate the fluid forms plug in.

98
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:43.740
This is a great free forms plug in that's easy to use and go into fluent forms new form.

99
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.550
And we can use a pre-made template like contact form, which is easy to use.

100
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.160
So let's create that form.

101
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.490
We'll see how this ends up looking on the page.

102
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.020
But what is his first name?

103
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:04.850
Last name, email has a required asterisk, as well as message and the submit form.

104
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.820
And so it's a contact form.

105
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.710
Of course, you need an email and a message, so we could say save form right here.

106
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:19.030
And we can set up the settings in the integrations later.

107
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.610
These would be, you know, the form settings.

108
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.610
What happens after someone submits the message?

109
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.650
They open up a message right here, right on the page?

110
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.540
Or do you send them to another page or even to a custom URL off site?

111
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.210
It's up to you.

112
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:39.550
And then after the four form submission, do you reset the form or hide the form?

113
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.100
You know, let's see what it looks like to hide the form.

114
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.180
That's the default layout.

115
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:50.410
And then there's a lot of different layout options right here that you can play with and different options

116
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.540
within the fluent form.

117
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.600
Plug in, and so let's save the settings right here.

118
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.830
Let's just go down through these and look at what will happen.

119
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:10.710
So the email notifications, the admin wants to get notified when this form gets submitted, most likely.

120
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:17.880
And so let's enable the admin notification email and we can duplicate.

121
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.970
You can change the settings for what you want to happen and what that email looks like.

122
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:31.890
You want the the emails coming in to you, to the administrator, and you know what is in the email

123
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.960
body here, those types of things you just hit back.

124
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:41.160
You could also check this in the trash if you want to, but we've enabled that.

125
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.530
And then there's other confirmations.

126
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:49.200
For example, you could add an email that gets sent to the user to say, here's what you submitted so

127
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.480
that they have that on file as their contact form.

128
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:59.880
And then, of course, there's custom design with CSS and JavaScript, or even marketing and CRM integrations

129
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:06.480
that you could add, like having that go to your your MailChimp email list or something like that.

130
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.210
And so that's something that we can look at later.

131
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:15.330
But as far as the form itself, these are the settings and then entries would be one great thing about

132
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:22.380
fluent forms is that it saves the data that's sent in the database so you can go and open up all the

133
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:27.450
form submissions inside your website so you don't have to save them or try to find them in your email

134
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.710
program later on.

135
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.280
But for now, let's embed this form on our contact page to see what it looks like.

136
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:41.730
So this is a short code, you know, code for different functionality within the contact form plug in

137
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.130
or any other kind of plug in might use your codes.

138
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.290
They can be inserted anywhere in WordPress, on a page or on a post.

139
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.470
I just clicked it, said, copied to Clipboard.

140
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.700
So then we'll go back into our pages.

141
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.070
All pages open up the contact page.

142
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.990
And then over here, really just below in this area here, let's see exactly where we want to put it

143
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.570
in this single column.

144
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.730
I would like to add a block.

145
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.470
And if you just start typing shortcode, there is a shortcut block.

146
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.820
You can just control V to paste and update that.

147
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.400
And then let's take a look.

148
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.090
I just go over here.

149
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.090
Actually, I have it open in another tab, still.

150
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:36.250
So if I refresh the page now, we've got that full width image and contact information and then that

151
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:36.820
form.

152
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.540
Nice.

153
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.040
It's definitely style able.

154
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.900
We could change the color of the button.

155
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:47.890
This is looking a little narrow in this column for me where this comes out to the left hand side.

156
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.920
You might want to change the column widths a little bit.

157
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.900
Maybe let's go back to.

158
00:11:53.870 --> 00:12:02.120
The editing page here, and this would add a column in between, but let's see if we want to edit the

159
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.380
columns just a little bit.

160
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.170
So this column here?

161
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.060
Here's the set of columns.

162
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.230
Let's see this column over here.

163
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.810
Oh, that's the cover image.

164
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.180
This is a set of columns right here.

165
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.400
Now it's a two column layout.

166
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:24.290
Right.

167
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.640
And let's see what other kinds of edits we can make here.

168
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:35.020
So if we want this to be a little wider, potentially this cover image this this column, I could say

169
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:35.500
width.

170
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.530
Do I want it to be 50 percent?

171
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.450
Maybe I want it to be a little bit less.

172
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.260
This column right here doesn't have a width.

173
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.280
It'll do the rest of it.

174
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.610
So let's bring this column down just a little bit.

175
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.870
Let's bring it down to maybe about 30 percent.

176
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:53.980
No, that's not.

177
00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.590
Let's do 40 percent click Update, and we'll see what that looks like on the contact page.

178
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.110
Oh, nice.

179
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:09.570
Actually brought it back, and then this one's still a little bit narrow, so that didn't really work.

180
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.600
Let's make this this column here.

181
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.660
I can see, OK, there's column width here.

182
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.000
This column, if we make that 60 percent.

183
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.850
Oh, sixty pixels now we want to make that percent.

184
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.340
And I think I'm working with the wrong column here.

185
00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.890
So we have that column.

186
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:42.440
Let's bring this back to where it was, and then there's an inner column set right here.

187
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.380
And with the dimensions, we have margin and block spacing.

188
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.690
And what about this inner column?

189
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.180
There we go.

190
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.820
It's a fixed width column settings 320 pixels.

191
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.900
Why don't we make this 60 percent?

192
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.680
Is that going to work now that 60 percent of this content area?

193
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:14.890
So if we make it pixels and instead of 60 pixels, it was 320, maybe that will make it 400.

194
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.250
Maybe let's make it 500.

195
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.660
And then.

196
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.490
Go ahead and refresh the page and see what that looks like.

197
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:29.680
Much better, so I might go back to 50 percent here on this column.

198
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.130
Instead of 40 percent.

199
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.010
Let's update that.

200
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.160
That'll bring this line out to halfway in between.

201
00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:49.190
And I just let the form extend out just a little bit, so that looks great.

202
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:49.790
Yeah.

203
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:57.830
And this is an example of where I might want to get rid of this dividing line or separator.

204
00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:03.290
Um, and to do that, really what I might want to do is just go to the page and instead of using the

205
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.520
default template, let's use a no separators template.

206
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.590
See how that changes things for us.

207
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.240
Yeah, that's a little bit better.

208
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.640
Just brought it up just a little bit.

209
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:23.540
So we have contact information, address, phone number and then our form there, and we could test

210
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:23.750
that.

211
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.170
Awesome.
