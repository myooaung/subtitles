00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.150
In this lesson, we'll explore how you can develop or migrate a WordPress Web site at a live host before

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.950
the DNS is pointing to the domain.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.040
You'll learn how to edit the hosts file on a Windows computer to fool the browser into thinking the

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.770
domain is live at your server's IP address.

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.990
By the end of this video, you'll understand how you can set up a working site behind the scenes in

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.840
an environment only you can see and then point the domain with DNS after you're finished in my grid

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.830
pattern hosting.

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.200
I'm just going to make up a domain name.

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.310
I don't even have to have this domain name registered, and it's just going to be my test domain.

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.120
Dot com.

11
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.740
I don't know who owns that domain, but I don't, and I'm going to go ahead and put that on one of my

12
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.110
servers, and then I'll have it create a new system user, as I did before.

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.720
I'm not going to set up a DNS API integration instead of just going to click none so that I don't actually

14
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.060
have to set up this DNS system.

15
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.990
So if I click Add Site here, it's just starting to build it like it did before with the last migration

16
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.590
that we did.

17
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.980
So if I want to for my browser into going to a domain name that either doesn't exist or one that is

18
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.180
not yet pointed to the server where I'm doing the website development at a different IP address, I

19
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.950
can use the hosts file on my windows computer or on my Mac in order to change the operating system and

20
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.750
think that this domain name is hosted at this IP address.

21
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.990
That's how you can do web development in the background before pointing the DNS over to the new server,

22
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:53.130
even while the old server is either nonexistent or while it's running as a previously designed website.

23
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.980
Let's look at how to do that on Windows.

24
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.780
So I'm down here a little bit off screen here in my search bar, and I've opened up the Little Windows

25
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.880
search bar and I'm starting to type notepad.

26
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.240
And so I'm going to right click Notepad and click run as administrator.

27
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.570
It's important that you run Notepad as administrator when you're using Windows so that you can actually

28
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.140
edit the hosts file and access that to be able to fool your computer into navigating to this domain

29
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.390
name at this IP address.

30
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:36.330
And so once you have notepad open under the administrator account, then you go to file open and you're

31
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.920
trying to open a particular folder and file here on your computer.

32
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.230
And you can see I've done this recently.

33
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.170
It's already opening the folder I need and where it's located is in the main hard drive the Windows

34
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.610
CE colon drive under Windows System32 drivers and the ETSI folder.

35
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.250
And so if I just go back where you would, wherever you are in windows, you would you would click the

36
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.710
Windows CE colon and then you would double click the Windows folder and then go down to the S's, where

37
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.450
it's System32 and then to the DS, where it's drivers.

38
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.790
And then the ETSI folder.

39
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.630
And looking at this, there doesn't seem to be anything in here.

40
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.470
And the reason is I'm trying to open a text file with notepad.

41
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.630
And so go down here just over the open and cancel buttons and click all files.

42
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.160
And then that'll show you all file types that are inside of that ETSI folder.

43
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.640
And so you're looking for this hosts folder so you can click it and then click open.

44
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.130
Or you could double click hosts.

45
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.900
And now what we're looking at is the hosts file that Microsoft uses for navigating to a different IP

46
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.580
addresses through the browser and different ways of navigating on the internet.

47
00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:05.970
And so the the top section with all of these comment hashtags is the standard with the hosts file has

48
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.410
in it now by default.

49
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.290
Anything down below are things that potentially if you're using a local development environment like

50
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.140
like a local, you might have a whole section like this.

51
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.270
This one is commented out.

52
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:24.210
It says local by flywheel because local used to be called local by flywheel, and it is owned by a flywheel.

53
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:31.200
But the local local development environment puts these different indicators in the hosts file so that

54
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.530
he can use that extension called Dot Local without having to register those on the internet.

55
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.360
And so there's other things just up here.

56
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.680
This is where Lara gone.

57
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.540
The local development environment puts its hosts file entries.

58
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.070
There's some up here.

59
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.910
Desktop server is another local development environment, and I've set some of these manually when I'm

60
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.470
doing just what we're doing here.

61
00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.490
And so.

62
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.340
To do is just anywhere below and any of your locations here, you can just put a couple of carriage

63
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:15.340
returns or hit, enter a couple of times and you can go ahead and go to the grid paint or wherever your

64
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.800
site is hosted and copy controls.

65
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.640
See that IP address where you have this fake domain registered.

66
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.850
And so now open up the hosts file again and I'm going to paste that IP address.

67
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.210
And then you could either have a space or a tab, and then you're going to put the domain name my test

68
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.020
domain rt.com.

69
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.970
I'm hitting copy controls.

70
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.520
See, and then I'll paste it.

71
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:47.770
And then you can always use a hash mark or the the hash tag symbol to put a comment in there.

72
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.210
And I would I usually put, you know, points to somewhere.

73
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.930
And for me, it's the grid pain over each server.

74
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:04.090
And so once I've got that in there, I can control SE and that little asterisk goes away when the when

75
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.090
the file is saved or I could hit file save.

76
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:14.950
And now this hosts file is saved with a new entry that's going to point this domain name to this IP

77
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.020
address, so we can test that by going to the web site itself.

78
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:27.790
If I just copy the domain name and put it in my browser, let's see what comes up.

79
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.850
Well, look, it's a fresh website that I just installed via a grid pin at this domain name.

80
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.850
Even though this domain name, if I log in from another computer, it doesn't really exist.

81
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.280
It points to someone else's website or a parking page.

82
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:49.090
Now I can develop a website at this domain name, and then later on, I can go to Cloudflare or wherever

83
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.190
the DNS is hosted and I can point it to the live new website.

84
00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:03.760
If we just go to, Oh, let's do this, go into grid pane, and if I go to the domain name here and

85
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:10.780
click the single sign on, it should be able to open me a new tab and log me into the WordPress dashboard.

86
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:17.770
So even though this site is not accessible to the public at this domain name, I've fooled my computer

87
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.970
using the hosts file into thinking that this domain name works.

88
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.890
And with that said, these actual URLs are present in the database.

89
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:36.640
Even we can take a look under Settings General and if we look there, that's where the WordPress address

90
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.090
and the site URL are this actual domain name.

91
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.310
So I'm developing this website correctly at the correct you URL.

92
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:54.490
If we even go into grid pain and we were to navigate to phpMyAdmin and open the database, we could

93
00:07:54.490 --> 00:08:03.010
even inspect the database under WP options and look and see that the site URL in the home URLs are the

94
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.870
My Test Domain Dakar.

95
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.680
Now, like I said, no other person would be able to navigate to this.

96
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:16.450
So it's a great way to either develop a website or to change a website and redesign it in the background

97
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.750
at a different server before the DNS is pointed.

98
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:27.280
And that way, you can migrate a site in a seamless fashion without having the new site ever go down

99
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.130
or need a maintenance mode or a coming soon.

100
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.450
Page can just have a seamless process where there's absolutely no downtime.
