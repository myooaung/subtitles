00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.280
In this lesson, we'll check out shared hosting at site ground and how to understand the pricing model.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.410
You'll see how to sign up initially.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:14.010
Avoid committing to a domain name registration and tour the website control interface called site tools.

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.680
By the end of this video, you'll be able to decide if shared hosting is the place to start for you.

5
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.480
Why say ground is a good choice for shared hosting and how to navigate the site tools?

6
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.760
Let's talk about shared hosting and in particular site ground shared hosting, which you can link to

7
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.440
from the resources page, but here if you click Grow Big, you can go ahead and set up your hosting

8
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.120
plan to start with and then choose your payment duration.

9
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.310
As I stated before, you can pay that discounted price for up to three years.

10
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.830
If you pay it all at once and retain that price per month, at which point after that period, you can

11
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.710
either migrate your sites away and change your hosting, or you can go ahead and pay the regular price,

12
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.660
which is actually affordable and within, you know, market standards.

13
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.680
But when you set up with site round, one thing to be aware of.

14
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.010
You don't want to register your new domain through your website host, even if you don't have a domain

15
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.820
already.

16
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.870
You know you could just make up a domain.

17
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.550
Under any name and click Proceed, Oops, I didn't put dot com on dot anything on the end of that.

18
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.460
And so even though it says it's not registered, that is fine.

19
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.380
I would just say no, thank you and we'll be ready to sign up for any period that we want for this price.

20
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.320
And so you can sign up for 12 months, 24 or thirty six now.

21
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.960
Oh, if I sign up for 36, then that's bringing it back up in price.

22
00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.650
And so actually the best deal is to sign up for 12 months at this point for that price.

23
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.200
And so you have to pay that upfront.

24
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.040
But in any case, I'm not going to sign up for a new account yet.

25
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.930
I just wanted to show you that that's the way that you sign up with site ground for the discounted period

26
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.350
and you don't want to register a domain name with your website host, since it's a best practice to

27
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.700
register domain names externally with a dedicated registrar versus doing it and being locked in at your

28
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.360
domain name.

29
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.080
And so I'm going to just go ahead and log in instead, and I'll pause the video while I log in to my

30
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.920
site ground account.

31
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.200
Now, one of the great things about Site Ground shared hosting is that they have this custom built control

32
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.400
panel called site tools for any of the websites that you're hosting.

33
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.800
And so I'm going to go through with you just a little bit of a tour about how to use that and where

34
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.760
all the features and the services are located that you would want to use.

35
00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:03.730
And so let's use a client site that I have called Vale sign, and it's it will open the site tool's

36
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.750
interface, where you'll know you'll be able to see all the controls down the left hand side.

37
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.990
And I'll explain a few of the setups that I would recommend when you set up Site Ground is your shared

38
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.240
hosting provider if you're going to use them.

39
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.650
And I'll also explain this message that my domain is not pointing to this site.

40
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.090
Now I've got a we're going to talk about that in a future section of the course about domains and DNS

41
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.870
settings.

42
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.330
I've got my domain for this site hosted at Cloudflare, and the DNS is provided by Cloudflare in their

43
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.960
free service.

44
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:53.080
And so it just says that the the actual DNS is pointing back to this website, but just not using the

45
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.400
DNS name servers settings here in my site tools.

46
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.500
That's why I'm getting this warning message right here.

47
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.910
But once you have your account set up and you're you're looking at a particular domain name, even if

48
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.770
it's a fake domain name and you're going to be using the temporary one, you could go down and click

49
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.790
install and manage WordPress in order to select it to automatically install WordPress or automatically

50
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.920
install WordPress and WooCommerce.

51
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.100
If you are using an e-commerce WooCommerce plug in, it'll just install the free WooCommerce plug in

52
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.520
for you.

53
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.380
I would recommend if you're going to do WooCommerce and an e-commerce site that you don't use shared

54
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.160
hosting at all.

55
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.070
But I would recommend you'd click click the select button, and you could see that I already have an

56
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:46.000
installation at the domain name here, and it gives me a few, you know, a little information about

57
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.180
it.

58
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:53.860
I can do actions like update the password, I can move or delete the application, which is WordPress.

59
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.360
And so this is under the WordPress menu item down here.

60
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:06.370
One of the things that the grow big and the go geek shared hosting systems offer is staging, which

61
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.550
is an important benefit that I would recommend you look for when you're looking and shopping for WordPress.

62
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.790
Hosting staging is just a place where you can make an exact copy of your website separate from the live

63
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.120
site.

64
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.470
Then you can test things.

65
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.460
You can make changes.

66
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.860
You can do updates to plug ins and themes.

67
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.720
You can do a complete site redesign behind the scenes without affecting the live site.

68
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.420
And then you can just click one button to overwrite the live site with the changes that you've made,

69
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.690
and you can even just use it as an easy testing area for that.

70
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.010
And so that's one of the features in my site ground tools here.

71
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.120
Again, under site, let's just go through and look at where things are located in the site tools in

72
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.700
site ground.

73
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.300
So under site, you've got file manager and we're going to be exploring the files of a WordPress site

74
00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.010
and how it connects to the database later in the course in a future lesson.

75
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:07.240
But just to show you right now this is where a file manager exists, and now you can.

76
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:15.310
You can also access all of these files, which power WordPress through an FTP program or file transfer

77
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.200
protocol, which would be an external program you can use to connect to your server.

78
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.810
And you can upload and download files to the website if you ever need to.

79
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.430
Again, in a future lesson, we're going to be talking about the files in the database and how they

80
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.480
connect and how you can manage those.

81
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.040
But in ground, the file manager makes it easy to manage and work with files on your website.

82
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:46.270
Here's where you would set up FTP accounts if you want to use an external FTP program and then my school

83
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.420
is the type of database that we're using with WordPress.

84
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:56.020
So this is where the databases for this website, the database itself would be located or multiple databases

85
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.320
if you're using them at this under this account name.

86
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.580
And so these are users for the database itself.

87
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:11.890
phpMyAdmin is a really common program that's installed on hosting servers to help you to manage the

88
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.430
database.

89
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:18.900
If you do want to get in there and fiddle with it, or make any changes or inspect areas of the database,

90
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:26.290
and we'll be doing that again later, and you would click this access phpMyAdmin to open up an interface

91
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.750
in your browser so that you can access the database.

92
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:34.030
This is just a different type of database, a postscript SQL that is not.

93
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.190
Really used with WordPress, so I'll just leave that alone under security.

94
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:46.960
There are automated backups that you can set up in WordPress and incite ground to backup your WordPress

95
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.350
website daily, so you could see my backups that have been occurring in the background on my behalf.

96
00:07:53.650 --> 00:08:00.460
And over here at the actions button, I could restore the entire website or parts of it files, databases

97
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.960
or even emails from backups that were made days in the past.

98
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.760
And they don't count towards your your server allocation.

99
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.410
And so that's a really nice feature.

100
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:17.230
That site ground gives that a lot of shared hosts either use an inferior system or don't give you backups

101
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.870
with as robust a system.

102
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.980
And so there's a few more things in here the there's a site scanner in case you're feeling like there's

103
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.420
malware in place.

104
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:35.350
Enforcing HTTP s is something that is you definitely want to do on your website.

105
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:43.570
If you don't have that, that that can be installed automatically for your domain here for free, you

106
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.870
shouldn't pay for an SSL certificate.

107
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:54.820
You should use a Let's Encrypt Free Certificate setup and renewed automatically from your host.

108
00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:01.480
If your host doesn't provide a free SSL certificate for having a secure and encrypted website, then

109
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.980
you shouldn't be using that host.

110
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:09.640
Yeah, that's just the way it is these days, and that's usually automatically updated and set up through

111
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.690
your hosting company.

112
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:15.380
And so that's basically it under security.

113
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.620
And then let's just look at speed.

114
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.860
There's caching and there's a Cloudflare connection.

115
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:28.600
Cloudflare is a recommended DNS provider and also a domain registrar now that I highly recommend.

116
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.280
This is just a connection.

117
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:36.760
We're using Cloudflare to your site, ground domain and your site ground hosting account.

118
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.560
And because they have this site ground tools here, you can use that to connect.

119
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.960
If you are using Cloudflare, which I'd recommend.

120
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.930
The content delivery network is really what they're connecting here, meaning that wherever in the world

121
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:55.240
people connect to your web site, you're giving them a fast connection to all your all of your files,

122
00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:00.610
and you're serving them from different locations around the world supplied by Cloudflare.

123
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.030
And so caching is where I mentioned it briefly before in this part of the course.

124
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:14.290
But a caching is where, you know when WordPress is delivering the pages of your web site instead of

125
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:20.980
having to create each page on the fly by pulling content from the database, plus files and images from

126
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:27.680
the the file structure of WordPress and combining them in real time and delivering them to the user.

127
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:34.270
If those pages aren't often changed, you want to cache your content so that those can be delivered

128
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.610
as a static web page to the user.

129
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:42.880
Instead, it saves a lot of loads loading time because milliseconds add up to seconds and you want your

130
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.220
website to be delivered as fast as possible.

131
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.020
One of the things that site ground offers is this super casher.

132
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:57.190
It is a plug in that's called the WP, the S.G., I should say optimizer plug in that comes installed

133
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.330
when you install WordPress.

134
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.500
You can also get it from the WordPress repository just from within any WordPress website.

135
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:09.100
If you're hosting with site ground, you should use their WP Optimizer plug in and have it enabled and

136
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.300
enable caching.

137
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:16.420
And it's easy to set up and it just maintains your web site much, much faster in the background loading

138
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.170
for your visitors.

139
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.300
And then under WordPress, you know this is where we were before installing and managing your current

140
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.160
WordPress installations.

141
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:30.760
Even you can even install a separate installation under a sub directory on an existing domain name,

142
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.390
if you like.

143
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.450
And then there's the staging areas.

144
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:42.220
You can create staging copies by just naming them, and they exist as a subdomain like staging one Dot

145
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.870
Vale signed account, for example.

146
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:50.650
If you want to use staging, they do have a migrate or tool that works some of the time to migrate sites

147
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:54.430
from, you know, externally away from Saigon, back into site ground.

148
00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:01.270
And then there's a couple of other features that are a little more advanced here as far as domains.

149
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.850
Let's finish up by talking about domains.

150
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:12.820
Lastly, but because this is a shared website account, it does include email hosting, which can be

151
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.660
very convenient.

152
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.840
Of course, it's less expensive because email hosting we'll talk about in the email section of the course.

153
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:26.230
Email hosting does cost a couple dollars per email address per month, but there are great advantages

154
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.760
to it, and it is a best practice to host email separately from your website.

155
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.300
However, if you're just starting out and you are deciding to use shared.

156
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:41.560
Hosting, you can set up emails and email accounts for send and receive email through the site ground

157
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.910
tools right here.

158
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.850
And so you could set up emails, for example.

159
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.780
I have a couple of email addresses set up for this business.

160
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:56.470
And you could say you could see that I have current usage drafts and the quota defined for each of those

161
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.460
email addresses.

162
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:04.510
And this is the potential problem for hosting email alongside your website if email fills up above its

163
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.110
quota.

164
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:11.800
It's possible that the website could go down because it's using all of its resources, and so it's a

165
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.500
best practice to host email outside of your website.

166
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:19.780
But the way you can kind of prevent that from happening is to use a forwarder.

167
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:27.820
And what I have right now is that the website emails at this domain name they signed are forwarded to

168
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:33.220
a separate email address that the user is able to check and use.

169
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:39.910
And so that's just an easy way, as a beginner to set up emails and to start in that way.

170
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.860
And then finally, let's talk about domains under domain names.

171
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:45.190
Oops.

172
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:51.850
Let me open that back up under domain names, parked domains or just domains that don't have a website

173
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:52.300
on them.

174
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:58.840
There are subdomains, redirects you can you can have a domain name registered in site ground and redirect

175
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.040
it to a second domain.

176
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:06.160
As if I had say, I had fail dot net as well, and I wanted to just have that redirect straight to Bill

177
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.000
Sinochem.

178
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.420
If anybody browse to that website address, I could use a redirect.

179
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:15.490
But then the DNS Zone editor, I'll just briefly show you the system I have here.

180
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:21.640
It does tell me that this is not hosted by us at site ground, which isn't exactly true.

181
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:30.040
Really, the truth is that the DNS records are not managed here because at the domain registrar and

182
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:38.350
the domain DNS provider, which I have at Cloudflare, I have the the traffic that goes to Vail, Sinochem

183
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:44.950
going to Cloudflare and getting all the benefits of that, that DNS provider that Cloudflare gives and

184
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.470
I will go about that will go over that later in the course.

185
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:54.510
And then I point traffic through Cloudflare over to this website right here.

186
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.600
So the name servers at that domain name are pointed to Cloudflare.

187
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.820
So all traffic goes through Cloudflare.

188
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:06.130
And then Cloudflare can then decide, well, you know, website traffic goes here to site ground.

189
00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:16.630
And so I have an I have an IP address right here that the website traffic needs to use to go to this

190
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.180
site ground IP address.

191
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:25.030
And since this domain is registered to that IP address, I can then point traffic from Cloudflare straight

192
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.300
here.

193
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:33.160
It gives me the ability to point email traffic, for example, as in Emacs records or mail exchanger

194
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.070
records to a different server, if I want to.

195
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:44.260
And so right now, I still have these Emacs records at Cloudflare pointed to the the site ground records.

196
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:51.010
So I have at this point email hosted at this shared server, but I'm still taking advantage of Cloudflare.

197
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:59.290
And so that's a tour of the, you know, the site ground site tools for any web site that you have.

198
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.480
If you only have one website and maybe you're using the startup plan, then you only have one of these.

199
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:12.610
But if you have the the Groberg or the Go Geek plan and you can take advantage of having a site tools

200
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.390
area for each one of the web sites that you're hosting there.
