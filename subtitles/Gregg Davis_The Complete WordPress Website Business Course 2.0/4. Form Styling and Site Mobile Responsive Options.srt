1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,850
In this lesson, we'll customize the look and feel of the contact form and test the outgoing notification

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,240
email.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,390
You'll customize the success message that shows after the form is submitted and also add a navigation

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,740
menu item to the contact page and explore the mobile responsive options.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,960
By the end of this video, you'll learn how to modify the style of a form through the plug in settings,

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,900
as well as explore mobile responsive styling with the browser developer tools and the WordPress site

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,290
editor.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:35,940
Now, later, in the course, we're going to talk about functionality like outgoing email systems sending

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,990
and receiving email.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,000
Transactional email like this would be, you know, when someone fills out this form, and then the

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,260
website automatically sends an outgoing email to the administrator.

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,810
That is a transactional email.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:55,230
And so we're not going to test that or set it up right now, but we'll do that later in the course.

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,520
But for now, let's go ahead and edit this, or it looks even just a little bit better.

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,630
One thing I'm noticing is that I have both labels and I have, you know, interior text here as well,

16
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,620
which really isn't needed.

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,790
It looks redundant to me.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,820
Maybe we can tighten up these form fields a little bit and then also maybe edit the color and look of

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:23,370
this submit button as well, so that what we're looking at matches our design in 2022 and our customizations

20
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,600
just a little bit more.

21
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:32,790
And so let's go back into the dashboard and I'm going to go back away from the contact page and into

22
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,780
the fluent forms.

23
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,060
This time, I'm going to go to all forms and let's take a look at the form.

24
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,500
So contact form, contact, what do we use?

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,060
We used form number three.

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,840
These two, the contact form demo in the subscription form.

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,350
We're already in the plug in by default.

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,140
I think this is the one that we were creating here.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,100
Let's just make sure we go and oops.

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,160
If I go to the page, you know, in the admin bar here, you can always click Edit Sight.

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,590
And actually, no, let me hit back.

32
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,170
It's not at its site, it's edit page.

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,200
And then that would go into the editing page for that.

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,710
So it's fluent for my ID equals three in the short code.

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,290
I just wanted to go in there in order to make sure I'm editing the right one.

36
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,620
And so if I go back again, let's just make sure this is no it says number three and the shortcut is

37
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,420
ID equals three.

38
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,490
So let's go to edit and the in the editor here.

39
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,220
There's a few different things.

40
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,110
This is for the form itself and for settings and integrations.

41
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,460
These are the form settings and the form layout gives us some options here.

42
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,560
Let's look, let's see the label alignment at the top.

43
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,600
You know?

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,270
We really maybe want to get rid of that label, so.

45
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:01,960
Hmm.

46
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,750
Let's see here what other options do we have?

47
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,450
OK, so if we go here?

48
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:16,500
The forms settings label alignment labels can be top left or right.

49
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,080
There's a help message.

50
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,090
There's an error message in case you know, you didn't fill out a required field or something and the

51
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,550
asterisk position, the asterisk labels the required elements.

52
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,420
And so let's just take a look at what this looks like.

53
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,150
You can hit back and look at that contact form.

54
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,100
So we've got the labels are above and the asterisk is to the right.

55
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,340
Sure.

56
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,980
Let's see how it message.

57
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:55,480
Wonder what happens if the label is to the left got back to the top, we can save settings.

58
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,710
Uh, yeah, that does look a little bit better, doesn't it?

59
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,050
These are for email subject and the message that it looks a little better.

60
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,930
It's tighten it up a little bit within this content area where the featured image is still.

61
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,650
There's little redundancy here.

62
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,140
That's something that we can.

63
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,470
That we can change these could also be to the right.

64
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,340
Let's check that out.

65
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,260
Just refresh the page that's justified to the right, I see.

66
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,110
So let's see.

67
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,900
Alignment alignment to the left looked the best, I think.

68
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,270
So just click save right there.

69
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,020
There's a few items that you'll see that are available only on the pro version of fluent forms, wherever

70
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,500
there's a mark here, say right here where it doesn't let you do it.

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,680
For example, a survey result, there's a pro version of version of fluent forms that we don't have

72
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,240
installed here in the sandbox.

73
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:15,180
But if we go back to you, ED, there might be some other options that we have here.

74
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:25,200
Input customization is where for the whichever label that we're whichever field, I should say that

75
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,230
we're editing, you can have some different input customization settings over here.

76
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:38,370
So for first name, last name, the name fields, we can have the label placement be hide the label.

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,110
That's what I was looking for before.

78
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,290
If we save that, let's just take a look at what that did.

79
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,630
I like that because it shows first name, last name inside the field.

80
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,850
Is that what we want?

81
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,200
Not sure.

82
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,660
Let's take a look at what other options we have there.

83
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,990
There's a field field label, whatever it is, there's advanced options.

84
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,760
It's the name attribute.

85
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,350
This is for submitting the form data.

86
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,430
So you really probably don't need to go to advanced options, but in the name fields.

87
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,800
So for first name, there's a label and then there's a placeholder.

88
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,810
And so you wonder what would look best.

89
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:27,470
I did like the look of having the label there, but then having no placeholder, potentially inside

90
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,810
the first and last name.

91
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,550
So let's do that.

92
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,980
Let's let's leave the label.

93
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,520
Let's take away the placeholder instead of hide label.

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,400
We'll say default and save form.

95
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,000
We're just editing the first and last name fields for now.

96
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,570
So let's see what that looks like.

97
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,640
First name, last name, email, subject and your message that looks like a nice form.

98
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,280
This is something that you can play around with, too.

99
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:03,630
So again, for the email address, the input customization, we have a label, but.

100
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,210
Let's see.

101
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,820
The placeholder.

102
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,230
Let's leave it, leave it blank, since we're using the label anyway.

103
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:21,260
This is required and this validates meaning if their email address is typed wrong and it's not an e-mail

104
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:27,410
address or has a space or something, it'll tell the person so we could save that you must do the same

105
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,210
for the subject, meaning we place the label by default.

106
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,390
But then let's take the field label or no?

107
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,960
Excuse me.

108
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,190
And do that, the placeholder.

109
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,880
We'll get rid of.

110
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,220
Say that and in the message, the same no placeholder in here.

111
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:55,990
So.

112
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,700
Select your message and hit back.

113
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,570
And then, of course, the size of the field here, we could have it be just a little bit smaller if

114
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,870
we want to to bring this button up a little, that might look nice.

115
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,500
So instead of four rows, we could bring it to three brings it up just a little bit.

116
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,450
Click Save Form and then the submit button.

117
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,460
Let's see.

118
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,700
Submit form, I think I'll just say.

119
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:41,870
Submit, or sometimes like to use the word send, and you could use the the default button or an image

120
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,390
if you had if you had an image URL, if you wanted to create a button.

121
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,320
Let's see.

122
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,030
There's some different button styles.

123
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,740
You could have different colors.

124
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,790
You know, a gray button is a little bit more matching.

125
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,930
I like the medium sized button.

126
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,790
And what do you think?

127
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,020
Do we want it to be centered or over on the left?

128
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,730
I do like it over on the left there since we have our two column layout.

129
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,590
And so it'll say it'll say send.

130
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,820
It'll be in the gray color medium to the left.

131
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,770
Let's save the form.

132
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,660
Now let's refresh and take a look.

133
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,520
Yeah, that match is just a little bit more first name, last name, email subject.

134
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,170
And your message now in the sandbox?

135
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,580
I do have outgoing email enabled, so this is a working form.

136
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,480
I'll talk about this a little bit later, but let's see.

137
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,910
Put my email in there.

138
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,760
Test message and then say hello and click Send.

139
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,710
This should show me a message.

140
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,060
Thanks for your message.

141
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,740
We'll get in touch with you shortly.

142
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,820
Now that message is editable, too, and also that form has disappeared, showing that we've already

143
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,510
submitted it.

144
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:08,600
And so, you know, you can go to settings and integrations and then thank you for your message.

145
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,950
We'll get in touch with you shortly without a period I might.

146
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,000
Just, you know.

147
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,450
Thanks.

148
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,510
Thank you.

149
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,420
Mary, thanks for your message.

150
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,040
With an exclamation point.

151
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,240
Sounds good to me.

152
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:29,020
You put anything you like there or like I said, send them to a page or even to an off site custom URL.

153
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,780
So refresh the page.

154
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,440
What will happen?

155
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,920
Show me the form again and looking great.

156
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:44,110
The last thing would be to add the navigation to this contact page into the header navigation.

157
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,060
Let's see if you can do that without messing up the layout and see if I can do it, and we'll do that

158
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,480
next.

159
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,420
Before we end this section of the course.

160
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,310
And so where would I do that?

161
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,350
That's an appearance editor.

162
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:05,180
Yeah, now if we go back into here, template parts and this header.

163
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,290
Go ahead and just go.

164
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,510
And now this this layout just messed up again, didn't it?

165
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,770
So we could see about fixing that later.

166
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:24,900
But if I wanted to add navigation that member, I would just put the plus sign and I could put the contact

167
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,270
in there as well and then click Save and save.

168
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,620
Let's see what happened.

169
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,160
All right, so it showed that, you know, a little bit different layout inside of the Block editor

170
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,270
here, but I'm happy to report that it did not mess up the layout.

171
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:47,010
So now we've got six different items in our in our header.

172
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,920
Now one thing is that this will convert into, you know, a few.

173
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,440
We just kind of drag this over to the left.

174
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,740
We can get the responsive design and see what it looks like past a certain point.

175
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:11,250
It turns into a little dropdown here where opening that up will show the mobile overlay menu instead

176
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,350
of the regular menu here.

177
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:20,340
At some point, you'll have to deal with that if you have too many items and it might overlap or not,

178
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:26,400
look quite right over here inside of the live website itself.

179
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:32,490
So to take a look at what your website would look like on different devices, you can just take your

180
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,810
edge of your browser and drag it back left and right.

181
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,220
Or you can use the dev tools by right clicking and clicking Inspect.

182
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,240
And now, you know, I've got the developer tools open on the right hand side here in the developer

183
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,750
tools.

184
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:55,080
You can change the settings so that they're docked at the bottom or or the side.

185
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:02,730
So here I've got the dock at the bottom, and so I'm looking at a full width inside of the recording

186
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,390
window here.

187
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,550
But one of the things that's great about the developer tools in Chrome or Firefox is you can open up

188
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:17,940
the device toolbar, which will let you drag the display window to, you know, different widths.

189
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:26,520
And so if I if I scroll up and look at the menu here as I drag this to a narrow and narrower and narrower

190
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:34,740
device like a, you know, iPad or tablet and vertical, as I get over closer to here, at some point

191
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,270
that menu is going to run into the the name of the site and you can see it drops down below.

192
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,470
That's not too bad.

193
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,160
It's usable.

194
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:49,170
But then at some breakpoint, this theme is set to change the menu from a menu that shows each item

195
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,790
over to a dropdown right here a toggle.

196
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,270
And so that opens up an overlay menu.

197
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,510
Then you can click the X and get out of it.

198
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,320
So even way down into this, whose phone is this narrow?

199
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,870
No one's well right here.

200
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,380
You would have an overlay menu and then you can click the X.

201
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:17,100
And so at this point, you know, if I was designing a website that was going to be a real life website,

202
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:25,440
I might limit the number of items I have in the navigation here or reduce the font size or the spacing

203
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,380
in some way so that I don't have the menu drop down below at some breakpoint.

204
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,300
That's just personal preference.

205
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,820
However, you'd like to do that, but one of the things about the dev tools is that it's great, is

206
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:37,930
it?

207
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:45,000
You can use this toggle the device toolbar so that you can look at different break points.

208
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,970
While you're designing a website, you can see what other parts of your website would look like as you

209
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,780
go down into mobile or tablet.

210
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,490
And so right down here, you can see that there's two column layout in 2020.

211
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:07,890
Two does go at some point from two columns into one column and stacks the information and the columns

212
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,400
instead.

213
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:15,870
So if somebody navigates to the website on a phone, for example, they'll have navigation here as an

214
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,450
overlay and then they can go down and it still looks great and is completely functional, including

215
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,690
the footer, the header and the content of the page.

216
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,580
No matter what size device they're using, so you can toggle that back off.

217
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:38,670
I do prefer to have my dev tools over on the right hand side, so I'm looking at the content over here

218
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,110
and I use it there, and then you can use the X to X out of it.

219
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,070
Great.
