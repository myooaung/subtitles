00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.730
In this lesson, we'll look at an independent hosting benchmark site and discuss how to evaluate hosts.

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.250
You'll see me explore the pricing pages for three different hosts and discuss what type of business

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.990
each is most suited for.

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.330
By the end of this video, you'll understand why it's difficult to find real reviews and information

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.060
about WordPress hosts among all the online noise and how to navigate through it to select the right

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.750
host for you.

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.530
Before we get into the different specific types of hosting and pricing and recommendations, I want

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.690
to go over the kind of problem in the WordPress hosting space.

9
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.910
And that is that there are reviews and affiliate relationships and referral relationships that have

10
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.630
money involved.

11
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:54.030
And therefore in our industry, it's kind of hard and confusing to find real information and truthful

12
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.150
information about WordPress website hosting.

13
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.860
And so here's the one of the places that I would recommend you go.

14
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:10.890
Review Signal Dot Com is a website that takes honest reviews and posts them, and also does WordPress

15
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.330
hosting benchmarks every single year to rate different hosts on a lot of different categories, especially

16
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.880
performance at different pricing levels.

17
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.780
And so just add review signal dot com.

18
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.350
There's a chart right here and over on the WordPress side, you can see that there's a different levels

19
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.880
of pricing, and there's just a kind of a quick and quick ratings area here where you can get an idea

20
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.710
of where the different companies fit in regarding not only reviews from real users, but also performance

21
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.350
and consistency and reliability.

22
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.180
And so if you look at WordPress hosting, you can actually just open up and see actual reviews for these

23
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.960
companies.

24
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.990
And they're not the only companies available, but here's lists of web hosting reviews for many, many,

25
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.430
many hosting companies.

26
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.780
And first, as you look at the type of WordPress hosting that you need, as you'll learn here in this

27
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.200
section of the course, you might then give yourself kind of a short list of, say, managed WordPress

28
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.190
hosts and then go and look at the reviews and make your own decisions as far as what's the best.

29
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.590
And so don't always trust reviews.

30
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.120
You fine on on random blogs or on Facebook and groups and things like that because they are often influenced

31
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.840
by potential income being an affiliate or a referral partner and, you know, getting paid for every

32
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.660
single person that clicks through and signs up for hosting.

33
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.260
And so you can also go over to WordPress hosting benchmarks.

34
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.810
This is where you can really go into detail as far as looking at the the performance benchmarks of different

35
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.170
WordPress hosts at different pricing levels.

36
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.470
And so I would really encourage you to go in and to go into different pricing levels.

37
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.590
For example, less than $25 per month per website.

38
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:20.610
And at this level and and up from there and look at what's recommended, what's the most recent information

39
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:29.670
about, you know, the different companies and read the written reviews about the tests that were done

40
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.460
and the reviews on even, you know, customer service and support.

41
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.740
And so review Signal and the WP hosting benchmarks dotcom website is a great place to start and understand

42
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.600
the methodology and the scope of the tests by clicking here and then looking at the yearly tests for

43
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.420
both, you know, WordPress in general for regular web sites that a lot of them can be served statically

44
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.280
and cached and then WooCommerce as well in 2020 and 2021.

45
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.970
There are some WooCommerce specific benchmarks and tests for e-commerce sites which need a little bit

46
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:17.760
more server power in order to, you know, serve them accurately and at high speed for the user.

47
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.570
And so the companies and products, you know, so I've clicked here at less than $25 a month, WordPress

48
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.520
hosting performance benchmarks.

49
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:35.370
You can go to the results here and look at, you know, might you just go straight down to the awards

50
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.150
at this level?

51
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.200
There's some top tier and an honorable mention.

52
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.510
And you can just kind of look at what hosts are right here.

53
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.500
And of course, this isn't all the hosts in the world.

54
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:58.320
These hosts have volunteered to submit the, you know, a free hosting account or a an equivalent hosting

55
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.910
account to these levels.

56
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.200
So that the people at WP hosting benchmarks can make their tests.

57
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.600
And so Kevin Ohashi is the person that started this, and he is it's been really over the last, I'd

58
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.940
say, five to up to 10 years.

59
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:23.680
He's been doing these tests and trying to offer a solution to the problem of, you know, the market

60
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.470
is kind of obfuscated and it's confusing to find real honest information about WordPress hosting.

61
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.690
And so he's offered this up.

62
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.230
You can really go into some detail about the different plans and the different types of hosting and

63
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.910
narrow it down for yourself.

64
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.320
But I'm going to move forward here with talking about three types of hosting.

65
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:54.550
I'll talk about shared hosting and site ground dotcom site Ground is a company that I've been recommending

66
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.860
for shared hosting for a long, long time.

67
00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:04.900
I've been using them for more than 10 years now as one of the hosting companies that I use for inexpensive

68
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.380
hosting.

69
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.100
And as we talk about pricing just a little bit before we go in that next few lessons into some detail

70
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.300
about each one.

71
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.770
If you look at the three pricing levels for sake around shared hosting here, here's where it kind of

72
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.770
can sneak up on people a little bit as far as you can see, you know, OK, save 75 percent.

73
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.560
That looks great, but that's not forever.

74
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.180
And it's not exactly clear here you know how long you get this discount for.

75
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:40.870
And so the real truth with with this is that, OK, here you can see that with start up, you get one

76
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:48.640
website and I wouldn't recommend startup except for maybe a practice or if you really are just going

77
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.160
to be hosting one website only.

78
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.180
It is the least expensive option out there for a host that's going to be quite powerful, have great

79
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.760
customer support and somewhere that you can rely on for shared hosting, that's inexpensive.

80
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.760
However, you can see that it's discounted from, you know, almost three times the cost fourteen ninety

81
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.790
nine per month, but you can pay three sixty nine.

82
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.230
And this is the key right here.

83
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:20.290
You can pay that amount for up to three years if you pay for each of those months in advance.

84
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.930
And so if you pay, what is it?

85
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:30.010
If it's 360 million a month times 12, it's $30, something like $40 for the entire year.

86
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:37.120
And if you can pay for that for up to three years, 120, 130 dollars or so, we'll get you three years

87
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.630
of hosting for one website at three sixty nine a month.

88
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.780
Now, at the end of that three year period, if you haven't migrated your site away to a different host,

89
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:53.290
which again is a whole section that we have in the course coming up about migrating sites between hosts,

90
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.160
it's not that hard to do.

91
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:01.630
But in any case, if you have migrated away you, it might come as a shock that your next payments will

92
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.850
be at the rate of 14 999 a month.

93
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.230
Now, it's still well worth that amount if you want to stay with site ground at that point.

94
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:16.630
Not a bad idea, but if you're going to be hosting anywhere from two sites to 10 and up and the grow

95
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:24.070
big and the go geek shared hosting plans are where I'd recommend Groberg is a great place to start.

96
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:32.980
It's you can get again up to three years at six 19 a month and then it will go to 20 499 a month.

97
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.830
And it's well worth doing.

98
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:42.460
But if we just take as a reference, you know, 20 gigabytes of space divided among all your web sites.

99
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:48.340
Now they say unlimited websites, but that's not really the case because you're going to start to run

100
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.270
out of storage space.

101
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:54.130
You may start to run out of monthly visits is something that they regulate.

102
00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:01.120
And so with shared hosting again, one of the least expensive ways to host, I mean, lower than $10

103
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:08.110
a month per website is a great goal, especially when you'll be selling websites and hosting a website

104
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:15.250
care for something like 25 or $50 a month per website or $100 a month per website like I do.

105
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:23.350
And and so, you know, $10 a month per over here for for your entire plan, you could probably fit

106
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.390
10 websites on this grow big plan.

107
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:32.020
No problem 20 websites on this go geek, but you're looking at 20 gigs of space and 40 gigs of space,

108
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.970
and then you're going to start to run into your upper limits above that many websites.

109
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:44.620
And that's where either going to manage WordPress host, where you can really get much more storage

110
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:52.510
and much more power for even less money per website if you're hosting more than 10 websites.

111
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:59.760
And so from there, like we've played with, I recommend Flywheel as a managed WordPress host now when?

112
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:05.340
You look at viewing the managed WordPress plans under managed hosting here.

113
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.800
If you pay annually and let's just look at paying monthly so that we're looking apples to apples.

114
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:18.840
You can get a single website for $15 a month at a managed and that's with five gigs storage that's per

115
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.850
website and a certain number of bandwidth and monthly visits.

116
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:29.790
But the tiny is a great place to start if you're going to be hosting a single web site.

117
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.190
I would recommend that over shared hosting.

118
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:38.700
If you're going to be hosting a single web site now, the starter has a little bit more power and it

119
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:44.970
also is for one WordPress site and you could see it gives you, you know, five times the monthly visits

120
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.530
ET double the storage.

121
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.410
This is something that you can upgrade to later without even having to migrate or move your website.

122
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:59.250
And so the plans here are really, you know, if you pay annually, you can see that you're paying a

123
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:08.280
little bit less per website there annually for a up to 10 websites plan brings each website down to

124
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.950
under $10 per month per website.

125
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:19.740
And that is a level that I would I can really support and stand behind for hosting client websites.

126
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:27.300
I've used this freelance plan for up to 10 client websites for years and years, and it's been really,

127
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.060
really awesome.

128
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.820
They just take care of everything for you.

129
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.850
As far as performance, security, customer service is excellent.

130
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.140
If you ever need help, they are WordPress experts.

131
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:43.140
But let's talk about self-managed WordPress hosting for a quick second, and then we'll go into each

132
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.850
one in a little bit more detail.

133
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.930
But if we look at Grid Ben, here's their home page.

134
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:56.610
And if you one thing about Groupon is they'll offer a two week free trial where you do have to put in

135
00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:03.270
a payment method, but you won't pay anything unless you keep your active account past the 14 day mark.

136
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.570
And I would recommend trying them out.

137
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:11.880
They have a couple different pricing levels if we look at pricing here.

138
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.790
The panel plan is something that I would recommend starting with.

139
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.060
Now I'm on the developer plan, which gives you a few more features that the panel plan doesn't include,

140
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.530
including the enhanced support.

141
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:36.060
And that's where you can have direct support tickets and the community, which is a great support channel

142
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:42.990
anyway, where people from Grid Pam, the server and system admins get in there and and help.

143
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:50.910
But this panel plan has a little bit less of a level of service, although it gives you so much power

144
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.930
as far as things that other plans don't include in their lower tiers.

145
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.400
We like with shared hosting Start Startup Plan is sacred and doesn't include staging.

146
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:07.980
There's a lot of benefits you get here for $50 a month, and if we talk pricing $50 a month here with

147
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:14.070
great pain lets you set up unlimited sites with their proprietary software stack, which I would call

148
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:20.340
the fastest or at least top three fastest software stacks available for WordPress.

149
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:25.980
And then you buy your own servers month to month at different levels.

150
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:32.100
And this is something we'll talk about in detail when we go into self-managed hosting and the section

151
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:39.720
that the lesson I should say that we're going to go into here, but the minimum I would recommend would

152
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:45.510
be a $20 a month, you know, four gigabytes of RAM memory server.

153
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:52.950
And so at the panel plan, looking at $50 a month plus a $20 a month server, you would be able to host

154
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.420
up to 40 sites.

155
00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:05.040
I would recommend 20 to 40 sites on a on a $20 server at the grid pain plan or with another self-managed

156
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.570
WordPress company.

157
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:18.120
And so at $70 hosting 40 websites per month, you know you're really looking at, you know, you're

158
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.370
looking at what, just a couple of dollars per site per month way under $10 a month.

159
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:32.490
And so with self hosting the I would really recommend for 10 sites or more that you go ahead and pull

160
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.710
the trigger on something like grid pain.

161
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:43.860
It's well worth the developer plan when you get over 10 sites, or especially up to 20 or 40 or 50 or

162
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.090
60, like I'm hosting.

163
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:52.890
As far as client sites now, I charge from $25 a month to $100 a month for each one of those web sites.

164
00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:59.220
And so I'm not technically paying for my grid paying account or for my servers, and I'll show you around

165
00:14:59.400 --> 00:14:59.610
my.

166
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:07.270
Gripping account here just a little bit and give you an idea, especially we'll go deeper into how to

167
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.470
set this up and how to work with it in the next few lessons.

168
00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:16.720
But you could see that I've got a few different servers that I run here.

169
00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.640
There are some different sizes.

170
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:26.650
I have a big, dedicated server for the student sandboxes and for my own sites with e-commerce, and

171
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:33.700
I have certain servers that I use for particular companies that have multiple websites that I host for

172
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.790
them, and I keep those sites separate from everyone else.

173
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:43.210
I have others that I load up, for instance, some of these these up to up cloud servers.

174
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:51.490
I place between 20 and 40 websites on each of those, and I can manage those for that low, low cost.

175
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.560
And so, you know, here's the idea.

176
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.200
You can just set up inside of grid.

177
00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.800
And I'll tell you around this in quick second here, you know, you can easily set up say, you know,

178
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.430
through digital ocean, I already have it connected.

179
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:11.380
I would just select, you know, here's my digital ocean connection and then I can look at the plans.

180
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.750
So they have a little warning here.

181
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.300
It's not recommended to use only one gigabyte of RAM.

182
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:21.910
I recommend starting with four gigabytes of RAM, which basically can cost you $20 a month.

183
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:30.160
And like I said, 20 to 40 websites on there and and have plenty of space to grow and have the fastest

184
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.000
front end and fastest loading websites for your clients.

185
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:39.340
And so it's super easy to spin up a website or a new server.

186
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:47.290
You know, if I look at if I look at sites here, if I wanted to add a new site, all I have to do is,

187
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:51.070
you know, have the site name here, select which of my servers.

188
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:51.820
I want to host it.

189
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.980
A few other selections.

190
00:16:53.980 --> 00:17:02.320
And then I can easily go ahead and create a new site in just a minute or two on that server.

191
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.140
And I'm set to go and grid pain.

192
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:11.260
Pain, as I mentioned, provides us with one of the best proprietary software stacks for WordPress,

193
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:19.630
which powers it super fast also gives you some really excellent services that you can use that you can't

194
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:25.030
get on companies like Flywheel WP Engine and can't control that.

195
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:31.120
It's really a matter of transparency being able to control your own servers and do with them anything

196
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:31.750
you want to.

197
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:39.940
As far as backups and even failover systems where, you know, as far as tools, here's my integrations.

198
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:48.670
You know, I set up my my vulture's server is connected, my, you know, I don't have A. or a connected,

199
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:54.040
but really all you do is you put in the API keys from those companies and you pay those companies separately,

200
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.790
even though you can connect and set them up easily with great pain.

201
00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.040
You know, I'm building from Vulture separately for my $24 high-frequency server.

202
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:10.900
I'm build from Up Cloud for a couple of $20 servers and a $40 server for one of my larger clients separately.

203
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:17.110
And then you set up DNS providers as well, and we'll connect all this together and explain it in different

204
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.790
sections of the course coming up.

205
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:27.220
But I have my Cloudflare integration here connected with with Groupon, as well as outgoing email.

206
00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:34.000
And so I have a SendGrid integration where every time, anytime I set up a new website, I can enable

207
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:42.280
the SendGrid provider and I just have a free SendGrid account where all of my outgoing email is is sent

208
00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:50.290
through a proprietary and managed IP address through SendGrid, which is a best practice not to send

209
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:56.130
your email through just the default WordPress website from your website server itself.

210
00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:01.840
Again, another place when we go into the three types of email chapter you'll learn a lot about.

211
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:08.980
And so that gives you a good idea of how you can set everything up with a self-managed server and still

212
00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.030
get the support you need.

213
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:16.000
You don't have to be a system administrator or know anything about code or about setting up servers

214
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.130
to have these systems work for you.

215
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:23.830
So next, let's get into each type of hosting in detail, and I'll show you the control panels and the

216
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.500
benefits and the disadvantages of each kind.
