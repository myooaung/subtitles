1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,940
In this lesson, we'll start exploring the 20 22 block based theme included in WordPress, which allows

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,110
for full site editing and creating site wide templates without using any code.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,960
We'll check out the site editor and template system and discover how the theme enables you to use content

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,070
blocks to control things like header and footer and other global elements.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,690
By the end of this video, you'll know where to start.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,770
As far as setting up the 2022 theme and how to get your own site set up to start building in this section

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,510
of the course, let's get to it.

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:37,680
So taking a look at this dashboard page, this welcome here it has a dismiss button up here at the top,

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,080
which is generally what you want to do after you've read that.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,500
But you can always get things back to your dashboard.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,290
Up here at the top right, you can use this little screen options dropdown and you can see if I click

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,740
the welcome checkbox that that welcome comes back.

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,560
And so once you dismiss it, it won't come back for you again, and you can control the way your dashboard

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,140
looks by checking or checking any of these screen elements in screen options here.

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:12,450
And so as we take a look at this, let's just go down and look under appearance themes and take a look

16
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,520
at what we have here.

17
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,730
We have the active theme showing at the top left always, and that's twenty twenty two and it'll show

18
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,840
customize if you have that theme activated.

19
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,450
Now the next theme over doesn't show customize.

20
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,200
It shows the Activate button and the theme details where you can open a modal window up at the top here

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,900
and get a little bit of information on the themes.

22
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,540
The theme that you have available inside of your WordPress installation and you can click Activate from

23
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,380
here as well.

24
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,170
You can also close the model over here at the right, and you can go to the next or previous using these

25
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,370
little arrow buttons.

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,630
And I'll just go ahead and use the X to close that.

27
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,790
And let's go to the next stage.

28
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,970
Now, if you hit this customize button that will open this editor and you see it's so new that it has

29
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,180
a little red mark here called beta, meaning that this is still being developed and actively worked

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,270
on by many, many volunteers in the WordPress ecosystem.

31
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:20,820
And it's really there's not as many active sites using this type of editor, which is a block based

32
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,210
theme.

33
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,490
But what are we going to do in this video?

34
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:31,620
And this section of the course is use the 20 22 theme to learn about block based editing, as well as

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,410
blocks within the WordPress editor.

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,030
And then let's go ahead and just take a look at what this 20 22 theme looks like out of the box.

37
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:51,900
Now this will be true of if you install WordPress as a fresh installation at any host, you will see

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,320
that it'll install 20 22 theme and activate it, and it'll just be a blank website.

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,970
Looking like this, I'll roll over my sites and under the name of the site, you can click visit site

40
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,160
or at the top in the admin bar here.

41
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,530
There's also the name of the site and the visit site link, so I'll right click that and open into the

42
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,160
new tab.

43
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,430
And when I click that new tab, you can see that here's a live site and it is pretty basic.

44
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,340
The way WordPress comes out of the box by default is generally, it'll show you a home page, which

45
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,940
shows the blog posts that are present within the WordPress installation or the website.

46
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:41,700
And WordPress comes with one sample blog post called Helloworld and just has some welcome text blog

47
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,120
posts or generally, you know, displayed in reverse chronological order.

48
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,890
So you'll usually see a date, a title sometimes and author categories or tags marking and categorizing

49
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,240
those blog posts.

50
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:05,190
And so you'll see the homepage of the 2022 theme has a nice little graphic, and it has a header at

51
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,820
the top with the name which is clickable to the home page, as well as a menu that goes to the pages.

52
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,260
Now a post.

53
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,480
Like I said, if I click the title of the post, we can see that now the header has changed a little

54
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:18,720
bit.

55
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,960
It's now a white background instead of that dark black.

56
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:29,670
It has the same menu and the name of the site over here on the top left at which clicks back to the

57
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,860
homepage and then you have a title.

58
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,890
You know, there's a little dividing line and some more content that we didn't see on the home page

59
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,740
because that was kind of an excerpt of each blog post.

60
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:48,090
Now, below the content of the blog post, you can see the date, the author and the category of this

61
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,750
blog post.

62
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:54,580
And there's another little dividing line and there's a comment that comes shipping with WordPress.

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,790
This is a comment, and it shows you a little icon, which.

64
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:06,820
Presents, if the person has a gravitas or their email address is associated at gravitas with their

65
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,530
headshot, it might show here.

66
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,270
And then there's a little reply button when you're logged in and then leave a reply.

67
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,760
This is a comments form, and so it's got the comments form here.

68
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:25,420
I'm already logged in, so it tells me, you know, that I'm replying as this person and the post comments

69
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,100
button now at the bottom of the website, there's also a footer.

70
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,930
This is present on the whole website, again out of the box.

71
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,540
This comes with a link back to the homepage and then a message that that links to the WordPress dot

72
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,870
org project, open source WordPress or otherwise known as self-hosted WordPress, which we're working

73
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,090
with through this entire course.

74
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,160
And so let me go back up, and let's talk about the difference between a post and a page.

75
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,560
Just briefly, a page is more of a static content page within the website.

76
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,890
Generally, things like the About Page, a contact us page for a business website.

77
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:13,780
You might have a projects or services page a and other general static content pages that stay the same

78
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,310
all the time, unlike posts.

79
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,230
And so in the WordPress environment, you've got posts and you've got pages you can see on this sample

80
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,650
page.

81
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,780
There's a few different things in here.

82
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,540
It's got a little description that comes by default.

83
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,020
And then again, the footer shows the same way.

84
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:36,130
Also that same header up at the top here, and we're going to be talking about headers and footers and

85
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:41,750
other global elements in WordPress that are site wide, staying the same.

86
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,010
So if I edit the header, for example, that header will change on every page of the website, so I'll

87
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,510
click back to home.

88
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,810
And really, that's that's all we have in a default installation with the 20 22 theme.

89
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,600
And so let's go back to the dashboard.

90
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:08,200
I often like to have, you know, a dashboard open under one tab in my browser and the live site open

91
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,730
in a second tab so I can go back and forth and refresh the page as I make changes.

92
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:21,520
But if I go back here into the WordPress dashboard under appearance now I can click ED.

93
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:30,310
And this is what's unique and new about a block based theme like Twenty Twenty Two, and that is when

94
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,940
you click editor, you are editing the entire site.

95
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:40,600
You're not you're not editing the content of any post or of any page, but you are editing the global

96
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,840
elements or what are called templates and template parts that make up the different parts of the website

97
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,150
and the power of a block based theme.

98
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:55,780
Is that now, without rewriting or copying and pasting any code at all, you can control all the parts

99
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:02,740
of the website using a block based theme, including the header content and the footer content.

100
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:10,240
And with this system, you can have a certain type of header like a black background header on one page

101
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,320
and on a different page.

102
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,020
You can have a white background header like all the other sample page, etc. on this website.

103
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,590
And so let's take a look at the controls we have here.

104
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,950
First up, at the top left, if I hit the WordPress logo up here, it toggles the navigation.

105
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,930
And so this is some navigation for editing, the different things that I can edit.

106
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,800
And then this is the content area showing you a sample page in this case, the home page and what that

107
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,610
looks like.

108
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:46,390
And as I roll over the different parts of this homepage, you can see that it gets a little highlighting

109
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,040
an outline in blue.

110
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:55,720
And so if I if I I, you can see that site is highlighted right here for this site.

111
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,780
So this is in this site.

112
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,630
I'm looking at the home template up here.

113
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,380
This is the show template details dropdown.

114
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,830
So if I click that little arrow, it tells me the title of the template that I'm looking at and it tells

115
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,510
me what areas are contained within this template that we can change.

116
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,300
And so this is the header you can see it highlighting.

117
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:26,080
And if I scroll down here, you could see that if I roll over this, this is the footer right here.

118
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,350
And then there's some other stuff in the middle here.

119
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,050
This is just an example of a blog post.

120
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,180
Now, we wouldn't edit the content of a blog post within the site editor right here.

121
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,810
We would edit that within the post editing page itself.

122
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:48,640
And so you may have noticed in SEO, browse all templates better that exist on this website and within

123
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,300
this theme.

124
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,510
And that's the same as clicking over here, where it says templates.

125
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:59,290
And so if I click browse all templates there can see that the templates is highlighted with in the.

126
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,830
Navigation panel over here on the left hand side, and you could see that the templates that exist in

127
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,810
this theme and in this website are right here and it says added by.

128
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,540
And this is the theme title 20 22.

129
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:19,200
And so you'll have all the themes by default or excuse me, all the templates by default listed here.

130
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,040
And you can see that they're added by the theme.

131
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,980
And that's the beauty of block based themes.

132
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:33,750
A theme author or developer can create any number of templates that then the user can use to customize

133
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,290
and make their website unique from all others.

134
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:44,070
And we're going to go ahead and move forward with customizing this, this theme and this website using

135
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,240
the 2022 theme.

136
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,260
You can also see that there's an add new button up over here on the right.

137
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,050
And if we get when we get to the point where we're going to create a new template for a certain purpose,

138
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:04,860
like maybe we have an event, for example, or we have say, you know, something that that the business

139
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:12,030
is going to have in their business that needs its own special web page set apart from the other parts

140
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,860
of the website and looks different.

141
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,760
And so you can click Add New to add a new template.

142
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:27,480
And then so if we add a new template, this will be used as the kind of sample to start from as the

143
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,910
starting starting point there.

144
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:35,250
So when you do this, this is this says front page, and then you would save it here.

145
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:41,430
Once you build the template for that type of page, then once you create pages, you can choose that

146
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,190
template and display them however you like.

147
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:51,270
We'll get into this later, so I'm going to go ahead and click the W to go back to the Navigator and

148
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:57,150
then all the way back to the WordPress dashboard by clicking that little dashboard with the left arrow.

149
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:05,790
And so remember that was under appearance ED, and that is a good start, a tour of how block based

150
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,080
themes work.

151
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:15,600
And so next, we're going to get into how we're going to customize the 20 22 theme, and we have a sample

152
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,830
design to go from and we're going to make it look like the sample.

153
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,360
And so let's get into it.

154
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,170
See you then.
