1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,000
In this lesson, we'll check out some advanced design elements in cadence, including controlling gutter

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,190
width between images in a gallery.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,280
You'll learn about image overlays and setting a tiled repeating image underneath another element.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,370
By the end of this video, you'll get more experience working with the list view using layers of content

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,010
and creating more complex layouts with cadence.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,920
Now, let's check out the about page.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:33,000
There's another really cool effect that comes in with this design, which is this background image that

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,070
is kind of a looks like a topographical map behind, you know, the featured agents or that behind this

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,260
gallery where all the images are touching.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,250
And I want to show you how that was done with a few features to point out within the cadence, blocks

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,180
and cadence theme.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,620
So if we look at the about page, I went to all pages and then clicked about if we if we look here,

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,920
let's go ahead again and open up the list view and just take a look at what this is here.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,470
If I click anywhere in here, it shows me where I am.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
There's a row layout here that has a background on it.

16
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,050
And actually, no, it's the section that has the background.

17
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:22,530
I believe now it's the row, there's the row layout and it actually is a background overlay.

18
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:23,880
There we go.

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,160
You could see that it has an image here that matches those, those topographical lines.

20
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:39,060
And I just wanted to show you that this this is a tile lable image, and it's also kind of brighter,

21
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,990
you know, darker black here, too, so that you might imagine that the overlay opacity is, you know,

22
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,430
a certain darkness.

23
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,880
And so if I were to just go ahead in here, let me let me close the set so we can see it a little bit

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,180
better.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,440
Close the ListView.

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,690
But if we look and a couple of things I wanted to show you, you can find, you know, repeatable images

27
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,570
all over the web, ones that you can buy from stock libraries or you can find for free that you can

28
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,720
use as very, very fast loading small backgrounds.

29
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,430
And it's a really interesting effect to wear this one.

30
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,710
You know, if I change the opacity, I can bring that a lot brighter.

31
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,770
And of course, that doesn't look quite as good if we bring this back down to a three where it was.

32
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,700
It's a nice, dim gray, but it has this kind of neat lines.

33
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:41,730
Now this image, if we look at that image in the media library, go down here and and choose it.

34
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:49,080
It's, you know, it's a thousand pixels, but the screen with over here that I have is more than a

35
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,040
thousand pixels.

36
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,350
And can you find by looking where the repeat is, a lot of times it's hard.

37
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,910
But looking at this right now, I can see that right here, there's this oval.

38
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,050
And then the other edge you have just to the left of that oval is just right here.

39
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,030
So that's that thousand pixel mark.

40
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,910
And then it repeats, but it's a seamless repeating square image that you can find.

41
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,470
A lot of them are very small.

42
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:22,860
Maybe only, you know, 20 pixels or 100 pixels, depending on what the images that you're looking at.

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,590
But let's close the media library again.

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,660
I just want to show you that repeated image and the opacity is controlled because that's set as an overlay

45
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,300
on this section right here.

46
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,290
Excuse me, it's set on the row, not on this section, because that section that sits within there

47
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,510
is what's holding this advanced heading and advanced gallery.

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,900
The gallery is set with a gutter width of zero.

49
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:59,160
So the pictures are touching, et cetera, and the section itself has both a title.

50
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,750
You know, two headings, actually.

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,790
And then a gallery.

52
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,800
And so the row layout, I would expect this to have only one column.

53
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:15,180
So you can see how, you know, depending on how you have it designed, this has a 90 pixel padding

54
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,330
at the top and a 90 pixel margin at the top.

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:25,440
And so that arranges kind of what these two headings do this one right here and that one as far as where

56
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,300
they are on this background image, which is really, really cool.

57
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,890
So that is very cool.

58
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,120
And while we're here, let's just take a look at the design library.

59
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:42,930
If you remember, I talked about how you know when we open up here before I talked about block patterns.

60
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:49,860
Now here, when we're looking under what blocks you could add, there's a bunch of cadence blocks that

61
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,860
I talked about when we were looking at the plug in itself.

62
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,390
And so these are some of them.

63
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,580
You would click any of these to bring it into the website, but block patterns.

64
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,030
Aren't taken advantage of in cadence in the same way they are in 2022.

65
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,690
And so these block patterns don't come with the theme.

66
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,620
These are block patterns that are being just pulled in from WordPress.org and, you know, available.

67
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,120
They are just available block patterns.

68
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,380
These are featured ones.

69
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:24,760
There's buttons, you know, but none of these necessarily match the page layout that cadence has brought

70
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,150
in here.

71
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:32,740
So generally, when you're working with cadence, I wouldn't generally use these patterns unless you

72
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,830
kind of know what you're looking for and and you do find something that matches unless you're building

73
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,880
something from scratch.

74
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:48,040
But instead, what I would suggest is that you use this cadence design library button right up here.

75
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:54,280
So if you open the design library, this is a very powerful modal window and you can start to even just

76
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,990
imagine and see what these kinds of things are.

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,030
These are full sections.

78
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:08,500
These ones are called sections, and you can look at them, you know, either larger or smaller, you

79
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,340
know, and you can see what they all are in here.

80
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,250
So, you know, you can bring in these four sections.

81
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,460
These are built for cadence themes.

82
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,710
Some of them might match, you know, the starter template a little bit worse or a little bit better.

83
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,610
And also, some of them are only available with the Pro Licence.

84
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:34,060
And so they're using that a little bit to get you to upgrade if you would want some of these extra ones,

85
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,190
but most of them are available for free.

86
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:43,270
And then secondly, there is, you know, another starter packs area here.

87
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:50,770
This is another place where if you're editing a page, you can bring in a, you know, a full page from

88
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,930
one of these starter packs right into a page when you have it open.

89
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,630
In fact, here's the real estate page that we're working on right now.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,190
You know, if you click that, it will just bring a page right into the website.

91
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,880
And then finally, I wanted to show you this wireframe.

92
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,570
Oh, they want you to subscribe.

93
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,460
In order to access the wire frame layouts, that's fine.

94
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,470
I'm already subscribed with another email address, but if you go ahead and enter your email address

95
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,670
and share it with cadence, you know they really don't send you that much email, honestly.

96
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:36,730
So you'll see that this is a really great way to kind of, well, prototype a design that doesn't have

97
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,980
the distraction of kind of a brand with photos or colors.

98
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:50,590
These are wireframe, you know, available wireframes that you can bring in to a page in order to design

99
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,520
from scratch.

100
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:59,530
And so if your design process is more like, you know, you're bringing, you're looking at potentially

101
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:08,650
designing within a user interface or user experience design program like Figma or Adobe XD or something

102
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,310
like that.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,630
And then what you want is to just design the functionality and the layout of the website without the

104
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,970
distractions of images or anything like that.

105
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,730
You can use these wireframe layouts.

106
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,800
That is not really the way I work, but a lot of designers prefer to work this way.

107
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,940
It gives them kind of a better idea of what the how the website will function as far as user experience,

108
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:41,530
instead of how the website will look as far as colors and imagery and backgrounds.

109
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,130
And so those wireframes are really awesome.

110
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,120
You can see you can you can look at them all or you can, you know, look at certain ones.

111
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,530
There's a promotional sale, there's these image cards or cards that have different content on them.

112
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,230
Portfolio wireframes.

113
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:07,900
Here's a countdown numbers you can use what a form might look like without any distracting colors.

114
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,500
They just use these blues and grays and whites.

115
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,080
And so that's in the wireframe area.

116
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:20,050
It's a great thing that cadence offers as far as bringing in new things.

117
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,610
And so the last thing is that this right here is a quite a nice image gallery.

118
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,300
Let's see.

119
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,380
What are we looking at down here?

120
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,940
An advanced gallery?

121
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,210
Yeah.

122
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,640
So the the on the about page as we scroll down here, just like these images are laid out in a certain

123
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,530
way with no gutter down here, these images kind of look like part of the footer.

124
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,810
It's a good way to have a row of images, potentially, and you can even have it be scrolling across

125
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,200
as a slider if you want to in the advanced gallery.

126
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,560
And you can see that over here.

127
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:59,560
If there's all these different settings for mobile responsiveness to, you have specific.

128
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,160
Control about how many columns for this screen size, say, four columns, four columns, and then when

129
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:13,180
it gets down below 992, which is tablet size, it goes to three columns and then below this size it

130
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,620
goes to two and two.

131
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,410
And the gutter width is zero.

132
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:24,540
You can see it change as I make the slider in terms of the pixel number, but that's a great way to

133
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,710
a great thing to know as far as controlling how an image gallery looks like that.

134
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,780
And so I didn't make any changes here.

135
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,950
So when I get out, I can just click leave instead of saving my changes.

136
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,640
And that's another set of design examples about how we can work with cadence.

137
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,670
You can see that it's so super powerful as far as all the functionality and specific design options

138
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:54,400
that it gives you on top of what WordPress, the Block editor and Guttenberg gives you.
