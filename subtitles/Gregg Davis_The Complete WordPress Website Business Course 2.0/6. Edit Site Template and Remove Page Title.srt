1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,880
In this lesson, we'll recreate the event page from the twenty twenty two theme sample site using a

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,600
block pattern.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:14,010
You'll see how sometimes editing an existing site template is a way to customize a page or a page type

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,570
by the end of this video.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:22,170
You'll see how I brainstormed a solution and solve the problem of removing the page title by editing

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,780
an existing site template included in the theme.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,500
Next, here's our event page, as it looks right now, no content in there.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:38,410
So if I open the dashboard and go pages, all pages open this event page here.

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,910
That's where we'll start.

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,980
Now let's look at the demo sites as far as the event page.

11
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:57,220
I'll bet you I can find a block pattern that has this two column layout with a title, and that page

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,200
is event with the URL.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,220
So let's see if we can find that.

14
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:03,760
Let's see.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,950
I'll just hit add.

16
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,490
Let's look at patterns.

17
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,610
Let's look at explore and see if it pops out at us.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,660
There's that pick, but it's a different pattern.

19
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,010
I see it's not one of the featured patterns.

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,410
Then maybe it's a page.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,650
There's that pick again, but it's a different one.

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,610
It's got black on the right hand side.

23
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,260
There it is.

24
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,260
All right.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,930
Poster with right sidebar.

26
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,180
So I'm going to click that.

27
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,880
That brings it in under event and great.

28
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,480
OK, now let's go ahead and click Update and see what we have.

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,650
So here.

30
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,680
All right, now, here's a little bit different.

31
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:55,400
The difference here is that this is showing the page title with a dividing line, which is kind of default

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,960
for the page itself.

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,120
So what I want is to not show that right there.

34
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,910
Let's see what we can figure out about that.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,600
So on this page here.

36
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:16,880
Under the Settings panel, on the right hand side, the default template may be blank or maybe page

37
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,470
with no separators.

38
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,020
Let's see.

39
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,050
Let's just do a test.

40
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,530
First of all, we'll just see what happens there.

41
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:35,330
OK, so that took out the separator, but I still have the page title here if I hit page with no separators.

42
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:46,490
And that's that's going to be closer it just as event under event here, but the header looks correct,

43
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:46,760
right?

44
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,200
Yeah, that's the.

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,040
The same header with the menu, OK?

46
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,460
And we want to get rid of the page title.

47
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:03,860
And so let's see if there's any templates in the site editor that we can look at.

48
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,320
Open up this navigator, let's see.

49
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,310
Yeah, I really want to make myself a new template.

50
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,280
It's allow me to add a new template, but only a front page template, not a different kind of template.

51
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,730
You know, I could commandeer this one right here.

52
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,500
What if I commandeered the page?

53
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,560
No separators template and I just edited it.

54
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:37,350
You know, I could do is just instead of no separators, I could make a page template for myself called

55
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,890
Page.

56
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,510
No title.

57
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,970
And so what I can do is just remove the post title.

58
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,110
Save this template.

59
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:58,560
Templates not being used anywhere yet, but if I go back to the dashboard and I go to the pages now,

60
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,170
I can only know it's the event page.

61
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,490
If I go to the event page.

62
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:15,680
I can go and choose Page No title, OK, because that's I was using the no separator one before.

63
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,560
And so let's update that.

64
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,800
And see what we have.

65
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,210
Refresh.

66
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,230
There we go.

67
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,910
That worked, OK.

68
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,840
So took a little bit of discovery to figure that out.

69
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,150
But that's what you have to do in WordPress.

70
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,580
Sometimes there's there's multiple ways to do things.

71
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:42,260
Another thing I was going to do was go in here and just remove the title and save the page.

72
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:51,470
Now that's not ideal because then when you look at your your pages here, it would show no title right

73
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:51,740
here.

74
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,230
I've done it before, but it's not ideal.

75
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,730
So now I'm using a particular page template called no title.

76
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,380
That's great.

77
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:00,680
All right.

78
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,030
Let's check again, event.

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,910
Page no title.

80
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,710
Great.

81
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,820
I just kind of commandeered that, so I no longer have a page.

82
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,740
No separator.

83
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,380
And that's OK.

84
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,240
I don't need to necessarily use that template right now, but that made it match.

85
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:22,720
OK?

86
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,920
No page title in there.

87
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,330
That was a great solution.

88
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:32,530
And after a little bit more experimentation, I did find a different solution where I don't have to

89
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,930
commandeer another site template.

90
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:43,030
So if we go back to event right here, if you ever get this attempted attempt to block recovery, you

91
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,040
can go ahead and just click to recover.

92
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,660
The block usually comes right back.

93
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:53,710
But on the page settings, let's just go back to the default template for now, and I'm going to show

94
00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:01,450
you how you can create your own template and customize it completely and then use that in any page or

95
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:01,960
post.

96
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,650
And so if I refresh the page on this event, now you you can see I have the page title and the separator

97
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,430
back again.

98
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,320
Page content is the same.

99
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:22,240
Because I'm using the default template now, and so let me go back into this event page and very small

100
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,500
little button right here under the page settings, whichever template you have selected just under if

101
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,270
there's an edit button and a new button.

102
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,660
So now if I click new, this gives me a modal window where I can actually create a custom template from

103
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,380
scratch.

104
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:49,050
And so what I'm going to do is select page and I'll call it no title, just with no parentheses.

105
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,860
Just to differentiate it and click Create, and now it gives me a little welcome message, welcome to

106
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,990
the template editor.

107
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:05,760
You just click Get Started Now is actually showing me the event page, but I'm within the template editor

108
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:13,320
here, so it's showing me the event page content, but I'm editing the actual template called Page No

109
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,890
title.

110
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,780
And you can see some differences too.

111
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,250
Here it's it's showing a different header than the default header.

112
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,970
And it's also not showing a footer at all.

113
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:34,980
And so I'm just going to click Update just to simplify and get out of this event page and go back into

114
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,260
the actual template editor.

115
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:44,340
So if I go back to appearance editor now I'm going to open up that actual.

116
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:53,980
Template that I created, and you can see that now it shows that it's added by me, it's not added by

117
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,410
the theme itself.

118
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:03,670
And so one thing I could do is I could revert this back when it has a blue dot here like you saw, it

119
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,120
shows that it has been customized.

120
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,060
So if I clear customizations now, that template is back to being page no separators.

121
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,410
And that default template that comes with the theme is now available to use the way the theme has designed

122
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:20,560
it.

123
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,660
And so that's been saved there.

124
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,880
But Page No title is a new one.

125
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,090
And you can see what it has is post title and post content.

126
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,650
And then there's just a header here.

127
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:42,040
So what I'm going to do is go into the plus button here to add a pattern and I'm going to look for a

128
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,130
header and then the default header is right here.

129
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,470
So if I just click default header, that adds that block pattern in and you could see it added below

130
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,690
the existing content.

131
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,070
So really, all I have to do is move it up with this little button and I can move it up again.

132
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,450
And now really, I can just delete this content up here.

133
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:09,070
This is the old header that came as I selected the new page template, so I'm just going to say Remove

134
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,340
Group, and there's also a little line up here a separator.

135
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,570
So let me open the list view.

136
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,340
You can see the separator is here, so I'll just use those three dots and click Remove Separator.

137
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,110
Now I'm looking pretty good.

138
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,410
I've got that the default header, I've got post title post content and you know, I want to remove

139
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,090
the post title.

140
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,400
And so let's see.

141
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,560
I don't want to remove the entire group.

142
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,800
The Post content is also within that group.

143
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,080
So really, I could just click post title here.

144
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,210
I could use either over here, I could remove the Post title, or you can actually click the three dots

145
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,770
over in the list view as well.

146
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,170
And so now I'm looking pretty good.

147
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,300
I'm showing just the post content, not the post title, but I still don't have a footer.

148
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,940
And so let's add a footer.

149
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:02,440
I'll go to block patterns again and choose footers that are provided by the theme and I can see default

150
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,580
footer right here.

151
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,200
That's what it's going to be.

152
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,300
So now I can just click Save.

153
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,120
And yes, I'm going to save this template.

154
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:19,270
And if I go back, you know, to pages all pages and click event and then display, I can show it.

155
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,490
But here I have it open in another tab.

156
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:27,790
So if I just refresh the page, here we go now I'm a lot closer, so the footer looks good as far as

157
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,660
spacing goes.

158
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:35,800
But you can tell that I need a separator here at the top to make it look like the default template on

159
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,700
every other page.

160
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,340
So I'm not going to edit the event page.

161
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,590
I'm going to go back into the editor again.

162
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:49,090
I'm going to edit my page template by clicking the Navigation Open Clicking Templates page no title

163
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,850
and now above the header.

164
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,290
I want to insert a spacer up there.

165
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:06,100
So really, I guess what I'll do is select this group and I'll click Plus, and I just want to put I

166
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,760
could find it by searching down the list or just start typing spacer and do spacer.

167
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,240
And there's my spacer, but let's move it up and move it up.

168
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,030
And now it's above the header itself.

169
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,150
And so I'll save this template again, and let's take a look.

170
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,980
Oh, you know what?

171
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,230
Let's just make sure.

172
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:38,880
That my event page, this might have been the problem with the space or under event, I didn't click.

173
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:47,390
The new page, open page, no title, it is selected because I had created it from this button new,

174
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,600
so that was correct.

175
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,030
OK.

176
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,190
Just because I recovered that block, I'm going to click Update.

177
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,610
Let's go back here and click Refresh.

178
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,500
Now I'm looking better.

179
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,340
You know, I've got the looks a little different though, doesn't it?

180
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,180
Let's look.

181
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,470
Let's look at the event page.

182
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,750
And so I've got the menu is even with the page title.

183
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,900
And how much space I have is just a little bit different, so I might go ahead and.

184
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,300
Go back and edit this page template again.

185
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,970
This is something that you may have to do.

186
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,230
Just to make sure everything comes out correctly.

187
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:39,910
Let's go back in there and you can see that, OK, there's these two things are now separated.

188
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,780
So really, what I want to do is, can I move that up?

189
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,950
Now it's above.

190
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,130
I actually want to place it inside here.

191
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,490
Yeah.

192
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,460
And.

193
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,280
I want to justify it to the right.

194
00:12:59,270 --> 00:12:59,680
OK.

195
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,350
Come on now.

196
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,730
It says Justify left, justify right.

197
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,470
That justified all that, I'm sorry, because I have the group selected.

198
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,080
So let's see, I have this row.

199
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:29,260
And the logo, title and logo and the site title.

200
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,530
Oh, I think I need two different columns in here.

201
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,740
You know, it might be the easiest thing to do.

202
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,380
Potentially would let's see where is this group right here?

203
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:52,500
I'm just going to add that once again, this spacer is still here, so if I click the spacer, then

204
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm just going to click to add a block pattern.

205
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,520
I want to add the header and I want it to be the default header.

206
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,910
That looks much better, doesn't it?

207
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:11,220
The space are still there and this space looks right, but let's go ahead and save and see if this solved

208
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,860
our formatting issue here.

209
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,100
Refresh the page that looks much better.

210
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,950
Now, of course, this heading is too large as well.

211
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,760
And so there's some customizations here to be done, uh.

212
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,260
Let's see if it's the post content.

213
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,200
Do I?

214
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,150
Let's see if I can edit some of the post content and inherit the default layout.

215
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,230
If I.

216
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,440
Change that that could change it, or I could go into the event page itself.

217
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,630
I could click.

218
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,690
At it there.

219
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,310
No, that's not right.

220
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,910
Let's go back to the dashboard.

221
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,160
And pages and pages.

222
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,520
Click the event page.

223
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,150
Yeah, so it's the it's the heading.

224
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,930
Let's see what the difference is.

225
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:32,250
I wanted to resolve the block, so if I converted to H.M. or converted to blocks after the conversion,

226
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,800
align it to wide.

227
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,030
Yeah, let's just say convert to block.

228
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,610
This is in each one.

229
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,710
I wonder if I go over to here.

230
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:54,240
Just let's do an inspection, I'm opening the dev tools, click this little arrow and I can look, and

231
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,100
it does say it's an H1 and it says the font is a certain size fifty seven point nine pixels right here.

232
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,420
So I can remember that in each 157.

233
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,390
So click the one.

234
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:23,110
My go over here and what could I make, I could make the size extra large so I could do a custom size

235
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,140
of about fifty seven pixels.

236
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,450
That's really going to do it, isn't it?

237
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,110
And it's still an H1.

238
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,700
So then I can click Update.

239
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,870
Yeah, now under Paige, I could just click permalink and click that link to open a new tab.

240
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,870
Now we're looking like it should, you know, let's close the dev tools like that.

241
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,040
And then here's my page.

242
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,800
It is a slight bit smaller, but you can see where you have to fool around with the layout a little

243
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,880
bit sometimes.

244
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,810
This space is a little smaller, too, so this space is a bit larger.

245
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,250
I could go back here and play with this spacer.

246
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,110
You know it might be.

247
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,680
I might just be able to remove that spacer.

248
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,950
Because this default heading has a certain amount of space in it already.

249
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,690
Let's see if that makes it.

250
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,920
No, look at that.

251
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,320
It removed all the space again.

252
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,300
And so I still do want to place a spacer in here.

253
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,380
Yeah.

254
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,090
So let's see.

255
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,320
Let me add.

256
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,340
Spacer.

257
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,140
Back in.

258
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,960
Move it up and move it up.

259
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:48,800
You can also drag the items in the list view here, but I'm going to make it just a little bit smaller,

260
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:57,100
more like 60 pixels over here tells me how tall it is can save this template now.

261
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,430
Let's see how that looks.

262
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,260
Yeah, that looks about right, doesn't it?

263
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,130
Because I'm logged in, it's showing the admin bar, so the spacing looks a little bit different, but

264
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,480
that looks right.

265
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:11,930
All right.

266
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,250
So this is my page, I'm just going to close that tab.

267
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,100
And there we go.

268
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,760
I can go back to the dashboard.

269
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,320
You can see that under pages, all pages.

270
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:32,840
Now I've created a special template by using this new button and I've selected it page no title.

271
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:40,370
So you can create as many of these new templates as you want and use them on posts and pages to do these

272
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,800
kinds of customizations.

273
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:49,160
So even though there's a title on the page itself so that when I go back to all pages, I can see what's

274
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,490
what.

275
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,090
When I go to the page, it doesn't show the title.

276
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,460
And that's the way it's supposed to look.

277
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,850
All right, thanks for following along with that discovery.
