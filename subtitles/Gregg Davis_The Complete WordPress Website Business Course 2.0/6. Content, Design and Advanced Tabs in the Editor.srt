1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,360
In this lesson, we'll get into the content editing window interface for sections, rows and modules

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,190
in the visual builder in more detail.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,730
You'll see how to use the three tabs across the top of the content window, which are content design

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,290
and the Advanced tab.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,690
By the end of this video, you'll know where to find all the many controls at your disposal when editing

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,870
any one content area in the Devi Visual Builder.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:34,290
And finally, as we look in the visual builder again on this same case study page, I just want to briefly

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:42,180
show the existence of the different options that you have under each sections modal window when you

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,840
pop them up and you may have noticed the three different tabs.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:53,460
So generally you'll have the content and within that you'll have these different, you know, accordion

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,760
layout places where there's different content that you can edit and and change.

12
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,430
So here I've got a text editor that gives me a whole lot of options.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,980
If I'm scrolling down, I can click Link and that will then close the above accordion and open the next

14
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,250
one.

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,740
That would be a link for the entire module and then whether you open it in the same window or not.

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,400
So I could have an entire module clickable, not just the text and then background.

17
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:30,060
If you want a background, a background gradient, a background image or even a background video on

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,020
any kind of a module.

19
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:38,640
Generally, those are used in larger modules like sections or rows instead of module instead of modules

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,420
themselves.

21
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,910
And then below that, this is where you label the admin label.

22
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:50,070
So, you know, if I have header right here, this doesn't appear to the public.

23
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,300
But now, once I know that I label this header right here, when I go down and open the page layout

24
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,540
and look at the wireframe view, then I have that labeled so I know what it is.

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,780
And so if you start to use the wireframe view a little bit, it's useful to have those admin labels

26
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,200
in there.

27
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,460
So you know what's what?

28
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:18,960
Another great thing about that wireframe view is that you can drag things around using the mouse right

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,670
here in this four sided arrow so you could bring it and place it there.

30
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,710
And I can bring it.

31
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:34,230
Place it down below again and then back to the visual builder desktop view would give me that same spot.

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,620
So then let's open this module once again under design.

33
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,750
That's where you're where you'll find things like how is the text and the heading text and the different

34
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,000
things in the content area styled.

35
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,770
And so for text, you know, it'll be set up as a default every time.

36
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:55,620
But you have so many options here, you know, the text alignment you could make centered instead of

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,480
left, for example.

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,440
And if you're using default colors, whether it's a dark on light or light on dark right here, you

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,420
know this is not changing because these colors are defined in the content area.

40
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,260
Over here in terms of text, color, and then because these are two different colors, these are most

41
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,500
likely defined inside of here.

42
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,730
So case study has a text color here and then online store has a different text color here.

43
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,060
You can also notice that this while the text is just capitalized right here, it's all caps.

44
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,290
Over here in the actual website.

45
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,590
And so that would be determined in design over here.

46
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,080
And so here I'm going to set that to the side to make it easy to see the whole thing.

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,490
So under design, this is a heading right under content.

48
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,590
If I click there, I could see that it's a heading one.

49
00:03:53,130 --> 00:04:00,450
And so if I look at design under heading text, this heading font style is changed into all caps.

50
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,630
And so if I click that, you could see that it's shown in blue to show that that's set as all caps,

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,880
you know, italics, for example, and alignment like I showed you.

52
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,980
Here's the heading font monserrat.

53
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,000
Now, if that were in H two, I could change that styling here.

54
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:24,060
But if this is H one and I go in and I change the H2, that's not going to affect this text because

55
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,650
that is an H1, and that's where this little blue paintbrush comes in.

56
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:36,240
Oftentimes, it's easier to find where you want to work on this by clicking that little edit button

57
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,110
versus trying to figure out, OK, you know, what was it?

58
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,920
It was here.

59
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,140
It was an H1.

60
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,160
OK, I have to go back to design heading text h one instead.

61
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,200
If you're anywhere over here inside of this area and you're like, You know, I'm going through, I'm

62
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,350
working on this one, I'm going to click that.

63
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,900
And when I click that little blue paint brush, that brings me right to the design to.

64
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,340
And right to the H1 tab for heading text.

65
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,400
And so that's an easy way to get where you need to be.

66
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,070
And then you get these sliders for, you know, heading text, et cetera, for size heading.

67
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,220
Text size, spacing, line height.

68
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,710
Whenever you change something, you can always hit this, you know, go back to the original size.

69
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,390
Now this was modified up to 60 pixels, but the original size was 30.

70
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:32,410
The way this was set up, and so I'll bring that back up to 60, or I could just x out without saving

71
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,760
this text module.

72
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,620
It would go back to what it was.

73
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,540
Of course, there's text shadow.

74
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,060
Different things you could do there.

75
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:47,530
And sizing is things like max width or min width module alignment.

76
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,960
If I want the module, the module is already filling up the entire space anyway.

77
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,900
And so by centering it, it doesn't do anything.

78
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:03,000
But oftentimes that does work to center a module itself within the row or within the column.

79
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:09,700
And so spacing is, you know, padding and margin, and you can lock top item and you can lock left

80
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,160
right so that you can control that.

81
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:19,320
But if I wanted, some say I wanted some left margin here, I might just go in under margin left.

82
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:25,020
I can just use this little slider and I can change that number to adjust it how I want.

83
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,860
And of course, you can also, you know, select it and use your keyboard, or you can even go up and

84
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,050
down by pixels right here.

85
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,600
And so I'll just, you know, revert that back to what it was before.

86
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,450
And that's the spacing area.

87
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,310
And then under design, there's always border where you can round the corners of something.

88
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,400
If it's got a if that's visible border styles in width, you know, if I wanted to put a border on there

89
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,440
and define it and then if I wanted to round the corners, you know, all that stuff is available and

90
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,910
they come locked, but you can revert back to doing one or the other.

91
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:14,240
There are so many design options in Dili under the Design tab on all the different module row and section

92
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,390
areas for editing, you know, a box shadow.

93
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,160
If this whole thing, you want to have a shadow on there to define the area.

94
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,340
And then, of course, if I had a black shadow, that's where I want to add some margin or padding so

95
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,760
that it's not running up against the edge of my box shadow.

96
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,930
And then, of course, filters for color contrast, inverting the colors and blur and opacity.

97
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:44,840
Very powerful design elements transforming into, you know, shapes.

98
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,890
Even you can, you know, do size transformations.

99
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:57,530
You can, you know, do really amazing things with, you know, rotating and, you know, angles and

100
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,430
things like that.

101
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:05,150
There's amazing design work you can do under with the transform options.

102
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:13,550
We just revert that back and let's revert back there, the rotate as well.

103
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,020
So back to where I was.

104
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,720
And then finally, animations.

105
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,380
This is really powerful.

106
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,100
This one's actually a fade in.

107
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:29,600
And so let me back out of here and let's go exit the visual build there and discard the changes.

108
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:36,110
But that's where you were seeing you could see that fade when I re refreshed the page as we go down

109
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,440
here.

110
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,160
Those were coming in at a slight angle.

111
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,220
Here's a fade in under creative process this one.

112
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,320
Oh, there's the slide left to right.

113
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,260
Those are all, you know, CSS animations that are controlled without code and don't affect the page

114
00:08:51,260 --> 00:09:00,650
loading very much at all and are amazing ways to design with Divij and then finally enable the visual

115
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,070
builder once again and we'll go into advanced.

116
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:13,700
You may use this just a little bit will be one thing that will teach you about using a CIUSSS class

117
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:23,180
for using anchor tags or a side, and there's custom CSS that you can put either before, after or as

118
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,610
a part of the element in any single section in your design.

119
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:37,610
This custom KSAZ and these other advanced places for working on either an individual module a row or

120
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:44,900
a section are super powerful, especially being able to add a piece of custom CC to a single module

121
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,360
without having to add that CSS sitewide.

122
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,840
And that saves the loading time a whole lot, because then that piece of code does not need to load

123
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,240
unless this particular module on this particular page is being loaded on the front end.

124
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:06,260
And so that's some of the power of the different tabs across the top of these editing windows and gives

125
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,820
you an idea of the power of the DV visual builder.

126
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,920
And I hope that gives you an idea.

127
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,160
We're going to be going into a lot more detail on how to create and modify layouts to build completely

128
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,460
unique and custom sites here in the next few sections.
