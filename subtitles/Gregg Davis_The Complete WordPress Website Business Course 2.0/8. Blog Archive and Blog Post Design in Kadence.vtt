00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.880
In this lesson, we'll edit the blog page and the layout of blog posts present within the design.

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.510
You'll learn archive pages and how they bring in dynamic content like posts and arrange them by the

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.200
end of this video.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.350
You'll be able to control the look and feel of blog archive pages, category archives and individual

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.970
blog posts using cadence.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.890
Let's take a look at the blog page in cadence.

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.910
We've brought in the real estate starter template, and the blog page is a page that exists on the website,

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.710
so it has a title page title blog.

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.580
It does use the same header and it has this image at the top that we've been working with, and you

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:52.080
can see that the blog page has this three column grid and it has all six blog posts in there and this

11
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.220
is called a blog archive page.

12
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, a category would also have an archive page, and you can edit that and change the way that looks

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.720
as well.

14
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.290
Potentially, if you look at, you know, if these are categories like home buying, for example, the

15
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.690
home buying archive page, it looks similar.

16
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.440
Now there's only one post in the home buying category, I can tell.

17
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.900
And then a single post layout has a different layout than a blog.

18
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.710
Archive page and archive in WordPress is just meaning that it's pulling in dynamically.

19
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.120
Some different content that exists as full pages elsewhere and an archive is a conglomeration or a group

20
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.680
of all those pages.

21
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.120
And so usually a blog page is known as a blog archive.

22
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.940
It's just assumed and there could be a category archive or a tag archive page.

23
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.040
In any case, let's take a look at the blog archive page or the blog page and just see how it's built

24
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.280
and how we edit the look and feel of that before we finish up with this Kadence section of the course.

25
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.950
So I'll just go back into pages and you can take a look at this to The Post's page.

26
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.860
Now remember under appearance?

27
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.000
Excuse me?

28
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.390
Nope.

29
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.330
Under Settings and reading.

30
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.960
You can set what page is set as the Post's page to have this blog archive page work.

31
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.960
You have to set a page called blog or call whatever you want and set it as the post page here under

32
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.130
Reading Settings.

33
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.280
And so let's look under pages all pages and click the blog posts page.

34
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.410
Now, you might be surprised at this point that it doesn't have any content in it.

35
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.980
Look at this this list view is empty.

36
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.970
You are currently editing the page that shows your latest posts, and so this is controlled dynamically

37
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:56.180
through cadence and through WordPress itself, because we've defined it as the blog archive itself.

38
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.170
And so you wouldn't want to bring any content into this page.

39
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.860
In fact, if you, you know, if you use the design library and you brought some content into this page

40
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.590
at all, then it wouldn't even appear on the blog page.

41
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.790
And so let's find out where that is controlled.

42
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.180
Go back and leave that page and leave it the way it is.

43
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.090
Go back to the WordPress dashboard and go to appearence.

44
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.990
Customize.

45
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:35.900
Let's check out where the editing is for the blog archive page, so under blog posts, blog posts are

46
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.510
a post type in WordPress.

47
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.550
And, you know, as we've looked at before, when we're looking at the 2022 theme as well as the Frost

48
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.690
theme, there's a post type called pages and there's a post type called posts in WordPress.

49
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:59.000
And so posts are just defined by having being associated with a date and having potentially a category,

50
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.000
a number of tags and an author.

51
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:10.190
And so generally, an archive layout or a blog page is displayed with all the blog posts being shown

52
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.370
to the user in reverse chronological order, with the newest posts up at the top and then scrolling

53
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.370
down to older posts in a blog layout.

54
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.870
And so you're probably familiar with that.

55
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.880
But I just wanted to define it here.

56
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.260
So when we look at the blog page itself, we can look at it inside of the customizer and see what we're

57
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.010
looking at here.

58
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.000
So, you know, we have a few things defined for the blog archive.

59
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.550
So for blog posts, this are a for for archives.

60
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.670
As far as showing, you know what we want to show, there's a lot of settings here we have above the

61
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.500
content for the archive title.

62
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.140
If we weren't in content, what would that do?

63
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.050
Well, that just shows, you know, the word blog is here somewhere, but it's in white.

64
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.220
There it is.

65
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.880
And so we would have to change the spacing and change, you know, different things if we wanted that

66
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.710
to be what it looks like.

67
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:14.930
But if we do above the content and it comes back and it shows the defined image at the top there.

68
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.440
And so that's the defined image for, you know, all pages of the website that are not the home page.

69
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.470
And so the container width basically standard or full width would just bring it out.

70
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.500
It wouldn't change anything as far as this layout.

71
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.430
This is for the title, you know, actually, so it can be full width standard is actually full width,

72
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.620
then the post archive title align.

73
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.230
If you wanted to put it in the middle, you totally could do that.

74
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.140
In fact, I like how that looks a little bit better or even on the right.

75
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.760
But then you can change the mobile responsive settings right here and then the container minimum height.

76
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.530
So that's the container for, you know this right here.

77
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:05.900
You could say that I want that actually to be a little bit smaller, just maybe maybe 150, I think.

78
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.500
I like round numbers.

79
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.750
Well, I don't know why when I do that.

80
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.990
But, you know, a hundred and fifty pixels and then what is it look like on a tablet might want to

81
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.310
bring that a little smaller.

82
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.370
That looks pretty good, though.

83
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.490
And then on the phone, you know, that's a little bit tall.

84
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.630
It's sort of wasted space on the phone screen.

85
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.110
So might bring that back down to more like 90.

86
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.800
And then on the tablet, you know, it might as might as well customize that as well down to say, What

87
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.310
did I say?

88
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.690
It was one fifty.

89
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:44.900
Yeah, maybe maybe 120 on the tablet and then 150 on that container.

90
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.080
What that does is it minimizes this space and it doesn't waste any space, and it lets the user see

91
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.040
the first three blog posts sooner.

92
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.920
You know, above the fold or above the line of the bottom of the browser, which is called above the

93
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.310
fold.

94
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.360
And so as we go down again, what do you want to show as far as the title here, the title, if there's

95
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:13.000
a description on the blog page and then whether you want to show breadcrumbs, these are barely make

96
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.630
them out, but it just shows you where you are as far as the blog archive, you know, and you'd want

97
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:25.930
to change the color of that as far as the way it's displayed, and then you can change the order of

98
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:32.350
it to by dragging these around near the title elements under breadcrumbs show the post title in the

99
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.400
breadcrumb you could.

100
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.620
If you're looking at a post, it'll tell you that you're in blog and in what category and then the post

101
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.610
title in the breadcrumbs that's sometimes useful for user navigation.

102
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.610
And then so the layout, you know, normal layout.

103
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.820
Do you want it to look narrower where it would bring, you know, the posts down there?

104
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.110
Or do you want it full width?

105
00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:00.820
Do you want to use a sidebar, you know, that would use a widget that you can define site wide and

106
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:07.810
put different items like, say, maybe there's a Facebook feed for the Facebook page for this website

107
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:13.630
over there or, you know, recent posts, for example, or comments a search bar, for example.

108
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.220
But let's leave it at normal.

109
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:21.130
And here's the default sidebar we have two sidebars defined under appearance widgets in this website,

110
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.340
but you know, let's just leave it where it is.

111
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.660
Of course, there's lots more boxed or unboxed.

112
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.940
How many columns?

113
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:39.130
And then for each item down here, you could see that we're showing, you know, we're showing the categories,

114
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.080
we're showing the title.

115
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:50.260
The featured image, you know, always looks better with the featured image of each blog post, and

116
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.420
that's clickable to the blog post itself.

117
00:08:52.780 --> 00:09:00.370
And then the Mirror would be, you know, author and date, you know, and even the author, avatar

118
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.470
or or profile pic.

119
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:10.090
And so the excerpt you can define how much of the excerpt maybe I want less of the excerpt.

120
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.010
You know, here, if I want to bring it back down to say, you know, twenty two characters instead

121
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:20.260
of where it was, that might be appropriate, especially if you come back up here and you're like,

122
00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:27.220
I'm using a narrow width and look with this excerpt does so when I'm using that narrow with, I want

123
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.020
to bring that excerpt way down.

124
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.000
Or maybe I don't want an excerpt at all.

125
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:37.630
And so anyway, those are some of the options that you can give to the archive pages.

126
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.680
And then there's a read more link, of course, which is always appropriate to have.

127
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:48.700
I'm going to close out of this without saving my changes because I think the layout that comes in by

128
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.680
default is quite good.

129
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:51.520
All right.

130
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.880
So that's how you edit the Post Archive and the blog posts area and our appearance customize.

131
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:03.700
And of course, you can imagine and you've seen there's a lot more to it, and we'll get to a cadence

132
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.880
pro and other cadence features later in the course.

133
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.580
But I hope that was good and informative for you.

134
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.110
And we'll see it in the next section.
