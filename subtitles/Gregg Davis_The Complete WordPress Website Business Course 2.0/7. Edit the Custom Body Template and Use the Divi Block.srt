00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,340
In this lesson, we'll edit the design of the custom body template to match the website's layout.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,400
You'll change the fonts and font weights of headings and body text colors and other design elements

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,250
so that the blog post template design matches the design of the original non matching layout pack,

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,620
as well as save a divvy designed layout section for use in the DV block.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,020
By the end of this video, you'll understand how editing the template will affect the way all the dynamic

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:35,070
content looks, as well as how to provide divvy designed content blocks that can be used in posts created

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,630
in the default block editor.

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:43,800
There's a few more things we could look at as far as this blog post template and one I mentioned before.

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,840
It's changing the font to match the rest of the layout here, and so let's just go check that out real

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,270
quick and start there.

11
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:03,930
And then, you know, I'll give you a challenge to potentially go into one of the pages that is already

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:13,170
in this layout, like packages, for example, and potentially use one of these pre-designed pages as

13
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,330
a framework to create your own blog template that absolutely does match.

14
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,890
Instead of adapting one that was built for a different page layout that we're using right now, but

15
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,900
in any case, let's go ahead and hit back and look at this one.

16
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,280
I know this is a serif.

17
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,240
It's a header.

18
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:42,600
And if we look at other pages, maybe if I just go to visit site in a new tab, I can open up a different

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,140
page here.

20
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,130
You know, our headings are this kind of blocky sans serif font.

21
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:55,110
And then as far as copy, this looks a little bit different than what is down here, this kind of standard

22
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,580
divvy font right here.

23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,480
And so let's find out what our fans are and change these around to further match the layout to the layout

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,650
pack that we're using.

25
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:12,510
And so if we go back here into the dashboard, one thing I want to do is, let's see.

26
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,140
You know what I'll do.

27
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,240
I'll go right over to any page and let's go ahead and use this package as page.

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,580
And if I hit Enable Visual Builder, I should be able to go in and just quickly look at the heading

29
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,940
here.

30
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,790
This is a text module.

31
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,010
If I click here, I can see that's heading one and under design, under heading text.

32
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,620
Of course, I can go over here and if I, you know, let's attach to this to the side like I've showed

33
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,130
you before.

34
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,830
If I click the Little Blue Paintbrush here, it'll show me where I'm supposed to be.

35
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,030
Of course, I'm already having text each one, which is what this was.

36
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:57,320
So it's Oswald bold, all caps and 60 pixels.

37
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,050
And so that's maybe something we could use.

38
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:07,430
So Oswald pulled all caps is something we could change over here inside of a theme builder.

39
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,350
So let's take a look at it.

40
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,370
Let's see if I go back to my custom body for all posts.

41
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:21,680
I can go in here and edit the header right here if I look at the dynamic post title.

42
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,340
This is the Post Archive Pope Archive title.

43
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,640
And if I look under design heading text h one for this design, it's nota serif, but I want to go up

44
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,750
and look for us.

45
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,230
Want?

46
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,330
I found it right there.

47
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,110
And I want it to be bold and I want it to be all caps.

48
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,030
And now it's I'm going to leave it in that way.

49
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,700
Color, since it's on this dark gray background and leave the layout the way it is right here.

50
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,680
60 pixels is what it was, right?

51
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,220
So I just leave it to 60 pixels.

52
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,650
That might look just the same.

53
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,480
Now we can make it really whatever we want.

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,850
And so I'm going to save changes there.

55
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,880
And then let's take a look at the next font in travel packages here.

56
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:20,670
I'll just close this one, and let's go down to a text module that has regular body text on it paragraph

57
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,150
text.

58
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,360
So I'll do text here under design.

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,650
And it's Roboto.

60
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,230
It's Roboto regular in 16 pixels, so I can go back here again.

61
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,750
Let's change this to Roboto regular in 16.

62
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,180
So instead of default font, we can look for Roboto.

63
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:50,200
There's a few different versions, and this is 14, so it's bumped up to 16 and great, that's going

64
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,060
to match super awesome.

65
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,570
I do like the categories the way they're all caps right here.

66
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,450
But let's see if we go down here.

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,240
Are there any more kind of headings that are different?

68
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,170
Well, not really.

69
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,040
Let's see.

70
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:12,400
We do have a let's see paragraph text with Oswald in upper and lower for some of the headings right

71
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,290
here, so we could go back and just change some more of these.

72
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,070
Yeah.

73
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,830
Let's see Oswald right here.

74
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,090
I already changed.

75
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,720
So if we go right to here, is that the title text for an h for?

76
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,980
Yeah, that's what we have going on right here.

77
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,600
So if I just remembered Oswald for me, so I can just change that, Oswald?

78
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,580
Let's see.

79
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,960
Did I bump up the size?

80
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,030
I think I did just a little bit here.

81
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,660
Title text Oswald 18.

82
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,850
Let's just make sure I have the same size here and it's looking pretty good.

83
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,350
You can see what I'm trying to do.

84
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,820
Yeah, let's just bump that up.

85
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,770
To 18 and then over here as well do the same.

86
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,210
This is where this is a style that you could copy.

87
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:08,800
So if I click here and say copy module styles, I could go over here and say paste module styles.

88
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,740
Once I change one, I can duplicate it easily over to the next one.

89
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:21,830
And then I would go down through this whole post content settings and I would change all the fonts to

90
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:29,090
match Oswald and Roboto and just go down and change all the different sections so that it matches.

91
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,060
So let's just quickly see about doing that.

92
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,680
This could be pretty quick.

93
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,350
I could just use this little blueprint precious.

94
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:43,160
Change him to let's see Oswald all caps and just keep following down.

95
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,750
Oops.

96
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,660
Keep following down all the headings here.

97
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,860
This one?

98
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,000
You know, I can just keep the size and make them all caps.

99
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,090
Right here.

100
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,250
Go to Oswald.

101
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,430
Make it all caps looking good.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,010
That looks pretty good.

103
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,190
I mean, let's see.

104
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:09,970
Let's do some of the body text, of course, and bring that over to rubato.

105
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:16,010
And it looks like all the body techs now changed over to rubato, including the italic for a black quote

106
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,320
and all of it.

107
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,330
Everything is looking pretty good now.

108
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,770
Now, down here, I've got a post navigation.

109
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,100
If we just look at the links text, let's change it back to.

110
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,740
Yeah, let's have it be the.

111
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,320
All caps heading.

112
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:36,800
Sure.

113
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,140
It's just making everything match and right down here, the about the author.

114
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,750
Of course, I want this.

115
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,710
Let's go to where it needs to be easy to find that way.

116
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,720
Make it Oswald all caps.

117
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,580
And then let's make right here.

118
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,390
Where's that?

119
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,970
And it must be a different module.

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,210
Yeah.

121
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,470
Two different modules here.

122
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,100
Here's one.

123
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,470
And that is, let's see who is it going to take me there?

124
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,730
Click that.

125
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,680
Well, let's see what it is.

126
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,010
That's.

127
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,820
Text.

128
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,980
Let's see what the content looks like, it's the Post author.

129
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,050
It's an age three.

130
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,910
OK, so now I know I can go to heading text h three.

131
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,650
Change that into what we're using for heading text, which is Oswald all caps.

132
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:29,460
Yup.

133
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:37,440
And then finally, here's somebody text we know we're going to bring that over to rubato.

134
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,850
Nice.

135
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,380
Close that off.

136
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,460
Almost done.

137
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,960
Got a few more things to do, and you can pause the video here and take care of it yourself.

138
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,070
And I'll do the same and come back and we'll take a look at what we got.

139
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,160
OK, so basically I went through and everything that was a header.

140
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:59,940
I changed into Oswald, all caps and everything that was body text or anything else that wasn't a header

141
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,260
changed into rubato.

142
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,540
And so it made it all look quite good.

143
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,010
I changed the color on this.

144
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,100
You know, you could do what you want as far as buttons.

145
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,360
I just left these yellow and I left these all caps the way I had before.

146
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:22,050
So here is a nice all posts body layout that now I have to go ahead and save over here, and that should

147
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,740
finish up our custom blog posts template.

148
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,470
If I close that it says all changes saved here.

149
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,590
So if I look at example post now, that should bring everything into line as far as the design.

150
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,510
Yeah, looking good.

151
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,830
All the body text similar to all the other pages of the website.

152
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,640
There's no related posts yet, but that even looks good.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,240
And even the forms down here, this form.

154
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:48,660
Oh yeah.

155
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,820
You just make a comment, right?

156
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:57,000
That would be in the all caps right there if you want to, but that's all changeable and looking good.

157
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:05,640
So that was a great way to customize one of these special custom bodies inside the TV theme builder

158
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,440
just for blog posts.

159
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:14,070
Now, keep in mind the power of this functionality here within the device settings under theme builder

160
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:21,480
and being able to define which pages and which type page types you want these custom designed to be

161
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,840
on.

162
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:29,040
Remember, I said then, that what that means is that the client or the website owner can go in, and

163
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,900
if they wanted to just edit a post, all they do is go into that post and they can use this traditional

164
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:43,200
WordPress default block editor, which is a little more simple than using the divvy builder.

165
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,650
They need to remember to put a featured image in and just use headings, copy images, way they like,

166
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:56,160
and it's going to come out just looking great, no matter what the way you want your design to match.

167
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:03,720
So there's one more interesting thing that we can do as we open this, you know, block editor content

168
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,610
area to content managers or clients that want to manage their blog posts.

169
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,210
Not only can you let them use the block editor and style it how you want using the divvy builder, you

170
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:23,220
can also have them bring in pre-built sections made with divvy that can be laid inside of the content

171
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,490
here.

172
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,660
Let's take a look.

173
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:31,500
There's actually a Divvy Gutenberg block or block that you can use and style it yourself and save it

174
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,910
into the Devi library.

175
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,540
And so what we'll do is first, let's just build a sample page.

176
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:48,060
We do this because we want to use a pre-built layout and use the entire power of the Devi builder in

177
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,280
order to make the layout we want.

178
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,940
I'm going to bring in a section from one of the pre-built layouts from the travel agency pages, and

179
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,300
then we'll use that in the Devi library and save it as a layout so that then when you're, you know,

180
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,850
editing or building a blog post, you can use a Devi block and import that content in.

181
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,470
Let's take a look at how it works.

182
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,590
Let's see if I just go, so I'm going to go tour packages.

183
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,120
I'm just going to call this tour package and click Use the Devi Builder.

184
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:28,290
And what I'm going to do is bring a pre-made layout in, you could use an existing page, which is which

185
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,540
could be one of our packages.

186
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,610
One of our pages here called packages.

187
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,450
Or we could go into that travel layout and use the packages layout.

188
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,300
We haven't really edited it, but you, if you had this is a good place where you can bring in an existing

189
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,410
page from your website.

190
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:50,970
So I just brought in this whole page, and I'm going to use one of these sections here now there a row

191
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,510
layout.

192
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:59,550
And in order to save it as a page layout in the TV library, we need to save this entire page.

193
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:06,810
Now, of course, it doesn't include the header and it doesn't include the footer down here, but this

194
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,460
page content inside.

195
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:13,270
I want to basically delete everything except the one piece that I'm going to be using.

196
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,280
So I'm going to use the wireframe builder to make it easier to do that.

197
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:24,780
I can see that under packages this section, I've got multiple rows, each one called package, and

198
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,140
so I'm going to delete everything except one of the packages.

199
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:33,180
Maybe the second to last one is one that I thought looked good for this process.

200
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,520
And so what I'll do is go up and I'm going to leave the blue section intact, but I'm going to start

201
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,580
deleting these row layouts using the little trashcan.

202
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,390
So the title.

203
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,310
And now there's four of these.

204
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,730
I want to delete the first two one two.

205
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,170
Now there's two left.

206
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,780
I'm going to delete the bottom package right here.

207
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,540
And now what I have is a section with my row that I'm looking for right inside of it here.

208
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,730
And now this bottom section called offer.

209
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,870
I'll delete that and then I'll do it the more places section as well.

210
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:12,540
So what I'm left with is one single blue section with a row and a number of modules, and that is what

211
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,860
I'm looking to bring into the DV library so that I can use it later.

212
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,860
So now that I have that here, what I want to do is save this as an entire page layout.

213
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:30,060
And so instead of using either the section or the row little down arrow here, that's for, you know,

214
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:30,950
save to library.

215
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:37,110
I want to go down here to the bottom row, use this purple down arrow, which will save it as an entire

216
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,980
page layout.

217
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,100
So I'm going to call this tour package.

218
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:46,200
That might be something that's descriptive inside of the device library for a content manager to use

219
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,560
later.

220
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,290
So I'll just click Save Library, Save to Library.

221
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:56,460
Now I can just save this page as a draft because it's more of my building area that I that I was using,

222
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,580
and we won't we won't want to publish that as a page on the website.

223
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:06,570
So now that I've saved it as a draft, I can go back into the dashboard and let's just take a look in

224
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,270
the Div Library under Divvy Div Library.

225
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,460
Now, of course, you've seen the parallax footer and the newsletter footer that we created that were

226
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,290
sections in the DV library, but here the tour package is called a layout.

227
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:25,230
That's how we have to label that and and save it as an entire page layout to be able to bring that section

228
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,720
into a blog post in the Block editor.

229
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:34,860
So let's take a look at how that works inside of this blog post, I was thinking below the image and,

230
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,770
you know, maybe in the middle of this big block of text, we'll put that call to action tour package

231
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,300
block inside of there.

232
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:51,120
So one thing I can do, I'll just go back into the TV and the WordPress dashboard and go to posts and

233
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,290
I'll edit that post.

234
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:58,650
This is as if I were, you know, a content manager on the website, just using the block editor for

235
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,220
posts.

236
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:08,520
Maybe I'll just go in here and I can hit enter to start a new area and I can hit Plus to get a new block.

237
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Or I could go over here and hit plus and look at the list of blocks, you know, and look for the divvy

238
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,180
block.

239
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,580
Or I can even start typing.

240
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:23,340
And if you type, Slash even says right here, if you type a forward slash and I hit the deaky, you

241
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,070
could see that there is a block called divvy layout.

242
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,620
And so, you know, if you're here and you start typing divvy, oops.

243
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,820
You can see that there's a divvy layout block and over.

244
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,510
Let's see.

245
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,810
Let's get rid of this slash right here over here with the plus button.

246
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,740
You can also just start typing Deivi and see that there's a div layout.

247
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:50,760
So now that brings in a block, which is a developer, then it's easiest just to load from the library,

248
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,970
especially if you're a user that doesn't know how to really build with DV and you're just using the

249
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,600
Block editor.

250
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:03,420
So I'll click load from library, and all I have to do is click my saved layouts here under this tab,

251
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,850
and you'll see that it shows me all of the different full layouts that I've saved in the DV library.

252
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,190
I just have one here, so a quick tour package and it brings it in just like a complete page layout

253
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,050
into a blank page.

254
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,630
And there we go now because of the content with you can see that it.

255
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,410
Instead of placing it to the left and right, it's got the larger image at the top.

256
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:34,060
And you can do things like, you know, you can you can edit this layout by clicking this little edit

257
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:39,640
layout button, and it opens a window where you can edit this layout, block itself.

258
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:47,650
And so while while this is right here, you know, one thing you might do is just maybe reduce the space

259
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,880
at the top and bottom.

260
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,080
Here I could lock that.

261
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,250
And then just reduce the space, maybe down to 45 pixels.

262
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,980
Go down here and click Save and exit.

263
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,110
Now that's editing the layout block and saving it directly into the DV library.

264
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,840
And by doing that, you could see that, you know, it actually did bring the image over to the left

265
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,410
hand side.

266
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:16,360
But if I just click Update and then go back to the blog post and refresh the page, now I've got that

267
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:22,120
really nice TV layout sitting in line inside of the text.

268
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,210
You can, you know, make sure that the button works.

269
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:32,500
The user can edit this text by, you know, editing the DV block, as I showed you there.

270
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:40,270
It's just a really powerful way to make inset divvy powered layouts available to the content manager.
