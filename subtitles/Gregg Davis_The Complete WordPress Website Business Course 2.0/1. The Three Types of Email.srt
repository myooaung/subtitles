00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,950
In this lesson, we'll explore the three types of email that you might need to manage while supporting

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,260
a WordPress web site at a custom domain name.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,080
You'll learn that regular email needs hosting.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:16,590
Transactional email is outgoing only from a website, and broadcast email is all about building an email

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,450
list by the end of this video.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,910
You'll see why the three types of email mostly don't overlap and why they exist as different systems.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,120
Let's talk about the three types of email associated with custom websites now.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,930
The first is called Send and receive email, or you may call it hosted email.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:42,240
And this is what you probably think of as regular email email addresses that you own that you can send

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,390
email from and receive email into.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:53,790
Now, those email addresses require hosting because those emails and their attachments, the data that

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,210
comprises those emails needs to be stored somewhere on a server, and the receiver is the person that's

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,420
responsible for storing those emails somewhere.

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:12,520
Now you might think of that email hosting is is generally free, and it is known as free at, you know,

15
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,240
public services such as Gmail.

16
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,260
Your address at gmail.com is hosted email.

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,750
It is, you know, it's it's an address at a domain name now.

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:32,610
The domain name is gmail.com in this example, and it's free because Gmail hopes that you'll use their

19
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,510
services in the future, and they also capture data that they can then use in their advertising systems

20
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,930
and everything that they do as a google.com.

21
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:50,940
And so email is free, but email hosting is not free when you want to do it at your custom domain name.

22
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,800
And so that's the big difference.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,980
And as far as our purposes here in the course, working with WordPress and making websites for yourself

24
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:08,220
and for others hosted email is something that can be free, but it's best if it has a small expense

25
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:15,480
associated with it because that hosting is something you you want to be responsible for, and that costs

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,490
money in some way.

27
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:25,200
You know, as far as gmail.com and send and receive emails that hosted email is paid for by Google because

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,490
they like to collect that data.

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,940
But if you want to have a custom email address like you at example com, then that email needs to be

30
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,810
hosted somewhere.

31
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,540
So another thing about the first type of email send and receive email is that it's a one to one setup.

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,340
There's a sender and a receiver, and it goes in both directions.

33
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,300
So there's, you know, sending and receiving by one person and then either replying or sending again

34
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,640
and receiving back and forth.

35
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,820
And so that's why I call it send and receive email.

36
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:04,800
The second type of emails called transactional email now transactional email is something that you're

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,040
probably familiar with, but you've not been necessarily exposed to setting it up or managing it.

38
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:18,840
Behind the scenes transactional email is something that happens from a web site to a human.

39
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,250
It is one directional, so it is outgoing only email.

40
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,170
Transactional email is something like a forgot password link.

41
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,770
If you click on the login page for WordPress, for example, if you click Forgot My Password, it will

42
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,260
generate an email that comes from the website and is received by you.

43
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:45,000
Whatever email address is your admin account and so it is sent one to one.

44
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,610
But it's not from a human to a human.

45
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,170
It's from a computer to a human, and it's also only one direction.

46
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,830
And so the computer sends an email out to the human.

47
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,100
Generally, from an address that's not designed to receive a reply, and often you've seen addresses

48
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,650
like no reply at example, dot com or something like that.

49
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:14,580
And so it's not designed to have an email sent back to it, and therefore it doesn't require any hosting

50
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,890
for a transactional email setup.

51
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,800
Another example would be notifications for, say, a contact form that the user might fill out on a

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,310
website.

53
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,440
And then that website sends a notification to the admin that says, Hey, the contact form was filled

54
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,710
out, and here's what the person submitted in their contact form.

55
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,250
That is a transactional email, again, outgoing only.

56
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,740
And another example would be receipts or notifications from an ecommerce web store.

57
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,940
So the user might receive an email, which is an invoice or a receipt from their purchase at a website.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,250
Again, transactional email.

59
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:59,850
Now, transactional email can be free, but it's a best practice to use a service to provide that send.

60
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,760
And we'll talk about that deeper in the next few lessons.

61
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:10,810
The third type of email that I'd like to define as different from the first two is broadcast or marketing

62
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,450
email, and you might be familiar with this email, as it has to do with building an email list.

63
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:24,070
Now, building an email list and sending email to a group is something that is again sent from the computer

64
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,190
and sent to a group of people.

65
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,310
And so, as in this example diagram right here you can see that you know, there's the website sends

66
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:42,010
email, multiple email, say the same email all at once to the members of a group, and that would be

67
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,880
the email list.

68
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,030
An example would be someone subscribes to a newsletter.

69
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:53,080
And then when the owner of the website writes that newsletter and press send, they only have to do

70
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,620
that once.

71
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,920
And it sends to hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of participants and members of that email

72
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,250
list.

73
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,460
And so these two transactional and broadcast are both outgoing only.

74
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,000
They're outgoing only, but one is just sending to one person and the other is sending to a group of

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,450
people.

76
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,820
And so oftentimes it's referred to broadcast emails referred to as bulk email sent sent in bulk.

77
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,560
Many at once or a lot of people talk about marketing, email.

78
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:29,230
And so the final thing I'll say about broadcast email is that in this example, for example, someone

79
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,270
might fill out a form and opt in to the email list.

80
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,040
They might opt in to the newsletter and it's marked in green here because that first email that goes

81
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,230
out is actually a transactional email.

82
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,290
Each person gets that email right away.

83
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,230
It might be a confirmation email so that they can verify and double opt in into the email list.

84
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:56,170
Or it might be just the first copy of the newsletter that comes to them as a single email to a single

85
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,490
person right away.

86
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:04,540
But then after that, when the user, the owner of the website, writes the bulk email or the marketing

87
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,590
email and sends it out, then they're a member of this group.

88
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,110
And so that changes to this orange color.

89
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,400
And I would define that as broadcast or marketing email.

90
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,910
So those are the three types of email in then that can be associated with your WordPress website or

91
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,530
your client's WordPress websites.

92
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:30,370
And in the next few lessons, I'm going to go over different setups how you set up both send and receive

93
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:38,170
email, transactional email systems and broadcast and marketing email systems using best practices through

94
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:45,800
either custom domain names or transactional email providers, and also broadcast email providers.

95
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,010
There's multiple ways to do these setups, and there's some gotchas that you want to watch out for.

96
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:58,360
So you don't make any mistakes and have either your website go down or your IP address or domain name

97
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,740
banned for spamming.

98
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,700
Let's get into it.
