1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,670
In this lesson, we'll finish matching the about page from the sample site using a different site template

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,530
provided by the 2022 theme.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,010
You'll see why you can't bring a template block pattern into a page or post content area, and you'll

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,830
understand the power of the query block for bringing a series of dynamic blocks like posts into a layout.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,620
Finally, by the end of this video, you'll learn how to use a columns block and spacer blocks to fine

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,480
tune your layout in a specific page.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:37,290
OK, so if we go back into the about page, you might think that you just want to go in here and find

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:47,580
a pattern, and you may have recognized that there's a headers section here, and we saw before that

9
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,390
this pattern right here looks exactly right.

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,090
You know, it's got some.

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,470
It's got navigation.

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,580
It looks right.

13
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,130
So what happens if I hit update?

14
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,820
And then I view this page in another tab.

15
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,400
You may have encountered this problem.

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,270
OK, so what have I done?

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,450
I brought a pattern which is a header pattern, and I put it inside the content of the about page.

18
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,590
So the that, you know, the spacing is messed up.

19
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:26,470
And of course, there's a white section that says the title of the page and then the other header is

20
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,050
up here.

21
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:34,120
Now, since the about page has a different header and this thing is a header, we need to treat this

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,670
like a page template and then use that template for the about page.

23
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,270
So here we are in pages, all pages.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,130
And if I click about which we created before all, we have the page title and the content so far is

25
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:51,610
empty.

26
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,850
But remember, I want to add a page template, which will be the header for the about page.

27
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:05,050
I know that over here under template, it's I open it up if you need to, but there's a dropdown here.

28
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,820
The default template is the one that's on every page if you don't define something different.

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,070
But I can put page large header and click Update.

30
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:22,690
And now if I look at this about page, I'll refresh and you can see that it gives me that large header

31
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,540
and then the content area is empty.

32
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,820
So it's even got the menu here for me.

33
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,860
So that's a really good start.

34
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,620
And now let's go to the about page itself and start adding the content that we need.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,450
So on the demo site, I know that I have a section that's latest posts and it has three posts across.

36
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,210
I want to look and see if there's a block pattern that matches this.

37
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:56,410
So I'll go over here and let's open up the toggle and for patterns.

38
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,860
The first one I see here is the one featured posts.

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,170
It already shows my three posts that I have with the right pictures, and that looks great.

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,930
So next thing I'm going to add is watch birds from your inbox and join our mailing list.

41
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:23,830
Looks like a column layout, and so if we just open it up a little bit bigger, oh, the one at the

42
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,500
top left here, subscribe or call out.

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,440
And of course, you would put a an opt in form right here on the right hand side.

44
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:40,180
But as I look at this, you can see and let's just check on the front end and the real page, I'll just

45
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,950
refresh in the new tab.

46
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,140
And that's looking very good.

47
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,050
But this is a little close, isn't it?

48
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,260
If I look at the demo site, the spacing is a little bit bigger there.

49
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:58,570
So what I'll do is just go over here and let me look for a block to put in there for space, and there's

50
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,570
a spacer block that I could place right in there.

51
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,060
Now it's here, it's in the wrong place.

52
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:13,450
So you can either hit this up arrow or you can use this hand and and and drag it up into the spot where

53
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,280
you want it.

54
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,990
The blue line shows you where it's going to go.

55
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,160
Um, no, let me control Z and undo that.

56
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,520
I just really want to keep it on the main part of the page and move it up.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,810
That's where I want it.

58
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:32,350
And for this space, or if I look at the height settings 100 pixels, yeah, that looks pretty good.

59
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,090
That's probably the default.

60
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:44,770
So if I hit update and now let's look at the spacing much better, that's pretty much it.

61
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,390
That's the about page.

62
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,850
And now the navigation is there.

63
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,800
It's all looking correct and latest posts and then join our mailing list.

64
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,580
Great.

65
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:04,570
Now looking at this latest posts block or group, let's look at it real quick in this query loop, which

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,650
is a post template inside of the query loop.

67
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,740
You can see that if I hit Query Loop here, you can see some of the options on the right hand side the

68
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,550
settings.

69
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,130
For this query, it's going to query the database for a certain post type.

70
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,990
And so that's going to be posts or it could be pages and plugins and other functionality inside WordPress

71
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,000
might add other post types like services or projects, and you can create your own, which will learn

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,840
later in the course.

73
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:42,340
But this is the post post type and a page is a separate type of post that then you can choose how many

74
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:49,270
columns in this query block, whether it's posted newest to oldest as in attritional traditional blog,

75
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:58,660
and whether sticky posts, which are designed to be listed always first in any post list are included

76
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,200
or not.

77
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:07,450
Where you can even just only display sticky posts, you can display posts from certain categories like

78
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,800
featured or something like that.

79
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,900
You can do it from tags, from authors or even with keywords.

80
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,200
And you can also look at one level inward as far as the post template.

81
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,380
We're including a featured image.

82
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:30,910
We're including a post title, including a post excerpt and including a post date in each one.

83
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:37,660
And so each one will be repeated with whichever features you choose inside the query loop here.

84
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:45,190
You also may have noticed that in this page on the right hand side on the demo, there's a view all

85
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:51,670
link where that would link to the blog page, which would be a blog archive page.

86
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,450
And so I can show you how to put that in there now.

87
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,650
The way to do that would be, let's take a look at the layout first.

88
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,730
If we look at what's going on here, let's see.

89
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,700
The first thing we have is a paragraph that's within this group, which was the block pattern that we

90
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,150
chose.

91
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,350
There's just a plain paragraph block in here.

92
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:20,590
And so, you know, you don't want to put a bunch of spaces and or tabs or something like that.

93
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,290
You know, you could potentially type view all.

94
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,090
Let's put a space right here.

95
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,630
View all and then just select that one.

96
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,880
And click Align Text, right?

97
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,680
But look, that's for the whole block, not just for the piece of text.

98
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,420
So let's put that back.

99
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,210
Let's get rid of view all here, and I'll show you how I would go about making this change.

100
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:56,020
So what I would do is I would add a new block right here after this paragraph block or before.

101
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:04,570
But what I'll do is hit plus and let's go ahead and choose a column block.

102
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,660
So if I go down here and choose columns.

103
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,730
Click right there now because the cursor was here it, it's going to insert this column's block right

104
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:19,700
here below the paragraph block and I want a two column block because I'm going to put, you know, the

105
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,270
the the title over here on the left in one block.

106
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,790
And then I will in one column, I should say, and then view all over here in the other column.

107
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,500
So I'm going to choose 50-50.

108
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,590
And there's two columns, each with a plus sign.

109
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,840
So when you click the plus sign, that will allow you to place any kind of block within the column.

110
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,840
So I'll do paragraph latest posts.

111
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:50,690
And now, when I choose the latest posts, I can go over here under the block selection settings over

112
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,760
here and under typography, I can go letter case and choose uppercase.

113
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:04,340
That's how this one was created, and then I can go ahead and select this block and remove that block.

114
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,940
Now I just need to fill this one with another paragraph block and I can type view all.

115
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,580
And now what I want to do is have this block here be aligned.

116
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:16,910
Right?

117
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,260
There we go.

118
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,950
We're getting somewhere.

119
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,600
Now we just need to put a link in there.

120
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,020
So in order to, I don't have a blog page yet created, but to make this a link, so it looks right.

121
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,210
You can just place a hash character and then insert that.

122
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:32,840
Oops.

123
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:38,960
Now I didn't have the the text selected, so it placed the actual hash character in there and had that

124
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,590
be the link.

125
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,600
So what you need to do is select the text first and then click the link button.

126
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,150
And now we're adding hash just to make it look like a link, and it's not going to go anywhere.

127
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:56,030
But now I can just click Update and as I go over here to the actual page.

128
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:56,960
Here we go.

129
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,600
Now I have the title here, latest posts of this section and then this view all well.

130
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,960
It'll just, you know, reload the same page or go to the top of the page.

131
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,540
But that's the way the link will look to go to the blog page once we have a core created.
