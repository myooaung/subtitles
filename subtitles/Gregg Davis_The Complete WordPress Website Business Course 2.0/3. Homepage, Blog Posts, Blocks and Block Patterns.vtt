00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.210
In this lesson, we'll recreate the home page of the sample site using the 2022 theme, you create the

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.580
three blog posts with their featured images and learn about the WordPress blocks available by default,

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.410
as well as block patterns included in the theme and available at WordPress.org.

4
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.780
By the end of this video, you'll understand how the Block Editor is used for creating content and how

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.490
block patterns are pre-designed sets of blocks that you can use in the design process.

6
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.560
First, let's deal with this homepage.

7
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.630
All they've got to do is create three new blog posts with this content.

8
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.870
And I can see that the header will look the same except for the menu item, of course, and then the

9
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.640
footer is exactly the same.

10
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.550
And so let's go back.

11
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.230
Go ahead.

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.710
And here's how I would attack this task.

13
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.520
You know, I've got the home page open in one tab and I've got the dashboard open in a second tab and

14
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.110
I have all the resources I need.

15
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:07.760
I can grab the text of each blog post from here and I can grab the images from the media library.

16
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.580
And so as we go back to here, what I'll do is go posts, all posts, and let's just take a look at

17
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.450
what we have here.

18
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.920
First thing I might do is just put the Hello World post in the trash and add a new post, and I could

19
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.070
see this is the post editing screen, and there's a few things here that I could show you.

20
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:38.000
This is really unchanged between a block based theme and and a non block based theme for full site editing.

21
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.820
And when we go to twenty two here, what I'm going to do the demo site is just control C to copy the

22
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.980
title and I'll add the title right there.

23
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.140
And now that I have that in here, I can click Save Draft if I want to.

24
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.680
And you know, if I click Preview, what that'll do is allow me to preview it for desktop or for tablet

25
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.240
or for mobile, because we always want to make sure that the sites we design are mobile responsive.

26
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.560
But you could say preview in a new tab and you'll be you'll remember I just clicked save as a draft,

27
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.160
and so it doesn't show the real URL.

28
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.400
It shows this little tag after the URL.

29
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.390
It's just preview equals true.

30
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.110
And so that's what this post is looking like so far.

31
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.760
You'll remember the the comments section.

32
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.870
And of course, there's no content here yet, so I'm just going to close that tab.

33
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.000
And as we go in here, just let me show you around before we bring all the content in.

34
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.840
First off, over here on the left side, you could click these three little lines and that's the list

35
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.120
view of all the blocks that you might have inside of your post itself.

36
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.910
So that's just something to be aware of.

37
00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.020
And then all the content that we put in WordPress sites is housed in individual blocks, and that makes

38
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.730
it very modular so that you can, you know, put your content in there and then you can rearrange the

39
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.940
blocks into different order and you can easily export blocks to put them on different pages.

40
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.330
You can create reusable blocks so that you can easily bring a design that you made into other pages

41
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.470
or posts of the website.

42
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.850
But wherever there's a plus button, it basically does the same thing.

43
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.060
Add a block.

44
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.420
And over here, this plus side is going to toggle again another toolbar over here, which is the block

45
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.240
insert here.

46
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:38.330
And so if I do that now, you can see that, you know, here inside of the content area, I could add

47
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:45.270
any of these types of blocks and you could see when I roll over any of them with the mouse.

48
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.950
It shows me a preview of what the block might look like over here on the right hand side.

49
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.450
And so these are all the default blocks they're categorized.

50
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.230
There's text blocks here, just a paragraph, you know, a list.

51
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.460
There's a bulleted list.

52
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.040
There's also a numerical list within there, too.

53
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:14.160
There's a quotation, a code block if you want to put code that will execute on the page tables, a

54
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.260
pull quote.

55
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.610
Things like that.

56
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.770
So in any case, here's media blocks.

57
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.630
Design blocks are ones that allow you to take other blocks and put them in a certain configuration,

58
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.930
right?

59
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.980
So you could.

60
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.880
What you could do is you could use a roadblock as kind of a placeholder or a container, and then you

61
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.070
can put columns inside of that container and then inside of each column.

62
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.980
You would then put a different type of block like in image.

63
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.050
And so those are design blocks and then widgets do certain things.

64
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.760
So a list of your categories a calendar, some custom HTML.

65
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.330
If you want to paste something you know, like a Google map, embed code or or an embed code from YouTube

66
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.320
or something like that.

67
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.650
The the theme section shows a bunch of different types of blocks.

68
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.460
Like if you were going to use, if you were going to put, say, a grid of blog posts, you might use

69
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.290
the query loop, which goes and gets data in a loop.

70
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.400
It'll go get a blog post and then it'll get the next blog post and then the next blog post and can figure

71
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.000
out how you like.

72
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.320
So you can start to see the power of these blocks and how they work.

73
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.350
Now, I mentioned embedding a YouTube embed code using the custom HTML block, but there's also all

74
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:40.190
of these embeds over here, so you could just embed it by simply pasting the URL of a YouTube video

75
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.540
and putting it in there and all these types of embed blocks down here.

76
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:54.890
But not only that, there's patterns and patterns are really the the the the real power in a block based

77
00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:01.490
theme is that that theme can include a whole bunch of design patterns that you can use that match the

78
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.980
design that the theme has.

79
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.420
And so in this 20 22 theme under patterns, you can start to see this is the featured category.

80
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.780
And as I go down here, you can see that there's all kinds of different sections that are more complex

81
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.780
layouts that you can just easily bring in.

82
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:27.410
You know, an image with a caption, If I just click that, that brings in that image with a caption,

83
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.030
I can replace the image.

84
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.530
It has a nice color.

85
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.560
And you can see that that's easily usable.

86
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.620
And so then when you bring in a block and when a block exists in the content of a page, you can see

87
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.560
that it has a control bar here up at the top and so I can click options.

88
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.930
And then there's a few options for this block.

89
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.030
For now, this is a group of blocks.

90
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.560
That's why it's calling it a group.

91
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.820
And so because it was a block pattern is basically a group of blocks.

92
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.930
So I'm going to click Remove Group so that we're back to where we were.

93
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.000
So not only are these patterns visible in a row?

94
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.200
Yes.

95
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:14.250
Excuse me, in a column down here, they're a little bit easier to see if you click Explore, that opens

96
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.750
up a window where you can just see them a little bit easier to see.

97
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.600
Not such a long list.

98
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:29.100
And then that dropdown, where it said, featured these are all the featured block patterns or groups

99
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.700
of blocks.

100
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.950
But there's footers.

101
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.300
Oh, OK, so now you're starting to see if you want a different footer.

102
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.830
You can just use one of the four footers supplied by the theme that matches everything.

103
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.120
And so and headers as well.

104
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.970
You can see that.

105
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.420
Do you recognize this header from one of the pages in the demo?

106
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:48.900
I do.

107
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:54.180
And you can see that there's all kinds of different headers included in the 2022 two theme.

108
00:07:54.630 --> 00:08:02.700
The query block, like I said, it does things like brings in featured posts or a grid of posts and

109
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.740
some large title offset.

110
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.180
There's pages.

111
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.180
These are complete pages that are block patterns.

112
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:15.240
And so if you look about look at these and they have a little description title at the bottom there

113
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:22.020
an about page with a large image and buttons, for example, a page layout with image and text image,

114
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.200
a page layout with image, text and video.

115
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.360
Does this one look a little bit familiar to you?

116
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.940
That was the film page, wasn't it?

117
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.700
In the other in the demo site?

118
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:40.050
And so you can see that there's the real power here of a block based theme is that you can customize

119
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:45.960
and design everything without any code or using any special CSC to change things.

120
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:53.760
And you can make a completely unique site, but matching the global elements of typography, colors

121
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.150
and styles that the theme has within it.

122
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.940
And so this 20 22 theme has a lot of hidden features in these block patterns.

123
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.440
There's column layouts, galleries for imagery.

124
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.570
There's a whole series of different types of text block patterns.

125
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:20.880
And so I'm just going to close this modal window here that gives you an idea of the power of block patterns

126
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.910
and what we're talking about patterns just quickly.

127
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:30.240
Let's go back to WordPress dot org and there's a new button here called Patterns.

128
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:37.230
And now these are patterns not from the 2020 to theme necessarily, but from not even connected with

129
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.460
any theme at all.

130
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:45.660
These are user submitted and volunteers submitted patterns that are on the WordPress dot org website.

131
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.520
And so, for example, you know, to offset images with a description.

132
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:56.550
If you were to click that, you could see a bigger, bigger version, your version of it, and you can

133
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.810
drag these to see what that looks like at different screen sizes.

134
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:07.200
You could see the two different images stack each other when you get to smaller, smaller screens.

135
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:15.270
But the beauty of the block patterns and the pattern library here is that you can just click copy pattern,

136
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.770
and now you can just paste it into a WordPress post or a page.

137
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:27.760
Suppose I wanted to just go here into this post and just move the cursor right there and click Control

138
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.070
V and paste that.

139
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:36.060
I have that exact block pattern now in my website, including the images, and I can publish it.

140
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.480
And so there's real power in these block patterns.

141
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.040
There's so shareable.

142
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:48.840
And not only can they be, are they included in the WordPress.org repository that's just going to keep

143
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.300
growing with more and more patterns available.

144
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:59.220
But the real power, like I said, is having these patterns available to you, you know, inside of

145
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.400
your website supplied by the theme that you're using.

146
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.500
And so, OK, let's get back to designing now.

147
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:11.960
Now that you know about that, let's put the image that needs to go in here.

148
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:18.660
So at this blog post this image right here, I know that this image is a particular kind of image.

149
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:26.340
Now I'm looking at the homepage here that has three blog posts, and because this is an archive of three

150
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.120
blog posts, I know that these images are what's called featured images.

151
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.770
So if you click it, it goes and opens the blog post itself.

152
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:43.560
And I'll bet that if I were to log in to this website and look at this post, this image doesn't actually

153
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:51.150
exist within the content area of the post here, but instead under post over on the right hand side.

154
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.890
Here it's under featured image and you can click set featured image.

155
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.580
Now this control bar over here for either the post.

156
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:07.120
Or the block that you're looking at over here, this paragraph block potentially is controlled up here

157
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.060
with the gear icon.

158
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.610
I can close it and get a full screen layout of what the the site will look like.

159
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.630
Or I can just open that up.

160
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.540
Usually, I'll have it open all the time.

161
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.750
So if I click set featured image, I can go to the media library and let's put the right image in.

162
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.650
So for an area of hawks, it's this red bird with the tail.

163
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.070
That's right there.

164
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:36.790
And then I can just say set featured image and it's uploading it there, and then I can either click

165
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.620
save, draft or publish.

166
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.710
And now this will give you by default, it'll say, Oh, are you sure you want to publish?

167
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.120
It'll say, We've done a double.

168
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.670
Check your settings, OK, the visibility's public.

169
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.950
Publish it now or do you want it's scheduled, et cetera.

170
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.380
Or do you want to assign a category where this kind of category?

171
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.500
Yeah, these were assigned to category birds.

172
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:08.290
Goldfinch and Sparrow were tags I can see by looking at the URL at the bottom there and then notes was

173
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.130
the category.

174
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.700
We don't have to do that right now, but I could assign a category.

175
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.110
And of course, uncategorized is the default.

176
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:25.450
But let's go ahead and create a new category called notes if we're really going to match this demo site.

177
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.280
That would be the proper way to do it.

178
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:33.250
And sure, I could add some tags birds, goldfinch and sparrow.

179
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.820
Birds, you can separate them by karma.

180
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.020
I just hit a karma.

181
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:43.210
And that's what put it kind of as a little tag with an X button to remove it.

182
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.620
Goldfinch.

183
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.480
Oops!

184
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.980
Goldfinch comma.

185
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:53.280
Woops.

186
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.990
Well, something happened there.

187
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.810
Let's cancel that.

188
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.120
Let's look in here, OK, birds.

189
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:09.990
Goldfinch comma, spero, comma.

190
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:16.750
All right, so now do I have that category of notes yet now I can click publish and here's the checks

191
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.440
again.

192
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.980
I usually uncheck this box here.

193
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.680
Always show the pre-published checks.

194
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.800
That's what we're looking at, the pre-published checks here.

195
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.440
So I'm going to uncheck that and click publish.

196
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.290
And then that's what this looks like.

197
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:37.600
There's one thing we're missing, though, which is the the text content, text content of this blog

198
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:37.930
post.

199
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.620
So I'm just going to click there and hit paste.

200
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.460
Now, if you just if you're like in a block, a text, a paragraph block, for example, and you hit

201
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:48.940
enter.

202
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:56.290
If you just start typing words that's going to create a paragraph block for you.

203
00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:01.990
So this now is a separate paragraph block from this above paragraph block.

204
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.940
And here are the controls for that block.

205
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.490
And so you can actually change the type of block.

206
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.480
I can transform it into any of these.

207
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.880
Suppose I wanted a heading or something else that I could transform the paragraph block.

208
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.780
I could use it there.

209
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:25.150
If I wanted this to be a link, for example, I could click Link right here and I could, you know?

210
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:32.940
Put the link in there and hit enter or click here, and then that's showing as a link and it'll be a

211
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.830
clickable link from the website.

212
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.740
If I wanted that link to open in a new tab, I could use.

213
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.850
I could use you open that again.

214
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.540
I could use this little toggle.

215
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.940
Open that link in a new tab if I want to.

216
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.120
There are some, some other things you could do with the text like bold, italic.

217
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.080
You know, all these types of things here.

218
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.840
So let's go ahead.

219
00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:00.930
And yeah, if I highlight paragraph, oops, if I had that paragraph again or even just click it, I

220
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:06.180
could and I click the link, I could unlink it if I want to or edit that.

221
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.550
In any case, if I just go ahead and highlight it and hit the back button, I've gotten rid of that.

222
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.460
This is the contents of the post over here.

223
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.260
So I'm just going to click Update over here.

224
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.780
It gives me a message post updated now.

225
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:24.390
If I click View Post now, it's going to open the post in the same tab as I have my dashboard.

226
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.520
So I generally don't do that very much.

227
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:32.460
I'll often go over to another tab and then take a look, refresh the page and see what I've got there.

228
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.410
And so this is what the blog post itself looks like.

229
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:45.800
Nice, you know, it's got that featured image and there's the tags and there, and this is the author

230
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.850
right here.

231
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.510
And this is the nickname of the author and how the name of that author is displayed.

232
00:16:53.930 --> 00:17:01.460
And so if I wanted to hit back real quick just to get back to the dashboard and then if when you're

233
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:07.130
in any editing page for a post or a page, you can hit this arrow at the top left to get back to the

234
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.180
real dashboard.

235
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.160
You can see now I'm on the Post's page.

236
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.780
And there's my post right there.

237
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.290
The author shows again that that nickname.

238
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:23.000
Now I'm going to go ahead and either under users and profile or in the admin bar, you can go under

239
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.640
your username up here and click Edit Profile.

240
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.190
Either place goes down in it.

241
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:36.140
It shows nickname required and you can display name publicly as now the only thing available is the

242
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.410
username that I used.

243
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:42.760
But if I wanted to, which I usually do, I'll put my first and last name in there.

244
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:50.180
Now that gives me the option to use my real name as the public name in there, and then I can go to

245
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.790
the bottom and click Update profile.

246
00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.990
So now if I look at this blog post, let's go ahead and refresh the page.

247
00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.310
Oops.

248
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.370
Something happened there.

249
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:07.910
Sample page, I was on the sample page, so if I go to home, something's wrong here.

250
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:14.570
It must have been from when I went and edited the site itself because there's an empty template here.

251
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.340
Let's do a little troubleshooting.

252
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.340
Go back to the editor.

253
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.160
Because I have front page enabled, I remember when I clicked add.

254
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.660
Yeah, let's go ahead and let's see.

255
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:31.800
Hmm.

256
00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.100
I'm going to get back.

257
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.480
I want to look at the templates, so I added this template here.

258
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:44.940
I don't I want to delete that front page template because it was conflicting with the template I have

259
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.840
called home.

260
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.220
And so now that I did that, the front page was deleted.

261
00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:58.240
If I look at home now, that's showing correctly as I'm in the template editor here.

262
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:05.350
So then I can go back to the dashboard and as I go back here, I can just refresh the page.

263
00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.690
And that's going to show the correct template.

264
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:15.290
And so now great, I have one of the three blog posts, and so I'll pass the video here and add the

265
00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.600
next two, and you should do the same.
