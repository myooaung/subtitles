00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.520
In this lesson, we'll explore how the default transactional email system that comes with WordPress

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.460
is not recommended on a production site and how easy it is to set up an SMTP service instead.

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.220
You'll learn how to select from a variety of services, from free to those with a cost and why you would

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.780
use them, as well as a selection of free SMTP WordPress plug ins to use.

5
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.570
We'll also look at the pricing structure of three different services, including a free one, and discuss

6
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.440
the merits of each.

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.930
By the end of this video, you'll understand how to set up a dedicated transactional email provider

8
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.150
and connected to WordPress and be able to make an educated choice about which service to use.

9
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.560
Let's take a look at transactional email and how it works in the first place.

10
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.300
And then a variety of different set ups from the default the way WordPress works, as well as some best

11
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.320
practices as far as setting up transactional, outgoing only email.

12
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.330
Now, as we've defined, transactional email is outgoing only.

13
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.900
And what that means is it's coming from the website itself and going to a single person.

14
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.990
And so here's a little diagram, an example of how this might work in the real world on a WordPress

15
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.500
web site.

16
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:24.250
You know, there might be a contact form or an e-commerce checkout happening where once the user submits

17
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.690
the form or makes a checkout, there's a submit button, of course, and the computer or the WordPress

18
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.110
website would then generate some outgoing emails.

19
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.890
So in general, two things might happen first, the the admin or you.

20
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.340
If you're the owner of the website, we'd get a notification, say this is a contact form, so you'll

21
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.770
want to know when someone fills out the contact form and you want to receive an email that states what

22
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.170
the contact form is about.

23
00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.830
You know what?

24
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.670
What's the message?

25
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.320
Why is someone filling out that contact form and what is their message, their name and their email

26
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.740
address?

27
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.060
And so that is an example of a transactional email that goes out automatically to just one person after

28
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.820
someone fills out a form and clicks the submit button.

29
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.560
And then secondly, you may have a user notification or a user confirmation email that goes out as well,

30
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.080
depending on whether this is a contact form and e-commerce check out.

31
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.320
They might get a receipt, or maybe it's even an opt in form for an email newsletter or joining an email

32
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.650
list.

33
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.130
The user would get an automated email that goes out and tells them, Hey, you've joined the the newsletter?

34
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.320
Welcome or Hey, here's the information that you submitted in the contact form.

35
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.080
Or it may be a receipt like, Hey, here's the receipt for your purchase and thank you very much.

36
00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.220
And so first, those emails go out and really, this all happens at the same time.

37
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.810
So I have it in this order.

38
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.120
First, the server receives data, you know, the server, depending on the system that you're using

39
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:15.610
the context of your contact form, the email, the e-commerce sale and the order information gets saved

40
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.880
in the database, of course, through your WordPress website.

41
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.570
And then secondly, you might get an email sent to the user and you might get an email sent to the administrator.

42
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.110
And so really, that's the way transactional email works.

43
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.000
Don't forget is outgoing only.

44
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.230
And it's also unrelated to send and receive email.

45
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.960
And so the from address that the transactional email has can really be defined as any address.

46
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.380
You can define the from address.

47
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.710
And oftentimes you can define the reply to address to let the user that receives the email.

48
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.450
If they do reply, what address should be reused for them to reply?

49
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:04.990
And so as we look at the WordPress default setup for outgoing email, WordPress comes with an outgoing

50
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:14.440
email system that relies on the website server and its P program and under underlying server infrastructure

51
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.060
and programming to be able to power outgoing email through the website.

52
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:27.670
And I have this with a Red X in the checkbox here next to, you know, the first type of setup.

53
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.470
This is the WordPress default.

54
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.280
If you install WordPress on a server, that's a live server like a shared server, for example, and

55
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.030
you set up a contact form and use it.

56
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.010
It will use the default email system, which is called Send Mail, Send Mail as a function within the

57
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.150
AP language, and it is basically using the same IP address that the website is using.

58
00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:05.590
And it's also not a verified email or IP address as far as using the the DNS records and things like

59
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.460
that to make sure that this IP address here doesn't get listed as a spammers IP address and blacklisted.

60
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.390
And so that's the biggest reason why this is not a good way to go because you're first using the same

61
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.800
IP address as the website.

62
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:29.320
It's not verified or authenticated, and by default, usually you'll see a firm address as WordPress

63
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.170
at your domain dot com, which really usually isn't set up as a receivable.

64
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.920
You know, email address that can that can receive a reply.

65
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.390
And so I would not suggest using the default IP send mail.

66
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:52.390
The best managed WordPress hosts set up an SMTP outgoing email system for you in the background and

67
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.840
allow you to set up a send grid or other.

68
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.140
Free service to power your outgoing transactional email for you without using send mail.

69
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:13.000
The much better way to go is to use a transactional SMTP email provider alongside a plug in on your

70
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.350
WordPress website.

71
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.140
And so again, it takes a little bit more setup, but it has a lot of advantages that I've alluded to

72
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.090
in previous lessons.

73
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.570
But within this diagram, here's really how it works.

74
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.920
The IP address is for the website only in this case.

75
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.140
Again, you might have a contact form.

76
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.370
You might have an e-commerce receipt that needs to go out or even an opt in form.

77
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.730
And when people are filling out that form, they're navigating to your web site using a particular IP

78
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.150
address.

79
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.460
And when you set up a transactional email provider, which we're going to go over, some of them next,

80
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:59.440
it will use a special IP address that is only used for email and it is warmed up and protected from

81
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.760
being used in spam and from being blacklisted.

82
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.810
And so depending on the service that you use the IP addresses for email only and you can verify your

83
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:17.470
domain within their service so that your domain doesn't get blacklisted as far as a spammer.

84
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:24.760
And so there are a couple of different levels of transactional SMTP email that you can use.

85
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:34.750
SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, and so you need to set up both a transactional email

86
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:40.120
provider and an SMTP plug in through your WordPress website.

87
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.860
Each of those is for each outgoing email only for transactional emails.

88
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.790
And there are three ways to get this done.

89
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.990
There are low cost ways, and then there are very low cost ways.

90
00:07:53.290 --> 00:08:00.100
Outgoing email is, you know, if it's a small number of emails, I recommend going with one of the

91
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:06.100
companies that has a free service that limits the number of emails per day that you can that you can

92
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.890
use, but they remain free forever.

93
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.910
Two of those are SendGrid and also Postmark.

94
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:19.270
Postmark has a free service that's 100 emails a day, and SendGrid has a service that's 100 emails a

95
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.570
day.

96
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.600
And when you set that up, there's only one negative.

97
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.040
And and really, that is well, of course, you've got 100 email per day limit, but for a small website,

98
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.530
it's usually plenty.

99
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:37.750
The only thing that is that with SendGrid in particular, I found that the IP address in the free level

100
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:45.310
can sometimes be compromised because there are, you know, bad actors that create a spambots that use

101
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:51.940
the free services until they get kicked off, and they compromised the IP addresses reputation.

102
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.940
And so SendGrid has to manage that over time.

103
00:08:55.150 --> 00:09:02.110
And so the IP addresses that the free SendGrid service is using aren't always the best as far as email,

104
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.300
deliverability and speed.

105
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.210
And sometimes they can be listed on blacklists.

106
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.770
Now, SendGrid also has a paid service, as do these other companies spark post.

107
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.970
We're going to talk about Amazon simple email service in a little bit more detail.

108
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.290
Mail Gun Mandrill are a little more expensive.

109
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:26.080
Mandrell is the transactional email service provided by MailChimp, which you may have heard of, and

110
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.860
then Miller Lite is a good, good provider as well.

111
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:36.970
I've used SendGrid Amazon Spark post and I've heard a lot of good things about Postmark as well.

112
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.470
And so one of the things that these do is they enable you to verify your domain with the DNS records

113
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.580
similar to what we did with a custom hosted email address with send and receive email.

114
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.590
So that's only half of the setup.

115
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:58.360
The other half is that you need to set up an SMTP plug in a simple mail transfer protocol plug in for

116
00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:58.870
WordPress.

117
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:03.520
There are several good ones, a longstanding one used to be called postman.

118
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.530
Now it's called post SMTP.

119
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.740
All of these work with any of these services.

120
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.000
WP forms SMTP is a great one.

121
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.920
The two that I really do recommend for one, they work with all these services.

122
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.160
But for another, they both work with Amazon simple email service and you'll see why in a minute is

123
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:34.810
fluent SMTP and WP Offload six as he stands for simple email service from Amazon's RWC Amazon Web Services.

124
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:42.760
And so the thing about some of most of these, all of these services, with the exception of Amazon,

125
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.270
they work, you know, on a on a monthly fee.

126
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:54.190
You know, you've got a monthly fee for using theirs, their paid version of their service.

127
00:10:54.490 --> 00:11:01.270
And it's it's generally very low and they do provide you with the DNS records for verification and,

128
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.920
you know, an IP address that they.

129
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:14.120
Manage the the fluent SMTP and WP offload, six plug ins allow you to use Amazon six and Amazon six

130
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:21.110
is different in that they don't use a monthly fee for a certain number of emails per day, like in the

131
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:27.950
thousands, but they just charge you per email set at a very, very low cost.

132
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:35.060
And this is why Amazon six crosses over into broadcast or marketing email in bulk, which we'll talk

133
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.890
about in the next few lessons.

134
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:43.160
But to set up Amazon six takes a little bit more more effort to set up.

135
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:49.610
But in the long run, it ends up being just as secure, with managed IP addresses separate from your

136
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:55.880
website, but a lot cheaper for transactional email if you're going to pay for transactional email.

137
00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:03.530
I recommend going with Amazon simple email service and use one of these two plug ins fluent SMTP or

138
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.940
WP Offload S6 Lite.

139
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:12.800
They have a paid version, but the Lite version is a free version that is almost as functional as the

140
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.670
free version now.

141
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:20.150
The fluent SMTP plug in does everything that the paid version of WP Offload does, and so that's the

142
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.380
one I prefer these days.

143
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:29.150
Fluent SMTP with Amazon six, it's probably the best way to go about setting up transactional email.

144
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.760
So let's look at a few of these services on their websites.

145
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:41.530
This is SendGrid or now called Twilio Standard because they also manage SMS texting, which is a great

146
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.390
service if you're going to use them for that.

147
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.190
SendGrid is a great company.

148
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:50.170
They do have the free plan when you click Start for free right here.

149
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.430
Bill, talk about, Oh, let's just talk about signing you up.

150
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.000
But the way they're free service works, it's not really a free trial.

151
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:04.240
You don't need to put a payment method in, but you get 100 emails per day forever.

152
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:09.550
And that's the same way Postmark works postmark at postmark apple.com.

153
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:17.770
They talk about this these these pricing levels $10 a month for $10 10000 emails per month and up from

154
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:18.190
there.

155
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:23.860
And you can have your own dedicated IP address for a fee.

156
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.060
That service is a lot cheaper with Amazon six as well.

157
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.620
But then they also talk about the free trial is not really a trial.

158
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.060
All new accounts start off on the free developer plan, which is really meant for testing.

159
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:43.780
Same is true of SendGrid because you get one hundred emails and not per day per month at postmark,

160
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.570
and that then at SendGrid.

161
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:58.510
If you look at the plans and pricing page, the free free service allows for 100 emails per day, not

162
00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.010
per month.

163
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:04.870
And so I would recommend if you're going to go with a free transactional email provider, the SendGrid

164
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:09.820
Free Service, even though sometimes their APIs get tagged a little bit or blacklisted.

165
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:16.300
They're a great service for free postmark, a little more expensive, and it's 100 emails per month.

166
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.920
Now just let's take a quick look at Amazon MWC.

167
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:30.040
Amazon Web Services is generally a little more complex to setup than than other services, not just

168
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:39.220
simple email service, but a WC hosting and other services that they offer in the web space.

169
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.450
And there's a console that you sign into that has all of your controls.

170
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:50.080
But there are these plug ins, like I mentioned, fluent SMTP and WP offload.

171
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:55.990
Yes, that make it easier to set up transactional email through the Amazon Simple Email Service.

172
00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:07.440
So if you look at the pricing page on Amazon, yes, now you do get it for free if you're hosted at

173
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.370
one of their more expensive hosting instances.

174
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.740
But if you're sending from, you know, another software package, which WordPress qualifies as that,

175
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.110
it's 10 cents for every thousand emails you send.

176
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:27.450
And so really, if you send 10000 emails in a month, that would only be a dollar.

177
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.610
And so it's quite inexpensive for transactional email.

178
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:39.030
And that's one of the reasons why it crosses over into broadcast and marketing email because you can

179
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:46.440
send a large number of outgoing emails through simple email service from Amazon very inexpensively.
