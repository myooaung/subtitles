1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,090
In this lesson, we'll migrate a live website behind the scenes using a staging area at grid pain and

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,550
only pointing the domain to the new site.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,240
Once the site migration is complete, you'll learn how the WP Migrate DB Pro plug in works requiring

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:22,350
two live URLs to migrate between and how you can manage the DNS so that the original site stays up while

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,790
the migration is taking place.

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,490
By the end of this video, you'll understand how to migrate a site without any downtime by strategically

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,170
managing the domains DNS.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,520
This next migration project I want to show you is a real life web site that I'm migrating from my site

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,610
ground account over to grid pain.

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,910
And so I've already started the process of migrating because there are email addresses involved and

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:55,110
I do have the DNS and the domain name registered and the DNS using Cloudflare.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:03,870
And so I have easy to change Cloudflare DNS records that I can use that have almost instant change because

13
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,110
Cloudflare so closely connected to the internet and fast.

14
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,230
And so you can see the DNS records here for right now, there's an AA record for the domain name, and

15
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,460
it goes to this 35 dot to await IP address.

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,950
So I'll show you over at my site ground account.

17
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,950
Here's Elevate Animal Rehab dot com and there's the site IP 35 Dot two 08.

18
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:34,290
And so what I want to do is a no downtime migration of the website, so it's seamless for any visitors

19
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,710
and that website will be migrated over and then they can change the DNS once the website is live.

20
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:50,250
And I'm going to use a great migration plugin called WP Migrate DB Pro by the company Delicious Brains,

21
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,310
and there is a free version at the WordPress.org repository that migrates just the database.

22
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,380
And it's the same company that makes that better.

23
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,230
Search and replace plug in that we used in a previous lesson for changing the database right from the

24
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,160
WordPress dashboard.

25
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,630
But this is a database migration plug in and the paid version.

26
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:18,180
The pro version of WP Migrate DB Pro allows you to do seamless migrations, including all the files

27
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,160
for the website, as well as the database, including the media and the plugins and themes folders.

28
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,320
And so I'm going to migrate from site ground over here to grid pain.

29
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,610
For now, I'll just show you that I do have the email already moved over to Rackspace email hosting,

30
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,340
and in the next section of the course, we'll talk about the different types of email and email hosting.

31
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,010
But for now, just take note that I have the a record pointing at the site ground website.

32
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,740
And so when we navigate to the real website, this website is hosted at site ground at that IP address.

33
00:02:53,190 --> 00:03:01,560
So the first thing I've done is I've gone into the website itself and under plug ins, I've installed

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:09,090
and activated the WP Migrate DB Pro plug in and the two associated plug ins in my pro licence, the

35
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,420
media files and the theme and plug in files plugins.

36
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,990
What that does is it gives me an opportunity to go into tools in this website and under the Migrate

37
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,370
DB Pro settings.

38
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:30,540
I'm going to look under settings right here and I want to give permissions from this website to go ahead

39
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:38,250
and push what this website to another website that I have hosted elsewhere, which I'll be setting up

40
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,110
on this in this lesson with grid pain.

41
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,940
I want a pull request.

42
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,350
I want to process requests to pull data from this install.

43
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,060
Copying it elsewhere.

44
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,660
And so I'm going to go ahead and turn on the pull permissions.

45
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,390
And I've already put my license key in here.

46
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,000
And so that allows me to use the other two plugins.

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,580
And so those that's all the settings I need to make at the origin website right now.

48
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:09,750
Now I'm going to go ahead and I've already put in the web address and, you know, auto create the system

49
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:16,530
user, and I just wanted to show you that I'm going to click the advanced options checkbox next to staging

50
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:16,890
site.

51
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,730
And because the way that WP Migrate DB Pro works is it works on domain names.

52
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,850
And so it works between two live sites that exist at two different domain names.

53
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:37,050
And because we are moving this website from one domain name Elevate Animal Rehab dot com to the same

54
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,620
domain name, Elevate Animal Rehab.

55
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,320
What we have to do is bring it into a staging environment, which is at a subdomain in great pain,

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,090
so it will be staging Dot Elevate, Animal Rehab, Dakar.

57
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,910
And what I'll do once I create that, I'll allow this site to be built now on the server and what I'll

58
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,850
do after that site is live, I'll take.

59
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,150
And make a DNS record for that staging subdomain.

60
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,070
And I'll point it at the IP address for the grid pain server.

61
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,290
And so as that creates right here, I know that this is the IP address right here.

62
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,350
And so I could just start by copying that IP address and going over to the DNS records.

63
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,160
What I need to do is over here in the Cloudflare DNS is actually create another a record which is going

64
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:34,000
to put the sub domain and point it to the new IP address, while the regular Elevate Animal Rehab dot

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
com domain name points to the site ground address.

66
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,810
While we make these changes and the site migration, pure staging, dot elevate, animal rehab dot com.

67
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,830
And I know that it's at that original IP address for the server.

68
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:57,580
Now, if I just go and click the single sign on button since I created the DNS record for staging Dot

69
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:05,710
Elevate Animal Rehab dot com that will open a subdomain and open another tab in my browser at staging

70
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,080
data, a little elevate animal rehab dot com.

71
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,280
And that's just a an empty and freshly installed WordPress site.

72
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,320
If we go to visit site, I'll right click and open that in a new tab.

73
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,900
You can see that it's just a regular empty WordPress site under appearance themes.

74
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,780
There's just the twenty two theme is activated, and there's another couple default themes from WordPress

75
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,020
here.

76
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,740
So now all I need to do is go under plug ins and add new.

77
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,580
And now remember, we're working in the staging environment here, and so the real website is not being

78
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,270
affected at all at the Elevate Animal Rehab dot com site.

79
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:53,320
This is still over at site ground and so under here or under ad plugins, I'm going to go ahead and

80
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,860
upload the three plugins that I showed you that I had on the original site, the WP Migrate DB Pro,

81
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,640
and I'll pass the video while I go ahead and do that and enter my license key again.

82
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:12,280
So now I've got all three plug ins, the WP Migrant DV Pro, the media files and the themin plugin files

83
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,390
plugins activated and I've ended my license key as well.

84
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:25,440
So if I go over here under settings or is it tools under Migrate DB Pro, I can go to Settings.

85
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,760
And now for this new site at the staging environment, I want to give permissions to push overwriting

86
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,990
the data on this install.

87
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,250
So here's where it describes that process.

88
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:44,350
It's the opposite as the other site, which is the origin site process requests to push data to this

89
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,820
install, overwriting its data.

90
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:54,940
So a click push and now that that saved, I'm ready to begin the migration process and so on the staging

91
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:02,860
site here if I click Migrate and what I want to do is I want to replace this site with another site,

92
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,680
I'm going to go and ahead and click pull.

93
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,520
I want to replace this site at staging with the other site.

94
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,670
And so it's asking me for on the remote site.

95
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:19,480
There's a site URL and secret key that is provided in the other plug in on that on the origin site.

96
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,090
So I'm going to go back over here to elevate animal rehab dot com and under the connection info under

97
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:25,570
settings.

98
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,560
Here's where I have the connection info, so that's all I need.

99
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:35,950
I just click copy to copy to the clipboard and then I'll go back over to the staging environment here

100
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,750
and paste that right here.

101
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,180
And now it's establishing a connection.

102
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,950
And since it's done that successfully, I can move down and select what I'd like to do.

103
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,780
And so I want to pull.

104
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,250
Basically, I want to pull everything.

105
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,760
I'm just going to use all the default settings.

106
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,220
It's going to do a standard find and replace because it's going to go into the database and it's going

107
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:04,420
to replace the Elevate domain with this staging dot elevate domain and the same thing here, it will

108
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:10,750
find the actual server location and then replace it with the server location of the new server at grid

109
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,200
pane here.

110
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,120
You can see that these are different structures, and so I don't have to customize anything here.

111
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,270
And I do want to turn on and bring all the media files, and I also want to turn on the theme files

112
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,850
and can bring all the themes across.

113
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,890
Or I could just pull only the active themes, which I'm using Devi on that site.

114
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,240
So I'm going to go ahead and do that.

115
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,670
I don't need all these extra themes from the origin site, and I also want to pull the plug in files

116
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:44,020
and there is one plug in that I don't have to do, and that is the site ground optimizer plug in.

117
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,390
That's not something that I need over at Grid Plant.

118
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:52,660
And so I'm going to uncheck Site Ground Optimizer and check the email encoder plugin that I have activated

119
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,140
over there.

120
00:09:53,530 --> 00:10:01,300
Now all I have to do is click pull, and it's going to give me messages as it goes and pulls the site

121
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:01,960
across.

122
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,270
It'll tell me what it's doing at each stage.

123
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:09,910
It's bringing the database tables across and it's going to go ahead and bring the media files and the

124
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,040
theme files and then the plugin files.

125
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:18,820
OK, well, it only took a couple more seconds and it gave me a success message and as normal, it's

126
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,240
forcing me to log in again under a different username.

127
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:29,860
Now, because we've migrated the entire site from the regular domain name over to the staging domain

128
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:37,030
at a different place, now I need to use the login details that I have over it grid pane.

129
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,870
Now I just need to go to staging that elevate animal rehab dot com and click the little single sign

130
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,520
on button with the little W.

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,730
And that will sign me in with whatever secure password that it had created for me and grid pain when

132
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,600
I set up the site.

133
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:59,620
And so now it looks like I'm at staging and it's now the site titles changed, and so it looks like

134
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,880
everything is working.

135
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:06,520
Let's go ahead and open the site itself in another tab and I can take a look.

136
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:12,910
And it looks like all the images have come across the home page here, and there's an easy contact page.

137
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,050
Great.

138
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,330
All right.

139
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,570
Everything seems to be working.

140
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:27,610
And so now I have an exact copy of the original site at Elevate Animal Rehab dot com over at Staging

141
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,430
Dot, Elevate Animal Rehab dot com.

142
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:37,540
And now that I can see that everything is working correctly, let's just look at the Elevate website.

143
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:47,560
Ingrid Payne And while I'm here, let's look at the domains and there is an SSL certificate active for

144
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,000
live animal rehab.

145
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,960
And so that's looking good when I bring it to the live site, that's going to be working.

146
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:07,000
So before I change the DNS, if I point this domain over to the new IP address, I haven't pushed the

147
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,240
staging site over to the live site yet.

148
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,460
And so that's the last step that I have to do before I change the DNS records.

149
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,440
So I'll go over to staging here.

150
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,100
And go down to elevate animal rehab.

151
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:29,540
And then what I want to do is take the staging and take it to the live side, and the push type I want

152
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:35,480
is all files and the complete database can leave this as the default and I'll click push staging to

153
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:35,960
life.

154
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:41,300
And now what I'll do is make a check to make sure that the staging environment is using all the same

155
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,180
settings as the live environment.

156
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,320
So there's nothing different.

157
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,870
And then I can just click push staging to life.

158
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:53,720
So it's giving me a little green staging push started depending on the size of the site.

159
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,030
This can take a little bit of time now.

160
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:03,440
This is quite a small site, so it should take only a few seconds really to push it onto the live environment.

161
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:10,280
Give me a whole bunch of periodic messages to tell me how things are going, and I can also look at

162
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,550
the log files in great pain to see how things are going here.

163
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,750
Live success, everything cleaned up and I've got as I close these messages over here, I've got the

164
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,780
green bar that says staging push completed.

165
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:34,310
And now I know that this exact copy that I had over at staging is now live at the real server over here

166
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,210
at grid pain.

167
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,630
And so I could just go over to sites.

168
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:46,240
When I look at live animal rehab down here, I could see that it's at this IP address.

169
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,020
Now, I'm just copying that IP address to my clipboard.

170
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,450
I can go over here to Cloudflare.

171
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:00,550
And if I just go to the a record and I'll edit that a record now, I'm just going to go ahead and paste

172
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,980
it right into there and click Save.

173
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:11,610
And now that should be totally done, and now I have a live say at the new at the original domain name.

174
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:17,940
And I know that it's hosted in the new place so I can turn off my hosting site ground here.

175
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,900
I know that in the DNS, I'm pointing everything to the IP address is reflected in my grid pain account

176
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,310
for the server and everything is looking good.

177
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,270
Awesome.

178
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,520
Little more complex of a migration.

179
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:38,730
But oftentimes you need to figure out ways to solve problems depending on what you're trying to do in

180
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,360
your migration.
