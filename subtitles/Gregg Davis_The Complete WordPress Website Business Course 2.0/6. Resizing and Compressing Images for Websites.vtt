00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.880
In this lesson, I'll go over three methods of resizing and compressing images for use with WordPress

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.480
websites.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.060
You'll see how you can use a plug in to let WordPress do this during the upload process, which allows

4
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.800
clients or site owners to avoid using images that are too large on their own sites.

5
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.660
Then I'll show you how I use Photoshop, as well as suggest a free alternative.

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.450
By the end of this video, you'll know of a few solutions that will ensure your website images are appropriately

7
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.690
sized and compressed for a fast loading website.

8
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.480
When working with WordPress and building custom websites, you'll invariably need to be working with

9
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.700
images and compressing and resizing them for website use.

10
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.810
You really want to make images that are, you know, no larger than they need to be as far as pixel

11
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.470
size and also know larger as far as a file size.

12
00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.700
So a good recommended range that I like to use is, you know, no bigger than 2000 or 2048 pixels at

13
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:09.370
the long side, usually with and then no more than 200 kilobytes in size for the image, even if it's

14
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.270
a very, very large background image that spans the whole screen.

15
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.270
And so there's a couple of different ways you can deal with this.

16
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.580
One of which is installing a plug in.

17
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.380
Now, some of these plug ins are free plug ins that allow you to resize and compress images as they're

18
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.670
uploaded into WordPress.

19
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.810
Now, these can be convenient ways to allow a client or a website owner to upload large sized images

20
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.750
directly from their camera without having to use Photoshop or another program to resize and compress

21
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.890
those images first.

22
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.790
Often, they don't compress as far as as well as Photoshop, and you don't have custom control over

23
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.170
what the images look like.

24
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.050
But it can prevent the problem of having super large, you know, five megabyte images in the media

25
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.230
library, which can be a problem for website loading speed.

26
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.660
So I recommend the first few here.

27
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.610
Image Optimizer is probably the most popular plug in that you can set to resize and compress images

28
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.710
on their way into your media library.

29
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:19.750
I also like Smosh by PMU Dev, and there are a couple of others down here that a lot of folks use that

30
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.230
actually plug in to paid services that work very well.

31
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.640
This short Pixel Image Optimizer plugs into a paid service for doing that, and so that's one solution.

32
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.540
Another one.

33
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.510
And what I generally use is Photoshop.

34
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.670
Here in Photoshop, I've got a large image from my canon digital SLR camera loaded up here.

35
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.700
The original image as a JPEG, and if I open image image size, I can get some data.

36
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.170
It's a pretty large image, and it's 5000 more than 5000 pixels across on the long side.

37
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.040
And so what I'll generally do is resize it down to if I want it available as a full with background

38
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.840
image, I can leave it at 2048 2048 pixels wide and click OK and leave it so that it's proportionally

39
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.780
going to be the same.

40
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:20.500
It's not stretched, and so it'll choose the size for me in that way, and then I can go to file export

41
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.260
and export as in Photoshop.

42
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.520
Now I can choose to use some different photo types or file types.

43
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.990
I should say a PNG file is a way to use to do graphics or an image that you need to remove the background

44
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.280
and make a transparency so that the color or graphics behind can show through and JPEG is more for a

45
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.300
photographic image.

46
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:52.510
And so with this 2048 by 13 65 pixel image now by default, now as a JPEG, it's going to compress it

47
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.590
at this level of quality to eight and 15k.

48
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.610
But I want to bring this slider down so that I can get it around 200 kilobytes.

49
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.820
Now, when I export that, I can choose to save it anywhere on my computer here on my desktop.

50
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.650
This is burro days, and I usually append the word Web on the end just to tell me that I've saved it

51
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:21.010
for the web, meaning I've compressed and resized this image to an appropriate size for a web site.

52
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:27.850
So if I go and take a look at it, we could see that the quality is good and the size and the file size

53
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.000
are good compressed sizes for a web site.

54
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.940
I've opened it up in windows using the File Explorer, and I can see that as I make it larger, it's

55
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.800
a very high quality image.

56
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.680
And there's the percentage up at the top that's about 100 percent.

57
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.290
And so that really is looking great as an image that I can bring into the WordPress media library now.

58
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.860
And so that's a quick tutorial on how to use Photoshop to do this.

59
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:03.150
And if you want a free option, there is a very good free option and there are some online that do image

60
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.250
compression quite a lot of them, but it's hard to find one that does resizing for you as well.

61
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:16.920
This Pixel three XL XCOM either quick and easy or the advanced photo editor, either one of those are

62
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.070
based in your browser and are kind of like a Photoshop clone or a program that's just like Photoshop.

63
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.540
So you can use that to resize and compress images on your own if you like for free.

64
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.080
And those are three options for doing some graphic design in preparation for working with your WordPress

65
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.620
websites.
