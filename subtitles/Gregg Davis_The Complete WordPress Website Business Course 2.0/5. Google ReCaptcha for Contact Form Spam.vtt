00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.070
In this lesson, we'll set up a system to prevent contact form spam submissions from bots.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.980
You'll use the free Google reCAPTCHA service and connected to the form so that automated programs and

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.930
spam submissions can be prevented.

4
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.390
By the end of this video, you'll understand how to limit extra server resources from being wasted by

5
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.550
spambots and prevent annoying emails from getting to yours or your clients email boxes.

6
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.200
Let's add a quick piece of functionality to our contact form.

7
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.670
Let's prevent comment spam by adding a recapture functionality through Google's recapture in flip forms.

8
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.990
It's easy to set that up, but let's take a look at our website first and just see what we'll be adding

9
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.390
here if we go to the contact page.

10
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.740
Of course, the form is here, and nothing's to prevent someone from filling out this form and sending

11
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.230
it, even if it's.

12
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.500
Nothing's to prevent a bat or a spider from crawling the internet, looking for forms like this to fill

13
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.920
out, to try to get links or other things posted on the internet automatically, a reCAPTCHA system

14
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.400
is something that captures and blocks an automated submission that's not a real human submission.

15
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.230
And so if we go back to the dashboard, let's open flip forms and look at all forms.

16
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.090
And what we can do is set up the integration modules within fluent forms.

17
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.240
And actually, it's global settings where we want to set up a reCAPTCHA system.

18
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.100
Now, Google reCAPTCHA is a really popular free service that's easy to setup.

19
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.060
I use it for all of my client websites, for contact forms and for comments or comment forms within

20
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.630
WordPress.

21
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.970
And there's two versions.

22
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.880
The Version two is something you might be familiar with.

23
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.960
That's when it brings up a screen where you have to pick a series of images that match and it's actually

24
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.540
actually a visible reCAPTCHA system.

25
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.290
Version three is an invisible reCAPTCHA that does something in the background to prevent those bots

26
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.200
from putting automated spam submissions into your contact form and can just prevent your server from

27
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.270
being overloaded and also prevent the annoying emails that come in from automated bot spam comments

28
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.550
and spam contact form submissions.

29
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.160
And so we'll be using version three.

30
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.870
And so it'll be invisible to the user, but it will block most, if not all, spam submissions to your

31
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.890
contact forms.

32
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.940
And so let's take a look at reCAPTCHA at Google.com slash reCAPTCHA.

33
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.200
When you go there, it takes you to their about page and you can read a little bit about how reCAPTCHA

34
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.620
works, but it's easy enough to set up.

35
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.340
You do have to be logged into an active Google account to set it up.

36
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.820
But if you go to version three admin console up here, you can see that it tells you how many sites

37
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.010
are set up, and all you have to do is click the Plus button to create a new site.

38
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.590
And so I'm going to put this as.

39
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.230
Just a reference name for me.

40
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.410
And then you can choose your reCAPTCHA type version three or version to the version three, they say

41
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.760
requests it with a score.

42
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.780
Version two request with a challenge, which is a visible challenge.

43
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.590
So I'm going to choose reCAPTCHA version three and then I'm going to add the domain name here and you

44
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.880
fill it in right here without the HTTPS or anything like that.

45
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.610
And so I'm going to go ahead and just grab that from the website here.

46
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.860
That is my sandbox website address without the protocol HTTPS in the front.

47
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:12.470
And then my, you know, owner is right here, you have to accept the reCAPTCHA terms of service.

48
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.480
You can have it send alerts if there's any issue or anything and just click Submit.

49
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.570
Once you click Submit, it brings you to a place where it shows you your psyche and your secret key.

50
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.950
And you may have noticed you have to paste these into the fluid forms area.

51
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.970
So I'll copy the site key and I'll go back into here and paste that into the site.

52
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.800
Key area in the fluid forms settings area, global settings.

53
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.670
Then go back.

54
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.840
I'll copy the secret key and paste it in there.

55
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.700
And then you can click Save Settings, so it says that it's been saved and test the real phone with

56
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.960
reCAPTCHA enabled and always generally works automatically as far as as my forms go.

57
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.290
And so now we're in this contact form area and it should be done.

58
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.800
Let's go ahead and test the form out.

59
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.670
I'll just refresh the page.

60
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.380
Make sure there's no error or anything on the page, and I'll go ahead and fill it out.

61
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.690
You know, I don't need a first name and last name as you remember, just the email and the message

62
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.340
are what's required.

63
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:32.150
And so you can just put a valid email address and testing reCAPTCHA.

64
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.020
If I hit Send the progress bar and then thank you for your message.

65
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.900
Now I'll just pause the video and go over and make sure I received the notification email to my email

66
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.260
address.

67
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.220
Great, I got the notification, I don't know if you noticed, but I mistyped the email address that

68
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.740
I submitted there, it just has to be a valid email address in terms of its syntax, meaning it has

69
00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:02.870
to have a name, the at symbol and then a something dot com or something else just to show that it is

70
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.220
in the valid email format.

71
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:12.150
However, I missed out the email and so if I had that and notification going out to to the customer,

72
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.400
the person that submits the form and that wouldn't have submitted to them.

73
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.490
And I might notice that when it comes in to the contact form, plus, if the email is incorrect and

74
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.890
if I want to reply to them, then of course they put in their own wrong email address.

75
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.190
So.

76
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.840
So that wouldn't really work.

77
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:38.720
But anyway, that's how you set up reCAPTCHA, and it's a great system to prevent comment spam in WordPress,

78
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.660
but especially contact form spam inside of your clients and your websites.
