00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,760
WordPress is a free, open source software tool that allows websites to be created and managed with

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,830
a variety of designs and functionality.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,320
Well, it started out as a blogging tool.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,920
It's now known as a full fledged CMS or a content management system, and powers more than 40 percent

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,230
of websites on the entire internet, according to W3 Tech's WordPress powers.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,060
Forty three percent of all the websites on the internet, including those without a content management

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,960
system or with a custom coded CMS, the core software is free and open source built and maintained by

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,960
volunteers, and that means anyone can use or change it in any way for personal or commercial projects

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,830
for no charge.

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,740
And for that reason, there's been many, many extra tools developed in and around the WordPress software

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,860
ecosystem for both free and paid usage.

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,800
WordPress, the open source software otherwise known as self-hosted WordPress, is found and documented

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,730
at WordPress.org, and that's the software we're using in this course.

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,420
There's a commercial version of WordPress available in a curated environment at WordPress.com, but

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,650
in this course we're only learning about self-hosted WordPress from WordPress.org.

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,740
The WordPress.com version has its uses and limitations and is different from the open source version.

17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,540
So if you've found yourself using that environment change over to the open source version that we use

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,250
in the course, I'll show you how to install and use WordPress in later sections.

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,340
We have a free 60 day trial from flywheel hosting available for you to build your own practice site,

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,290
and there's also two sandbox environments I make available for students that I'll tell you about in

21
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:37,710
a little bit.

22
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,590
In any case, WordPress Dawg is where you can download the WordPress open source software, and it's

23
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,410
also where all the developer documentation is available.
