1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,940
In this lesson, we'll talk about the other benefits of using a third party DNS provider like Cloudflare.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,970
You'll learn how I point domains from a different domain registrar to Cloudflare using name servers

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,920
and then continue the setup to a complete website at a new domain connected with grid pain hosting.

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,220
By the end of this video, you'll understand how to connect Cloudflare to domains that you may already

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,190
own or that clients have registered elsewhere.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:33,930
Let's look at how DNS systems and DNS records work to point traffic through a domain name to different

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,370
places on the internet, depending on what you're trying to do.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,140
And I'll show you how this works with a website address that I'm not currently using and how I could

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,640
set it up if I don't have it registered as a domain at Cloudflare.

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,200
But I want to run my traffic through Cloudflare for the DNS.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,540
And so this is just a little screen that shows you kind of what DNS is.

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,240
And basically, it's a way to point traffic.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:06,570
Like I mentioned from one domain name through two different places a records point to an IP address

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,770
and sea name records point to a domain name.

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:19,230
And so that is convenient for pointing subdomains correctly, like something like staging dot domain,

16
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,760
Gqom or something like that.

17
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,790
And then there's something called text records, text records.

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,580
Those often are used to verify a domain with a service like if you're using an outgoing email service

19
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:38,430
like Amazon, a simple email service, you can put a text record into the DNS and then allow that company

20
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,010
to verify that you own that domain name and then mix record, stand for mail, exchange your records

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,220
and by controlling your own DNS records.

22
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,680
This is how you can separate your email hosting from your website.

23
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:01,530
And so we do need to still use name servers in a way to be able to control our DNS at a separate provider

24
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,820
like Cloudflare.

25
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,590
So let's go back to the website browser here, and I'm looking in my GoDaddy account where I have a

26
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,350
website domain that I have a registered called Greg Davis Dot Club.

27
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,200
And this isn't a domain that I've used yet, but I'll just show you as an example how I would point

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,850
this domain through to Cloudflare and then from Cloudflare, be able to bring it into my hosting company,

29
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,490
which I'm using now called grid pin, as you know.

30
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,560
And so looking at GoDaddy, what I did was I went to all my domains and I clicked on the domain name

31
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,070
and I went to manage the DNS.

32
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,060
So here under DNS is where that would be.

33
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,790
I can look at the different zones, but I'm on the DNS page right now for this domain name and these

34
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,900
are my DNS records.

35
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,260
So right now that a record is actually parked.

36
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:02,220
What happens is if you if you just register a domain name at GoDaddy and leave it alone, they send

37
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:09,440
it to a parking page where if anyone clicks around and goes into GoDaddy, it's like a referral.

38
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,190
They would get that business.

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,830
And so that's not bringing anything to me.

40
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:21,360
The name servers that are associated with GoDaddy by default, are ones that the domain control dot

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,830
com domain name.

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,450
That's a GoDaddy domain name.

43
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,870
And so there's other things like this si name record, like I mentioned, if anyone were to navigate

44
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,250
to UWW.

45
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,320
This allows a redirect to the regular domain name Greg Davis Dot Club.

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,200
And so that's basically the default settings for a GoDaddy registered domain name.

47
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,980
Other registrars would work similarly, like Network Solutions or Namecheap if you've registered domains

48
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,280
there.

49
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,980
But what if I wanted to point my domain to Cloudflare?

50
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,560
If you go to Cloudflare and you get an account at Cloudflare, you could click ad site up here at the

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,420
right or there's a blue button often and then you just put your domain name right in here.

52
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,800
So let's do that.

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:14,610
Let's go Gray Davis Dot Club and click ad site, and it brings you to select a plan.

54
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,230
And there's three paid plans.

55
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,530
But the free plan is what I'd recommend because it gives you so many great benefits for free.

56
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,160
Otherwise, it's $20 per month per website for other services that aren't really necessary, especially

57
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,040
if you have a great website hosts like grid pain.

58
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,450
And so I'm going to click that free and click Continue and then to set this up there.

59
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:46,800
The Cloudflare Company website will scan the existing DNS records, and it will build them for me inside

60
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,610
this DNS.

61
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,870
Now, like I mentioned, the DNS right now is live and being controlled by GoDaddy, and so Cloudflare

62
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,540
goes and sees, OK, what are the necessary DNS records that if we did point?

63
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,240
Traffic from there away from the DNS of GoDaddy.

64
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,350
What DNS records would we need to be live to have nothing change?

65
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,810
And that's this a record, this sea name and then this other sea name record right here.

66
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,870
And so generally, the minimum is one, a record and one sea name record for the W WW version.

67
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,290
And so, OK, that's just, you know, it's telling me that I don't have any Amex records, so I know

68
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,680
that I don't have any email set up right now, so I can ignore that.

69
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,730
And this looks correct.

70
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,080
So I'll click continue.

71
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,880
And now I get these instructions.

72
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,800
I want to remove these two name servers which detected Remember Over and GoDaddy.

73
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:43,540
These are what the default name servers are, and I want to change those name servers to Cloudflare

74
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,880
name servers here.

75
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,220
And these are the name servers that go to the free Cloudflare DNS controller.

76
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:57,900
And so I have to do is click to copy number one, go back to Domain Domain Manager and GoDaddy, and

77
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,890
I'll click change.

78
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,780
And then I want to enter my own name servers right here.

79
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:10,890
And so I'll go ahead and paste that first one and I'll go back and click the second one, copy it on

80
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,280
to the clipboard and paste into the second section.

81
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,560
And then I'm going to save.

82
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,140
And now GoDaddy will give me a warning because if you do update your name servers to an existing website,

83
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,160
that's up and running.

84
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,470
There's a chance that you could break things.

85
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,560
You could stop an email address from working, or you could make a website go down if your DNS records

86
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,010
are incorrect or non-existent in the new spot.

87
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:43,980
But as I mentioned, Cloudflare goes and has already found my existing domain DNS records, and so it

88
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,570
will point correctly no matter what.

89
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:51,390
So you shouldn't be fearful here, but you do have to check the box that says yes, I consent to to

90
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,790
updating the name servers and click Continue.

91
00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:00,750
Now, GoDaddy is a pretty good registrar in that they only take just a few minutes, usually to change

92
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,750
the name servers and point traffic to the new place.

93
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:10,560
But they do warn you that it could take up to 48 hours to update globally because the DNS system is

94
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,630
a domain name system that it propagates across the world and all the different hubs where internet traffic

95
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:24,900
goes through all the different places all over the world, and it can take hours or days for the DNS

96
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,890
records to completely propagate through the entire world.

97
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,040
And so there can be a delay for existing services that are up and running to change.

98
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,800
And that's why when you're changing over DNS for an existing website, you would want to have that DNS

99
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,650
really live and correct at the new place.

100
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:51,240
If there are email addresses, sometimes emails can stop working for a few minutes and then come back

101
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,570
when the DNS propagates through all the places on the internet.

102
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,400
And so while this is happening, I can go back to name servers.

103
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,150
And now that I've done that, I can click done check name servers.

104
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:09,810
And now it's just kind of telling me I can configure some things or I can skip these recommendations.

105
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:16,770
And now it takes me back to this screen where I can just make sure that everything is correct.

106
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:24,330
Now I'll receive an email from Cloudflare as soon as it detects that the name servers are, you know,

107
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,950
pointed to the right place.

108
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:31,200
Usually that happens in a number of minutes when I'm working with GoDaddy for these changes.

109
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,700
If I want to later, I can come back and I could click check name servers.

110
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,840
I often don't need to do that because it usually takes just a couple of minutes.

111
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:50,130
And then once the DNS has moved its control from GoDaddy over to Cloudflare, then I can start to make

112
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,240
some changes, like adding that website to my grid pain account.

113
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,150
Now, for example, here is my grid pain account for one of my sites, Greg Davis dot com, which is

114
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,860
a life site.

115
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:10,500
And here's where I would have the the the address, the IP address of my server and other settings that

116
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,780
I could make for this domain name.

117
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:21,720
But in a in grid pain, really, the next thing I would do is to begin to set up a new site here at

118
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,530
these sites.

119
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,590
Add new sites section right here.

120
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:32,730
And what I would do is, I would say, Greg Davis, Dart Club and I would select the server where I

121
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:39,230
want to host that and just put that on my personal dedicated server there.

122
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,010
I could select that I want to auto create a system user.

123
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:48,840
That means I can separate all these for different purposes like FTP and things like that to different

124
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,500
users.

125
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,740
So none of my sites, especially if their different client sites are, you know, can see each other.

126
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,370
And then as we go down here, it's there's an admin email and.

127
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,190
Password.

128
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:06,910
Other things to choose, like if I have a bundle set up where I have my themes and my plug ins I want

129
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,080
to use, and then the IP version, everything I kind of leave as default.

130
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,550
And the one thing I do when I set up a new site is I set up my outgoing email account, which I've connected

131
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:27,070
to my free SendGrid for outgoing email and use the primary domain SSL so that I have a secure SSL certificate.

132
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,150
And then I want to integrate with my Cloudflare DNS.

133
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,650
This is the important part.

134
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:38,410
I want to integrate Cloudflare file and then choose the API key that's labeled with this funny name

135
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,450
inside of grid pane.

136
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,240
And then I can choose whether I want to set up a staging site right away or not, and automatic updates

137
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,800
is another feature within grid pane.

138
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:54,430
You can learn about now and click the Add site button, but not until Cloudflare sees that my site is

139
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,330
up and running.

140
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:02,020
So I pause the video here and I'll check my email and then see if Cloudflare sees the change in its

141
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,670
name servers quite yet.
