00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.300
In this lesson, we'll configure the about page call to action section that we set up before with an

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.790
email opt in form connected to MailChimp.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.000
You'll see how to set up a free MailChimp API key and connected to the form plugin to be able to collect

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.430
email addresses into the MailChimp broadcast email service by the end of this video.

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.010
You'll have a tool to grow an email list and send group emails like a newsletter or marketing emails,

6
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.500
all for free up to 2000 contacts.

7
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.340
Let's add an email opt in form to the about page in our sample site here with the 2022 theme.

8
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.770
If you remember on the about page down a little bit below, we had both the latest posts block pattern

9
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.790
and there was a block pattern that says join our mailing list and just has a divider line and an area

10
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.840
for an opt in form.

11
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.970
Over here on the right hand side.

12
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.780
And so we'll be talking about the three types of email used in WordPress and hosting WordPress websites.

13
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.280
One of those types is broadcast email, and what I'll do is just briefly show you how to set up your

14
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.050
free MailChimp account.

15
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.900
Grab the API key and then put it into the Fluent Forms Settings area and enable a subscribe field and

16
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.890
button here on the about page.

17
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.960
Now, MailChimp is a great way to go because it allows you to have up to 2000 contacts in their free

18
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.560
level, and so you can have a fully functional broadcast email system to up to 2000 contacts before

19
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.050
you begin getting charged for that service.

20
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.150
From MailChimp and so it's a great place to start out for your sites or your client sites.

21
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.030
So let's take a look at MailChimp, first of all.

22
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.940
Once you sign up and have your MailChimp account, you can click your profile name over here and click

23
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.720
Account.

24
00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.100
And then on this account page under extras, you can click API keys that just gives you an API key that

25
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.420
you can create.

26
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.700
If you don't have any, it'll show you that you don't hear.

27
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.840
You can click Create a key, and that just creates a fresh API key that you can use for any purpose.

28
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.340
I like to create a separate API key for each website or each project that I'm working on and for this

29
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.650
one.

30
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.390
You know, I might go ahead and just set the name

31
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.720
of the website that I'm working on, but all you have to do is click the API key to highlight it and

32
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.860
click Control.

33
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.700
See to copy.

34
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.790
You can also hit right click and copy to do that and then back in the website here.

35
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.280
Even Fluent Forms comes with a subscription form as a an example of a subscription form that you can

36
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.580
use.

37
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.240
If you look at the subscription form by clicking Edit can see that all it is is an email address and

38
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.710
a subscribe button, and Flewitt Forms comes with a free connection to the MailChimp service, which

39
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.830
makes it really easy to set up a subscription button and a place where people can join your email list

40
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.440
and you can set this up easily for your clients.

41
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.040
It just makes it easy.

42
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:21.010
So first, before we set up the form itself, let's go to integration modules in fluent forms and you

43
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.270
can see that the MailChimp integration is part of their free plugin.

44
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.040
They also have one for Slack.

45
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.570
There's other integrations that are available in their Prosor service.

46
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.950
But if you just click the little toggle down at the bottom left of the MailChimp area, it just enables

47
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.100
it.

48
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.300
And then you can either click settings right here or you can go to global settings over here, and that

49
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.280
shows you the MailChimp Chimp integration button over here on the left hand side.

50
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.930
So if you click, MailChimp gives you a field to put your API key in there.

51
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.000
So I've already copied it, so I'll paste it in there and click Save Settings.

52
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.290
And then it's been verified and successfully set so I can close this little message and then I'll have

53
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.940
to do is simply go to my forms and then my subscription form, and I can edit that form for its look

54
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.040
and feel and whether I want to capture the first name, last name and other things.

55
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.980
You do have to set that up within MailChimp, but just the email address and the subscribe button is

56
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.420
what's enabled by default.

57
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.570
And then you need to go to settings and integrations and down here, marketing and CRM integrations.

58
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.010
And then you have to add the MailChimp feed integration so it will go connect to the API to MailChimp

59
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.040
and select which audience list that you want to use inside of your MailChimp list.

60
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:56.680
And then you can select things like what fields you want to collect and other settings over here, whether

61
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.090
you want to enable double opt in or not and other settings within MailChimp.

62
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.700
And so, you know you'd want to maybe select just the email fields.

63
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.240
Of course, this is just a sample for one of my client and my wife's website, Wild Food Girl.

64
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:22.960
And once I have that set, I can create the MailChimp feed and then the integration successfully saved

65
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.170
means that when I go back to the website here and when I enter.

66
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.720
My email address, then that formal work.

67
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.050
So one thing you can do as we did before is to just set up the look and feel a little bit.

68
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.690
I know that one thing that we had done is change it to a gray button.

69
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.390
Let's go ahead and make that a large button.

70
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.310
So I'll save this form.

71
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.120
I'll click the short code in order to copy it to the clipboard.

72
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.790
And let's go back to our website.

73
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.930
Let's look at it here.

74
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.510
So there's a button already existing over here, and I might just change out the forms.

75
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.360
Plug in is going to provide us with the Subscribe button, so we'll put that over here in this content

76
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.040
area on the right hand side.

77
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:16.580
So go back to the website and what we're going to do is edit the about page.

78
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.030
So go to all pages and let's go and click about or the edit button under the title there.

79
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.870
And then as we scroll down here, we're just basically editing the about page with the Block editor.

80
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.380
If I start to click, it could see what blocks are over here.

81
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.410
And let's see, look at the list for you to see what I have over here.

82
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.490
Looks like I've got a, you know, a heading.

83
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.120
There's a column over here and there's just a separator over here in the right side.

84
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.670
SHORTCODE block, there we go.

85
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.730
And I'll paste the shortcode in there.

86
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.350
And update, let's just see what it looks like on the front end for now.

87
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.000
Oh, great.

88
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.600
Watch birds from your inbox.

89
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.860
Join our mailing list.

90
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.660
And, you know, I don't want that to be a clickable button.

91
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:20.030
And really, I want to put like a heading over here above this email address and subscribe button.

92
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.100
So let's see.

93
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.120
I just go, Oops!

94
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.410
Go over to.

95
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:32.590
This, you know, I don't really need this button, I'm just going to remove, oops, I'm going to remove

96
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.730
the button and then over here, what I want to do is.

97
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:43.010
Let's get into the list of you again here instead of this, let's see.

98
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.620
Near this separator, I'm going to place.

99
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.240
Let's, uh, put a heading.

100
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.670
And let's have that say.

101
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.290
Join the mailing list.

102
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.630
I'm going to make that a little bit smaller, so it doesn't really conflict with here.

103
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.070
You know, you can style this anywhere you like.

104
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.140
Let's put that above the separator line and click Update.

105
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.230
Refresh the page.

106
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.530
Oh, great.

107
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.710
Watch birds from your inbox, you might put a little little image there might look good.

108
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.340
Yeah, let's go.

109
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:35.310
Oops!

110
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.580
And I want to add that that's remove the button again.

111
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:45.810
I'm just going to put a little image over here, so I still have a buttons block here.

112
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.370
Going, I remove the whole buttons block now in this column.

113
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.900
I'm going to go ahead and add an image.

114
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:57.800
Yes.

115
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:00.980
I see.

116
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.300
Here we go.

117
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.490
Now I want to add an image.

118
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.920
Let's go to the media library, and let's just add one, I said this hummingbird image.

119
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.530
Just doing the styles a little bit.

120
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.920
From now would be a square version of the image.

121
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.530
Maybe we move it up above.

122
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:28.790
I like it down below.

123
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:38.940
Of course, we could change it into kind of a, you know, a dual tone different color duo tone if we

124
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.540
want to.

125
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.900
Just another option for editing the image.

126
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.950
Yeah, you know, I'm going to make that into the medium sized, actually.

127
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.700
I mean, the large image over there and just fill up the area here.

128
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:01.090
Great.

129
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.210
Let's quick update.

130
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.730
Take a look at what that looks like.

131
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:14.980
All right, you know, I might take this title and span the entire area above so that this looks a little

132
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:15.610
bit better.

133
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.380
I'm just playing with the design here, which is of course, something that you can do.

134
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:26.480
See if I can bring this book up into the next column area like that.

135
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:28.690
There we go.

136
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.130
There was a line break right there in the heading.

137
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.660
So now it's looking like I want.

138
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.920
I think it's a take this and just see what it looks like.

139
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.110
There we go.

140
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.130
That's how it's looking.

141
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:53.900
All right, so now we have a great looking email opt in form provided by fluent forms and the MailChimp

142
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.210
service active on the website.

143
00:10:58.650 --> 00:10:59.970
So let's go ahead and test it.

144
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.670
What?

145
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.350
Needs to be a valid email address.

146
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.720
Let's see what happens if it's not a valid e-mail address and I click Subscribe.

147
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.700
There's my error message tells me what's wrong with my email, so that's nice to know.

148
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.150
Click Subscribe.

149
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.600
Here's my new success message there.

150
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:29.930
If I go back here and refresh the page under this audience says there's been.

151
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.800
One more, one more contact.

152
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.400
And there I am, I've been subscribed.

153
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.030
Awesome.

154
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:48.040
That's how you set up to capture email addresses on an email list using MailChimp and style the form

155
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.140
using fluent forms, and let's get on to the next section.
