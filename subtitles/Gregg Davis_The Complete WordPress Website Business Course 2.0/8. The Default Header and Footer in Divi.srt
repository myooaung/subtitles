1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,280
In this lesson, we'll check out the default header and footer settings in Devi and learn how to customize

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,490
them.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,380
You'll learn the different locations in the WordPress dashboard, where you can edit those, including

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,610
the site logo, navigation menus and different features of the header and footer.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,800
By the end of this video, you'll understand the simple default header and footer system included with

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,190
DeFi and how to utilize it for a simple but customized design.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:31,800
Now, let's finish up with the design agency layout pack by looking at this traditional or default header

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,290
area.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:39,000
Customizing it a little bit, even though knowing that we're going to be customizing a much more powerful

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,530
header design system later in the next section in Divij Part two.

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,030
But for now, just know that you know this is a usable header section that that you can use.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,920
If you want something simple, you can customize it as far as the background color, whether it's sticky

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,540
or not, how much it shrinks, what the logo looks like and everything up here.

14
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,060
But let's customize this just so you know what you're doing as far as the default header in divvy.

15
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:14,970
For now, you can see that every page that we've added is in there, plus an uncategorized navigation

16
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,790
label, and that's for the blog post categories.

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,070
And of course, Uncategorized is, by default, the the the only category in there.

18
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,610
You have to have one default category, at least in the blog post system in WordPress.

19
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,750
You can relabeled that create a new one called news or something generic versus uncategorized, which

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,420
isn't very pretty when it appears on the front of the website.

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,810
Also, you can see by default it comes with a search function right here that is a nice little layout

22
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,040
that opens up a search bar instead of the navigation menu.

23
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:01,800
And we'll also look at the default widget ties to area down here at the footer and then the footer bar

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,000
down here at the bottom.

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,970
That's kind of a final customization of this layout pack that we've been using in this section of the

26
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,390
course.

27
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,020
So let's go back and look in the sandbox dashboard again or your own dashboard if you're using your

28
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,240
own hosting in your own device license.

29
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,310
But inside of the website dashboard, let's first look under.

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,640
Actually, let's look under Divij theme options.

31
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,890
There's a couple of places that we can replace some of the content in this header.

32
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,020
The first is the logo area.

33
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:41,760
This logo is really only used in the default header under appearance, customize under header settings.

34
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,630
And so if you do want to, you can click Upload, go to the media library.

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,700
And if you do have a small and a header.

36
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,690
Excuse me, a small logo image, you can upload it there and it will replace that default div logo that

37
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,950
you see right here.

38
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,120
And so I'll just close out of that and the fixed navigation bar.

39
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,480
You can either enable or disable that and just taking a look if we disable that and then click save

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,300
changes and look for the green checkbox there, checkmark there and reflect refresh the page on the

41
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:18,840
front here.

42
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,160
Let's see what happens here.

43
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:28,980
Well, that means that the label navigation header, excuse me, is no longer fixed or sticky to the

44
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,760
top of the page.

45
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,260
And so that's a more traditional, you know, navigation header.

46
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,710
But of course, the fixed navigation bar is a nice feature, the way it shrinks a little bit.

47
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:48,060
When the user scrolls, if you use that feature at all and recently I have used this when I didn't need

48
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,790
a customized or colorful or navigation header that was full of features.

49
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,230
It was easiest and best for the client side to just edit the font and the weight of the font and what

50
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:08,070
the navigation items are, and then edit all that into what was needed for the website at the time.

51
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,590
So let's let's edit what's going on here with the navigation items.

52
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:20,520
So what we have right here are under theme options navigation the right now.

53
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,490
There's no menu under appearance menus.

54
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,720
There's no menu associated with this primary navigation area.

55
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,180
And so it's really pulling in every page that is within the website.

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,700
And so all these pages are in there, and if we wanted to exclude any of the pages, all we'd have to

57
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,010
do is click the checkbox and then save.

58
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,890
And then that page would be eliminated from the navigation there.

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,240
And then there's a couple other options, like displaying the home link or the dropdown menus, enabling

60
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,350
those dropdown menus.

61
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,100
You can see that it shows home and that it also shows home.

62
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,490
And it did.

63
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:07,760
Replace and that's because we have not only this home, but we have the display HomeLink selected here.

64
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:14,840
Now this display, HomeLink will show and be correct no matter which page you have associated with home.

65
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,690
And so if you're going to use, it might be best to just take away this home a page called home and

66
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,340
then have this display.

67
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,620
HomeLink enabled that way.

68
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:31,370
No matter what pages you have here, the home link will work and it won't show, you know, every and

69
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,780
won't show double right there.

70
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:40,820
And so lastly, you know, oh, just here, it eliminated the blog post category.

71
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,250
But if we look here under categories, the uncategorized was enabled there.

72
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,410
But what you can do is just hit this checkbox.

73
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,850
Not sure why that disappeared there at that point?

74
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,910
Maybe it was because I got rid of the home navigation and also got rid of the uncategorized.

75
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:03,230
But if I say save changes, if you wanted to just get rid of the category menu items, then that would

76
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,460
eliminate that from there.

77
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,650
And then let's see what else.

78
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:13,970
Just in general settings this feature, you know, if you want to disable for something where there's

79
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:20,030
a drop down, you want to disable the top tier and you want only the dropdown items to be selectable

80
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,190
or clickable, then you can click this here and save it.

81
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,720
But let's look at appearance.

82
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,030
Customize a couple of different things.

83
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,240
Under the customizer here, the header navigation when you look at the format, of course, is a couple

84
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,960
of different formats we've seen before.

85
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,590
The default is what we have here, or Senate or senator centered with the inline logo in between the

86
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,380
items slide in and full screen.

87
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,800
All those different settings we've looked at as far as format.

88
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:55,520
Oh, and then now, excuse me, header navigation header format enable vertical navigation, which would

89
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,260
be like down the side or hide the navigation until scroll is interesting.

90
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,700
You could have no navigation until the user scrolls.

91
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,970
And so under primary, this is where you control your different colors and things like that, and the

92
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:17,600
different fonts and the sizing and everything and even how big that the logo gets so you can make the

93
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,360
logo get, you know, a little bit bigger, depending on.

94
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:30,320
Let's see if I want to just shrink that down and make it smaller, for example, while it's in the primary

95
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,830
menu bar.

96
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,380
So the menu all the way I scrolled up and extended here is the primary menu bar.

97
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,140
And you can make it full width so that the items spread themselves out to the full width or not.

98
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,060
You could hide the logo image here, and those are the settings there.

99
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,160
The secondary menu bar.

100
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,380
Now we don't have it enabled right now because we don't have a menu inside the secondary menu bar,

101
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,890
but that puts a smaller row or any size you want.

102
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,100
Really up above the primary menu bar, you can put extra menu items up there, which is often a good

103
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,060
way to go or a special marketing message across the top.

104
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,890
It's kind of like a welcome bar or a hello bar, you might say at the top of the website that you can

105
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:21,020
use and menu items can go into it and then fixed navigation settings or what this looks like when you

106
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,820
scroll up and it's sitting here.

107
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,140
And so the fixed menu height, it gets smaller when you scroll.

108
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:35,330
And so, you know, I could make it get even smaller if I wanted to, you know, way down, small if

109
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,050
I wanted to.

110
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,450
You can play with that kind of thing if you want to.

111
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:45,200
You can even hide the logo image, you know, only on scroll, which is an interesting way to go, too.

112
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,500
So there's a lot of different color choices and a lot of choices you can make.

113
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,020
And then the header elements.

114
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,690
Finally, this is where the search icon comes in at the top.

115
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,770
You can get rid of that or put it in there.

116
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,160
You can also put social items now that's bringing up a strange side menu over there.

117
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,480
But oftentimes that can be usable depending on what kind of menu you're using.

118
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:13,730
You can also put a phone number, you know, and that might that could appear, you know, over on the

119
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:20,090
side, wherever you can see that come up with after you publish or an email address, even up in the

120
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:20,660
side there.

121
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,700
And I'm just going to get out of here without publishing, so I don't change any of the things here,

122
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:31,280
but that's pretty much it for the traditional or default header in divvy.

123
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,850
Let's just look lastly at the footer area.

124
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,600
You know, down here at the bottom, there are two parts to this footer.

125
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,300
Actually, you can just barely make out a slightly different color.

126
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:49,280
One is where there's widgets across here in different columns, and then this is the bottom bar it's

127
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,580
called.

128
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:55,460
You can see social icons on the right and then a kind of a credits on the left hand side here.

129
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,260
And so that's often used.

130
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,330
That's under the theme custom.

131
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,720
Pfizer as well, so I'll reopen that customizer and under footer, you can see, first of all, the

132
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,900
bottom bar down here.

133
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,830
That would be down that, you know, you can get the color and the text color, et cetera, down here.

134
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,790
The footer credits.

135
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,950
If you just wanted to disable these footer credits that are by default pointing to elegant themes and

136
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,210
WordPress, you can just click that box to disable those credits.

137
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:35,750
And then whether these icons are showing or not is actually this is this is the size and color of those

138
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,520
social icons, et cetera.

139
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,520
This is that's the text color that it's using down there.

140
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:50,960
But to get to get rid of the social icons in the bottom bar you, you would actually go back to the

141
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,460
theme customizer.

142
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,990
Let's just go back there real quick.

143
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:00,350
So you know where this is located and under the theme options, not the theme customizer, but the options

144
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,250
under general.

145
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,650
That's where you have these social icons enabled or not.

146
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,380
This just represents a link, and you would, of course, paste the Facebook profile link, et cetera,

147
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,800
in here.

148
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,750
But if you wanted to remove any or all of these automatic ones, you could do that and then hit Save.

149
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,570
Look for the green checkbox here.

150
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:29,060
And of course, if we refresh the page, you'll see those disappear if you wanted to get rid of the

151
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,320
whole bottom bar.

152
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,600
You could go back to the customizer after removing those social icons.

153
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,060
Go to footer and bottom bar and then, you could say, disable footer credits.

154
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,220
And so that'll show no bottom bar at all.

155
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,400
But often people put a copy, right?

156
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:53,090
And then, you know, the business name and the year down at the bottom, and you can play with having

157
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,200
some text down there.

158
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:02,750
Sometimes people will put, you know, something like, you know, site design by and have your business

159
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,970
name with a link to your business in case people like the site and want to get in touch with you.

160
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,240
And so that's something that you can do as well.

161
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,590
I'll just disable the four footer credits here now in the next section.

162
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,040
Davey Part two, we're going to be customizing this entire footer area.

163
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,910
So the bottom will be irrelevant anyway.

164
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:29,630
But let's finally look at this footer area down here, and that is actually, oh, you can also put

165
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,530
a footer menu.

166
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:38,810
I should say, if you do have a menu enabled for the footer area over there, we'll look at what else

167
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,340
down here.

168
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,870
Oh, you can also make these social icons disappear just with this checkbox under footer elements as

169
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,290
well.

170
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,050
And then the widgets area, you can control the header size and the color of these widgets that are

171
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,410
in here.

172
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,080
But where do you control the content of those widgets?

173
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,220
Well, before we do that, the layout, you can control it as far as the columns.

174
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,910
These are just different column layouts that would be a three column layout.

175
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,350
The footer background color.

176
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:09,470
Of course, you could have a, you know, 50 fifty one where you could have a small and a large in there.

177
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:16,010
And so that's something that's controllable, but widgets under appearance widgets.

178
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:24,080
That's where these, you know, default footer widgets are found and there's actually six possible footer

179
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,620
widgets, air widget areas that are included with the device theme.

180
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:34,850
And of course, under Widget Area, Footer Area one, we have the two that are located there.

181
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:42,170
And so here I'll use the list view just to make sure I can see what's in here and be able to access

182
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,320
it.

183
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,740
So that's the sidebar.

184
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,310
And then here's footer area one.

185
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:53,060
I could just take this group if I wanted to and go over here and say Remove Group, and that'll just

186
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,860
remove that from the footer area.

187
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,930
It doesn't really matter if you're going to be changing it over, but oftentimes when I'm first designing,

188
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:08,980
I'll just take everything out of the footer widget areas here so that I'll just remove these groups.

189
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,660
And now there's nothing there in the footer area.

190
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,610
Um, let's see.

191
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,950
There's still, oh, this is the sidebar, right?

192
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,060
So in the sidebar, if you do use the sidebar, this is just a little bit of content in there.

193
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,400
We can just leave that in there for now.

194
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,450
And then let's just finally look under appearance menus.

195
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:35,390
And instead of using, you know, the top level pages automatically in this upper menu area, let's

196
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,540
define a menu to put in here so we can specifically control it.

197
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,310
This is really the right way to do it, even if you're using the default menu area.

198
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,600
So first of all, as you know, we have to create a menu.

199
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,220
So I'll just say, you know, header menu, and this is where you would create the different menus if

200
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,290
you want to have one as the primary and then a different menu as a secondary, like I said, and then

201
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,760
the footer menu could be something different.

202
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:06,050
As well, but I'll just create a menu name and say create menu, and then you could hit view all under

203
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,400
pages here and just see what you want to put in here.

204
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,640
So the front page or home about blog, case study, contact landing and portfolio?

205
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,800
Sure, maybe I'll eliminate that landing page from the navigation you could or that was the same as

206
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,460
select all.

207
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:28,100
But if you add to the menu here, then you have all those items, which really will be the same layout

208
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,970
as this.

209
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:37,580
But as you know, you can control the, you know, the order by dragging and dropping things, as well

210
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:43,070
as having a drop down, by sliding it up and having it as a submenu under there like that.

211
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:50,990
So what I'll do is just hit save menu, and then I'm going to bring in the portfolio pages that we had

212
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,140
created for this agency design agency layout.

213
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:01,610
They're not there aren't any portfolio items by default in the WordPress menus, but what you can do

214
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,420
is use a custom link.

215
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:08,120
And so what I'll do usually is just open a different page with the projects.

216
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,900
Right click open new tab and then I'll just.

217
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:19,220
This view is the URL so I can right click there under review and say Copy Link Address I can go back

218
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,030
into here.

219
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:30,500
I can put that URL by pasting it here and say the title this one was Project two click add to Menu and

220
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,930
then I'll do the next one.

221
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:40,460
Right click Copy, Link Address and paste it in there by clicking Control V.

222
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,110
And this was the Project one and adds a menu.

223
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,960
And now what I'm going to do is change the order of these, first of all and then actually put it under

224
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:58,100
portfolio and slide it in one so that I have a dropdown here and I click Save Menu.

225
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,840
That'll tell me the menu's been updated, I go up here and refresh.

226
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,220
Oops, wrong page.

227
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,080
Go up here and refresh.

228
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,360
And now under portfolio, I should have that dropdown.

229
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,650
No, that's not exactly working.

230
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,840
Oh, there's one more thing I have to do.

231
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:23,520
So for this menu, I didn't place it in the primary menu location, and that's that primary menu.

232
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,240
You know, under in the customizer, under menus, header menus.

233
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,720
And so now that I've done that, if I refresh the page.

234
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,330
There we go.

235
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,690
Gives me a little drop down indicator and project one and two.

236
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,760
You can see now my blue color for active items is showing.

237
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,940
So whichever one is blue, of course, I might change that to a yellow or something like this to match

238
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,660
the design or that bright red like I was using before, as well as this line.

239
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,100
And that, like I showed you before, is all controlled under appearance.

240
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,600
Customize.

241
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,160
That would be under header and navigation under primary menu bar.

242
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,860
You come down and say, What's the dropdown?

243
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,480
Well, the menu line color.

244
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,440
Maybe I want to have that be that red instead?

245
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,230
And then also the active link color.

246
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,210
I might do that as the red.

247
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,970
And then I'll probably look a lot nicer for that menu, depending on which page you're on.

248
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,190
And then the line for the project.

249
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,220
So whatever you like, that's customizing the default header in DV.

250
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,470
And then down at the bottom, you can see that I eliminated the widget sized area for the footer, and

251
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,380
there's just a remnant of that bottom bar visible here.

252
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,660
Even though there's no content there, you can change that to the same color as your background or your

253
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,430
website or just leave it.

254
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,620
But at this point, we're going to call this good.

255
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,440
And next in the Divvy Part two section, we're going to customize the header and footer and other global

256
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,950
elements for the website a lot more deeply.

257
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,400
And so we'll get to it next.
