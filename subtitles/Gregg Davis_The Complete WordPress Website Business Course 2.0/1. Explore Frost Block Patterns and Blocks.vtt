00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.190
In this lesson, we'll take a look at the Frost theme, a new block based theme with full editing like

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.000
2022.

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.340
You'll check out the Frost WP e-commerce site, which shows all the black patterns and style blocks

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.390
available so far.

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.830
By the end of this video, you'll see how you can leverage the pre-designed sample sites.

6
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.270
Explore the demo sites and easily import a complete site as a starting point.

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.670
Let's take a look at another block based theme in WordPress and build another site with it.

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.480
If you took the last course, you may remember Genesis.

9
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.100
Themes from studio press and the makers of Genesis have come up with the next generation of what Genesis

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.760
is going to provide from WP Engine, a free theme called Frost from the founders of Genesis.

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:54.290
Now, similar to twenty twenty two, it leverages the power of the site templates and the site editor

12
00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.160
where you can use blocks and a block based system for templating without code and controlling global

13
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.800
elements like the header and the footer and other elements within the website, including typography,

14
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.240
colors and other items and block patterns, especially.

15
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.010
Let's take a look at frost, and we'll build a site within the sandbox and also learn about another

16
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.480
way to import site content to make a site automatically look like the demo or the sample.

17
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.760
So if you open up your sandbox site, I'm just going to go ahead and click my sites here in the sidebar

18
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.230
or up at the top corner.

19
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.460
You should do the same, and if you have one site here, you can always click Add a new site and then

20
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.320
it'll bring bring you to the registration page, where you can choose a site name and a site URL and

21
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.040
go ahead and click Create that'll create another site for you.

22
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.270
Then you can go in under appearance themes with that site active and choose the Frost theme and click

23
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.080
Activate.

24
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.640
I already have my Frost theme activated here in my sandbox site.

25
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.500
Also, I would suggest you open another tab and go to Frost WP XCOM so you can check it out and we'll

26
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.660
take a look at it together right now.

27
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.920
So Frost, you can see, is a pretty clean look.

28
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.780
This is just the home page of Frost created with Frost, but it has that kind of studio press and genesis

29
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.850
clean and minimalist look.

30
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.880
And there's a few things I wanted to show you here.

31
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.610
One is a series of block patterns now in frost, at least for now.

32
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.840
It's very minimalist and with really blacks and whites and grays and kind of a frame setup.

33
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.820
So if you were to look at something like, you know, hero section block patterns, for example, you've

34
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.030
got, you know, an image with two called action buttons and some text and a heading, and you have

35
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.530
the reverse of that with a light colored background, dark image, etc..

36
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:13.310
Here is a block pattern that has a hero section full with darker color, with a light image and lighter

37
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.240
color right here.

38
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.140
Here's a three items etc so you can go through and on the block patterns page.

39
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.870
You can look at what all patterns are included in Frost WP.

40
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.890
Again, it's a three theme.

41
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.520
It's not available in the WordPress repository yet, but it does take advantage of WordPress five point

42
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.360
nine and later.

43
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.690
And the site editor in is a block based theme and offers up these well-designed block patterns that

44
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.690
you can leverage to make any design that you like.

45
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.160
Another place to look is the style guide, where you can see the actual blocks that are available within

46
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.970
frost.

47
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.280
For example, you've got rounded corners.

48
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.870
Total pill shaped square corners.

49
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.910
Different fills, different ways.

50
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.290
The rollovers work.

51
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.870
You've got different widths for buttons and alignments as well.

52
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.320
And so if you keep going through here, you could see there are a lot of different customized blocks

53
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.440
that you can use and have a lot of good settings in them.

54
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:26.480
Similar to twenty twenty two now, a big difference between Frost and twenty twenty two is that, you

55
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.080
know, the block patterns aren't styled with existing images, but instead they're using generic kind

56
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.270
of wireframe images with just, you know, black background with a little logo here.

57
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:48.410
So three sizes within frost you'll see a 600 pixel and a wide width 2200 pixel and a full width 100

58
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.850
percent for what the image comes in as.

59
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.280
And then thirdly, if you go across the navigation, check out the sample sites.

60
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.800
This is where we're going to be able to use a special import process that's been available in WordPress

61
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.610
for a long time.

62
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.530
The import of an XML file to bring in images and a pre designed layout that you can either use as a

63
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.540
starting point or use to learn about frost and what's available.

64
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:18.860
So there's three.

65
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.730
There's venture capital, small business and night mode.

66
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:32.510
For example, we can click View Demo, and it opens in a new tab where you can see just what this theme

67
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.540
frost can do.

68
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:42.530
There's a full with image and a section with a heading and a three column design, their call to action

69
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.920
with a colored background and a roll over button.

70
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.550
There's another section right here.

71
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.330
You can kind of see what's possible with Frost by looking at these samples like this.

72
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:04.130
So if we go to the services page can see a full width image below a header, you know, with with some

73
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:10.550
text there, three columns with interactive buttons and then service plans.

74
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:17.000
This one is a pricing page with a pricing table and three buttons right here.

75
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.440
This is a blog page that shows a single column blog where the featured images are shown in a certain

76
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.830
way.

77
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.170
There's a quote that has kind of a border and a drop shadow right there ET.

78
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.520
And so the the styling here, if we add one more thing, you can go a little bit deeper in the services

79
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.970
page.

80
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.480
You look at, for example, click architectural design.

81
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.940
You can see that here's a service page that has some text like that.

82
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.250
And so let's go ahead and activate Frost.

83
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.340
And you know, when you first activate it and look at the site, it'll just show a blank white page

84
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:04.880
with a header and a footer and a single Hello World blog post in there on the home page.

85
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:12.380
But if we bring in the XML file that you can get from Frost WP, you'll see that you can make your site

86
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.370
look like one of the sample sites in just a couple of clicks.

87
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.530
And so this is what I've done to to my initial installation of Frost.

88
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:28.610
You can see that it looks like the small business sample site and we can go in there and customize it

89
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.060
and take a look at how Frost works in the background.
