1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,480
In this lesson, we'll explore global colors and presets and how to assign them so that changing a content

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,570
piece in one place can affect every instance across an entire website.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,190
You'll assign colors and also presets for particular module types like the divider module in this example

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,020
to make both initial designing and changing designs in the future faster.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,900
By the end of this video, you'll understand how preparing colors and content modules with global assignments

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,770
saves design time and also makes sitewide revisions possible.

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,920
Let's take a look at under the global elements section here of the DV theme and builder curriculum.

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,570
The just global colors where you can work with your layout and when you're customizing it, you can

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,720
save colors as a global element and then when there's multiple areas that use that color on the website.

10
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:57,180
If you need to make an edit in the future, or even while you're developing a website for a client,

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,330
if you're if you have areas labeled with particular colors, you can change that global color in one

12
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:09,630
place and then every version, every instance of that color across the entire website will change.

13
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,840
It's a good way to future proof your website and make it really easy to go ahead and change things.

14
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,490
As far as looking at colors, and so if we go into one of our pages here, let's look at the landing

15
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:31,260
page because it has quite a lot of content that we can use and maybe we can look at, you know, one

16
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,710
of the colors that we have being used inside the website.

17
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,810
One of them is this red, right?

18
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:44,280
This red is used in these dividing lines, as well as in the header up here inside of the website.

19
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:53,970
And so if we look back at the dashboard, let's just go back into the pages, all pages, and let's

20
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,760
just open up that landing page and just take a look now at it with the device builder could get here

21
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,450
from using the visual builder button up at the top there as well.

22
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,880
But once this is open, I can go down here and look at this content area right down here.

23
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,610
So I'm just going to open up this module, which is a divider and the divider is visible.

24
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,490
And if we look at the way it's designed, we can look at the line and the line color.

25
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:31,170
And so the color selector in any module, you'll see that there are a bunch of pre-selected colors that

26
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,780
kind of come by default in Divij.

27
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,580
And then there's a few other areas.

28
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,840
There's saved colors.

29
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,240
There's a global selection here.

30
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,510
There's a recent and then there's a settings panel for colors right down here.

31
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,340
And you've seen me work with this before.

32
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:53,370
If you click the color selector and you can use the opacity and the color intensity sliders, you can

33
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,170
use your mouse to move around and select colors on the rainbow screen.

34
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,590
Like this, you know, brighter and more saturated at the top.

35
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,920
Desaturated and down towards blacks at the bottom.

36
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,110
Far in know through the rainbow of colors off to the left.

37
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,790
Then you know you click the little checkbox to choose the color right there.

38
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:22,530
Now, once you choose that color, you can also actually open up this little three button color selector

39
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:30,600
window, and it gives you a much more widely, you know, a much wider variety of colors that are,

40
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,580
you know, selected here for you.

41
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:40,650
And so if you do select a color right here, let's just close that back up again.

42
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,810
You can go and under global, you can hit the plus button.

43
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:53,820
And so if once I've hit that plus button, I've given, you know, I've left that kind of teal color

44
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,060
selected and so I can just go ahead and add click that checkbox or I can make some changes if I want

45
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,360
to.

46
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:07,050
And what I've just done is I've saved that color to a global color and the little corner little corner

47
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,050
at the bottom right of the color circle.

48
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,500
The representation of that color indicates that it's a global color.

49
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,190
And then under here you can also look at saved colors.

50
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,430
Those are the ones that are saved by default in Devi.

51
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:26,340
And I'll show you right now where those are changeable as well as you know, it'll show you recent colors

52
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,790
and give you a variety of different levels of a variety of colors based on that color.

53
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,670
And you can see the global global colors here.

54
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:43,030
And then the Little Settings panel, you know, gives you a representation of what you've been doing.

55
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:49,560
You can then can you put that global color in the trash or say, OK, I'm going to finish editing,

56
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,670
finish what I was doing?

57
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,670
And so now if I hit the checkmark, you can see that that line is that green color.

58
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,620
And so if.

59
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:08,810
If I go into design and sizing, I might just bring that divider up a little bit as far as size, just

60
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,910
so we can see it a little bit better on the page here.

61
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,580
Now let's go ahead and save the page.

62
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:22,370
Now, if now, if I go down into a lower section of the page and I see that this dividing line is back

63
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,330
to the original color, now I can go ahead and go to design.

64
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,420
And I can look at the line design and I can click global and that colors available to me.

65
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:41,390
So now if I choose that color and let's go ahead and make that a little bit bigger as well back up to

66
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,950
that 12 pixel size.

67
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:50,120
Now, when I save the page and save the module, those two dividing lines are now connected.

68
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,050
Right, those those are using that global color.

69
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,590
And so when we change things on the website, including things in the header and things on different

70
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:08,360
pages of the website, even if there's tens of hundreds or tens or thousands of pages that are using

71
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,000
that global color, every single instance across the entire website will change when you change the

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,860
global color anywhere on the website.

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,240
And that's the power of the global colors.

74
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,960
And so suppose I'm in here, you know, I can see that these these two are the teal color.

75
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,100
The client is like, you know that that teal color needs to go back to red.

76
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,570
Let's bring that back to the red, and we'll make it kind of a bright red.

77
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,380
And so you could say, OK, well, I've got the entire website.

78
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,590
If you've prepared it like this, I've got the entire website using that global color so I could go

79
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,360
in here and edit it anywhere on the site.

80
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,320
I could go under design and find that global color area.

81
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,000
And I can say, you know what, I that that needs to change.

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,530
So you click the global color and now I'm editing that global color.

83
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,720
And so I can go back up into, you know, a different area.

84
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,680
I go up into this bright red up here on the right side, and when I click the little checkmark, it

85
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,100
gives me a modal window.

86
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,210
It says, Are you sure you've made changes to this global color?

87
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,680
It affects all instances.

88
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,310
And so if you're sure that that's what you want to do, you click Yes.

89
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:26,900
And then when you save that that module, you can see that everywhere that that global color was being

90
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,720
used, it changed it into the new color.

91
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,270
And so I can save this page.

92
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:38,900
And when I go to somewhere else that was using that global color, it changes it into that color.

93
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:45,860
It's a really powerful way to arrange for items on the website to be globally controlled, to make it

94
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,230
a lot easier to change design in the future.

95
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,460
Make and save your time as far as your workflow.

96
00:07:52,640 --> 00:08:00,170
Not only can you define global colors to be used around the website that you can use when you're designing,

97
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:07,820
but you can also define global presets, and you can even make yourself a style guide to hold all of

98
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,610
those presets and edit them as you will.

99
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:18,350
So let's check out the idea of global presets before we go ahead and import one to see how it all works

100
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,480
if we go back into our page here.

101
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:29,930
Under this divider that we styled with a wider line and in particular a global color, if we go to the

102
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:38,960
settings of this module, you may have noticed under the title of the of the editing area on all sections

103
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,700
and rows and modules, there is a preset area with a dropdown.

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,680
Often they're labeled with the word default and the dropdown.

105
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,030
That's how they come in by default, of course.

106
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:56,480
But what you can do is you can define a preset, which basically means when you bring in a divider module.

107
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,660
In this case, you can choose to bring it in as a particular preset and you can define more than one

108
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,200
preset.

109
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,830
So you can be like, OK, a red divider or a wide divider, a medium divider and a skinny divider.

110
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,310
Or you can have a, you know, different colors and you can see that this can be extended out to typography

111
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:24,350
or full sections where you can have a preset defined to make it easy to design new pages and bring new

112
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,700
content into the website, especially during the design process at the beginning.

113
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:35,000
And so one thing you can do is go ahead and just choose this dropdown where it says default and click

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,280
Create new preset from default styles, from existing styles.

115
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,960
And is that what it said?

116
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,570
Yeah, create new preset from current styles.

117
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,490
So after you've style that, you could say, Well, now that I made this, I want to I want to be available

118
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,220
everywhere.

119
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,330
So, you know, in addition to being able to just save that to the library and then bring it in and

120
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,180
use it later, you can also set a preset which.

121
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,210
Makes your workflow even faster.

122
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:10,390
And so this one would be, you know, you would call it divider wide, read something like that, some

123
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:16,990
words that can make sense to you as you're doing your design, and then you can assign this preset to

124
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:23,530
the default preset or just leave the default as it was before, which is probably wise because this

125
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,400
is a new design.

126
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:32,380
And you just click the the checkbox there and you saw the control window flip over and turn gray.

127
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:41,320
That means that now we are editing the actual preset itself, not this particular module, the divider

128
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,790
module, but we're actually editing the entire preset.

129
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:53,860
And so you can look at design, you can make those design changes like this, you know, for this module.

130
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,280
But generally, once I've designed it and saved it as a preset, I'll just click the checkbox to save

131
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,860
that preset and then save again.

132
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,430
And now I have a preset available to me while I'm designing.

133
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,470
That's different from the default preset.

134
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,930
You know, if you open it back up, you can see that it shows which preset it's using.

135
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:21,190
And if I wanted to, I could go back and say, Well, this, you know, I actually if I have divider,

136
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:27,820
preset one and divider wide read, I actually did change the default preset and so I made a new one

137
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,090
there.

138
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:33,520
But let's see what happens when we close that we can go down to a new section here.

139
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:41,800
And, you know, if maybe I just get rid of this divider, if I go to the plus button, this is for

140
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:47,410
the presets really work when you're adding new modules from scratch, but you don't want to just build

141
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,240
them yourself.

142
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,960
So I'm going to add a divider module because I know I have a new preset available and I've just added

143
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,050
the divider module and it's ready for me to customize it.

144
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,560
But instead of doing each one by itself instead of default, I can choose divider wide read and you

145
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,030
could see that it put it in there now.

146
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,790
The divider wide read was a justified to the left, wasn't it?

147
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:19,060
And so if I'm in here and I'm like, Well, I want this to be a centered one, I might make another

148
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:25,750
preset after I've designed it, so I'll take design and on this is it.

149
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,560
Now, let's see.

150
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,470
Let's let's look at how we can edit this for that line.

151
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,000
I want it vertically centered.

152
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,620
Sure.

153
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,100
Um, sizing and spacing.

154
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,780
Here we go.

155
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,700
That module alignment, I want to be centered instead of left aligned.

156
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:51,450
So now that I've changed that, I can go up here and say create a new preset from the current styles.

157
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,480
And so this preset is going to be a new version of that same one.

158
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,900
And if I rename it.

159
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:10,700
I can say divider wide read Senate, and now when I click that green bar and then I click the checkbox,

160
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,080
I should say turns to this editor, which is a preset editor in the gray.

161
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,720
And then I click the checkbox again.

162
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,180
Now I can save that and I have a different type of preset available to me.

163
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,330
So suppose right here, I know that this might be I could just get rid of that module.

164
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:35,540
I know that I want to add a new module here, so I'll click the Plus button and let's make it a divider

165
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,110
module.

166
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,830
And what I want is to choose from my presets.

167
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:44,750
And so which one I want the wide read, which is left justified, which I know is this one.

168
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,850
So all I have to do is select that.

169
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:52,340
And now I've brought that divider in, and all the styles are preset.

170
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:59,450
And so that can show you that shows you the power of the presets and how you can use those and build

171
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:05,990
them as you go, so that later as you're building custom layouts, those presets are available to you.

172
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,940
So just do one more here.

173
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,800
This one's a left justified one.

174
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,150
So I'm putting in a new divider.

175
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,840
I want to use the left justified preset and save it.

176
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,780
There it is, so I can go ahead and get rid of this one.

177
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:24,020
And I have my new preset there and I can save the page that just shows you the power of presets and

178
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,800
you can use presets on any kind of content area.

179
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:33,110
You can have modules, you can have rows that have presets and you can label them.

180
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,870
For example, this might be for column links row, and the preset would look exactly like this, and

181
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,000
you could re-use it anywhere that you want cetera.

182
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:49,280
It's just another way to speed up your design workflow so that in DV, you really have a powerful and

183
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,240
fast way to design custom and unique websites.

184
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,850
One more quick thing to show you about using the presets.

185
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:02,930
When I first built this one, I actually did save it as the default preset.

186
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,540
It made it divider preset one.

187
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,420
But when I'm in here say I did change it into divider wide read and save it.

188
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:20,030
OK, now when I go ahead and edit this module here, if I wanted to edit the rest of those, I could

189
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:29,300
open up the presets window here and I could go to divider wide read and I could edit the preset styles.

190
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,460
And so that's where you can re flip the card over to the gray preset editor.

191
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:42,530
And what if I wanted to make the line the sizing of that line, not 12 pixels, but I wanted to reduce

192
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,410
it back down to six?

193
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,720
Let's say if I save the changes on that now again, just like the global colors.

194
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,760
This will affect all the divider modules across the entire site that are using this preset.

195
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:05,450
So if I say yes right here, divider wide read, let's look at the the the line sizing here as well.

196
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,150
Let's bring that back down to six.

197
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,340
There's the six, and that's the default four divider wide red.

198
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,540
So let's save that.

199
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,270
OK, now let's let's go ahead and look again.

200
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,500
If I open it up under divider wide read and I go to edit now, that design should have persisted under

201
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,100
sizing.

202
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,000
So it's six pixels and the width is 150.

203
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:29,500
Sure.

204
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,020
So I didn't edit anything here so I could go and get out of it.

205
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:39,800
But if I scroll back down, you can see that even this one has changed its width to six.

206
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,230
But what about the other one that's centered?

207
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,230
No, the one that centered is still 12, and so it's very similar to the global colors.

208
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:55,310
Once you have a number of different modules or sections that are using a preset, then when you change

209
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:03,050
that actual preset setting by flipping the card over using a little pencil icon, then that will change

210
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,610
everything on the entire site.

211
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,020
That's using that preset.

212
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,660
Again, like the global colors, it enables you to make changes in the future, even if there's hundreds

213
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,200
or thousands of instances of that section.

214
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,270
Just the power of the div builder and using it visually in the visual builder.
