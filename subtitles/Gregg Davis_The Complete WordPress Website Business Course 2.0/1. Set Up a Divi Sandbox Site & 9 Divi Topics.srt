1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,340
In this lesson, we'll get a DeFi website set up and take a look at the topics covered on DeFi.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,520
In this course, you'll create a new site in the sandbox and import some DeFi layouts into it for us

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,120
to work with.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,310
By the end of this video, you'll have an understanding of how much there is to cover in DeFi and the

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,680
nine major topics you'll be learning in the course.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,590
Let's get started building a new site and learning about a page builder and theme called Devi.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,390
Now, this is the first time that we've worked with a strictly paid team and a layout system that is

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,950
really what I largely use for most, if not all of my client sites and my work on my own website lately.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,910
Now, DeFi is made by elegant themes at elegant themes, dot com, and one of the things I really love

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:56,370
about it is that for either an inexpensive yearly fee or a one time lifetime fee, you can use it on

11
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,430
unlimited websites and it has a whole lot of features will be going over in this section of the course,

12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,510
including a whole bunch of layouts.

13
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,830
If we look at the Layouts Library here on the elegant themes website, you can see that as that loads,

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:24,030
it has almost 250 complete layout packs, each of which have six or seven or eight pages to them that

15
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,480
are completely designed, including the license free images that you can use and graphics.

16
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,500
And so right now, there's a total of eighteen hundred and twenty two total layouts.

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:44,280
They release new layouts and new design systems every single week, and so we'll explore how to find

18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,020
those and how to use them as starting points as a way to learn the divvy system.

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,350
So we will be installing and setting up.

20
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,000
Is this design agency layout pack at least part of it?

21
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,820
It comes with nine different pages.

22
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:09,510
There's a home page as well as a landing page and a bunch of other pages, including two project pages

23
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,170
you can use in the DeFi projects custom post type.

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,880
And so it's a really versatile layout and has some interesting design features.

25
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:26,370
But first, let's go in and I'll show you how to set this up inside of the leverage div e-comm sandbox.

26
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:33,270
If you just go to leverage DeFi Dotcom, you'll see on this website, it gives you a little overview

27
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:42,210
of what the sandbox does, etc. And all you have to do is go to register or you can click Sign up right

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:50,670
here, and then you can go ahead and create yourself a site and get it set up in just a couple of seconds.

29
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,610
You just pick a site title and then the URL will be whatever it is, leveraged VK.com.

30
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm just going to write good agency for that one and continue to the next step.

31
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,460
Then you'll choose a username, email address and choose your password and type it two times so that

32
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,620
it matches and click Create Account.

33
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,880
You'll likely see the welcome message that you can just click Dismiss on right up here at the top and

34
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,970
then under appearance themes, the also likely have the default 2022 theme enabled.

35
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,550
And so just go here under appearance themes and click activate under the device theme.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,910
Now what you have is for you.

37
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:40,010
Right click Visit Site under the name of your site here and click Open in a new tab.

38
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:47,450
You just have a default layout with an empty blank divvy powered website, and you could see that there's

39
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:53,720
nothing there, but your latest post that's there by default, a page called Sample Page that comes

40
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,630
created in WordPress by default, a sidebar with a couple of widgets in there and a logo that clicks

41
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:05,010
back to the home page, as well as a footer that has one of the areas populated with a couple of widgets.

42
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:12,710
Now we'll get in and learn how to import layout content into your new device site directly from the

43
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,890
device website inside of your WordPress site.

44
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:23,870
So if we go back into the dashboard here, the next place we want to go is over two pages, all pages.

45
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,690
And you know, what I usually do is just go ahead and put this sample page in the trash by clicking

46
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,500
trash right there.

47
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,620
If you ever want to, you could go under all pages.

48
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:40,370
And if you view the trash by clicking the tab at the top, there you can click empty trash, or you

49
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,750
can restore a page that's in the trash or even delete it permanently here.

50
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:53,570
And so if we go back to all pages, I also usually go back into posts and I put that hello world post

51
00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:00,020
in the trash as well, and we can make some sample posts later on when we're learning how to work with

52
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,830
Divij and the posts archive and blog archive pages.

53
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,800
But let's go into pages and all pages and click Add New.

54
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,580
Now, when we do this in Divij, it'll give you a welcome to the Block editor message, most likely.

55
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,800
And the first page we want to bring in is home.

56
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,990
So let's just type home in the title.

57
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,760
And then you can type use Divvy Builder or click that button right there.

58
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:33,410
Now it saves that that page so that you can have that as your page title and the URL as the permalink.

59
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,570
And then it gives you a welcome to defeat builder.

60
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,230
Usually just click Start Building, and I'll teach you how to turn that welcome tour off.

61
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,860
So that doesn't bother you every time.

62
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:49,190
And then you'll generally get these three items as a welcome to starting a new empty page using Divij.

63
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,580
And so let's click choose a pre-made layout and then you'll notice there's a familiar screen right here.

64
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,460
It's the same interface, and it's actually bringing all these layouts in from the elegant themes website.

65
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:08,930
And so I'll usually have the layouts that I showed you before under elegant themes come up in a separate

66
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:17,360
tab so I can look at the layout pack that I'm importing and I can see what pages I need to import from

67
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,100
the layout pack itself.

68
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:27,230
So starting from the home page, just so you can see it, you can also view a live demo which will open

69
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:36,050
just a generic kind of menu and header at the top, but it lets you see the page at full size before

70
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,060
you import it or do anything with it.

71
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:44,270
But over here, I just use this open on another tab so that I can see the titles of each page.

72
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,690
You can bring all nine pages and if you like, and that'd be a good exercise now, we'll just bring

73
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,760
in a few that I'm going to show you around and start with our tour of div layouts and how to use some

74
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,300
of the controls and the features of the Divij Visual Builder here in our sandbox site.

75
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,800
So back at the sandbox on our new page under load from library, what we have is the pre-made layouts

76
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,700
tab open at first and you also have saved layouts that you might have in your TV library.

77
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,240
We'll go over that and then your existing pages.

78
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,630
You can even duplicate existing pages as a starting point.

79
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,380
But now let's just go ahead and click the design agency layout pack.

80
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,770
Click Home and then you can click this to use this layout button that'll give you a little progress

81
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:37,100
bar, and that brings in the entire layout, including all of the copyright free images and graphics

82
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,080
that you can use on the page.

83
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:46,100
And now what we have here is the representation of the page with the visual builder in front, and you

84
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:53,120
can see these frames around the different sections, different colors, as well as these gray colors

85
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,380
around the different sections.

86
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,120
So you can, you know, inspect that a little bit, but the next thing to do is just to go ahead and

87
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,600
click publish at the bottom right so that you're saving that page into your website.

88
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:12,500
And then I would suggest that you just go through and go back to new and click page and then we can

89
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,160
import.

90
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,940
Page after page, and so if we do the landing page next, I'll just type landing.

91
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:26,170
And you can refer to your other layouts page open in another tab to see which pages you want to bring

92
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,560
in.

93
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:32,650
And so I would suggest that you do that and let's go ahead and bring in a few different pages.

94
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,840
Now, I might suggest you bring in at least the home landing and case study pages because those are

95
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,840
the ones who are going to be going over in this section of the course.

96
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,990
But you might as well bring in all nine pages.

97
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:57,680
And when you do bring in the Project one and project two pages into not the pages area, but the portfolio

98
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,310
custom post type in divvy.

99
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,370
And I'll show you that in just a moment and then pause the video to give you a chance to bring in all

100
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,280
of these page layouts into your new DV site.

101
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,620
So click Choose a pre-made layout.

102
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,610
This is going to be the landing page.

103
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:18,860
I have to click the design agency layout and then make sure that landing is selected and click Use.

104
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,330
This layout usually takes just a few seconds to import the layout.

105
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,980
Now, the more images and the longer the page, the longer it takes.

106
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,180
And so it might take a few seconds longer for a longer page.

107
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:38,300
The landing page is quite a bit larger than the home pages in this particular layout, and in most of

108
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:38,960
the layouts.

109
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:46,010
The landing page in the DV layouts usually gives you a good idea of most of the different types of content

110
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,970
sections that are in the design.

111
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,660
And so I like to often use the landing page as my starting point to look at what I'm going to use as

112
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,170
a customized home page for a new site for a client.

113
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,290
You can see that this page is quite a bit longer and has some different sections as you go down.

114
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,720
So I'll click Publish right here.

115
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,800
And the last thing I'll show you before I set you loose.

116
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,730
Bringing in your own content layouts is that you can click the Exit Visual Builder to get back to the

117
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,450
dashboard.

118
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,020
Or, of course, you can always roll over the name of your site and click dashboard.

119
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:27,170
When you click Enable Visual Builder or Disable, it brings you back to the live version of the website.

120
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:33,290
The live version is where you can see some of the interesting scrolling animations that happen in some

121
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,450
of these layouts, which look quite nice.

122
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,380
I like this nice, transparent, sideways animation.

123
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,830
In any case, if you need to roll over the name of your site and click dashboard and then I just wanted

124
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,780
to show you under projects, all projects.

125
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,080
Of course, there's not going to be anything there yet.

126
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,620
But for this Project one and project two layouts, I would suggest you go to add new and then, you

127
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,680
know, build yourself a new layout and bring those projects into the projects area, which is part of

128
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,270
the development portfolio and projects custom post type within divvy.

129
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:15,590
So I paused the video now and do that on my own site and go ahead and let you take a chance to bring

130
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:20,300
in and practice bringing those layouts in to your new device site.

131
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,930
OK, so I hope you're able to import all the pages you want.

132
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,710
If you look at my installation under pages, all pages.

133
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:35,960
I've got the seven pages that I imported and named, according to the design agency layout that we are

134
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,410
using.

135
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,560
I also have two project pages right here.

136
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:48,230
And then what I might suggest you do is go into settings reading and just set your home page as the

137
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:54,740
home page that you created and also set your leave your posts page actually blank.

138
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,500
Because we're actually going to use the DV builder to design that post page instead of having WordPress

139
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,060
automatically populate it with posts.

140
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,930
And so a click save changes there.

141
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,700
And next, we'll get into customizing and checking out how we control all this content.

142
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,410
Now that it's in our web site, this is the first pre designed layout pack that we'll be exploring in

143
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,650
order to learn some of the systems of Devi right now.

144
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:29,960
This is the default header that comes in from Devi, and you'll see that we can use global header builder

145
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:36,710
and theme builder templates in order to build our own custom headers or import them from the DeFi ecosystem,

146
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,920
as well as can see as we scroll down here.

147
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:47,150
There's some interesting animation as images come up and down here, there's a footer, et cetera.

148
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,850
And so you can explore that just a little bit.

149
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:57,200
Each of these pages has a different set of layouts powered by Devi that's easily portable here in the

150
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,830
sandbox.

151
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,380
Or if you have your own single WordPress installation at your own hosting and you've installed the Devi

152
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,110
theme, you can get those.

153
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,740
So as we scroll down here, you can see some of the interesting animation.

154
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:18,470
This is one we'll explore a little bit later that I really like down below as this computer comes across

155
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,320
and has kind of a transparency.

156
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,390
I find it really interesting as far as a visual design goes.

157
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,510
And so to get started here, let's just explore a document that I have out there.

158
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,480
I'm going to use for the.

159
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:41,490
First time in the course, there's a, you know, an ecosystem, a theme and a builder that's so complex

160
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,550
that I'm going to use a document to help us organize our thoughts and the material that will be going

161
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,360
over in order to learn this really powerful design system that basically overlays on top of WordPress

162
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:00,660
and is really a super powerful design system on top of WordPress for building custom websites.

163
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:09,870
It's also quite fast as far as performance and loading speed, and also future proof as far as working

164
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,720
with WordPress and really makes for an easy and fast design system on top of WordPress.

165
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:22,260
So if you look at this pretty complex mind map that I have designed here around the Disney theme and

166
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:29,760
builder, there are nine different major topics that we'll be talking about here kind of wrapped around

167
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,920
the device theme and the builder.

168
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,750
If you look at each one has its own kind of sub topic underneath.

169
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:46,080
As far as you know, the most is there's these divvy modules and the WooCommerce modules that are available

170
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,760
with DV.

171
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,800
These are all the design tools that are available in the DeFi ecosystem.

172
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:59,130
And while we won't be making a video or a lesson on each one of these items, I will be making a lesson

173
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,390
on each one of the major topics.

174
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,160
As far as looking at over here, one of the first things one of the first things we will do is just

175
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,570
look at the DV overview and the options before we delve into designing specific pages and headers and

176
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,070
footers and things inside of DV.

177
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,430
But then each of these topics will have a dedicated lesson inside of the course here.

178
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:30,600
Layout packs like I showed you and importing them and using them, the divvy design tools and the modules

179
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,120
and elements that you can use as a sort of elements that are templated.

180
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,500
So they're global elements that you can use to build a style guide and to build a design system that

181
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:50,430
lays on top of WordPress that allows you to control things like colors and typography on a global sense

182
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:55,560
as far as the whole website goes, and then templates and Gutenberg blocks integration.

183
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:03,240
This is a very powerful section where we'll look at enabling, say, the blog section of a website to

184
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,300
be edited and new blog posts to be created by a client, for example, where they don't have to go in

185
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,710
and learn all of this complexity about using DV.

186
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:23,190
You can actually nest the regular block editor within a custom designed DV page so that all they have

187
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,900
is the regular block editor.

188
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,390
Like what we've been learning previously in the course, and they don't have to delve into the complexity

189
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:30,900
of DV.

190
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,150
And you can still customize the layout and make it beautiful and match your DV layout.

191
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:42,660
As far as blog posts or other types of custom posts, go and then WooCommerce with DV, meaning an e-commerce

192
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,210
site with a web store and things like that.

193
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:53,880
DVD DV marketing tools where you can use split testing and other items like opt in forms for a mailing

194
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,530
list, et cetera.

195
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:01,200
And then we'll look at what Divvy offers as far as speed and performance optimization.

196
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,720
If you took a look down over here, this is something that we'll be looking at.

197
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:15,210
As far as how does divvy do things to make the front end load very fast and not load extraneous code

198
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,020
that you don't need.

199
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:28,740
So let's get started looking at first degree overview and options and back in the sandbox here.

200
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:36,300
Let's take a look at the dashboard and go down to the divvy settings under theme options over here,

201
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,490
and you can follow along in your own site and take a look at the settings that I recommend that you

202
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,020
start with and learn about what each of the places does inside of Divvy.
