1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,730
In this lesson, I'll show you my client payments website where I'm able to take credit cards for one

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,350
time, project fee payments and recurring subscriptions for my website care plans.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,900
You'll learn how to automate your payment system so that clients can manage their own accounts and payment

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,270
methods and pay for your services online.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,580
By the end of this video, you'll understand how to set up a professional system to charge for your

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,070
services for initial project fees and recurring subscription payments for website care and maintenance

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,170
or any other services you offer.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:40,560
Let's look in detail here at my website, updrafts media and look at how I manage project fees and annual

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,640
and monthly subscriptions for client website care plans and hosting, as well as a couple of tips and

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,370
tricks for setting it up easily.

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,070
So it's easy to manage for clients and also for me as far as what's included.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,130
Email notifications and reminders about payments and credit card expirations and things like that for

13
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:02,700
clients.

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,540
And on this website, I'll show you this up.

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,330
Draft media website is really not designed to be navigated by the public or get a lot of traffic.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:21,270
I honestly just use this to give a product a link to clients so that they can go in and navigate to

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:29,400
their product and sign up for the payment and put their credit card in and manage their payments in

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,630
the future by creating an account using WooCommerce and the Woooo subscriptions extension or extension

19
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,760
plug in for WooCommerce in WordPress.

20
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,000
So I'll show you how all of that is set up in the back end.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,910
But as we take a look on the front end first here.

22
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:53,020
This is an example of just a sample product page that I've created just to show, you know, the way

23
00:01:53,020 --> 00:02:01,870
that I create this here and this is really just a default WooCommerce product display as well as having

24
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:08,080
the cart and the checkout just displayed the way the simple theme displays WooCommerce.

25
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:15,520
It's important that you do choose a theme that can display WooCommerce pages and checkout pages very

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,250
well, and this is just a standard WooCommerce layout.

27
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,670
I don't need anything fancy here, just a place for my customers to go in and make their payments.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,340
Sign up for the recurring fees, put in their credit cards, connecting to my payment gateway and also

29
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,610
to be able to go in and log in later to manage their account in a certain place if they need to.

30
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:44,620
And so here's a product page, and really all I do is I set a price and either a sign up fee, which

31
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,850
is for the project fee itself and website care plan a subscription fee.

32
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,030
So per term, which is in this case per year, or it might be per month.

33
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,440
And I have a description here which I usually have a lot more detail here.

34
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,690
Some bullet points about what the product and the website care plan includes.

35
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,050
And then that's all there is to it, really.

36
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,670
I just have a footer here that has a contact form and my contact information.

37
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:20,320
The contact button up in my menu here just scrolls to the bottom to the footer area where the contact

38
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,020
form is on every page of the website.

39
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,290
And you know, you can see that the home page isn't anything special, just a page and a scroll down

40
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:29,650
button.

41
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:37,690
It describes what this website is for and where you can go to go to shop or your own personal link and

42
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,610
my account to manage your own account within the website.

43
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:50,290
But you can see that within shop if you if someone clicks the shop button here, they don't see their

44
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,160
own products.

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:59,140
What they see is just my consultation charge for 15 minute increments and the price.

46
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:05,500
They could access this and add it to the car and pay for a consultation period of time, which would

47
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,680
then send them to my calendar booking program.

48
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,430
I use the free calendar plug in to book times for consultations, but my clients rarely have to pay

49
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,470
for their consultations if they're a paid client.

50
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:23,710
They can get in touch with me via email and of course, we do our interviews for figuring out the website,

51
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:31,330
project and stuff as included in my, in my, you know, website care plans and and as a client.

52
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,310
And so the the shop here doesn't include private products.

53
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,290
And so I'll show you how I set that up.

54
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:46,360
I've gone in here in the back end of the website, you know, under products, I'm looking at all products

55
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,980
and I chose this design hosting for this, you know, random Acme Company, just an example, sample

56
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,520
company.

57
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:01,600
And the way I set up this product is I'll choose a name, usually the name of the website or the name

58
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,390
of the company as a project name.

59
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,910
And then here in the description areas where I put bullet points with what this includes.

60
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:18,790
So if I scroll down in this product, you can see the product data section here and a couple of things

61
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:26,230
that I set in order to set this for a virtual product for my customers, one click virtual that just

62
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,650
turns off the shipping and I can have anything to ship, so I make it a virtual product.

63
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:39,400
But the main thing is that I switch it from a simple product to simple subscription that gets enabled

64
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,350
when you enable the Woohoo!

65
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,540
Subscriptions extension, and I'll show you a little bit more about that later in this lesson.

66
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,190
But a couple of the things that it also enables the subscription price right here.

67
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,970
So I've got a thousand for every year.

68
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,880
You can do it by the day, week, month or the year, and then the sign up fee I use as a one time charge.

69
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,070
And that's the project fee that I charge for the website project.

70
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,240
And so those are my pricing details.

71
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,680
And then there's two more things that I'd like to show you first up here.

72
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,900
These are all about the visibility of the product inside of the website itself.

73
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,240
Now each of these is a private product.

74
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:29,080
This is the permalink, the link that I share for my customer, and I'll email them this link and no

75
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,780
one else has this link.

76
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,380
And so it's a hidden product.

77
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:39,520
And so what I want to do is change this catalog visibility here under I can click, edit and you know,

78
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,590
it's available in the shop and the search results by default, but you want to choose hidden and then

79
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,820
click OK.

80
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,990
So this is hidden from the catalog.

81
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,160
That means that when someone's on your website and they go to shop, it will won't show up on the shop

82
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,550
page.

83
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:03,890
But secondly, and potentially more importantly, I limit the visibility of this product in the Google

84
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,720
Google search results.

85
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,610
And on the internet at large by limiting its visibility using SEO.

86
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,720
And so I'm using the SEO Yost SEO plug in and I have that activated.

87
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:24,410
Once you have that activated, you can choose a setting which which automatically sets products as not

88
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,090
visible or hidden from SEO and from search engines.

89
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:37,640
And so under advanced in the Yost's selection box here on the product, you can see that allows search

90
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,250
engines to show this product in search results is chosen to know and that's what you want.

91
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:49,160
And currently I have that as the default for products in the U.S. deseo plug in settings.

92
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,860
And so I just make sure that that's correct.

93
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,790
And then I would click Publish and then this product is now available.

94
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:02,450
If if they were to go to this link and they would find it there, they could click sign up now and then

95
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,890
it would take their billing details, obviously, and they could go ahead and pay with their credit

96
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,190
card.

97
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,250
And we'll talk about the payment gateway that I use as well.

98
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,200
For me, I use Stripe.

99
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:19,160
It works in in that really well for me, and I do prefer it over PayPal.

100
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:26,720
But Stripe is a really popular way to try to collect payments and as a payment gateway in the SEO menu,

101
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:34,940
in the admin menu on the left here under SEO, under search appearance, you can choose content types

102
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,830
and then not posts.

103
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:42,050
But as you go down here, as long as you have WooCommerce enabled, you can close each one of these

104
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,730
under products.

105
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:51,560
You can choose the default settings and so you just toggle off under show products in the search results

106
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,690
and then click save changes.

107
00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,920
And that will mean for every product that you create in the future under products, add new.

108
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,270
As soon as you create a new product that will then toggle that off as we look under your SEO under advanced.

109
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,270
It'll just always be no current default for products, and that's how you turn that off and make sure

110
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:21,140
that your product doesn't come up in the search results in Google on a product that you want to be just

111
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,550
private for your own client.

112
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:29,810
I've been talking about WooCommerce as the e-commerce provider plugin that I'm using, it is a free

113
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:36,560
plugin that you can use for ecommerce stores and I've used a paid attachment or extension for WooCommerce

114
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,340
called Woooo subscriptions or WooCommerce subscriptions.

115
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,680
And let me just show you a couple of things that that provides for under WooCommerce here on the site

116
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,420
and under settings under the Subscriptions tab over here.

117
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,990
On the right hand side, this is where you would choose what the button says.

118
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,690
I choose to say Sign up now.

119
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:03,500
And there's a few other settings that it provides for when you have the subscriptions extension enabled.

120
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,210
Let me just show you over here under WooCommerce scam in one of their products.

121
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:16,910
If you just search the extensions, store or search for WooCommerce products under WooCommerce subscriptions,

122
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:25,700
this is the plug in and now it does cost $199 per year, and I think it is well worth using for this

123
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,980
purpose with WooCommerce.

124
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:33,800
It just makes it so easy for me to create recurring subscriptions and have the customer manage their

125
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,320
own payment methods without having to do having me to do anything at all.

126
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:44,540
And so as we look down and under WooCommerce subscriptions, you can see that a few of the benefits

127
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,490
you know, you can choose multiple billing schedules to suit the needs of your customers.

128
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:56,750
As I said, monthly or yearly billing, there's over 25 payment gateways that are available and can

129
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,700
be used with WooCommerce subscriptions.

130
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:05,150
No matter what country you're in, you probably can find a way to use WooCommerce subscriptions to take

131
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,130
automatic recurring payments.

132
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:13,490
You can also do manual recurring payments and have it keep track of reminding you when you need to take

133
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:13,880
a payment.

134
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,790
If you have a client that prefers to write you a personal cheque then or a business check, that would

135
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,320
be fine.

136
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,670
You can just go ahead and enter that on the anniversary of their subscription.

137
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,960
And there's automatic rebuilding, you know, in the case where a credit card has expired, it takes

138
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,390
care of rebuilding on failed subscription payments, etc. Subscribers can upgrade or downgrade if you

139
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,060
have different levels of service, among many other different benefits.

140
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:45,980
And so the reason I love this plug in is for all those benefits and that it isn't an official plug in

141
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,840
supported by the company that powers WordPress, and it is an annual charge.

142
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:57,980
It only takes really one client account to feel that for me, that that really pays for this service,

143
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:06,010
and I use it on my website for every client that I charge, website care and hosting plans for.

144
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,610
And so it's a great thing.

145
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:16,640
Now I use the Stripe Payment Gateway because it works easily and it's it works for free with WooCommerce,

146
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,070
but you do need to pay the stripe fees in order to accept credit cards.

147
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:27,310
And so this is a standard fee generally standardize across the world.

148
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:35,840
As far as it's almost exactly what PayPal charges, it is exactly at 2.9 percent of the transaction

149
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,960
fee, plus 30 cents for each transaction.

150
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:46,340
And so I included as a cost of doing business that I pay almost three percent of the billing amount

151
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,730
for every time a person pays me with a credit card.

152
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:57,320
For years and years, I only did manual invoicing and took checks and where I didn't have to pay a fee

153
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,460
for taking those payments.

154
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:04,670
But I believe that it is well worth it for me to be able to take both automated recurring payments and

155
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:11,960
at the same time, be able to accept credit cards, especially because they can come out automatically

156
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,570
on a recurring basis.

157
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,530
And so it's an expense.

158
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:23,670
Both the Stripe Gateway fee and the subscriptions module fee to be able to take recurring payments.

159
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:30,710
Now, if you're just starting out and you don't want to take on those fees, I think that's totally

160
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,020
fine and you can do individual invoicing.

161
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:40,760
It's really easy to do invoicing through a free Google Doc or Google invoice, a spreadsheet that you

162
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:47,480
can manage with the Google Docs or Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel, something like that where you

163
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,290
can just send an invoice and then take a check from your customer.

164
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:58,670
But I think it's really advanced way of putting together just a website for your customers to come to

165
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,640
where they can come over and manage their own account.

166
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,410
They can see their orders.

167
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,850
They can look at their subscriptions and when their subscription is coming due.

168
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,970
And there's more that you can offer them to be able to manage their payment methods, et cetera.

169
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,670
Now there's one more thing I want to show you within WooCommerce and that is under the Emails tab under

170
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,380
WooCommerce settings.

171
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,270
One thing I like to do for.

172
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:30,760
Webster, like mine, where you know, the the customer makes the payment, and in WooCommerce, it's

173
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,990
set up by default so that that turns into a processing order.

174
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:42,160
And as you remember, when I created a let me go back when I created a.

175
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,890
As you remember, when I created a product, let me go.

176
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,650
Open up products.

177
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,370
As you remember, when I was showing you my product for a website customer, I arranged so that.

178
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,110
Hmm.

179
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:31,680
When I set up a product for my website customer, I enabled that as a virtual product because there

180
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,360
was nothing that I was going to ship.

181
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:39,210
So it turns off the shipping system, but there is something within WooCommerce and the email communication

182
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:46,380
that I think it's smart to turn off to match with this system because I'm not going to be shipping anything.

183
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,700
I don't need to notify the customer that their order has shipped.

184
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:57,360
And so you may find that you have a repeated email that repeats the invoice and can be confusing for

185
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,440
customers that are buying a virtual product from you through WooCommerce.

186
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:09,000
And so what happens with WooCommerce is when a customer buys a product, the order is is placed and

187
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:17,400
it's listed in your WooCommerce store under orders as an order that is as a processing order, and after

188
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,500
the payment goes through, it turns from a new order to a processing order.

189
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,370
And that gives you time to prepare the item for shipping.

190
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,330
And then mark the order completed once you've shipped it.

191
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:38,100
And if you look at the completed order email, this completed order email is designed to notify the

192
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,550
customer that their order has shipped and now their order is complete.

193
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,910
And so if there's nothing to ship, what can happen is when you change the order from processing to

194
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:54,330
completed in your WooCommerce system under orders here, it can generate another customer email that

195
00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:00,120
goes out confuse the customer because it will be almost the same exact email they got when they placed

196
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,220
their order and the payment went through.

197
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:08,740
And so what I usually do is I turn off the completed order email that goes out to the customer.

198
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,100
And we do that is under manage.

199
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:19,500
You would look at this order here and just uncheck enable this email notification and then click Save

200
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:27,450
Changes in that way that completed order email will be disabled and you'll see a grey X instead of the

201
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:32,730
purple checkbox here to let you know that that email won't go out to the customer when you change it

202
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,500
into a completed order.

203
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:41,220
What I usually do is I'll let that order stay as a processing order until I see that the payment has

204
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,170
gone all the way through to my stripe account, which usually takes just a day or two.

205
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,080
And then once I see that the money has gone into my stripe account and it's on its way to my bank account,

206
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,170
then I'll go ahead and change that order into completed and then I can have that correctly reflected

207
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,760
in my WooCommerce settings.

208
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:07,920
I hope that gives you a great idea about how you can manage your incoming invoices and design fees and

209
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,610
project fees, as well as recurring payments for your website and your website clients where you can

210
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:21,360
set up a shop where clients can manage their own accounts, have a payment processor like Stripe, and

211
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,660
manage your invoicing and taking payments via credit cards as a modern business should.

212
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:34,470
You should be able to take payments from clients and use this system for recurring payments on an ongoing

213
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,680
basis and have it pay for itself in a short period of time.

214
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,950
And finally, I hope you can see that you can set up these types of systems with WooCommerce, Woooo

215
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:50,490
subscriptions if needed, and Stripe to be able to set up e-commerce stores and payment systems for

216
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,810
your clients websites.

217
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:58,170
This is the type of website that you can charge more for and can provide hosting and website care on

218
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,140
an ongoing basis for client sites as well.
