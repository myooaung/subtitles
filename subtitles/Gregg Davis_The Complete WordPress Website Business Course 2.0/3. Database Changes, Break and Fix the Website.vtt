00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.940
In this lesson, we'll access the database to change user information like the username and password.

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.700
You'll see how you can use the database to regain access to a WordPress site if you're locked out.

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.980
We'll also learn to troubleshoot plugin conflicts by breaking the site and then fixing it through the

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.400
server.

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.230
By the end of this video, you'll understand how you can take control of a WordPress site through the

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.070
database and troubleshoot even if you can't access the dashboard.

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.400
Now that we have access to the database and the files on our sample site here using local, let's play

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.900
around with it a little bit more.

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.960
Let's go ahead and look at the pages now and in the WordPress dashboard.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.550
We've seen where the sample page content is located here in the WP posts table in the database.

11
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.660
Let's maybe look at a real world scenario that might happen.

12
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.910
Suppose you took over a web site and you didn't have a user account for it?

13
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.780
Maybe the developer had left the the designer.

14
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.110
Maybe you have access to the hosting account, but you don't have user credentials for the website.

15
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.960
If you have access to the database through the hosting account, you can go and modify areas in the

16
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.350
database that would give you access to the WordPress dashboard.

17
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.340
For example, let's go in and look at my user account here under user's profile and look at some of

18
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.260
the things in the profile here.

19
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.640
This is data that would be reflected in the database, of course.

20
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.370
And so there's a few things here that are changeable.

21
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.960
I could have a nickname.

22
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.090
I could display my name publicly.

23
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.760
I could enter a first name and a last name.

24
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.310
As we've seen, the email is a required area of a user account, and there's actually a website listed

25
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.120
here in this one.

26
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.690
And of course, there's a password and you can set a new password here.

27
00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.090
Now, an example of not being able to access a user account would be supposing that you know you, you

28
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.710
are on the login page and you use that forgot password link.

29
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.130
But potentially maybe you don't have access to the email address that's associated with that user account

30
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.690
because it's for another person or supposing the outgoing email system isn't working and so you can't

31
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.210
receive a password reset email.

32
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.480
One of the things you can do is access the database in order to solve some of these problems and troubleshoot

33
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.600
so that you can regain access to the WordPress website.

34
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.870
Let's just look at changing something here that's not normally changeable inside of WordPress, and

35
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.270
that is the username you can see right here.

36
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.260
The message that WordPress gives you is that usernames cannot be changed.

37
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.790
And of course, that's true.

38
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.630
They cannot be changed from the WordPress dashboard, but not so when you have access to the database.

39
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.500
Let's take a look at the user's area inside of the database.

40
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.570
Now, if you look through the tables, might be able to find a pretty obvious area.

41
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.380
There's a double up users area and if you click select data now.

42
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.370
Now we've talked about this just a little bit and now we're going to go ahead and change the user name,

43
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.450
the username in WordPress, where it says user names cannot be changed.

44
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.140
So if we're editing the database, let's go ahead and click Edit right here.

45
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.890
The username is called user underscore log in in the WP user's table.

46
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.430
This is a row within the database table and we can go ahead and edit this.

47
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.380
So we are editing the table WP users and we're editing a particular row, the row for the single user

48
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.640
ID number one.

49
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.110
And so the user login, if I just go ahead and change this, maybe I want to change this username to,

50
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.970
you know, something different.

51
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.690
Maybe I'll change it to just anything would work.

52
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.620
How about Greg Davis one?

53
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.190
Instead of Greg Davis?

54
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.370
And now when I hit Save right here, it says Item has been updated.

55
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.730
We made a SQL command in order to change that in the database, and you could see that the user login

56
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.100
name is now Greg Davis one.

57
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.760
And so if I go back to the profile page and just refresh, you can see that because that is the login

58
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.670
name, it's forcing me to log back in.

59
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.760
Now, of course, if I go with the old username and the password, that shouldn't let me log in because

60
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.990
look, it tells me here.

61
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.180
The error message says that the username Greg Davis is not registered on this site, so let's try.

62
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.830
Oops.

63
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.510
Let's try the username.

64
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.920
Then I just changed it to.

65
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.430
Oops!

66
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.630
Greg Davis one.

67
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.160
And the password that I know great now I have access and I'm logged in again with the correct username

68
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.520
here.

69
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.820
Greg Davis one which of course, cannot be changed with WordPress but can be changed in the database.

70
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.600
And now, supposing you needed to change the password, and I've alluded to this a little bit in previous

71
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.450
lessons, but let's go ahead and change the password now.

72
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.570
I know what this password was in my mind.

73
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.610
Let's just, you can, you know, reset the password using this button right here.

74
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.850
You can you can choose one, you can let it generate one and then update the profile and save it here.

75
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.820
But what if you didn't have access and you needed to, you know, regain access and know the password?

76
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:48.420
As I've said before, this user pass is a hashed or encrypted version of the password inside the database.

77
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.190
And so even if you do have access to the database, you can't gain knowledge of the existing password,

78
00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.850
but you can reset the password by editing this row within the WP user's table.

79
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.580
And so let's go ahead and click Edit.

80
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.340
There's one thing you need to be aware of when you reset the user password, and that is when you go

81
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.430
in here and you reset the password.

82
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.120
Let's see.

83
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:23.830
I'm just going to call it kangaroo one to seven with a capital K..

84
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.880
That's a great password.

85
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.260
And if I go to user pass here and save it without changing this dropdown, then it's not going to work

86
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.070
as a password.

87
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.970
I have to go to MD5, the type of encryption that is used with WordPress, and then I can save.

88
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:46.900
And now you can see that that user pass field is now just a series of numbers and digits, and it is

89
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.330
not reflected in it's not reflecting the real password.

90
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.510
I do need to remember what that was kangaroo with the capital K one, two seven.

91
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.850
And so now that I've changed that user password, if I refresh the page.

92
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.250
Then it allows it will OG's me out again because it knows that that user had the wrong password.

93
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.250
And so let's go ahead and go Greg Davis one and I'll go to the password field.

94
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:17.580
Kangaroo.

95
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.650
One, two, seven.

96
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.750
Now WordPress does give you this little eyeball.

97
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.170
You can go ahead and look to make sure you're typing it correctly.

98
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.870
And if I click log in, that logs me in.

99
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:34.190
So I've changed the password to kangaroo one to seven with a capital K, and I've done that all through

100
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.540
the database.

101
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:44.300
And so that is a really great way to be able to re access a user account or edit any of the content

102
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.740
areas that you need to.

103
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.840
If there's something that needs to be changed and you can't access the WordPress dashboard for some

104
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.230
reason.

105
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.330
That's a good way to go about it.

106
00:07:53.450 --> 00:08:00.200
Now let's talk about one more real life use case that you might come across and where you can use your

107
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.240
access to the files and the database to help troubleshoot an issue.

108
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.880
And that would be if you have some kind of a plug in conflict or a conflict between a theme and a plug

109
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.090
in.

110
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.490
If you've been able to plug in that has some kind of code conflict, sometimes you can get a critical

111
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:23.120
error or the white screen where you can't access the website and you can't access the website dashboard

112
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.660
either.

113
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:33.800
And so let's simulate that and let's fix it by disabling the plug in or even the plug ins folder by

114
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.640
renaming it.

115
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.860
And I'll just show you how this works and you can in your own local environment, if you like, simulate

116
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.640
this as well.

117
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:47.750
So here in our WordPress dashboard, if you remember, we did install one plugin called a kismet.

118
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.620
And what I've done is in the background.

119
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.650
I let that plug ins screen open.

120
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.560
There it is, and this is an activated plug in.

121
00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.760
So it says deactivate here.

122
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.000
So it's an plug in with code that's working on the website.

123
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:10.430
And if I go into my my folder here, where I have the files for this website and where I've gone is,

124
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:17.390
you know, in the public folder, under WP content, under plugins, there's the Kismet folder.

125
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:25.700
And what I'm what I did is just opened the main kismet p p file in my code editor.

126
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.880
And by doing this, I'm just going to simulate a plug in conflict.

127
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.800
We're going to break the website and then fix it again by disabling this plug in.

128
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.590
And so let's simulate a plugin conflict.

129
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:44.450
So I've opened up a kismet up inside of Adam, and you can see here's the file name in the location.

130
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.920
And as I go in this, this is just one of the files that's part of this plugin.

131
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:56.300
If I go down to the bottom, I know that I can break this up plug in by just removing one of the semicolons

132
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.860
at the end of any of these lines.

133
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:07.580
So if I just hit a backspace where that semicolon was and then I hit control s to save, I have basically,

134
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:16.040
you know, replaced this this whole file with the new file, which doesn't have the required semicolon

135
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.460
right here.

136
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:22.160
So now if we go back into the website, just go back to the front end of the website.

137
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.650
And if I just go back and press, enter here to go to the same or hit refresh, look what happens.

138
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:33.200
I've got an error message here and there's a WordPress screen says there's been a critical error on

139
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:33.860
this website.

140
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.350
This is a place that talks about troubleshooting on the WordPress.org website, but it just tells me

141
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.300
what's going on.

142
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:45.230
It gives me a little message that it's about, Oh, something's wrong with this plug in online.

143
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.190
Sixty six.

144
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:53.270
And so one thing I can do if you come across some kind of error like that, especially if you can narrow

145
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.710
it down to a particular plugin.

146
00:10:54.950 --> 00:11:02.300
But even if you can't, you can disable plug ins if you have access to the files at the hosting account.

147
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:09.680
And so if we go, imagine that our files are now accessible either at the hosting account with a file

148
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.470
manager or using an FTP program, which will go over how to set up in the next few lessons.

149
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.690
But right here, I'm working locally.

150
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:26.390
So how do I access the files I can go back to, you know, the plug ins WP content folder and under

151
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.260
plug ins?

152
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:36.170
If if I just rename this plug in folder title to anything besides the name, what it will do, it will

153
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.710
result in that plugin being deactivated on the WordPress site.

154
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.260
And by doing that, that should enable that should enable us to regain access to the dashboard.

155
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:51.980
Now, before I do that, let's go ahead and just, you know, I had the dashboard open if I were troubleshooting

156
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:57.230
and maybe I wanted to go to the plug ins page or just go to the dashboard anywhere on the dashboard.

157
00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.180
That same error comes up.

158
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:09.260
So here's an example even navigating to the URL slash WP admin, you know, is not going to work because

159
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.660
of this plugin conflict.

160
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.280
The code is wrong.

161
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.060
There's some kind of mistake that's happening.

162
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.470
And so if you can't?

163
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.010
Access the website and you can access the website dashboard.

164
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.690
One thing you can do is access the files if you have control of the hosting account.

165
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:30.050
And so here in local on my local computer, that's for all intents and purposes, the hosting account.

166
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.870
It's the server where this WordPress site is installed.

167
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:38.660
And so I'll have to do like I mentioned, I'll go into the plugins folder and usually what I'll do is

168
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.790
just add rename.

169
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:46.100
So I know what I'm doing and I can remember if I have to go back in here once I rename this plug in.

170
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:54.410
And I have that finish, OK, so now that folder has been renamed, I should be able to go back into

171
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:58.340
the dashboard and re access the website again.

172
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.920
Now this.

173
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:01.540
There we go.

174
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.360
It opened up.

175
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:10.460
And if I go into plug ins, installed plug ins, it should give me a message that this plug in is no

176
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.270
longer there.

177
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.040
It's been deactivated due to an error.

178
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.920
The plug in file does not exist.

179
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.250
Of course, it's looking for a plug in folder called it kismet.

180
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:23.270
However, I renamed it, I renamed it a kismet dash rename.

181
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.410
And so it can't find it.

182
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.220
So WordPress automatically deactivated that plug in.

183
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.360
And I also should be able to navigate to the website and have it working.

184
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.210
It's just that that plug in is no longer activated.

185
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:43.970
And so one of the things you can do is you can go into the the files and you can access the plugins

186
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:49.010
folder and you can deactivate your plug ins by renaming them one at a time.

187
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:55.970
And whichever one causes the website to come back up when you rename it, that is the one that's causing

188
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:56.660
the problem.

189
00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:02.540
And so this is a really great technique to be able to to troubleshoot WordPress when there are some

190
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.580
code conflicts happening between plugins and themes or between two plugins.

191
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:17.540
And so if I bring this back and rename it back to kismet, you know, without changing that code, then

192
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.010
it will break the website again.

193
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:26.600
So you do have to kind of find out what's going on and then potentially delete the plug in and look

194
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.220
for a different solution for what you're trying to do if that plugin conflict continues.

195
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.990
But I think for now, we can just restore it by going back to the file again.

196
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:43.760
I'm going to put a semicolon and then click control to save, and then I have to go back into the files.

197
00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:51.950
Let's change the name back, and generally that will enable the plugin to be activated again.

198
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.260
It's looking like it's working.

199
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.840
Let's make sure that the front end of the site is working.

200
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.470
Really, I generally don't go into any plug in code and remove semicolons or anything like that.

201
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.960
Now a kismet plug in is working.

202
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.820
I could set it up or manually enter an API key there to make it work.

203
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:19.710
And so that that gives you an example of how you can go into the file manager or access the files at

204
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:26.490
your hosting and go into the plug ins folder and rename plug ins to deactivate them even when you don't

205
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.040
have access to the WordPress dashboard.
