00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.160
In this lesson, we'll create a new device website in the sandbox to start using a different layout

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.890
that takes advantage of a predesigned style guide with included matching global presets.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.630
You'll import one or more page layouts and then import and explore a style guide into the DV library

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.160
supplied by elegant themes in the DV blog.

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.890
By the end of this video, you'll understand how importing or creating a style guide with global presets

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.740
can result in a resource you can use in designing and revising the designs of a particular website.

7
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.380
Making your work more streamlined and allowing for editing certain repeated design elements globally.

8
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.310
Let's take another look at a use case for style guides and the global presets that we were just talking

9
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.570
about in the last lesson.

10
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.700
Now this one is a big deal.

11
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.280
You can use and import pre-designed style guide and templates that provide you with a number of different

12
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.200
presets already set up for some of the layout packs in DV or using this and figuring out how they how

13
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.570
it works will teach you how to do it yourself.

14
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.100
And so let's go ahead and create a new site.

15
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.190
I'm going to go into my account page here and you can do the same.

16
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.840
I'm just going to add a new site and we're going to use a sample layout called estate planning.

17
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.760
Oh, the address, the title is going to be a state.

18
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.270
So let me just paste that in there.

19
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.260
Estate planning?

20
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.030
I'll spell it right.

21
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.580
And I usually put my initials in front so that other people using the same name is not already used,

22
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.110
but you just click add sight, as you saw before earlier in the course and then we have a new site ready

23
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.440
to go.

24
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.520
So I'll click Dashboard.

25
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.430
And now that I have that new site, what we want to do is bring in at least one page that uses that

26
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.920
estate planning layout pack.

27
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.810
Let's just look under divvy layouts.

28
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.110
If I type the word estate, I can see that.

29
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.550
There we go.

30
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.350
If I just click any of the pages there, here's the landing page you can see this is a particular design.

31
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.800
It has seven layouts in the pack.

32
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.910
And if I wanted to bring in all the different pages, I totally could.

33
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.950
And you could do that if you want to pause the video and bring these pages in to start playing with

34
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.840
the global presets and the style guide, we're going to use and start playing with this website.

35
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.970
I'll just bring in the landing page as a start because it has a lot of the different areas and different

36
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.290
styles in there.

37
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.190
Now, actually, before I do that, I just realized looking at the typography there that I do need to

38
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.760
go into themes as usual and activate the device theme first.

39
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.690
And that would have been one of the first things I'd want to do.

40
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.850
And then also under permalink, I prefer to bring in change it to a post name and save changes there

41
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.330
and then settings reading.

42
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.190
Of course, I can change the home page to that landing page later so that I have easy navigation to

43
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.310
it.

44
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.650
So I could just go to pages all pages.

45
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.580
Click Add New and I'll bring in this landing page.

46
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.710
Just call it landing and click Use Divvy Builder.

47
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.930
And just quickly bring in this layout to play with and then you'll be able to to see how it works with

48
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.440
the global presets style guide that we're going to import from the elegant themes website.

49
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.630
So let's see a state.

50
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.190
That brings in some of the lads here, there's also one called real estate that I found from using the

51
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.680
word estate, but I'll just pick the landing page here and click.

52
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.130
Use this layout and I'll let that import.

53
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.010
Gives me that progress bar only takes a couple of seconds to bring in the layout again, depending on

54
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.100
how many images and graphics there are to bring from the elegant themed server into the sandbox server

55
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.310
here.

56
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.910
And so great, I've got a nice looking page layout.

57
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.720
I'll publish it.

58
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.950
All right.

59
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:31.480
So let's go back into the dashboard, and next, let's go over to the Elegant Themes blog and take a

60
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.710
look at what we can find for a global.

61
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.660
Preset style guide.

62
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.330
So I'm just going to go to the bottom of the page and click blog.

63
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.000
Often what I'll do is look for.

64
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.050
Style guide to see what layout pack layout packs have a prebuilt style guide built for them.

65
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.040
The first one you'll find if you search for style guide is the estate planning one.

66
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.040
And so if we click that blog post, this is a really good tutorial on how to use the global style guide,

67
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:11.010
its global preset style guides, and similar to bringing in, you know, a header and footer, you can

68
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.240
just, you know, click the button.

69
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.470
It brings you down to the enter your email address and you can just if you're already on the email list,

70
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.100
it doesn't matter.

71
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.720
You can use the same email address.

72
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.380
You won't be joining twice, then you get the download button right here.

73
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.110
Great, so now I just click download the files, it brings it into my downloads folder as a zip file,

74
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.500
and you can unzip that or extract it to gain access to the JSON file right there.

75
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.540
But here's a quick overview It'd be a good little tutorial just to glance through, but I'm going to

76
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:53.510
show you exactly how this works in this lesson as a part of the Divvy course and DV section of the course.

77
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.080
Part two.

78
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.810
So a quick overview of global presets.

79
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:05.720
We've done that already in the previous lesson, but then this is a style guide framework and and so

80
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.680
you can build global presets style guides from scratch as opposed to using one that's based on a layout

81
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.040
pack.

82
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.550
And this link right here gives you access to a kind of a blank style guide framework that you can bring

83
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.810
into your site and then build to match the layout that you already have.

84
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.240
And so if there isn't a style guide already built for a layout pack, you're using and divvy.

85
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.710
You can build your own based on that style guide, and it's pretty easy to do.

86
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.170
Gives you a super powerful way to do it.

87
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.070
So there's two options when you bring in a style guide.

88
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.460
You can upload all the global presets from that style guide at once into your entire site, which I

89
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.180
would recommend.

90
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:56.750
Or you can go down to Option B, and that is to selectively turning on modules and making them into

91
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.250
presets one at a time.

92
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.380
If you don't want all the presets in your website, it won't make a difference as far as speed for the

93
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.900
loading speed of your website on the front end or anything.

94
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.720
It's just if you want to be a little more selective as far as which styles, and you can bring them

95
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.950
in one at a time.

96
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.610
But this is all I need now that I have that style guide in my downloads folder, I can go in here and

97
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.700
what we'll do is bring it into the Div library directly.

98
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:28.370
So you open Div Library under Divi Divi Library and then you use this import and export button.

99
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:35.420
But first, I'm going to go into the Downloads folder and find this zip file, and I'm going to use

100
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:41.510
right click Extract all four windows, or you can double click for a Mac if you're using Apple.

101
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.350
And so now I've got this JSON file right here.

102
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:51.980
Now that it's ready, I could click import and export, just click import, and I'll choose a file.

103
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.170
Let's go to that downloads folder.

104
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.780
Find that Jason file and click open.

105
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.400
And now here's where you select, whether you're going to import the presets all at once or not.

106
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.110
So I do like to import all the presets, especially since we're just checking out the functionality

107
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.120
of having a US style guide.

108
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.840
And so now I'll just click import the DV builder layouts.

109
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.180
It's going to take a little bit of time to bring that in, usually a couple of seconds.

110
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.080
What is it estimating one minute, but after what, two seconds?

111
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.830
I'm already done.

112
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:29.480
OK, so once that checks and it finishes, it will open up the DV library.

113
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.830
And now I have a new DV library item and it's a layout that like the similar, a full page layout like

114
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:37.670
we've seen before.

115
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:49.370
And if we click that now, it opens a page editor that's similar to similar to using, you know, a

116
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:54.660
page editor as editing a page or a blog post using the DV builder.

117
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.210
But it starts you out in the wireframe view here, and if you scroll down, you can see that they're

118
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.460
kind of divided into sections.

119
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:08.330
There's a bunch of, you know, text modules, dividers, images, there's images in different columns,

120
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.370
there's different column numbers.

121
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:17.030
There's all kinds of things in here, and you can look at this and build on the front end as well.

122
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.180
And so you can edit this style guide.

123
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:27.470
And so if we click build on the front end, let's inspect this global presets style guide and just take

124
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.090
a look at what it is.

125
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.710
So it's labeled at the top.

126
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.130
These ones that you bring in from DV are labeled with a title.

127
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:39.650
And there's even a link to a tutorial for using this.

128
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.160
That was a link to this tutorial right here.

129
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.470
So that's within the style guide itself.

130
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.340
But as we look, here's where the power of it's going to come to light for you.

131
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:55.910
You can see that it's got six colors that are already created as a palette for the whole site.

132
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.990
And it's what this layout pack is using as a color pack.

133
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.940
There's visuals like icons.

134
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:07.580
These are images that are being used as icons added to your media library when you bring in pages and

135
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.990
this layout pack anyway.

136
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.290
And there's, you know these images.

137
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.290
They're all set up as different modules.

138
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.530
For example, if I open up one of the modules settings, you can see that this preset is in here by

139
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:26.510
default, but there's a number of different active.

140
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.670
Presets, so this is the estate planning layout pack E.P. L.P..

141
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.260
This is an H1 one or an H1 two.

142
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:39.280
For example, a tech, this is a text preset.

143
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.490
And so oops, let me just get out of here.

144
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.420
Let's go down and continue to look.

145
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.670
These are just some image presets images that you can actually save.

146
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.330
These are actually text.

147
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:58.960
These are for designing with text on top of an image, and you can see how that works as far as this

148
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.080
layout pack when you go into your site and take a look at it.

149
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:09.220
But this has a background image with it's a colored, transparent overlay and a background image that

150
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.150
looks like this.

151
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:14.540
So there's all these pre-designed layouts.

152
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.690
Now this is one of the visuals.

153
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:23.740
So visuals, you know, there are these text or these images here that's just an image.

154
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.550
And so you can inspect the layout pack and see what all the different resources are that you have here.

155
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.800
Now here's where the power of it really might come to light for you, too, with the typography, the

156
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:41.050
headings and the sizes of headings and the fonts that are used for the headings.

157
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.050
Also, the font and size of the body text.

158
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:51.480
We have a matching heading font and body text font that are used in the site itself.

159
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.630
So let's go back.

160
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:59.740
I'm opening another tab and let's go in here and check out the the I'm just going to view, say, under

161
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.000
estate planning and check it out now.

162
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:09.010
Of course, my home page isn't set yet, but if I open landing, then I'll go ahead and see how this

163
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:15.370
global presets style guide is impacting the design on this layout pack page.

164
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.920
So you could see some of these different, you know, these are some of the different visuals that were

165
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.670
available.

166
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:28.180
This is a blurb, I believe, using some of those different visuals that are pre designed for you.

167
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.330
There's the typography is visible here.

168
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.180
It's just a beautiful layout.

169
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:40.030
But not only that, this layout has all these resources right down here.

170
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.220
So here's the typography.

171
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:53.080
Here's a and a text module with everything all in one text block, so you can just see an example of

172
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.990
what things would look like if you put text in here.

173
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.260
It different different things that are already set.

174
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.940
So this is an all text preset.

175
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:08.650
So if I open up this preset, you could see this is the layout pack preset that we have called all text

176
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.010
one.

177
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:15.130
If we edit it, then we get that grey window and we can see, like, what are the design options?

178
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.240
The heading text.

179
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.260
So there's an each one.

180
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:24.460
It's designed with a particular font and a particular size and color, and then the H2, the three,

181
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:30.070
the edge for it is all pre designed for us, including the font.

182
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:37.780
You know, the way that it's displayed the color, even as far as the mobile responsive settings for

183
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.130
those font settings.

184
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:45.520
So the power of using these presets and importing them into.

185
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:52.550
Your your your layout is super apparent when you look at these presets right here.

186
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:58.820
So then down past the headings, you know, there's other different design things.

187
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.290
There's a what do they call?

188
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.240
Let's see, I got a little stall right here.

189
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:11.880
These are blurbs, so these are blurb modules that have been frequently used in this layout pack, so

190
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.240
blurb one blurb you can see they have some different looks to them.

191
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.950
These are other modules.

192
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.980
So you know, we've got a divider, the number counter.

193
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.850
All these are pre-designed modules that are already in the layout now.

194
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.970
And so, OK, here's where the power of it comes into play.

195
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:27.930
You know what?

196
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:28.760
I'll just go back.

197
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.440
Let's go to the bottom of this layout pack.

198
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:37.410
There's a video that's styled a contact form and email opt in.

199
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.180
There's an accordion layout.

200
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.020
The video has rounded corners, a certain size of play button.

201
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:50.220
The there's a slider layout where you can, you know, have this is designed as a testimonial slider.

202
00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.860
The blog archive is even designed inside of here.

203
00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.720
And then different columns.

204
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.140
So different column layouts right there.

205
00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:06.570
And so, you know, I'm going to go ahead and just exit visual builder discard any of my changes here.

206
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:12.900
So this is just a reference so you can find what you're looking for visually if you're going to use

207
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:20.010
these global presets, once you kind of know what's there and when you're, you know, visually designing

208
00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:26.670
a page or editing the design of a page, if you're in the visual builder, you know, supposed down

209
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:33.420
here, say in this in this section, I want to go down here and you know, I'm going to add add a section

210
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.400
below this one right here.

211
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.350
Let's go ahead and add a section.

212
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.980
And you know, I'm just going to make it a regular section.

213
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.170
We'll have a nice white background in here.

214
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.940
I'll make it one row.

215
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:51.630
And if I wanted to add say, I wanted to add a blurb module.

216
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.590
Now the blurb module by default in DV looks like this.

217
00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:02.370
It has an image and you could have either an image or an icon that you can choose if you use an icon.

218
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:07.470
Then you know you can choose which icon you want to use and it places it in there by default.

219
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.900
But now, of course, we're using the default layout and the typography is not right.

220
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.350
The header size isn't right.

221
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:20.160
But if we just go in and decide, OK, you know what I'm going to do, I want to use the blurb too.

222
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.200
So there it is now.

223
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:29.400
This is taking the full with the taking the full width of the content area here.

224
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:36.540
But now that changes the typography into really what the style guide shows us.

225
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.690
And so you can really see the power of this here.

226
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:50.310
If I go, maybe I want to do a three column layout with blurbs and OK, OK, I have the the default

227
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.360
blurb layout there.

228
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:59.550
But what if I go to blurb layout two and it's using the right typography and I can place an image there?

229
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.120
You know, when I I can, I can style that image.

230
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.170
Instead of placing it on top to the left, I can place it on top.

231
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.180
And the size is already styled.

232
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:15.210
And then once that's in there, you could just go ahead and, you know, duplicate this two more times

233
00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.610
and then drag each one, you know, into its column.

234
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:29.520
And you've got a really quick way to dis design with the correct typography when you're building new

235
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.630
content inside of pages or even building a new page from scratch.

236
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.490
So that illustrates the real power of the global styles.

237
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:46.110
It's really powerful and gives you an opportunity to build faster use custom designs.

238
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:52.590
And even if you're using your own custom unique designs or an imported layout, these style guys are

239
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.370
really important and fast way to design with divvy.
