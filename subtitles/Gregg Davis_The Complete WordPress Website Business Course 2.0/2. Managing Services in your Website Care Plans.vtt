00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.370
In this lesson, we'll look at what services you can include in your website, care and maintenance

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.470
packages, and how to best manage them.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.160
You'll learn how to monitor and update multiple websites at once.

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.460
Learn some tools that can help you with proposals for new client sites and how to express the value

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.160
of your website care plans to new clients By the end of this video, you'll understand how to best manage

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.460
multiple websites on an ongoing basis, as well as what to do with domain registration and email hosting

7
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.460
alongside your website hosting and care services.

8
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:43.290
Let's talk about hosting and creating websites for clients and how to manage some of the needed items

9
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.680
that have to be done to take care of a WordPress site on an ongoing basis.

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.840
Of course, in the last lesson we talked about hosting, but there are other layers needed beyond just

11
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.860
hosting, like WordPress, plug in and theme updates, WordPress core software updates, monitoring

12
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.440
for uptime and backups, and things like that.

13
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.440
And there are tools that I use and recommend for managing multiple websites in the background.

14
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.580
Now, just right here on my screen is an example of this is my client management website, and we're

15
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.270
going to tour this in detail in the next couple of lessons.

16
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:30.720
But just looking at draft media here, I use a very simple website with WooCommerce installed and Woooo

17
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.880
subscriptions managed in the background.

18
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.670
So if I have in particular potentially, here's a sample website, project fee and ongoing website care

19
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.350
and maintenance product here on my website that I've created just as a sample.

20
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.120
And, you know, for my website care, I generally start at either $100 a month for website hosting

21
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.140
and website care and go up from there.

22
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.240
I like to give, you know, a discount for paying in advance for the entire year.

23
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.330
Generally, almost 100 percent of my clients pay annually instead of by the month, so a thousand dollars

24
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.950
a year and a $3500 project fee is a good example of kind of a minimum small project fee for me.

25
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.520
Where I live in the United States for creating a WordPress website for a client, for 3500 for the project

26
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.700
fee and an ongoing membership for website care maintenance at a thousand dollars per year.

27
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.500
And so let me just show you some of the tools that I use in order to provide the services needed for

28
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.940
that website care plan.

29
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.390
If you look here, there's a little bit of a description, you know, just very basic here in the description

30
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.890
I've I design a new site.

31
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.270
There's a website care plan that includes software updates and monitoring and also includes hosting

32
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.090
that website and then email communication.

33
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.380
The client can can email me at any time to ask questions to have me do simple changes or updates to

34
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.100
the website.

35
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.620
And if there are any issues, then they can communicate with me in that way.

36
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.640
And so for that, you know, some of the tools that I use, one of them is manage WP.

37
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.940
This is a free service and there is a paid level.

38
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:30.600
But the free service managed WP allows you to use a special connection plug in that you put on each

39
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.380
of your WordPress websites that allows you to log in and have a dashboard where you can update plugins

40
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.100
and themes and WordPress core software all at once.

41
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.940
Now I tend to update websites in an individual basis, especially for larger updates like theme updates

42
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.880
or WordPress core updates individually.

43
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:59.040
And oftentimes I use a staging area to manage the updates to make sure that everything is working well,

44
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.870
and I test everything on a staging area.

45
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.380
However, manage WP and there are some other services that provide this same type, but I use the free

46
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.170
managed WP service to monitor my websites and know which of them need updates.

47
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:22.320
They'll give me alerts for any kind of, you know, if there's any kind of a software updated need and

48
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.130
I can manage simple updates, multiple websites at once.

49
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.640
And so it makes it easy to look at all of your websites together on a website management dashboard.

50
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.980
You can automate your workflow as far as they do offer in some of their more advanced plans, security

51
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.010
and backups as a part of their paid plans.

52
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.610
Client care and white label reporting is something that you can add on with managed WP, and you can

53
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.280
also do that through, of course, the flywheel growth suite that we talked about earlier in this section.

54
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.180
But I just use the free version of managed WP to just.

55
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:07.980
Get an idea of the state of all of my client websites at once, and I can get alerted if there's any

56
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:16.440
kind of a security issue where I need to update some plug in immediately because there's been a security

57
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.330
breach of some kind or, you know, a hacking attempt or anything like that that we've seen in the WordPress

58
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.900
environment.

59
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.610
I get notifications of that.

60
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.040
And so that's one tool that I really recommend.

61
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:34.200
A second tools called uptime robot uptime monitoring is something that in case your site goes down,

62
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.120
the worst thing is for your client to notice that their site is down and then contact you.

63
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.140
And that's the first you're hearing about it.

64
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.090
It just doesn't feel very comfortable to have the client see that.

65
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.530
So rarely now do any of my sites go down.

66
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:55.080
But Uptime Robot is a good way to just assure that you hear about it within five minutes.

67
00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:05.100
If any of your sites go down so you can get free 50 monitors with a check every five minutes with uptime

68
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.490
robot.

69
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.200
And so it's a great place to start.

70
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.600
And they do have paid plans for more sites.

71
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.080
But Uptime Robot is easy to set up.

72
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:20.250
You really just log in and put the name of your site up, and every five minutes they monitor the site

73
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.070
to make sure it looks right and nothing is wrong with it.

74
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:30.420
They also give you a percentage of time that your site has been up and shows you when it's gone down.

75
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.540
Historically, you know they've got the free plan.

76
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.510
The Pro plans check every one minute instead of five.

77
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:44.820
So that's an advantage, and it's just a great place to start because it gives you a real room for growth

78
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.010
as far as monitoring for uptime.

79
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:54.540
So let's look at some of the more advanced things that I like to include in my website care plans.

80
00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:04.080
And as far as setting up for hosting for client sites and even getting client sites in and, you know,

81
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:12.720
setting up proposals and website care agreements, let's look at a company called Agency Mavericks.

82
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:20.970
Troy Dean and his company WP Elevation, rebranded in the last year call to agency Mavericks am a great

83
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:29.160
resource for me and also for you is the blog at agency Mavericks dot com and at agency Mavericks.

84
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.680
There's a great resource under media and blog.

85
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:40.200
I really recommend as you're starting out or if you're looking at improving your client proposals or,

86
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:47.820
you know, interviewing clients and with discovery interviews and setting up proposals to potential

87
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.660
new clients.

88
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:57.030
Just go ahead and just search the word proposals in the agency Mavericks blog, and you'll come upon

89
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:03.330
a real set of great resources about better proposals.

90
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:11.220
We've talked about this a little bit, you know, you talking about features of your website and your

91
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:17.040
business as benefits and how they benefit the client, how to win proposals.

92
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:26.940
There's a proposal tools blog post right here, but this blog ad agency Mavericks, they support WordPress

93
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:34.110
consultants and WordPress professionals and help them to improve their businesses and their workflow.

94
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:42.000
And so there's a lot of great information in this blog here, and it is a great place to start and to

95
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.930
continue to improve your business as far as getting great proposals out there and among other topics.

96
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.400
And then another resource I would recommend is the admin bar.

97
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.780
If you're not already, you should definitely join the Facebook group.

98
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:06.630
The community under the admin bar Kyle, who manages this community, is a great agency owner himself

99
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:14.070
and has developed this into one of the best Facebook groups and most engaged groups as far as helping

100
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.180
each other as WordPress professionals and freelancers and agency owners.

101
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:24.540
And so there's a couple of resources here at the admin bar that I would recommend that you look at and

102
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.630
even even buy.

103
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:32.070
There's some a couple of low cost products that I would really recommend, one of which has to do with

104
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.720
proposals.

105
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:39.600
So there's this easy peasy proposal product that that they have at the admin bar.

106
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.210
And you know, there's Kyle right there.

107
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:50.340
But this proposal template, it cost 19 U.S. dollars, but it is basically a fill in the blanks proposal

108
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.890
template for getting new clients.

109
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:58.350
And so it's got a lot of things that some things you may just eliminate to simplify your proposals,

110
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.030
but you can.

111
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.460
Have things like, you know, what are the objectives, the scope of the job, how communication will

112
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.060
happen?

113
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:13.590
What's the investment and a lot of different things that are easy to kind of gloss over when you're

114
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:21.660
starting out and it just gives you a great framework for getting great proposals out for potential new

115
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.830
clients in your business.

116
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.070
And so I really recommend the easy peasy proposal template.

117
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:32.520
Now, it's not a contract and monster contracts is what he recommends, and I think it's a great way

118
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.730
to go if you want to go with the formality of a contract.

119
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:43.320
But the proposal really, it gives the client more of a professional look and an idea of what will be

120
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.580
involved in the project.

121
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:50.640
Because as you talk to business owners, of course, you know, website design and going through a website

122
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.680
redesign or a project is not something that is in their profession oftentimes.

123
00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:02.130
And so there are some things that are that are easy to gloss over and that they might not understand

124
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:08.850
going into it that really need to be a part of the project proposal, like scoping the timeframe that

125
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.460
it will take, how the communication will take place.

126
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:18.030
Avoiding things like scope creep, where you know, there's a certain proposal that's been signed off

127
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.560
on and then the client comes back and says, Oh, well, I want to add this to to the website.

128
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.860
And of course, I forgot that this thing is needed in our business and that can cause the the scope

129
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:36.280
of the project to creep upwards, which of course, is a cost to you as a business owner or the freelancer.

130
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.870
And so you want to avoid scope creep, and this can help you to do that.

131
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:46.230
And so the easy peasy proposal, first of all and then secondly, the website owner's manual.

132
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:54.870
This is something that has to do with explaining website care plans and what is what is involved in

133
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.240
running a website on an ongoing basis.

134
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:03.870
And so, you know, it might at the beginning, it might feel like $100 a month as a minimum or a thousand

135
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.160
dollars per year is a lot of money to run a website for a client.

136
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.020
But it really isn't, especially if you go through this website owner's manual.

137
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:22.200
And so to explain the website owner's manual, it came out at first because, you know, as an agency

138
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:28.290
owner or a freelancer, you know, you may feel resistance as far as the client feeling like, Well,

139
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.740
you know, you've charge me thousands of dollars to build this website.

140
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.230
It's already up and running.

141
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.960
Why do I have to pay this money to keep it going?

142
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:44.520
It's not a set and forget it process running a WordPress website or any WordPress or any website, for

143
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.120
that matter.

144
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:52.950
It costs money to run a website not only the hosting cost, but the managing software updates, managing

145
00:12:52.950 --> 00:13:00.120
monitoring and backups, which are a really important part of managing a website.

146
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:08.790
And so the website owner's manual is a resource that you can use first while you're describing and explaining

147
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.770
a project from the very beginning.

148
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.790
But also, if you happen to have a client that wants to manage their own website moving forward instead

149
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:26.340
of paying for your website care plan, one thing you can do is you can say, OK, it's great that you

150
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.880
want to go in and manage your website.

151
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.670
We spend time on each and every one of our client sites, and these are the things that we do.

152
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:40.560
And you can pass on the website owner's manual to that business owner, which explains the different

153
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:47.420
items that are needed to maintain and manage their WordPress website.

154
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:53.310
And it's about a 50 page document that talks about everything that you would be doing if they paid your

155
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.570
fee for website care.

156
00:13:54.810 --> 00:14:01.680
And, you know, 99 percent of the time, the result of that is that instead of the client taking on

157
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:07.440
the job of maintaining their own website, they would much prefer to have you do it for the fee that

158
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.520
you want to get for that.

159
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.520
And so, you know, there's important website details.

160
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.340
There is maintenance overview schedule.

161
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.140
There's a troubleshooting guide.

162
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:22.860
Now this is a great resource if the client truly wants to take on maintaining their website themselves,

163
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:29.910
and it is a great thing for you to be able to offer to them for free for in exchange for not maintaining

164
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.480
their website.

165
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:39.120
And so but the result oftentimes is that the client will turn around and say, You know what, my business

166
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:45.090
expertise is in running my business, and I don't want to either manage that all myself or have to hire

167
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:45.900
people to do it.

168
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:52.290
And so again, I highly recommend the website owner's manual as a tool, as a part of your freelance

169
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:58.740
business or your agency, and a way to sell more care plans, as the button indicates here.

170
00:14:59.370 --> 00:14:59.700
And.

171
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:04.510
Support the pricing structure that you need to get for your website care plans.

172
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:13.750
And finally, let's just talk a little bit about website and domain registration and email hosting.

173
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.990
I know in the last section of the website we went into detail about email hosting and how it's a best

174
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.750
practice to separate that from the website hosting.

175
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:28.840
And now in my business, and what I'd recommend that you do if you're hosting client sites is that whenever

176
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:36.280
possible for both domain registration and email hosting that you take that on as a part of your website

177
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:43.330
care plan and you just take care of that as a part of your single monthly or annual fee for your clients.

178
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:50.680
In my business, I roll email hosting and I roll domain registration right into my website care plan.

179
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:58.810
And I don't just charge them a little bit more for each one of those for email hosting.

180
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:04.600
If I do have a business that requires a lot of email addresses or say, you know, more than, say,

181
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:13.990
three email addresses, or I often will just escalate them to the $300 a month plan instead of the $100

182
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.590
a month plan for me.

183
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.040
Word WordPress website, hosting and maintenance.

184
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.080
And I like to call that a website care plan, of course, as you've heard me refer to it.

185
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:30.970
But the reason for that is that for both managing email hosting and especially for domain registration,

186
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:37.720
domain registration is such a small cost that you know there can be just for forgetting to renew your

187
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.250
domain name on an annual or on a multiple year basis.

188
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:48.040
As far as registration registration for your domain name, the result of not renewing a domain name

189
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.690
is quite catastrophic.

190
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:55.790
The website goes down, and so that's not something that you want to leave your client responsible for.

191
00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:01.270
It's better to take that responsibility off their plate and just take care of of that for them.

192
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:07.810
So oftentimes, if a client already has a domain registered in their name, I'll make the extra effort

193
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:15.220
to migrate that domain into my Cloudflare account and pay for that myself as a part of a business expense

194
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.340
instead of letting them keep that registration.

195
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:24.970
Now, if the client would prefer to keep the domain registered in their name, that is totally fine.

196
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:32.380
I just make sure and remind them, and I keep my mind on that that needs to be renewed or otherwise.

197
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.200
The website and the email will go down.

198
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.940
And so if oftentimes I'll take on a new client that already has a website.

199
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.250
We're doing a website redesign project.

200
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:49.600
And in that case, I'll talk to them about transferring the domain name into my business.

201
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.570
Yeah, so that they don't have to worry about managing it.

202
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:59.170
But if they prefer to have the domain name registered in their name instead, then that is fine with

203
00:17:59.170 --> 00:17:59.380
me.

204
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:11.080
And so as far as email hosting again, I can, you know, at Rackspace, I pay about $3 per email address

205
00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.830
per month.

206
00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:19.810
And so if I have a client that's requiring, you know, a group of emails for multiple people within

207
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:28.480
within their their company, I do oftentimes either roll that into a website care plan that's on my

208
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.790
minimum cost or a little bit more.

209
00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:37.240
The if I feel that the website care is going to take a little bit more of my time and I want to be more

210
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:44.140
hands on with that client as far as managing more email addresses and storing those and helping that

211
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:51.400
client as far as with blog posts or ongoing work, that might be more time on my part, then I escalate

212
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.080
them to the $300 a month website care plan instead of 100.

213
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.760
And so those are my two levels.

214
00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.640
That's something that you have to decide for yourself.

215
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:06.100
You know what you want to charge for that, but that's just an example of how I really like to roll

216
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.980
everything into my own business and then charge a particular amount for that.

217
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.320
As far as in my business?

218
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:22.670
Next, a major part of managing client sites is, you know, doing software updates on plug ins, on

219
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:29.930
themes and on WordPress, as well as keeping the server nice and fast and scalable up and down, as

220
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:36.230
well as doing multiple backups so that you have an easily restore able backup in case anything were

221
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.890
to happen.

222
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:44.180
And so we'll go into detail next about the backups and updates and staging areas that I use in my business

223
00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.860
and what I recommend for you.

224
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.090
Let's get into that next.
