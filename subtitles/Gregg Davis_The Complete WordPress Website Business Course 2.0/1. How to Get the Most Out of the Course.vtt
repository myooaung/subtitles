00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.200
This first lesson is about how this course is organized and what you need and need to know to get the

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.010
most out of it.

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.560
Each section of the course covers a particular topic related to WordPress website development, and

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.260
some topics extend to more than one section.

5
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.660
If you already have experience in a particular area of WordPress website development, feel free to

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.380
skip around.

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.350
However, I've done my best to organize the sections into logical steps where one skill you learn builds

8
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.270
from one section into the next.

9
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.490
Each section does make more sense when viewed from start to finish, but you can use the lesson titles

10
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.820
to go back and reference a particular topic or segment.

11
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.490
You only need a computer and a browser to do everything in the course, and I suggest you use Chrome,

12
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.040
Firefox or Firefox Developer Edition to get the best experience as you create websites.

13
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.270
There's a resources page at leverage WP dot com slash resources, where I shared links and references

14
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.150
to all the tools, plugins, themes and helpful resources I recommend and refer to in the course.

15
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.380
I keep that updated and current at all times, so feel free to bookmark it in your browser and refer

16
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.810
to it when looking for help about any WordPress topic.

17
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.730
In the course where it makes sense, I include a written supplement to the video lessons to make it

18
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.340
easier for you to find external resources or as a reference document to be able to help you find information

19
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.450
again in the future.

20
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.660
There are a few tools I'll introduce along the way that are helpful, like an FTP program for transferring

21
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.990
files to and from a web server to your own computer.

22
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.900
Image editing software like Photoshop, for example, a program for installing WordPress on your own

23
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.860
computer called local, and a code editing program like Adam.

24
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.140
Most are free, and no paid software is required for you to complete everything in the course.

25
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.280
Let's get to it.
