00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,840
In this lesson, we'll finish customizing the 2022 site by creating a landing page without a header,

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,600
you use a blank page template to remove the header and footer and a full page block pattern for the

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,140
content.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,810
Finally, we'll add a footer back into the page content with a custom background color to match the

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,260
pattern.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,780
By the end of this video, you'll understand how to remove a header for a single page and create a custom

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,620
footer as well.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,300
Last but not least, let's take a look at this film page.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,860
And so we have a different background color, a different layout.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,840
Now this, I know, is a block pattern that I saw.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:47,550
It was an entire page block pattern, but we've got no header and then we have a slightly different

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,290
footer because it has a different background color as well.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,430
And so we'll have to change the templates a little bit, but let's take a look.

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,660
Right now, our film page is just a standard WordPress page inside of our site with the regular white

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,820
header and regular white footer.

16
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,860
Oh, also, the menu is down here on the left hand side, but let's go ahead and take a look.

17
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:20,770
First of all, film, and let's just take a look at the black patterns that are available here.

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,460
I don't think it was one of the featured ones, but it might have been a page, was it whole pages?

19
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,480
Here it is right here.

20
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,230
Page layout with image, text and video, I'm going to place that in there.

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,900
And now when I want to remove the header, that's not that hard.

22
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:46,560
I just instead of default template, I go to a blank template that's going to remove the header at the

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,010
top.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,590
And then, of course, the footer will probably be the traditional footer down there on the blank template.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,900
So we'll see what we have to do there.

26
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,400
Let's take a look at it.

27
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,130
All right.

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,420
Really getting somewhere now over here.

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,870
The yeah, it's a little different, isn't it?

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,850
Yeah, I wonder if I want to bring this page design into an entire template.

31
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,650
So actually now it's blank, so I have no footer and no header.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,230
There might be a different strategy here for this film page.

33
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,930
Yeah, let's let's see about.

34
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:40,570
I'm sorry about just taking this entire group, removing it now.

35
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,300
And we want to use a different template.

36
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,720
So a blank template, maybe not.

37
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,810
Let's just look at the default template and hit update.

38
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,850
That's the way it was before.

39
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:02,000
This is going to bring it back into just a blank page like this.

40
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:11,250
Maybe I want to bring the footer into the page itself, and then let's just look at the templates that

41
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,880
we have.

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,530
First of all, it's an interesting problem solving task.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,470
Click Editor.

44
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,810
Let's look at our templates that we already have.

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,180
Mm hmm.

46
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,400
That's the home template.

47
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,620
Single page is the template that's the.

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,920
There's page no title was the that's the the default is this page template right here.

49
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,580
Single post, single post.

50
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,760
And then there's a page with no title.

51
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,070
Page with a large header, so there's blank.

52
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,550
And I think what I what I do want to do is I think what I'll do is I can't really add a new template

53
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:15,340
except for front page template with that free me up to use this template, potentially.

54
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,100
Let's take a look at this home template.

55
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,200
And this template contains.

56
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:33,540
A bunch of things I can commandeer this template and then recreate this template as that home template,

57
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,040
that would be one way to do it.

58
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,190
But let's go back here.

59
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,130
Let's go back into pages and bring that page layout into the film page content area.

60
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,520
First of all, and use the blank template, and then I'll just add the footer to this page.

61
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,750
That makes sense.

62
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,760
I go to patterns and where was that it was four pages.

63
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,010
Mm hmm.

64
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:07,310
Here's the full page template that I want him back to page in the Settings panel.

65
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,460
I want to use a blank template.

66
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,200
And now, you know, I want to add a footer down here.

67
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:24,260
So if I say plus and let's see, just look for some footers, these are just a couple of footers.

68
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,710
Let's browse all blocks.

69
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,570
I'm just adding blocks here.

70
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,290
Now, I might want to add a pattern.

71
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,470
I want to find a footer pattern that matches.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,770
No, it's not quite here.

73
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:56,670
I want a footer that has a menu on the left and then, you know, that little message on the right,

74
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,730
so here's a colored footer.

75
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,680
This is the one footer with a query block, a title and a citation.

76
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,420
So let's just take the.

77
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,380
All right, I added it.

78
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,930
I added it in a weird spot.

79
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,780
So let's just move it down and move it down again.

80
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,990
And move it down once again.

81
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,330
Now it's at the bottom of the page.

82
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,010
This is going to look good.

83
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,830
Now let's use the list view so that I can get to this group here.

84
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,780
And really, I don't need the post template or space or anything.

85
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,490
I really just need this row right here.

86
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,380
I might need that spacer.

87
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,370
But what I can do is just get rid of this query loop.

88
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,660
There we go.

89
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,070
OK, this is the bottom of the template, and then I have those two.

90
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,800
So update.

91
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,700
And of course, over here I could add a navigation menu like I have up at the top.

92
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,310
But let's take a look at my work so far.

93
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,980
So refresh that page.

94
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,860
Yeah, I need to make this heading a little bit smaller and then add some space at the top.

95
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,610
But otherwise, I'm looking pretty good.

96
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,330
And this at the bottom, that looks quite good.

97
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,350
Yeah, but I need the menu down here.

98
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,600
Yeah.

99
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,930
So I can add all pages down there at the bottom.

100
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,410
So right here, what is this?

101
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,970
It's in each one.

102
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,640
Make that a little bit.

103
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:45,210
Oops.

104
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,900
I that a little smaller into an age to an update, first of all.

105
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:55,750
Hmm.

106
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,190
Maybe a little too small.

107
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,000
And no space at the top.

108
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,920
So.

109
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,090
Say.

110
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,450
I could go back to in one.

111
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,120
Didn't seem to get as big, did it?

112
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,900
I wonder if that's going to be the right size now.

113
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,670
That's still nice and big anyway.

114
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,720
A little bit different, but that's OK.

115
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:31,640
I can probably really customize that each one size if I want to by looking at this block and I can customize

116
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,660
the size right here.

117
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,550
Yeah, so.

118
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,300
Size extra large.

119
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,810
Or size, custom?

120
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,160
See?

121
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,030
I still want that to be a header.

122
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,800
I can even add boldness if I want to.

123
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,840
So, you know, you can see where you can you can play with this a little bit.

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,070
See what 48 pixels looks like.

125
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,040
Sixty four.

126
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,640
Pretty close.

127
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,280
Sixty eight looks pretty good, let's see if that reflects the same looking size on the front end.

128
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,660
Yeah, just need a spacer at the top.

129
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,320
Oops.

130
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,450
Compare those two sizes.

131
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,130
Yeah.

132
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,320
You guys know how I can add a space or don't you?

133
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,230
Where would I add it in this?

134
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,350
Just above this heading.

135
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,130
I could just add.

136
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:05,730
Start to type, spacer, yeah, and let's bring it up and let's bring it up.

137
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,260
There we go.

138
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,050
Leave 100 pixel space are there and see what that looks like.

139
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,640
That's better.

140
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,890
Now we're getting somewhere.

141
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,310
Oops.

142
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:15,850
Yeah.

143
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,890
Compare the two.

144
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,140
Texas a little bit smaller.

145
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,230
So, you know, this is what you do, maybe go up to 70 to.

146
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:30,630
Oops!

147
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,650
Refresh the page that brings it up nicely.

148
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,160
OK.

149
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,140
Really getting somewhere now?

150
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,060
Lastly, should I add a menu down here to the bottom left?

151
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,090
That's going to be on the page here.

152
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,810
Let's go to the list view and go back down.

153
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:56,490
So in this row, we have a paragraph.

154
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,680
Oops!

155
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,560
I see, OK, so this is a roadblock.

156
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,220
And what do we have over here?

157
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,070
That is a site title block.

158
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,010
So instead of site title, here's the group.

159
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,310
Yeah.

160
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,720
So there's a spacer and then in this row there's a site title and then there's another row after it's

161
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,980
within the same row.

162
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,200
And then there's that paragraph text.

163
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,050
So I really want to take this role really right next to this site title.

164
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,120
Well, as a navigation.

165
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,400
And then I could select menu.

166
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:49,680
I've been it's the system has been creating all these additional copies of the header, a header navigation.

167
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,990
So I'm just going to choose the latest one.

168
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,970
Nice.

169
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,770
Let's go back to the list for you.

170
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,800
That navigation, that's navigation, where I added the HomeLink.

171
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,820
And so that's fine, that's what this one looks like anyway.

172
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,210
So.

173
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,990
Maybe get rid of this site title.

174
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,830
Oh, now we're getting somewhere.

175
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,260
Perfect update.

176
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,300
See what we have.

177
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,440
Nice looking great.

178
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,430
All right, I think we have a good copy of the page.

179
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,680
You could see how you have to experiment a little bit, especially working with this new interface,

180
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,400
the site editor and using templates, et cetera.

181
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,070
But now we have a nice copy of the page.

182
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:53,210
Now, of course, the header navigation is missing, but conveniently it's located down here navigation.

183
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,920
So we've got that page with the blog posts.

184
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,650
Each of the blog posts, the title and the featured image clickable to the blog post itself.

185
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,330
Very nice.

186
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,140
The about page has the large header.

187
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:16,310
We're using different template for that, and it also has a group or a block pattern, which was a group,

188
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:22,700
and it contained a query block looking at three posts, the three latest posts in reverse order and

189
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,490
then a different group where we would join our mailing list and we can add an opt in form there.

190
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,710
Same footer as always, the event page.

191
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:42,020
We got rid of the title by doing a little bit of sleuthing to figure out how we could make a template

192
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,410
that did not have a title showing and used that template.

193
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,710
We also used a block pattern to match.

194
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:56,420
And then finally, the film page where we used a blank pattern so it didn't have.

195
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:04,760
And then we we compensated for that blank pattern by placing the footer in here using another block

196
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,600
pattern within.

197
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,270
And this was a whole page design block pattern included in the 20 22 theme.

198
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,140
Awesome.

199
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,490
Well, that does it for matching our demo site.

200
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,770
I really think that was a fun project.

201
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,150
I hope you learn something there.

202
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:30,030
And next, we'll get into other options in WordPress for using pre-designed templates, as well as more

203
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:38,400
features that we can get if we get away from the new site editor and use the previous functionality,

204
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,830
which most themes are using these days under appearance, customize and different spots like that.

205
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,180
All right.

206
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,650
See in the next one.
