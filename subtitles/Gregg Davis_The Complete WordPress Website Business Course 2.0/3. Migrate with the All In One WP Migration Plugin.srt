00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,600
In this lesson, we'll use the all in one WP migration plugin to migrate a site from one host to another

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,380
using local.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,710
You'll learn how a plugin can make a migration easier by taking care of the required database URL edits

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,710
for you By the end of this video, you'll understand how to migrate a site between hosts using a plugin

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,490
that creates a migration file to import into the destination site.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,780
Now let's migrate a website from one environment to another, one WordPress site to another hosted WordPress

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,740
site again.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,820
Here between sites that I have installed using local right on my computer.

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,990
But again, this can be used between any live or local websites.

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:47,070
But I've got my first original site activated again, cadence, and if we look at it again, it's got

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,740
the starter template that is the real estate starter template, a complete website with all the pages.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,850
And then I created a second site in local called Migration with a plugin, and you can see this is the

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,280
URL migration with a plug in dot local.

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,640
I have it open right up here, and it just looks like another standard default installation with the

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,560
2022 theme activated.

16
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,680
Now, in this case, since we're going to use a plug in, what we want to do is navigate to the login

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,470
pages of each of these sites because we need to install this plug in in each of the websites.

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,980
And it's a free plugin called All in one WP Migration, a great migration plugin that works well for

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,420
free for sites that are on the smaller side under 512 megabytes.

20
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,150
If they're larger than that, they do have a paid extension that you can get.

21
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,520
It's well worth doing if you migrate a lot of larger sites, but let's look at the free version.

22
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,380
So I'm going to go to local.

23
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,840
You know, what I can do is just turn on my one click admin to make it a little bit more convenient.

24
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,770
So what I'll do is have this.

25
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,030
Word for this, it says, is migration with a plug in, and I'll usually just slide these tabs around

26
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,710
so I know what is what.

27
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,660
And just to keep things straight.

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,060
Now open the cadence one and I'll turn on one click admin for that as well.

29
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,950
And click admin right here.

30
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,870
Now, when that opens up the WordPress dashboard and I'm logged in, then I can.

31
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,510
Yeah, I can slide this over to the far woops.

32
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,030
Slide it over to the far left here.

33
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,420
And now you'll see I have the dashboard for cadence on the left and then the real site just to the right,

34
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,420
and then the dashboard for migration with a plug in here to the left and the real site over here on

35
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,750
the right.

36
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,720
And that's the way I'll leave it so I can keep sense of everything.

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,220
So let's go into the first one and under plug ins, add new.

38
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,920
I'll just start searching for all in one and all in one.

39
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,610
WP migration is what I'm looking for.

40
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,450
It comes up here right on the right hand side.

41
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,460
It's by served mask and I'll just click install now and then.

42
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,370
Once that installs, I can click activate.

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,630
And great, that just brings me to the plug in page and says plug in activated.

44
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:17,240
Let's do the same thing with the migration with a plug in WordPress site, plug ins add new and search

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,680
for all in one, all in one WP migration install.

46
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,730
And let's activate it once that gets installed here.

47
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:34,780
Great, OK, so I have the plugin installed in both places, so I need to do is go to the original one

48
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,010
and I go to all in one migration and hit export.

49
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:46,660
Now the difference with the plug in powered migration and all in one WP migration in particular, is

50
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,000
that it's going to export a file.

51
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:56,050
It's not a zip file, it's a W press file, and it's actually a proprietary file extension that only

52
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,040
works between this plugin in different instances of this plugin.

53
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,870
And so what you'll do is go to all in one WP migration and click export.

54
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,380
And this will take you to the all in one WP migration settings screen with the export button here,

55
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,080
and then you just click the export two.

56
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,570
And of course, it does give you the opportunity to export to different storage areas like Dropbox or

57
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,200
different things.

58
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:27,520
But if you click export to file, then it's going to just go ahead and prepare the export, and then

59
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,050
it'll download it to your downloads folder.

60
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,760
Once you click this button and it gives you an idea of the size as well.

61
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,520
And so I'm just going to click download can see at the bottom here that's just brought itself into my

62
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,660
downloads folder.

63
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,670
And then you just click close.

64
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:50,590
And so now I'm just going to go over to plug ins at the other site, and I have the all in one WP migration

65
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,880
plug in activated.

66
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,580
I can go to all in one and click import.

67
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:02,220
Now, I just have to import from and I'm importing from a file, and so it'll open up on my computer,

68
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,390
I can go to downloads.

69
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,830
Just click this dot w press file.

70
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,250
It's the one in my downloads folder here and click Open.

71
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,880
And now it's importing and opening this file, and it's going to give us a few things.

72
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,230
Just a warning.

73
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,880
It's saying, OK, this will overwrite the website, including the database, the media, the plug ins

74
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,510
and the themes.

75
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,120
And so just a warning so that if you had an active site and you were doing this, it wouldn't leave

76
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,970
the things you have already in that site intact.

77
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,560
You know, you really should do this on a blank site or a site that you know, it's just going to overwrite

78
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,160
everything.

79
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,950
So I'm going to click proceed and then that will go ahead with the import process.

80
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,760
And this will give me a message once it's finished.

81
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,800
Tells you that you shouldn't close the browser window or your import will fail because it's actually

82
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,920
doing some importing through the browser itself.

83
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,950
So it says, may say it's been imported successfully now, similar to the last lesson where we had to

84
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,360
change the URLs.

85
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,500
It gives us a suggestion save the permalink, links structure.

86
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,720
And so that is a final step.

87
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
That's important.

88
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,520
A lot of times when you're doing a plug in migration, I'm just going to save.

89
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,440
I'm going to click this save permalink structure and it says it's going to open in a new window.

90
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,480
And because of the database import, it forces you to log in again.

91
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,870
And in this case, just like I said in the last lesson, you'd have to use the original site's login

92
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,440
credentials.

93
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,880
Not the new site.

94
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,380
And that's just important to know if they're not the same login credentials.

95
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:46,350
So I'm going to use the original site login credentials, and that should take me to the permalink setting,

96
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,940
which is under Settings perma links in WordPress.

97
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,800
All right, so I'm indoor settings permalink.

98
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:01,370
And you just leave it here and click Save and then the permalink structure's been updated.

99
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:09,590
And so what happens if we go back to the original site, the new site where we imported this into and

100
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,430
click refresh?

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,190
There we go.

102
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,670
That's an imported site.

103
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,650
It should all work.

104
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,550
It looks like the images are working right off the bat on the home page.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,170
And you know, the interior pages are all working as well and everything works.

106
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:33,700
As you can see, using a plug in can be a little bit more simple than doing the manual migration.

107
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:40,730
And when I'm doing migrations, I generally use one of a few different plug ins that I like to use instead

108
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,740
of doing it manually, just because it's a little more simple and the plug in takes care of updating

109
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,260
everything within the database for you.

110
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,010
And so that's the all in one WP migration plug in.

111
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,530
And in the next sections, next lessons, we'll look at a couple other options for migrating WordPress.
