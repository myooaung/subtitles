1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,350
In this lesson, we'll look at the file location for a local website and explore how the WP config file

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,580
connects to the database.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,300
You'll see where themes, plugins and images are saved, as well as how the text content lives in the

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:15,870
database.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,390
By the end of this video, you'll understand where files are located within a WordPress installation

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,270
and also how content is stored in the database.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,090
Now, let's take a look at how the database and the files are connected and working together on a real

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,170
working website.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:40,230
I've had has a I have one open here that we've experienced before the leverage WP site, one in local.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,450
I'm using the local development environment and you can get in here and play with your own WordPress

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,020
sites if you're using local or another local development environment, or even do this at a live hosting

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,500
server.

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,460
If you prefer.

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:00,990
But if we look here, remember I can click right here to open up a folder with the WordPress files right

15
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,040
in the right location.

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,100
But just to remind you, if I go to just the regular hard drive, the main hard drive C colon on my

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:17,130
windows computer here and I look at users and then my own user name, I've got a folder called local

18
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:24,330
sites, and that's where all my sites in the local development environment are located and I can go

19
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,770
down to L to leverage WP site one.

20
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,370
And that's what would open if I click that little button inside of local right over here.

21
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,150
But if I open app under that site name and then public, that is where the files are.

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,420
Don't those look familiar?

23
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:45,000
And there's one difference here, which is the sample is still here, but really, the working config

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,310
file has been renamed and copied and is called WP Dash config dot PHP.

25
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,770
And if you double click that or open that in your text editor or a code editor, I've got that open

26
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,820
in my Adam Code Editor program here.

27
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,150
You can see that here's another tab with the original sample.

28
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:14,340
It just says database name here, username here, etc. But this actual working config file has a kind

29
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,370
of standardized set of credentials, and this is the way that the local development environment works,

30
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,300
the one called local.

31
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:27,660
And so the database name is local user is root password as root and the host is local host.

32
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:39,270
And that just allows the WP config file to connect to the to the database so that this is now a unified

33
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,900
WordPress working website that we can see.

34
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,630
And also, if I scroll down a little bit, you can see that there's also some authentication keys called

35
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,670
Salt's that are here inside of the WP config file as well.

36
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,070
Just to take note in these comments.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,420
These slash asterisks in orange here in the code editor.

38
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,460
If you go to this particular link that's listed here, you can just copy it all the way over to the

39
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,440
Secret Key Service actually right over to this slash at the end of salt.

40
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:20,040
If you copy that and then place that into any browser, you can get an automatically generated set of

41
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,460
authentication keys that you can use to sort of re authenticate your website, force anybody that's

42
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,070
logged in to log back out, and that can be a security measure that you can take.

43
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,200
Many hosting companies provide that functionality.

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,230
There's even plug ins that you can get that will change that for you, say, every 30 days or every

45
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,990
60 days as an additional security measure.

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,540
But if we go back to local now, this is a working website.

47
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:56,640
So if I click open site, you've seen that this will open the default WordPress installation using the

48
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,350
2022 theme and looks like it's taking a minute to open up.

49
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,420
There it is, and it's just a regular website right here.

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,240
And if I go into the admin, I've got the one click admin on.

51
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,220
And so if I click admin now, this is going to open up the WordPress dashboard.

52
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:24,030
And if I look under appearance themes, you could see that I've got three themes available here.

53
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:31,020
And so just to compare what's happening here in the dashboard and what's happening on the front end

54
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,710
of the website, we've got the 2020 two theme active.

55
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,640
And then there's also 2020 and 2021.

56
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:48,060
Now, if you recall, we went and looked at the files before in under WP content under themes could

57
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,690
see that those are the three themes that I have.

58
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:58,440
And so let's look at what plugins I might have now as a default installation using local.

59
00:04:59,310 --> 00:04:59,940
There's.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,300
Generally, not any plug ins here yet.

61
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,870
And so let's just take a look at what it shows.

62
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,530
No plug ins are currently available now because I'm using local.

63
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,400
I don't necessarily have to be connected to the internet to work with WordPress.

64
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:21,780
However, to get new plug ins and themes, you know, from the repository, which is online, I would

65
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,830
need to be online.

66
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,630
So my computer is online right now.

67
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:34,650
And for example, if I wanted to go and get a plug in like there's a standard WordPress plug in called

68
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:41,820
a kismet that oftentimes when you install WordPress automatically through your host, it will be installed

69
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,220
automatically so it doesn't come with local.

70
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:52,140
But now that I've installed, I could activate that spam protection plug in and then you can actually

71
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,260
enter an API key and or get a free one.

72
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,700
But now that I've installed that plug in, I could go to plug ins and plug ins, all plug ins, and

73
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,950
that would be in my plug in list.

74
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,770
And we can see that there's a little notification that it wants to activate that.

75
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:17,460
But you can see that that that kismet plug in is now in my plug ins, all plug ins screen.

76
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:25,830
And if I go back into the files, if I go back into WP content and look at plug ins, now you can see

77
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,430
that the kismet plug in folder is present there.

78
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,850
Let's try something else.

79
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,150
Let's go to Media Library and check out if there's any images in the media library.

80
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:45,480
Now, at this point, if I go to the Files folder here under WP content, now that I do have I've gone

81
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,650
to the media library.

82
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,380
All of a sudden I have a folder called uploads.

83
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,070
Now, if I look under uploads 2022 and 02, it's got an empty folder.

84
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:03,840
Now, by default, WordPress usually creates date related folders for your media library.

85
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:10,650
Often I like to go ahead and change that setting in my WordPress sites, and so I'll just go quickly

86
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:21,480
into Settings Media, and I like to uncheck the box that says organize my uploads into month and year

87
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,640
base folders.

88
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:28,800
I just like to keep all of my media library into one big folder on the server just kind of easier to

89
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,890
find and access different items if you want to.

90
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:40,230
And so since I've done that and click save changes now, if I go to media, add new, I can go ahead

91
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:47,070
and find an image and either select it here or use the File Explorer to drag it over.

92
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,350
So let's see if I find I can find some images here.

93
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,480
Let's see.

94
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,130
Where do I have my images?

95
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:11,020
So if I just go into my file explorer, I've got a folder open where I have some images that I've imported

96
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,030
before for the 2022 theme.

97
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,530
And I can bring some of these images in.

98
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:24,370
If I just maybe I'll just bring the three featured images over and drop them in to upload them into

99
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,480
the media library.

100
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:32,050
Now, if I click the library, you could see that I've got those three images could see the URL here

101
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,750
is just now uploads featured image to JPEG, etc..

102
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:47,380
And now let's go ahead and let's go back and look at the File Explorer, where I can find that again.

103
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,980
So I know I've got it in windows and here I'll go to users good local sites.

104
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,810
Let's find the leverage WP site one.

105
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,310
There we go.

106
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:07,150
And I could have gone into local and clicked just to get into here, but into WP content and uploads.

107
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,400
Now you can see I've got a few different images, and this illustrates something that WordPress does

108
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,580
in the background related to the theme that it's using.

109
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:23,020
It brings in not only the original image, which if I roll over and get the data here, it's a 6500

110
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,550
by 900 pixel image and it's 47 kilobytes in size.

111
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,770
But WordPress creates the thumbnails associated with the theme that it's using.

112
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:41,860
And so in addition to that file, I've got a featured image one that's a 150 by 150, 300 by 169.

113
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,750
There's all these different files that come in that the website can then use.

114
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:54,610
That's just showing that how the feature, how the file system works in WordPress and showing how it's

115
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,590
connected to that database.

116
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,780
Now, let's take a look at one of the pages that comes in WordPress.

117
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,960
Let's see if we have a sample page here.

118
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,230
Yes, here's a sample page that's published on the web site.

119
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,460
And if we take a look at that sample page, here's some content.

120
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,120
This is an example page.

121
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,450
It's got a title.

122
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,240
It's got some content that's formatted a certain way.

123
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,130
These are blocks, right?

124
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,890
So this page exists.

125
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,980
Let's find out where this content actually exists in the database.

126
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,490
So if I go back into local, this is where I can access the database.

127
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,280
If I click open admin or that will open up another tab inside my browser.

128
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:42,460
And that's where I can find the database and just browse to find out where this stuff is.

129
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:49,390
So let's just find in what table the pages, et cetera, are located in all.

130
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,270
This content is in the WordPress database.

131
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:05,310
So the content is stored in a table called WP Posts, both blog posts and pages are types of posts.

132
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,250
And so let's open WP posts just by clicking that once it's showing me the database structure.

133
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:18,090
But if I click select data now, it's showing me all the different rows that are within the WP posts

134
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,680
table in this database.

135
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,170
So you can see right here the first one is welcome to WordPress.

136
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,680
This is your first post.

137
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,280
The second one is this as an example page.

138
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,820
Now, if I click Edit, I can see what all is part of this database.

139
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,510
Now these are tags that are part of the blocks system.

140
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,130
This is a paragraph block and this is a quote block.

141
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,240
And so if we go back into the page here, that's the paragraph block.

142
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,050
This right here is a quote block you can see right here.

143
00:11:52,590 --> 00:12:00,150
And so that gives you an idea of how things are stored in the database, as well as in the files and

144
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,780
the way that WordPress works.

145
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,540
Remember, the only file that connects these two things is the WP config file that has the connection

146
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,240
that shows the database name, user and password and where to find that database.

147
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,500
In this example, it's located in a folder on my computer.

148
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,050
It's over here called public, you know, and that's where all the files are now.

149
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,710
If I go into the app folder, here's this sequel.

150
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:35,310
Here's the SQL file and this is the actual database called local that we're working with here in the

151
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,030
local development environment.

152
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,080
So that gives you an idea of how things work in the background.

153
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,690
Next, we'll get into taking WordPress apart a little bit and fiddling with it to learn more about the

154
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,070
way all this stuff works.
