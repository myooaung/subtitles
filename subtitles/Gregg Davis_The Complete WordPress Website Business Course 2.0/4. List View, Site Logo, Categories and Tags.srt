1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,400
In this lesson, we'll finish creating the posts and pages needed to match the sample site and begin

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,750
editing the header template.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:13,200
You'll had categories and tags for the blog posts at a site logo and explorer the list view in the Block

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,740
editor.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,020
By the end of this video, you'll understand the power of the list view for navigating and selecting

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,450
the blocks within the design, and begin editing the site wide header template within the site editor.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,270
OK.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,120
Did you get it done?

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,610
If you look at my post's page here, you can see I've got my three posts.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,880
One thing I just want to show you, I realized it didn't mention as we were creating the posts here.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:46,530
When you add new, when you have your tag field here, if there's and say, you know, I was in here

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,900
like this when I was creating a new post, if I know that there's a tag I want to use and it already

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,400
exists, I just have to start typing it and it'll come up with that tag.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:04,560
And when I click it, it will add that existing tag to the tag list of any given post.

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,360
And so I'm going to back out of here.

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,910
Of course, I didn't want to save any of those changes, and so my browser gives me a warning and I

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,450
can click leave so that I don't change anything.

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,180
And you can see the author name, the category and the tags and then the date and time published and

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,650
whether there's any comments in the columns here on the Post's page.

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,830
And so next, what is next?

21
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,170
Let's take a look at our site here.

22
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,360
Now, of course, this header and the blog posts in the footer are the home page, and that looks pretty

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,150
well finished to me compared to this one.

24
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,370
But let's look at the next page.

25
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,980
Of course, when we create these pages, we're going to have to add that to the header and we're going

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,110
to add this logo in here too.

27
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,780
And why don't we take care of this right now?

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,790
Next, I might go into here and we're going to have to go into the editor.

29
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,130
If you remember, this is called the site editor, not a page editor or a post editor.

30
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:11,850
And you can see there's a place holder here, a very faint dotted line so that you can put a logo in

31
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,120
there.

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,830
And I've gone over and used that logo.

33
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,000
Now, as I click around here, you could see that when I roll the mouse over different sections, there's

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,240
some different things happening here that are being highlighted.

35
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:34,050
And sometimes it's hard to know sort of where you are on a page or in the site editor.

36
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,840
And so that's what this list view is really good for.

37
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,960
I didn't show I showed you an empty list view before, but if you look here, these are nested pieces

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,310
of content or blocks that can be kind of hard to find, especially if they're overlapping.

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,760
For example, if you roll your math mouse between these two, there's a little bit of a space.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,350
And if you hold your mouse there long enough, that will give you a plus sign so you could add a block

41
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,620
in between the two.

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,510
If you wanted to.

43
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:12,630
But if you go over here and roll your mouse over the different, if you click on the different list

44
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,420
items here, it will show you what you're looking at.

45
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,670
And so the header dark, small and actually you can go ahead and use these little down arrows to or

46
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,430
side arrows to open or close that.

47
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:34,530
And you can even go ahead and you can use the hand icon here to drag these down and reorder things even

48
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,760
within the list view.

49
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,700
And so that's just kind of a navigation lesson there.

50
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:46,680
But if I was looking at header dark small, I've got the header section right over here and within there.

51
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,870
There's a row and another row within that row, or you could see this row.

52
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,410
Here is this one at the top left as I roll the mouse.

53
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:01,680
You can see where the site title and that logo placeholder are surrounded by that blue line.

54
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,130
And now if you go down a little lower, you could see site logo.

55
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,040
So if I really wanted to target that, I could click here in the list view and it selects it for me.

56
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,120
Now let me click away, and if I go back up here, I can.

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,520
Also, if I click enough times, I can get to there from the regular content area too.

58
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,660
But sometimes it's easier in the list view to find things like that.

59
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,680
So I'm going to click the Add a site logo button here, and I know that this right here, the logo in

60
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,470
black is the one that I want, and because it matches the background color, it looks like just a little

61
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,480
white pair of binoculars there.

62
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,360
Isn't that right?

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,860
Yeah.

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,230
And this theme is set up so that that logo is clickable to the home page.

65
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,960
So if I go back here, I've made that change, so I want to go up here to the right and click Save.

66
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,970
And now this is a little different than saving a blog post this.

67
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,670
You can't turn this off.

68
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:05,580
It does want to make sure that you want to save what it wants to save here because I'm saving a sitewide

69
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,620
piece of content, the header, which is going to affect multiple pages of the website.

70
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,650
And so you want to make sure that you're doing the right thing.

71
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:20,280
So this is telling me that within the site, what I've changed is the icon and the logo that's going

72
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,590
to effect something on the entire site.

73
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,860
It says these changes will affect your whole site rate.

74
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,800
And then it says which template part am I, am I editing?

75
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,470
Yes, I'm editing the header template part, and that's usually going to be exactly what you want to

76
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:35,800
do.

77
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:44,170
And unless you're like splitting a certain template into multiple templates or splitting it into a different

78
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,150
page type, you might want to uncheck this at some points if you're doing something more advanced.

79
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,970
But for now, I'm just going to go ahead and click Save.

80
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,670
Then again, down at the bottom site updated.

81
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,970
That means that I can go over here to my new tab, where I have the site open hit refresh and now I

82
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,720
have that clickable logo right there to the home page.

83
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:11,190
Now over here, the menu isn't right, but I still don't have pages created to replace that.

84
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:18,070
If I look at the website here, hit the the logo and then go back to the dashboard, if I click pages

85
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:24,160
or click pages all pages, you can see that the only page I have is that sample page that comes with

86
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,790
WordPress.

87
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:32,890
And so let's go ahead and create all the pages that are necessary for this website.

88
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,760
One at a time.

89
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,340
This could be a good challenge for you if you open up the twenty to twenty twenty two dot WordPress

90
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,180
dot net.

91
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,640
You could create an about page and event page and a film page.

92
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,320
And that's probably the way I would do it.

93
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,150
I create all those pages and publish them just as empty pages for now.

94
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,770
And then I'll show you how I match the design that exists here in the demo site.

95
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,260
So you might pause the video and do that, and then I'll come back and show you how I do it.

96
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,810
So I'm first going to take the sample page and just stick it in the trash and then just so you know,

97
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,550
when you put something in the trash, it still exists in case you need to reverse that.

98
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,990
And I'm just going to leave that.

99
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,710
But if you do, click the Trash tab up here at the top, you can restore that page to the Pages list,

100
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,830
or you could click empty trash.

101
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,730
Now, this would delete it permanently.

102
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,410
All right, so I'm not going to do that right now.

103
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,360
I'll just go back to old old pages.

104
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,540
There's no pages here, but I'm going to create those three pages about event and film.

105
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,880
And so just quickly, I'll add new.

106
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,210
I guess it doesn't matter what order about Publish can see, it publishes it right away because I I

107
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,240
uncheck that box to do the pre checks.

108
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,960
And so then I'll hit, you know, back to the pages list.

109
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,010
Add new.

110
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,110
Next one is events.

111
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,000
Or is it event?

112
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,100
Yeah, it's just events singular.

113
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,990
Published that one.

114
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,530
Back to the dashboard from there.

115
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,160
One more.

116
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,470
Add new and this one is film.

117
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:25,610
It's going to be an interesting one to create, as you saw the there's a block pattern that gives us

118
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,330
that layout inside of 20 22, which is interesting.

119
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:36,260
And so hey, now your challenge is to go through and recreate these three pages looking through the

120
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,350
block patterns and see what you can find that would match first the about page here.

121
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:50,840
And then secondly, the event page, which goes back to white and has this layout.

122
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:57,230
And then the film page, which has no header, a different background color and also a different background

123
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,700
color on the footer.

124
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,140
Hint, hint.

125
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:05,570
So see if you can accomplish that and we'll see how you get on.

126
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,940
And when we come back, I'll show you how I've done it.
