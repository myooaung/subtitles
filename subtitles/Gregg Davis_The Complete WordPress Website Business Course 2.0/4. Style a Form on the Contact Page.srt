1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,060
In this lesson will activate and configure the forms plug in for the contact page on the small business

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,830
design using the Frost theme.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,960
You'll get to know the forms plug in a little better as you change the styling to match and see how

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,120
the form takes on the style of the theme.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,790
By the end of this video, you'll be more familiar with embedding and configuring a contact form, including

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,020
the submit button itself.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,160
Now, let's take a look at what else we might be able to do here if we click the Get Started button,

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,530
which goes to a contact page, it says Contact us, fill out the form and we'll be in touch shortly.

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,510
Well, here's a good challenge for you.

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:44,060
Go ahead and activate the forms, plug in and create a contact form and inserted here and style it as

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,540
you like.

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:51,080
So if you'd like, pause the video now, create a contact form for the contact page and see what you

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,760
can do there.

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,080
And when we come back, I'll show you how I do that.

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,590
All right.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:05,450
If I go back to the dashboard first, I'm just going to click back to the dashboard and go to plug ins

17
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,140
on this site.

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,110
And go ahead and activate the fluent forms plug in, just like we did with the twenty twenty two theme.

19
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,160
And now under fluent forms, let's go to all forms.

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,090
There's a contact form demo already created as we saw before any subscription form already created.

21
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,600
This would be for an opt in like we we didn't set up, but there's a space for it in the twenty 2022

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,380
theme isn't there?

23
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,680
So what I'll do is edit this contact form and then inserted into that contact page.

24
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,160
And so if I want to change the name, let's just click up here and I'll call a contact form instead

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,500
of contact form demo and click Rename.

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:58,500
And then we've seen this before in the last section, but let's just insert it as is and see what it

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,190
looks like.

28
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,510
You remember how to do that?

29
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,650
Click the shortcode up here to copy it.

30
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,120
Also, if you click all forms, the shortcode is also available over here.

31
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,980
Let's go back right here.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,760
So if you click to copy the shortcode, it'll be right there.

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,290
And so let's go to pages all pages and you remember what the contact us page is like.

34
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,520
Let's click contact us.

35
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,700
And now this site, it says, doesn't include support for the Ninja Forms Form block.

36
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:41,490
So that was brought in with the import when we imported the content from Frost WP Gqom and so we can

37
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,390
just select that block and remove that block.

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,540
And so what do we have the title of the page and then fill out the form and we'll be in touch shortly?

39
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,700
Sure, you can add a block.

40
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,660
You remember what kind of block we need to shortcode.

41
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,500
So I'm just going to paste that shortcut in there and click Update.

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,110
And then let's take a look at it.

43
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,910
All right, that's looking pretty nice, nice and fancy now on this site.

44
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,810
There's a few differences in design.

45
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,640
I can see the buttons, of course, looking different.

46
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:24,560
But one thing that's great about fluent forms and some other forms plug ins is that the text it's using

47
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,710
is able to be styled by the theme itself.

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,930
And the same was true of 2022.

49
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:37,280
But if you look, this is the same font that we're using in other places in the site, even though it's

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,170
a part of the forms plug in now, the button itself has been styled by the form.

51
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,900
And so let's go ahead and fix that and maybe make this look a little bit better.

52
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:56,240
You may have done that yourself, but I think what I might do is see, go back and let's go into forms.

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,390
All forms.

54
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,940
Let's see, I'll edit this.

55
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,130
And let's look.

56
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,140
So each one of these fields.

57
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,310
Let's look at the settings, first of all.

58
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,620
But for the form lap, let's see for the labels.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,810
Think maybe what I want to do.

60
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:26,930
I do like these bold headers here, and so I might just take out all the placeholder text.

61
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,680
We did that before in the in the last section.

62
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,760
Let's see the help message, the error message, the asterisk.

63
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,860
Oh, looks pretty good right there.

64
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,600
So I'm going to go straight to the editor then and begin editing these things in here, so under the

65
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,220
name for the first name, I'm going to remove the placeholder.

66
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,140
I can probably just do this.

67
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,440
All at once without having to save it every single time.

68
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,970
So, oh, you know what, I didn't do the last name that I can see it reflected here.

69
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,700
So I'll do the do the last name, remove the placeholder.

70
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,480
OK.

71
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,950
So, yeah, there we go.

72
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,130
Uh, those are the name fields.

73
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,920
Let's go to the email address field.

74
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,430
Take out the placeholder again subject.

75
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,950
Remove the placeholder message.

76
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,140
Your message placeholder?

77
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,180
And let's take a look at the button.

78
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,960
I think what I need is something.

79
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,190
Let's take a look at what happens when I click no style.

80
00:05:52,550 --> 00:06:00,170
I believe that I'll let the theme itself style the button and I think maybe a little bit larger since

81
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,650
this is such a wide open theme with a lot of white space.

82
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,170
And I'll leave it at the left side.

83
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,490
Let's click Save Form.

84
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,190
Go back and refresh.

85
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,690
OK, so new style that looks pretty good, really, it's got kind of a gray.

86
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,590
It doesn't have any rollover effects, though.

87
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,710
Yeah, that looks quite nice, though.

88
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,550
Let me go back.

89
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,780
I think what I'd like to do is style the button a little differently.

90
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,930
I'll just try.

91
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,850
Let's try Gray.

92
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,340
Large.

93
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,950
Yeah, I think that's going to give us a nice rollover effect.

94
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,450
Yeah, that looks nice.

95
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,320
All right.

96
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,010
You could do it however you like, but that does look nice, doesn't it?

97
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,760
All right.

98
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,590
That's a nice contact us form and it is ready to go.
