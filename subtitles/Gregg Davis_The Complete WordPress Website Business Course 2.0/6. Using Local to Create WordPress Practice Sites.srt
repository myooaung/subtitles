1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,730
In this lesson, I'll show you local, a program for easily creating a server environment on your own

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,570
computer that you can use to play with WordPress and experiment locally.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,180
You'll learn how you can use a local development environment to spin up as many WordPress sites as you

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,910
like to try out different things or test themes and plugins before committing those tests to a live

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,810
hosting environment.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,330
By the end of this video, you'll understand how using a local environment can expand your ability to

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,410
play with and learn WordPress without hosting or an internet connection.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,290
Let's talk about local WordPress hosting.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,120
Now this is an option for you.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,720
If you want to create an unlimited amount of WordPress sites for free just available to you on your

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,950
computer where you can practice and test things and build sites.

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:54,690
Even migrating sites and uploading them to a live host so that they can be live web sites in the future.

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,870
Local WP, XCOM or local is a great option for you.

14
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:08,850
This is probably the best local development tool for WordPress in the world, at least right now, and

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,250
it is completely free.

16
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,860
You can download it for free with this little button or even or create an account, which will give

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,910
you a few more benefits to downloading local, even to the point where you can connect it to your flywheel

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:30,630
hosting and use it as a staging environment or a development environment connected to your flywheel.

19
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,310
Hosting local is owned by a flywheel hosting, but it's provided completely free as a separate free

20
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,660
local development product.

21
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,660
And so if you download and install local WP, one of the things I should show you is that there's a

22
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:52,770
community as well that is a great place for resources, for looking up if you have any issues or anything

23
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,470
now, depending on the power of your personal computer, on a Mac or on Windows.

24
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,450
There are some limitations and sometimes some operating system conflicts that can happen when you set

25
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,670
up any local development environment, because what you're doing is you're setting up software that

26
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,250
usually powers live.

27
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,010
WordPress hosts servers connected to the internet, and you're installing that kind of software right

28
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:26,820
on your personal computer so that you can power a piece of software like WordPress to deliver WordPress

29
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,180
websites to your browser right there within your computer.

30
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:38,130
Now you can work with and practice with WordPress websites right on your local machine without being

31
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,640
connected to the internet, which is a really interesting way to work.

32
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:51,120
And I'll open my local program right here, and you could see that I use it for practicing and for testing

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,530
things for building sites in an environment where it's super fast to work with because I don't have

34
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,270
to be connected to the internet at all.

35
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:08,340
It's within my own computer, and I use it to easily spin up WordPress sites for testing things.

36
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,460
And so if you install local WP on your computer, you'll come up with this will be empty for you, but

37
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,480
you can just hit the plus button just to add a new site.

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,240
And I'll just show you how to create a new site and then navigate around local just a little bit.

39
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:31,890
If you want to use a local development environment in your practice for WordPress, and so let's see,

40
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,330
let's just call this.

41
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,060
Let's just call this a leverage WP site one.

42
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:51,090
And I have a preferred setup, or you can use a custom setup as far as a perversion type of web server

43
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,290
and type of database.

44
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:59,760
You can set this up to match your future live hosting if you are going to migrate your site up to any

45
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,660
hosting from here.

46
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,820
But I'll just leave it at my preferred.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,530
You can leave it at the defaults, most likely when you install local on your own computer.

48
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,050
And then, you know, I'll just use a.

49
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:19,610
Username and password that I can remember, and this is important with local local uses, a kind of

50
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,510
a just a kind of a dummy email address.

51
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:29,990
And this enables you to be able to use the email systems that WordPress sometimes uses for outgoing

52
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,810
email so you can use a forgotten password.

53
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:40,460
You can test a contact form, notifications and things like that locally by using the local email catcher,

54
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,740
or which will enable you to check emails kind of within your local system using your browser.

55
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,230
And so it's best practice not to change this email to something different, but to leave it here.

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,900
And then I usually just leave this alone.

57
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,480
Unless you're installing multi-site, just leave that at no for advanced options.

58
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,480
Then you just click Add site and it goes through and it provisions the different things that it needs

59
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,750
to in the background to set up your site.

60
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,710
And here's where.

61
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,960
If you encounter any errors, I could say you say allow access.

62
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,750
If anything that your computer says, Hey, you know someone's trying to access your operating system

63
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,390
because it's installing a server on your local computer, you want to allow any access that it asks

64
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,690
for.

65
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,240
If you have any errors and anything happens, you can go to the community here and use this little search

66
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,090
to search for, you know, either part of the error message or anything that you need to.

67
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,480
And I'll often find solutions to how to make that work and get around any of the issues here in the

68
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,440
local WP community.

69
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,550
That's at Community Dot and local WP dot com and its link above from the local WP dot com website,

70
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,850
too.

71
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,460
And so here I'm on the local website and then opening the local program.

72
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,150
It's already finished, so I have the site title right up here and right here under the site title.

73
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,760
It gives you an indication of where on your computer the files are all saved.

74
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,460
And so in working with WordPress, we are going to kind of take apart a WordPress site and put it back

75
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:16,910
together.

76
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,870
Look at the database and the files and how they talk to each other.

77
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,240
If you're using local to experiment with that, here's where you would find the WordPress files.

78
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:35,150
And so this little tilde means the this means the user or the default hard drive of your computer,

79
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,940
but it makes it easy for you with this little arrow.

80
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:45,230
This little button will open up a file explorer window, and it will just show you exactly on your computer

81
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,080
where the files are located for this website.

82
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:55,880
And so for me on my C drive, my Windows C drive on this computer, I have a user named Greg Davis.

83
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,380
And then there is a under that user.

84
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,260
There's a folder called local sites.

85
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,480
So local sites with a capital L Capital S.

86
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,500
That is a local folder that gets created by this program.

87
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,850
And so within there you have folders with the names of all of the sites that you've created inside local,

88
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,410
and that's where you can find all those.

89
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:27,080
And so this one was called Leverage WP Site one, and then that's where we were before and linked,

90
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,480
you know, from this little button over here in the control panel right there.

91
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,800
So if I go back there, there are three folders within this leverage WP site one folder, which is the

92
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:47,840
site folder for local and that where the WordPress files are located, are in app and then in the public

93
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,440
folder.

94
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,050
Now let's look at the database, too.

95
00:07:51,230 --> 00:08:00,710
If the next tab over here is database and so similar to like we saw in site ground, the PHP, my admin

96
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,380
utility is there in flywheel.

97
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:09,170
We saw that they had a browser based database editor that you could use from the Flywheel Control Panel

98
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,340
here in local.

99
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,870
There's a tool called admin here, and if I open, add Minner that will open a tab in my browser and

100
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,700
it will show the database for this site and give me a place where I can access it.

101
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:31,160
So again, if we go into WP users and this is showing the structure of that table and if we select data

102
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,130
here now, you can see that I have a user and this is the user email and you do want to keep it at that

103
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:44,560
flywheel dot local email and then the user login, etc. Just like before you could hit edit.

104
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:50,630
And I showed you where if you use the password changer, you want to change a password to something

105
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,680
you can remember.

106
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,050
Now remember, this is an MD5 hashed password password, so that's not my actual password.

107
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,540
It's a it's an encrypted version of it.

108
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:05,810
But if you do change it here in the database, you would select MD5 and then that would be your actual

109
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,880
password that you could type in later.

110
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,650
And so I'm just going to go back and go to my SQL.

111
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:19,200
There's, you know, you could you could go ahead and you navigate away and now have gone so far back

112
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,790
that I don't know if I could get back.

113
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,280
There we go.

114
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,620
I'm at the root of this database and these are all the database tables.

115
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,720
And so back to local.

116
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,760
Let's see.

117
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,880
I just go and open the the local utility right here.

118
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,520
This is just the local control panel and now under tools you could see.

119
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,750
Here's where you have two tools male hug and live links.

120
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:54,540
And so if this is what I was talking about with the email address, if you open mail hog now, that

121
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:03,150
will open a little tab in your browser that allows you to receive email that was sent from the WordPress

122
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,630
website.

123
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,570
And so this enables an email testing area.

124
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:14,790
And so this is an email that was sent to this email once that WordPress site was was created.

125
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,850
And so this is just a standard WordPress email that tells you your username and that gives you a message

126
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,390
about your password and it gives you a link to the login page.

127
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:31,470
But let's go back to local again, and if you did create an account with local, then you can enable

128
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,430
something called live links, which is a very interesting functionality.

129
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:41,220
If you are designing and developing a website locally and you want your client or someone else to be

130
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,600
able to view that site externally from some other computer elsewhere.

131
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,690
You can actually connect to your local site temporarily to the internet if you enable the live link.

132
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:58,050
It will give you a URL that you could then email or send to someone, and they would be able to access

133
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,640
your actual computer and view that website as if it were live on the internet.

134
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,250
It's an interesting and really powerful way of working if you like to work locally.

135
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,000
And so then finally, you know, the the overview page is where I usually remain and where it opens

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,540
up the site.

137
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,470
Over here, the two main buttons that you might use open your site and the admin button.

138
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,380
Now First VI open site, that'll open up basically a new installation of WordPress.

139
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,900
And when that opens up the site, you can see the address that it's trying to open.

140
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,440
Leverage WP Site one dot local.

141
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
And this is the way it works in local.

142
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,820
It creates a new domain extension called local within your home computer, and that uses what's something

143
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:54,540
called the hosts file on your computer, and it modifies that file to fool your browser into thinking

144
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,640
that Dot Local is a real place.

145
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,580
And it actually enables it to think, Oh, this is a website on the internet, where in reality it's

146
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:09,270
just browsing your own computer to the local setup, where you're using a server like a hosting company

147
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,170
on your own computer.

148
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,920
And so here's a standard 20 22 theme website.

149
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:22,110
If I go back into local, if I hit admin now, that would bring me to the login page where I could remember

150
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,420
my username and my password, and then I could log in to the WordPress dashboard.

151
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:34,230
But there's another convenient thing inside of local you can use, which is one click admin.

152
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:43,110
So if you if you turn on one click admin, once you do that, then you can select the administrator

153
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,380
that it will use when it does one click admin.

154
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,050
That means that when you click the admin button here, instead of having to put in your username and

155
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:58,320
password every time for each of your sites, you can set up each of them to use this one click admin.

156
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,760
And then it enables you to log in to the WordPress website, you know, without having to type in your

157
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,620
username and your password.

158
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,350
Really, really convenient for practicing and getting started with WordPress and playing with it.

159
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:21,300
And it's great for learning WordPress, even when you don't have to have a hosting account or even have

160
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,670
a site that's live on the internet at all.

161
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:32,440
And so one last time, back to the local control panel, this right here is I mentioned you can connect

162
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,870
to your local site to your flywheel hosting area.

163
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:44,010
And if you are a flywheel customer, then that enables local to be able to connect your local environment

164
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,360
as if it were a staging environment at Flywheel.

165
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,810
And so that's an interesting way to work.

166
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,610
I've not done it very much myself, but I've tested it.

167
00:13:53,610 --> 00:14:00,030
It works quite well for working locally and then uploading the site and migrating it up to your flywheel

168
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,870
account easily.

169
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,080
Now there's a few other functionalities over here.

170
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,360
There's a Settings panel right here.

171
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,100
You know the the preferences.

172
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,600
This might be where for new site defaults, you can.

173
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,960
To have that admin email, whether it's a custom environment or you use the preferred environment every

174
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,360
time for exporting.

175
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:29,970
If you you know what kind of a zip file are allowed, you can export a site from here into the database

176
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:37,140
and then the file structure, and then you can use that to migrate this site anywhere, any live host

177
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,120
another local environment.

178
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,400
So you don't have to just use this to migrate your site to flywheel hosting.

179
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,760
You could migrate a site that you developed locally into site ground or into your grid pain environment

180
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,110
at one of your servers.

181
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:58,590
So then there's some advanced if you're your website, if your local environment's not working and giving

182
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:05,190
you some errors with the hosts file or with the domain, you can choose to use local host instead of

183
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:13,560
site domains, and that will just maybe make it work instead of using that that dot local custom domain.

184
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,400
And there's some other other settings here blueprints.

185
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:25,800
Just like in fly, we'll let you in install certain themes or plugins that you can use as blueprints

186
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:31,080
to make a say, you know, have all of your, you know, plugins and themes preinstalled when you set

187
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,350
it up.

188
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,140
And so that's a good overview of local.

189
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,770
Don't forget, you use the Plus button down here to set up a new site and then you can go through and

190
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,010
you can turn on or off the different sites.

191
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,340
Now they do have to be on and running for you to use them, and then you can stop the site server in

192
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:55,440
order to shut it down and then close local for the day or whatever you need to do.

193
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,460
You can multi you can use multiple sites and have them on all at the same time.

194
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,800
But you don't have to.

195
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,600
If you are working with multiple sites in your day and you're ready to shut down, you can stop them

196
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,800
all at the same time with this button down here on the left hand side.

197
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:17,010
You can close this little panel if you want to go in here and, you know, use some of the other controls

198
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,090
and kind of get that out of your way for whatever site you're working with.

199
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,610
That's a good overview of a local environment.

200
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,730
There are some others I might recommend.

201
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,700
You know, local, I think, is above and beyond the best.

202
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,050
There's one called desktop server that you could try.

203
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:40,200
There's some others that don't have WordPress installers that are kind of the old fashioned sort of

204
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:47,130
old school local development environments that use the MP initials for them.

205
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,780
So there's WIMP with a W.

206
00:16:49,410 --> 00:17:00,140
There is a map within MMP, one that I've used quite often on Mac and on Windows and XAMPP with an X

207
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,540
X, a MP or X MP.

208
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,270
They all stand for like Apache, My School, PHP and Perl.

209
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,370
The computing languages and software that's necessary to run a website server.

210
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,740
And so that's why those are called by those weird names.

211
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:23,940
There's one more I'd recommend for windows called Larian, and that one does give you a WordPress installer

212
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,610
similar to local here.

213
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,750
But I don't think it's as powerful or as easy to use as local.

214
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,890
But those are some options.

215
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:38,430
If you do want to work locally and you don't have the ability to use local for some reason, you're

216
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,410
operating system is giving you a limitation.

217
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,860
You can try one of those others, and on the resources page, you'll find links to all those inside

218
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,700
of the course here.
