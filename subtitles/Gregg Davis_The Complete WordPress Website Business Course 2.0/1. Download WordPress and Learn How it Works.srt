1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,660
In this lesson, we'll download the WordPress core files from WordPress.org and then explore the configuration

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,880
file that connects the files to the database.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,650
You'll follow along as I diagram how WordPress works with the request from the user.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,520
The database query and the web page being delivered to the browser.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,160
By the end of this video, you'll understand how WordPress requires both files and a database hosted

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,720
physically at a hosting server.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,410
Let's learn how WordPress works if we go to WordPress dot org, the self-hosted open source version

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,760
of the WordPress software.

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,970
The initial page you open up is just about WordPress and different sites that use it.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,480
But if you click Get WordPress, it'll bring you to few descriptions and it immediately talks about

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,170
hosting.

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:52,860
Because as you'll learn in this video and this lesson, you can't just take WordPress the software and

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,170
open it up on your computer and build websites.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,660
The software is designed to be hosted.

15
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,860
It needs to have a place to hold files and a connection to a database, and that's the beauty of WordPress.

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:12,690
It uses a web server software to be able to combine and create web pages on the fly, which allows it

17
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,220
to be a C, M.S. or a content management system.

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,970
But first off, let's just take a look at what WordPress is.

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,660
It actually is just a bunch of files, including some JavaScript and some other things.

20
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:35,340
So I have just clicked the download button to download the latest version of WordPress, and it's downloading

21
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,060
here on my Into My Downloads folder.

22
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,260
You could see at the bottom of the screen here just takes a couple of seconds and it downloads as a

23
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,550
dot zip file.

24
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:51,870
And so if you'd like to follow along, this is a great exercise in learning behind the scenes how WordPress

25
00:01:51,870 --> 00:02:00,090
works, and it'll help you to understand the WordPress system, the environment that it needs the hosting,

26
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,550
as well as being able to troubleshoot WordPress much better, knowing how it all works.

27
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,200
So let's get into it.

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:14,730
I'll just close this back down and just leave this page open in my browser and open up my file explorer.

29
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:22,290
I usually like to open up to windows, and if you're using a Mac, you can use the Finder to store the

30
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,740
WordPress version zip file over in a folder on your computer where you know where it is, and then you

31
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,890
can double click the zip file on a Mac, or you can right click and choose Extract, all like I've done

32
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,300
here to open up the file.

33
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,840
So if I double click that there's usually a folder called WordPress inside of that unzipped file.

34
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,870
And then if you double click that these are all the files that make up the WordPress software.

35
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,770
This is all it is.

36
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,310
It's a whole bunch of files and three folders with some other folders and files in there.

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,650
And really, there's only two things that really get changed when you're working with WordPress.

38
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,220
One is the contents of the WP content folder.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,090
That's where your themes and plugins and also your media in the media library gets stored in an folder

40
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,730
called uploads that gets created inside this WP content folder.

41
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:24,990
And if we go back this file right here, the WP Dash Config Dash Sample file is the one that you can

42
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:30,270
change and remove this word sample if you're installing WordPress manually, which is something we'll

43
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:36,480
do later in this section, but just now, follow along and open this up for yourself and just take a

44
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,590
look at these files.

45
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,070
You don't have to open this up in a code editor.

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,250
You can open it up in a text editor like notepad or text.

47
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,910
Add it on the Mac, but I'm going to go ahead and open up this file in my code editor called Adam.

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:58,500
I've got that open in the Adam program, which gives me a little bit of color to tell me a little bit

49
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,090
more about the code that's in here.

50
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,700
But this WP configuration file in WordPress is the one place that connects the WordPress files to the

51
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,480
database.

52
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:17,040
And so you've got four credentials that are needed a database name, a database user, a password for

53
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,180
that database user and a database host.

54
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,570
In many cases, the host is called local host, but depending on your hosting, it may be something

55
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,140
different.

56
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,640
And then this username and password is not the same as the username and password that you get created

57
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,670
for your WordPress user credentials themselves.

58
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,660
Now, you usually don't have to go in here and edit any of this stuff unless you're installing WordPress

59
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,320
manually.

60
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:53,220
But we're just in here to inspect how WordPress works and how the files get connected to the database.

61
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:01,020
Now the beauty of WordPress is that the files themselves are saved in this on the server and the content

62
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,570
of the website, including all the text and all the references to the images and the navigation and

63
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,010
everything.

64
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,890
The whole series of content that makes up the WordPress website is saved in the database.

65
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,840
And that's what enables it to be a content management system or a CMS.

66
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:26,910
So if we scroll down a little bit further in the config file, there's a security series of keys called

67
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,240
Salt's that usually get created by your hosting company.

68
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,870
And here's where the table prefix is defined.

69
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,050
So standardised by WP underscore.

70
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:44,520
But as you've seen when we talked about grid pain and other hosting providers, they'll often change

71
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,550
the table prefix prefix for for security.

72
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,940
And so there's other places in here where you can place some different codes in order to enable different

73
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,590
functionality for WordPress.

74
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,880
For example, if you're enabling multi-site, this is where that would be defined.

75
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:07,410
If you're trying to debug something, you can turn this to true and turn on a debug function and hosting

76
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,240
a good pin does that automatically.

77
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:17,520
But this is just the only file inside the WordPress file structure that really gets changed by the user,

78
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:24,090
and that you would want to go in and edit any of these other PHP files are not something that you should

79
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:24,870
edit at all.

80
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,430
In fact, if you did, they would be overwritten when you updated WordPress.

81
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,940
And so the only thing that you would change again is the WP config file in some cases, and then the

82
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,130
WP content folder gets changed and added to as you build a WordPress website.

83
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:48,300
Now, with all that said, let's just take a look at a diagram about how WordPress works.

84
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,950
And this will make a little bit more sense to you before we go into the other lessons in this section

85
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,850
where we're going to take apart and put together WordPress and inspect how all this works in real time

86
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,170
with real websites.

87
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:10,590
So as we look at my diagram here about how WordPress works, this is really how many websites softwares

88
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,100
work.

89
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:18,090
But the this little diagram just outlines how it works and how WordPress fits in to the server space

90
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,610
and how it delivers web pages to the user.

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,010
So over here, we've got the user's browser.

92
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:29,520
Now, of course, what can happen is you either go to a search window and click through to a URL or

93
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,060
you type a URL into the address bar of the browser.

94
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,790
And that is a domain you URL.

95
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:42,750
Now that domain URL gets translated automatically into an IP address, and that's what the DNS and the

96
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,550
domain name system is for.

97
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,850
And so this is the domain and URL and IP address.

98
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:53,960
It goes out to the internet, and the IP address system knows where to point it.

99
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,800
It points it to the appropriate server.

100
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,430
And so in real time, what happens is the user's browser goes out and it says, I want this domain URL

101
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,360
and it goes to the appropriate IP address, which finds the server.

102
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,630
And now living in the at the server is the WordPress web site made up of a few different parts.

103
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,940
And so the files are here.

104
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,690
The files that we just looked at are hosted at the server physically on a computer attached to the internet

105
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,760
called a server, and they are comprised of PHP and JavaScript files.

106
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,020
And so those are the files now alongside the files.

107
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,390
Now, the files wouldn't do anything by themselves.

108
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,920
They need the database.

109
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,980
And so those files, like I mentioned, are connected to the database through that WP config file.

110
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,980
And so the database is also hosted at the server.

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,040
And so that what happens is the URL tells the browser, OK, go to that server and get this particular

112
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,520
page.

113
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:00,210
And so in the database, that particular page URLs associated with certain content also hosted at the

114
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:05,820
database, it might go over to the files and say, I want these images from the media library, etc.

115
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:12,810
And then in real time, those two things get combined and delivered as a web page.

116
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:21,780
And then that web page in the form of HTML and CSS, which the browser can read, is sent back to the

117
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:29,580
user, and it's delivered as a web page that's visible to the user as an HTML slash web page.

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,610
And so that's the whole system, that system, that circular, you know, travel of data happens within

119
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,150
seconds.

120
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:46,580
You know, it's you want to have your sites open from anywhere in the world at less than two seconds

121
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,730
would be ideal, you know, so this is happening very, very fast.

122
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:57,020
But it's good to know that there's two different things that are happening and getting combined into

123
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,440
one.

124
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:04,970
Turning from PHP and JavaScript and also my sequel, which is the language that we use in WordPress

125
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,320
when we're working with the database.

126
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:14,420
And those two things get combined in real time into a different kind of document and HTML and CSS document,

127
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,020
which is what's designed to be read by the user's browser.

128
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,010
And that's how you get a web page open in your browser.
