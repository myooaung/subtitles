00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.610
In this lesson, we'll begin editing one of the template pages to get to know the cadence controls and

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.990
focus on the header, too.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.480
You'll learn how to edit the global header to improve the design so it works well on all pages of the

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.460
site by the end of this video.

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.890
You'll know how the Cadence Block editor adds a huge number of options to each block it controls on

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.650
a page and how the powerful header editing system is really full, say editing at its best.

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.450
Let's start customizing.

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.650
Here we are in the real estate starter template using the cadence theme, and the first thing that I

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.720
want you guys to do is follow along.

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.600
As we're customizing this so that you can experience it for yourself and learn where some of the controls

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.470
are for customizing cadence themes within WordPress.

12
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.320
First, let's go to this for 18 Norman Street, and I've noticed this happen with my own websites and

13
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.560
with this cadence theme in particular that there is supposed to be a featured image.

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.420
And in fact, it's a it's a three slide slider at the top of the page here.

15
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.850
And if we go into pages for 18 Norman Street, you might notice if this happens to you that there's

16
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.240
a block which contains unexpected or invalid content.

17
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.140
You can just attempt block recovery and then update the page that usually returns the block to its working

18
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.630
state.

19
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.910
And you can see that even within the Block editor here, this slideshow is working, and as it goes

20
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.930
from one to the next, let's just take a look at how that looks on the front end or on the real website

21
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.440
right here.

22
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.340
And one of the things you may notice is that the transparent background on the menu isn't working as

23
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.780
well as it could, especially on that first slide, which has a light colored image and the image is

24
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.890
very light at the very top.

25
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.350
So on that first slide, especially these white menu items and the logo are not as visible as they need

26
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.830
to be.

27
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.320
And so, you know, you might think, well, one thing we could do is just we could darken those images

28
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.650
just a little bit, and let's start there, just going back to the post itself.

29
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.880
Now remember that we have over here the list of you can show us kind of where we are and what we're

30
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.270
looking at with these blue surrounding borders around the different sections of the page that we're

31
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.690
editing.

32
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.090
And so this row layout itself is where this little slider lives.

33
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.680
And if we look at background settings, you can see that the center one background slider is the one

34
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.490
that's selected.

35
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.280
Now, of course, you can have a single image, a background slider or a video in there.

36
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.810
And now it's important that when we work with video that you don't have something that takes too long

37
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.930
to load, of course, and we can talk about that a little bit later.

38
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.680
But with this slider, I want to see if I can maybe darken up this image now instead of taking this

39
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.700
image out into Photoshop or Canva.

40
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.300
And, you know, darkening it and then re uploading it to the website.

41
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.530
One of the things that's available to us right here is a background overlay.

42
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:27.650
Now I can look at at normal under background overlay for this this row layout.

43
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.380
So it's basically this whole row side to side on the website.

44
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.190
The whole thing down to the bottom of the image is what we're editing right here.

45
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.520
And you can just click overlay color right now.

46
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.910
You can see by the gray and white check that it's just transparent.

47
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.870
But if you choose drag around until maybe to the bottom left color until I'm using that black color

48
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.820
and click away from it, you can see that the opacity is at 30 30 out of 100 100 would be all the way

49
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.360
black.

50
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:06.390
Zero is completely transparent, so I found that maybe for those menu items, something like 30 is quite

51
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.070
a good amount.

52
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.710
And now, if we wanted to do that just for this page, I just clicked.

53
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.630
Update, if we go back and refresh the page now you can see, Oh, that's that same very, very bright

54
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.940
image, and these are much more visible.

55
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.290
However, the rest of the photos are also quite dark, right?

56
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.280
So there's a different solution that I might offer up.

57
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.490
And you know, this is kind of a single page solution where, you know, you'd have to do a background

58
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:43.470
overlay on every page that was, you know, designed to be for one property in this website designed

59
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.470
for for real estate agent or real estate brokerage.

60
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.210
And so instead of doing this background overlay on the image, let's think about editing that header

61
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.870
a little bit.

62
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.670
So maybe instead of a completely transparent header, maybe we can put a.

63
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:06.890
Background overlay or just a slightly less transparent background on the header?

64
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.430
I think that's a good idea.

65
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.380
So let's just go ahead and change the overlay color here back and you can just hit this clear.

66
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.950
It's clear the customization settings that you've put on this setting, wherever you see that kind of

67
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.110
rounded, sort of recycle arrow, that's a go back arrow.

68
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.880
So it'll say, well, if you've made some changes, it gives you that option to go back to what it was

69
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.480
before.

70
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.360
And so everything's the same now that I hit the back arrow and I'll click Update.

71
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:47.600
So let's continue with this lesson and look at where we might be able to just go ahead and change the

72
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.610
header a little bit instead of just changing that post itself.

73
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.400
If we change the header, then it won't matter in the future, whether we have a very, very bright

74
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.550
image that covers or if we have a slightly darker image, it will work in either case.

75
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.950
So if we go back to the dashboard, let's exit out of this page by using the W WordPress logo at the

76
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.610
top left.

77
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.940
We're back to the page's editing screen, but now let's explore the customizer a little bit under appearance.

78
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:27.770
Customize is where you do a lot of your design work when you're using the cadence theme, and so it

79
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:35.360
shows you like like as in the page starter templates shows you an example of what the website looks

80
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.270
like while you're working on it here and before you have clicked the publish button, which is here

81
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.440
up at the top left.

82
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:49.910
Another thing that the customizer does for you is that when you're rolling over some content that's

83
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.680
editable from this screen, for example, in the header here you can see these little blue pencil icons.

84
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:03.080
These edit icons coming up whenever you see one of those pop up might actually work down here in the

85
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.310
footer as well.

86
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.790
When you do that, it will open up on the left side right where you need to go ahead and edit that content.

87
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:18.170
Now, of course, because this home page is editable, not here in the customizer, but as a page in

88
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.360
the dashboard of the website dashboard.

89
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.870
You know it doesn't show any of those blue edit buttons.

90
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:32.300
And so so we could go to header right here and that slides the header section open.

91
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.790
But we could have also gone up here and click here to get a header.

92
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:44.450
And now it actually went one level deeper where we're customizing the header, but we're customizing

93
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.820
the main row within the header.

94
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.760
And that's something to note in cadence when we're editing a header in the footer works this way too.

95
00:07:53.030 --> 00:08:00.440
There are actually three different rows that are available to place content in when you're doing a header

96
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.680
or customizing or creating a header in the cadence theme.

97
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:12.770
And so this is where it's not technically WordPress full site editing in the real sense of the word

98
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.580
as far as WordPress defaults and the WordPress core software.

99
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:23.720
But really, cadence has added this functionality in the customizer so that really we're able to do

100
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.040
full site editing.

101
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:31.080
We don't have to use any code to change what the website header looks like.

102
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.760
And you can use these different places, as you know, containers for different content in the form

103
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.670
of blocks and different things you can put in the website through the cadence, theme and cadence blocks.

104
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.700
And so it's a super powerful kind of cadence version of full site editing.

105
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:56.660
And these days, because developers have been working on cadence for years and it really has some powerful

106
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.580
functionality at this point.

107
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.530
More powerful than the word press corps site at full site editing system.

108
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:04.970
And so let's continue.

109
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:11.970
You can always hit this back arrow to get back to one level up in terms of where you were editing.

110
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:19.520
So if I go one level up from header, you can see that I'm back to where I was and the header editor

111
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.100
down at the bottom of my screen has gone away.

112
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:30.440
And so one thing I mentioned, what we'll do in this last part of this particular lesson is just put

113
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:38.210
kind of a background transparency that's not perfectly transparent but has a little bit of color so

114
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:44.330
that no matter what image we have behind this, white lettering will show up nice, nice and bright

115
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:52.070
as the menu and logo and even the social icons over here inside every page of the website.

116
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.990
So I'll click header.

117
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:59.210
So here under a transparent header, I can leave enable transparent head.

118
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.560
Her.

119
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:08.240
Selected and under design, I can go back to you, Transparent had her background and begin to bring

120
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:08.890
that in.

121
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.540
You can see there it's it turned black.

122
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:19.460
And as I bring that transparency down to a point three, now you can see it's hard to see in this dark

123
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:25.640
background, but you can see that it's got that, you know, point three transparency.

124
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.420
And so we're that's where it's located under transparent head header under design.

125
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.630
And then the Transparent had her background color.

126
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:40.490
So if I click publish right here in the customizer, if I go back over to our 18 Norman Street post,

127
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.890
I can refresh the page.

128
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:50.000
And now you can see, even in that first slide, that transparent header has a little bit of dark to

129
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.680
it, but it still shows the image through makes that text really readable.

130
00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:01.880
Another thing I'm noticing here is we've got this, you know, strange you URL that I didn't change

131
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.030
yet.

132
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:07.820
And that's one of the things that I'll often do is one of the first things that I change when I'm installing

133
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.200
a new WordPress site.

134
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:14.060
So let's just quickly go back and change that, and then we'll continue customizing this header.

135
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.870
So we'll go back and hit the X to get out of the customizer.

136
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:23.450
And if you go to settings and perma links, those are the permanent links.

137
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:31.790
It just came in as plain, but one of the best the really the best permalink structure for SEO and for

138
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.630
being found and also for user interface.

139
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.140
Ease of use for the user is to use post name.

140
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.640
So that really just makes it so that save changes there.

141
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.500
That makes it so that, you know, if we go to this site, will it change?

142
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.600
And now it actually uses the title of the post in the actual URL.

143
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.410
So that's better for Google and it's better for the user as well.

144
00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.880
So changing that permalink.

145
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:06.770
Next, let's go ahead and continue to customize that header to make it look a little bit better, and

146
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.370
we'll go to the next settings that we'll learn in cadence.
