00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.300
In this lesson, we'll customize the navigation using both the customizer and the menu areas in WordPress.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.510
You'll also learn more design tools in cadence like image focus points and improving the design with

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.060
overlapping elements using negative margin.

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.790
By the end of this video, you'll understand more cadence block editing tools for precise design across

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.930
all screen sizes.

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.320
Let's make one more edit to this header the menu in particular, and then we'll go do some customization

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.470
of the home page itself and some other pages that were brought in as a part of our starter template

8
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.670
and continue to learn how to use the cadence, theme and cadence blocks.

9
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.900
So let's go back to the site.

10
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.840
Customize their appearance.

11
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.770
Customize.

12
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.790
And now, as we're looking in here, we can look under menus and we've got the main real estate menu

13
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.680
here now right now.

14
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.000
This menu, you can tell, is not the menu being used here.

15
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.360
This is actually just the default menu.

16
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.490
What happens in WordPress by default?

17
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.200
If you don't have a menu, define a particular menu that you've created with particular pages in the

18
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.730
Settings Menus area or in the customizer under menus.

19
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.710
Then it's just going to pull every page into the menu itself.

20
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.630
So what we want is for this main real estate menu to be in the primary menu location, so all I have

21
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.460
to do is click primary right there.

22
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.670
And now we've got the menu up here that's looking a lot better.

23
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.840
It gives us a home link.

24
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.760
The one thing that's missing, there's a couple of items missing the brokerage menu item, as well as

25
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.200
the 4:18 Norman Street.

26
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:57.140
We've been working on and so I've added those items to the menu itself.

27
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.400
OK.

28
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.680
And so I can just click publish.

29
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.030
And now one thing I want to do is maybe just move them around a little bit.

30
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.360
So just like in the appearance menus area, you can drag these in the customizer.

31
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.120
So I'll just drag maybe brokerage.

32
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.040
I'll drag next to home right over here.

33
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.700
And then let's put it the drop down.

34
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.970
If maybe under the brokerage, we'll put the properties for sale.

35
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.150
And so you look at the dotted line here, if you just pull it to the inside inset just a little bit

36
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.910
that defines that item as a dropdown item could see in the theme that we have a little down arrow and

37
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.300
that comes through as a dropdown item and clickable through to the page itself.

38
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.640
So you could see what that looks like, and yes, that's looking a lot better.

39
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.880
So a click publish and just very quickly.

40
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.440
Just, you know, a non full site editing theme, if you go under appearance menus, the area works

41
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.670
just about the same.

42
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.470
You know, you've got these menu locations if you have a menu selected right here.

43
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.200
Now we do only have one menu available.

44
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.170
So if we created a new menu, maybe a different one to put on the footer, we would just go up here

45
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.900
and say, create a new menu using this button.

46
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.510
And then here, like I said, you can drag these around, have it be indented as a dropdown item, etc.

47
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.190
When you want to pull items in, you could click View all to see all the pages, but you can also put

48
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.840
posts, you can put custom links and you can put category links into a WordPress menu.

49
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.380
And so that's a convenient way.

50
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.540
I usually use this appearance menus area to really edit and create my menus versus the customizer.

51
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.780
I don't think there's a lot of room in there, as you might have noticed.

52
00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.550
And so let's go through and look at the homepage now I go to pages all pages.

53
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.530
I didn't actually need to save my changes there in the menu.

54
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:16.580
Let me close this tab right here, and let's go refresh the page here in our web site and we'll see

55
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.870
what that menu looks like.

56
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.500
There we go.

57
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.420
Looking good.

58
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.640
OK, so we're on the home page.

59
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.390
Let's go to Page's home, and let's take a look at what we have here.

60
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.640
I just wanted to show you one other feature on this website is on the home page.

61
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:43.250
We have this sort of inset image right here in front of the background image that makes up the main

62
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.110
hero image of the home page.

63
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.580
Now, how was that accomplished?

64
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.000
Quite interesting the way this was created.

65
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.380
So let's look at the list view.

66
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.780
And of course, I have the settings closed from before, so I'll open up with the gear icon.

67
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.500
Take a look at the settings when we're inspecting the blocks over here.

68
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.810
And so let's see.

69
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.170
Let's look at the different sections that we have.

70
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.310
What do we have here?

71
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:15.680
So there's a row layout that's this very top a section which is within that row layout that contains

72
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.090
the heading and text and the button over here on the left hand side.

73
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.850
Right.

74
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.010
And then another section, which is the right hand side.

75
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.760
And so I can assume that this row layout is a two column layout, right?

76
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.190
Here's a two column layout.

77
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:39.680
Now that's how this text was forced over to the left side to reveal the background image here and really

78
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.600
make it a nice looking homepage.

79
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.850
So, you know, that's that's one thing.

80
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:44.960
There's the image.

81
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.570
One of the things you should know about cadence is that no matter how the image, you know, sometimes

82
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.730
the image will be cropped at different things.

83
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:59.240
But you can define a focal point if the image is on a really small screen that might be cropped differently,

84
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.000
but you can define by dragging this point.

85
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:10.520
You can define what part of the image do you want to always be the focal point of that image?

86
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:17.330
And so that's a really interesting way to really customize your your images and how they're displayed

87
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.020
on the website, even when your website is fully mobile responsive.

88
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.380
And so in addition to that, I can see that there's another row layout b r b below this whole section.

89
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.650
And so this is a row layout and within that roll out again, it's a two column rollout.

90
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.860
Here's where the width of it 50 50 is defined, and you can change that by dragging this back and forth

91
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.960
or by choosing a layout here.

92
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.360
And also, you can choose the gutter width.

93
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.520
So that's like how much space is around it between the content.

94
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.690
But here we have an advance heading in some paragraph text.

95
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.360
Then the second section over here contains this photo, and this is what I wanted to show you.

96
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:03.120
So there's an advanced gallery here, and this is a gallery with one image.

97
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.510
And in that way, you can say, OK, there was one column in the gallery.

98
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.940
There's just this one image and you can control the gutter width, which is how you know how much breathing

99
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.470
space this image has.

100
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.760
But how did they make it come and come up above and overlap?

101
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.110
The image here, which really leads to the nice look and feel of this website?

102
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.250
Well, that's determined.

103
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.370
I believe in the section settings.

104
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.900
In the section settings, we have some container styles.

105
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:39.420
First of all, nothing really important in there, but let's look at a line settings.

106
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.490
There's a it's aligned vertically for the block direction.

107
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.660
And as we look at padding and margin, here's where I suspected this was going on.

108
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:57.380
There is a negative margin number under the top margin, and so you can imagine if if an item has negative

109
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.680
margin, you could see here's the section in the blue.

110
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.420
But this item, there's padding and margin is defined with negative 100.

111
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:11.630
So if I change that to, you know, negative 80, that moves it down 80, you know, 20 pixels down

112
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.790
to where it's OK, it's pulled negative 80.

113
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:19.310
If I had zero as the margin, it would just be, you know, right at the top of the container, right

114
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.320
touching the top of the container right there.

115
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:29.900
And so that is a really interesting way to do some really cool, you know, image styling.

116
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.850
So let's go back and select the section.

117
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.380
We'll go back to the padding and margin and the top margin.

118
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.890
I had negative 100 and bring it back there.

119
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:47.050
And so I just wanted to show you that there's a very cool effect that takes place on this website.
