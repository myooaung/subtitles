1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,240
In this lesson, we'll set up a new device sandbox site and import another layout pack to use while

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,610
we learn more advanced device techniques.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,120
You'll also download a header template file from the DV website and import it into the site to match

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,110
the layout, as well as create a new default category for blog posts.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,670
By the end of this video, you'll have an understanding of where we're going in this section of the

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,160
course and import content from a doc JSON file that you can get from the DV blog.

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:35,190
Let's look at where we are in the Diffie curriculum and where we're going in this section of the course.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:43,320
Right now in lessons, we're really going to focus on global elements and templates within the DV,

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,930
theme builder and the theme builder, especially where we're going to be looking at over here under

10
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,760
Divij theme builder.

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,150
Here's a preview of some of the setups that we're going to be working with over the next several lessons

12
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:06,060
in this divvy part two section of the course not only global header and global footer, but also looking

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,200
at customizing a special header for just certain pages, as well as a custom body that we're going to

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,930
add for just blog posts that will help clients and content managers to go in and not have to learn the

15
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,190
DeFi ecosystem, but be able to use the traditional block editor.

16
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:36,030
And so back into here in our plan, as we look at first bringing in another set of layouts from the

17
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,000
elegant themes and the DeFi builder layout packs, we're going to be doing that and then looking at

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,500
post templates and global elements in this segment, including the theme builder page templates, headers

19
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,970
and footers, and those sorts of things that we can then leverage in order to work with our theme and

20
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:03,810
our customized design on a global level and define different places and different pages and page types

21
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,920
where our premium content and the content we customize can be used.

22
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:15,000
We'll also look at blog post templates and bringing a blog post template in from a separate layout pack

23
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,360
and using it together with the layout pack that we're customizing and bringing the colors and fonts

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,030
and the typography together in order to match.

25
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,780
You may have noticed that the leverage Devi website is using a pre designed layout.

26
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,040
I don't know if you've seen it, but there's also this custom header that's a transparent header that

27
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,900
changes into a sticky or fixed header when it goes up to the top.

28
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,080
It also has a log in button over here on the right.

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,690
It's got a nice scroll button that brings you down to this next section, as well as the learn more

30
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,670
button doing that same thing.

31
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,810
And there's a sign up button that goes to the register page, as well as an interesting footer down

32
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,680
here at the bottom.

33
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:10,560
It has this nice scrolling parallax effect where there's one image in front of the background scrolls

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,820
at a different rate.

35
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:19,770
And so we're going to take a look at a few different areas here and customize your own version of this

36
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,440
leverage dark website.

37
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,490
Let's get started.

38
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,710
Go ahead and go to leverage divide.

39
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,520
Com And click Log in or sign up.

40
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,480
If you don't have your sandbox account yet, get a go ahead and click the login button right here.

41
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,310
Which brings me to that login page.

42
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,090
Log in real quick.

43
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:52,820
And that brings me to the leverage DV profile, and if you do end up there, you can always roll over

44
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,160
my sites and go to the last site that you created right here.

45
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,770
Creating a new site is easy under.

46
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:05,210
You can either click my sites here at the top left or under home right here.

47
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,780
You can also look at your account page for the sandbox itself.

48
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:17,000
Down here is a list of your sites, and there's an add new site button right here now for the URL,

49
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,620
I'm going to use my initials again and just call this one good travel.

50
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:31,280
This layout pack is called Travel Agency under the elegant themes, layout packs and just call it GHD

51
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,430
travel as a site title and click Add site.

52
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,190
Of course, that immediately adds the site to your account, and this is the my site's page right here.

53
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:47,840
You're already inside of the dashboard of that new site that you've created right away.

54
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:55,700
And so one thing you can do is just go over to appearance right away and click themes and of course,

55
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,650
activate the device theme instead of the default twenty twenty two.

56
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,230
Now we have all the device controls that we need.

57
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,580
Oftentimes, I'll just go over to settings and reading and see what I have here.

58
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,510
Of course, I don't have any pages yet to set the static page.

59
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,190
As the home page.

60
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,390
We're going to import a couple of layout packs and create a few new pages here.

61
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,850
But another thing I might do is look at the permalink and I always like to change it away from the default

62
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,790
day and name permalink structure to make the URL a little more simple and call it post name.

63
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,590
So let's go ahead and do that now that we have that taken care of.

64
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,420
Let's go in and look at pages, all pages.

65
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:47,630
And as usual, I might just trash the sample page and start to bring in a few new pages.

66
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,410
I'll show you where to find the layout pack that will be working on and customizing for the next few

67
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:00,830
lessons, and then leave you to bring in a few pages of your own, if not all eight pages of this layout

68
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,190
pack.

69
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,780
So we'll just start by typing home to bring in the home page for this layout pack.

70
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:12,580
Click Use the Divvy Builder again, as you know, and let's search for travel agency under here.

71
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,460
Start building right there and choose a pre-made layout.

72
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:25,730
Now, as it opens up the pre-made layouts from the Elegant Themes website, the travel agency is the

73
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,780
one we're talking about.

74
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:33,620
And if you click home or any of the pages in the travel agency layout pack, you'll see that there are

75
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,270
eight pages to choose from.

76
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,830
And let's bring in a few different ones the home page, the landing page.

77
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:47,390
I used the landing page as the home page for the Leverage Divvy Dotcom website.

78
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:55,700
I liked it because it had a full screen, top to bottom image at the top instead of on the home page

79
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:55,940
here.

80
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,840
Having these four images, but let's just bring it in, as is.

81
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,380
What I'd suggest you do is at least bring in the home page, and let's take a look at the landing page,

82
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,630
as well as the what was it, the travel packages, I think.

83
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:21,290
Let's bring in a couple of these pages and we'll get them set so positive video now and bring in a bunch

84
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,970
of the pages, if not all of them.

85
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,810
Go ahead.

86
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:30,920
And as they come in here and finish to 100 percent, as you remember, they'll bring in the graphics

87
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,430
and images into your media library and then you'll want to click the publish page to make sure that

88
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,130
you save the layout after you bring it in.

89
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,840
So click Publish.

90
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:48,170
And then there's one page in particular I want to make sure that you do bring in, so I'll just go over

91
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:48,890
to new.

92
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,850
After I've hit publish, I can go straight to new page, create a new page, and again, let's look

93
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:02,900
at the well, we could open the elegant Themes Layouts page just to take a look here.

94
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:14,960
As I suggested in the previous section of the course, if we if we have this open, then it's easy to

95
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,130
look at which pages that we want to name before we bring in that layout pack.

96
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,640
And so this travel packages, it's called packages.

97
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,280
The reason why I want you to bring in this page or one of the light color pages is because at the top,

98
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:38,810
this area at the top is a white or light color background, and we're going to have to edit the customized

99
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,260
menu and global header that we're bringing in in the.

100
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,270
Next, few lessons, and so make sure you bring in travel packages.

101
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,390
I'll just call it travel, actually.

102
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,210
I'll just call it packages, because that's the way it's called in the layout pack itself.

103
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,800
And as I'm doing this, I'll go ahead and pause the video like I mentioned and let you guys bring in

104
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,520
your own set of pages and see you on the other side.

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,460
OK, I hope that went well for you.

106
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:22,600
I brought in all eight pages, so I have everything in the website that I need to work with, including

107
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,120
all the media inside of the library.

108
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:31,810
Now, if you open your media library, you can see that all of the images and everything that you need

109
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:38,050
for this layout is inside, and there is one more thing we need to go pick up before we get on with

110
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:43,330
the next several lessons and one of them is the header download.

111
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:50,590
And so let's we're going to be working with a global header, in fact, if we look at, you know, the

112
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,780
leverage division website itself.

113
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:04,120
This header, of course, is much different looking than the one that is by default on your current

114
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,660
website.

115
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,990
So if you open your site in a new tab, you'll notice that it's, of course, the same default header

116
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,600
that we had before and before we even bring in that header that we're going to import and customize

117
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,350
and work with.

118
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,940
Let's go back and customize some other things about this site before we get started.

119
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:29,650
First, of course, we could go into settings reading and choose the home page or the landing page,

120
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,710
if you like as our home page.

121
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:40,150
And now when we go back and refresh the page, we'll have, of course, a nicer looking site right here.

122
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:47,530
One of the great things about this also is this awesome gallery set up where each of these images opens

123
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,210
up in a light box so that you can click and make them larger.

124
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,140
Quite nice.

125
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,820
You'll notice the difference with the overlay here from the Leverage Divi website.

126
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:08,080
I brightened up that image and made it a lot more bright and crisp, even though it's still readable

127
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,150
as far as the text goes.

128
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,990
But one of the things we're going to be changing soon is when we go to say this page here it leverages

129
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,290
TV.

130
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:26,230
I've still got this travel packages page just as the default page here inside of the website for now,

131
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:33,520
but you can see that you know these menu items that I have in here just to light to contrast.

132
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:40,360
So we're going to have a conditional header where on certain pages, it shows these letters darker and

133
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:48,130
on other pages like the home page, it shows them light as they work on a darker background like this.

134
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:55,100
And so looking at your own home page, you can see that we also have the uncategorized, you know,

135
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,190
category here up in the menu.

136
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,460
It won't matter because we're going to be importing, you know, that header layout so that we can customize

137
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:09,850
it, as well as customizing the logo image if you want to read in here.

138
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:17,890
And so next, what we'll do is go into the elegant themes dot com website again, where you might have

139
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,990
had this layout packs page open.

140
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,870
And let's scroll to the bottom and go to the blog by clicking blog or clicking recent posts.

141
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,310
And if you search for Transparent.

142
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,560
Oops!

143
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,090
Got to spell it right.

144
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:42,310
Search for transparent, there is a transparent header tutorial right here, which is this header that

145
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,020
I'm using and that matches our travel agency layout pack.

146
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:54,280
And so go ahead and click that as you scroll down and look through the post a little bit if you click

147
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,750
the download files button.

148
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:02,100
If it doesn't download right away, just go ahead and enter your email address to join the email list.

149
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,970
Elegant theme scam and then click the Download the Files button.

150
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:14,560
You can move that if you like into a folder on your on your computer or leave it in your downloads folder.

151
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:22,240
Just know where that file is so that when you open up the File Explorer or the Finder in a Mac, you

152
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,310
can go ahead and find it and then unzip the zip file.

153
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,510
Right click Extract.

154
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:34,960
All like I mentioned for Windows and double click a zip file in a Mac and that will open it up for you.

155
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:42,160
So what we have inside the folder is the JSON file, and that's what we'll be importing into the website

156
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,240
to bring in that header layout in the next few lessons.

157
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,360
OK, so I think that prepares our website.

158
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:56,020
I'm also going to be leaving the post inside here, the Hello World post, and in fact, one thing you

159
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:03,700
can do to prepare a blog post and make it a little better looking for now is to add a featured image.

160
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,740
And so I just opened it up.

161
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,630
And of course, it's not using the DV builder yet to edit this post.

162
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,880
It's actually using the classic block inside of the editor right here.

163
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,750
And so I'm just going to click set featured image.

164
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,980
Look in the media library and just click one of the images that we have here as the featured image for

165
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,320
the blog post and click Update.

166
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:36,610
Last thing you can do also is if you click the classic block, you can convert the content to blocks.

167
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:44,560
And so that really just places it as a paragraph block for the initial post that we have here, and

168
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:53,430
I'll click Update and then we'll click the WordPress logo here to go back to the posts layout.

169
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,480
And of course, under categories.

170
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,840
This is under uncategorized, which isn't very pretty.

171
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:05,560
Oftentimes, I'll go in and just to show you quickly here I'll go into categories and I'll choose a

172
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,410
new category one.

173
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:16,330
That might be just news as some generic category that you can leave as the default category for a blog

174
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,540
post that's not categorized if you have categories later inside the blog, so you can choose a name

175
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,210
like news or something generic like that and then have that news.

176
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:35,350
If you edit the news category, then you can look at, you know what the slug is, which is the URL

177
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,140
name and everything down here.

178
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:46,120
And now one last change we can create, we can make that news category, our default category under

179
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,530
Settings rating.

180
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:55,600
And you can say that the default post category instead of uncategorized is now news this post category

181
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,680
that we created.

182
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:03,580
And so now under posts, we have, you know, a nicely formatted Hello World sample post with a featured

183
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,020
image we can click either edit or quick edit.

184
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:15,250
Quick Edit is a way to bring up just some meta information about the post or your pages and change some

185
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,690
of the information easily.

186
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,810
So we'll just change that to the news category and click Update.

187
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,670
And without opening the editing window, we can change a lot of that information over here.

188
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,290
And so that looks good.

189
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,280
What about the author?

190
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:37,780
In fact, I'll go right into my under user's profile and just change my display name here by putting

191
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,980
in a first and last.

192
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:46,210
Once I change that, then this will give me the option to display my name publicly in a little more

193
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,410
friendly way.

194
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:54,010
And that makes it so that the author name then will be displayed in the better information for for the

195
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,400
reader.

196
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,760
OK, let's get on to the next stages.
