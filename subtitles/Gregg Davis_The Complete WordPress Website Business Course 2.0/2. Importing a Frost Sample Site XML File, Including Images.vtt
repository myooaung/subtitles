00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.960
In this lesson, we'll download one of the Frost sample site Dot XML files and unzip it in preparation

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.510
for importing the complete site into WordPress.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.990
You'll use the WordPress importer to upload the content, assign the content to an existing user and

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.580
make sure the images come into.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.210
By the end of this video, you'll understand how to import a complete site.

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.250
When an XML file exists for it, once you have frost enabled in your sandbox dashboard, you can go

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.030
ahead and look for and download the XML file.

8
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.880
If you haven't already, so if you go to Frost WP dot com and click sample sites right up here you'll

9
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.250
come to these three and right next to the View demo button is the download XML.

10
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.580
And if you look at the URL there, it's going to download a zip file to your downloads folder and then

11
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.700
you can take and put that on your computer somewhere.

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.110
Now I've saved that to to my frost folder here on my computer and, you know, in windows to unzip a

13
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.960
file, you would right click and then you could click Extract all on a Mac.

14
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.270
You could just double click a zip file and it'll unzip that file.

15
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.260
So then inside the folder, you'll see just a small file.

16
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.510
That's an XML file.

17
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.330
It's only seventy six kilobytes.

18
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.940
And just remember where that is.

19
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.020
So when you go back into your sandbox, you can go to tools and import.

20
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.880
Now, if you haven't already, you need to go to the plugins page first, and you need to have the WordPress

21
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.950
importer plug in activated.

22
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.970
This is something that comes with WordPress, but you have to activate it and and then you can go back

23
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.130
to tools import.

24
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.560
That's going to give you a place where you can click Run Importer right here.

25
00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:02.280
So then you'll click Choose File and you can go into your computer, go to where you've saved the XML

26
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.850
file.

27
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.200
For me, it's in my frost folder.

28
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.990
XML sample sites, small business.

29
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.840
Then you would click that and click open, and then you can click, upload, file and import.

30
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.830
When you do that, it'll bring up, you know, a little assign authors section because Brian Gardner,

31
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:31.350
the founder of Genesis and End of Frost WP, now working for WP Engine, is the author on posts and

32
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.860
pages.

33
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.010
So you could select yourself and then make sure you click import attachments that checkbox there to

34
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.390
download and import the file attachments to bring in the images and stuff.

35
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.170
And so you click submit and it'll give you a welcome message.

36
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:55.310
And then if you look in the media library, you will have, you know, several images in there.

37
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.860
It looks like it brought in the XML file and I did that.

38
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.000
So I'm just going to delete that.

39
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.550
That probably won't happen because when you do your import, it deletes the the XML file afterward.

40
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.670
So you'll probably look like this with these images.

41
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.080
And, you know, just just to have a look and see, even though these images are fairly large 10 80

42
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.570
by 10 80, only 106 kilobytes.

43
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.470
And you know, it's recommended that you keep your images as small as possible before you upload them

44
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.880
into WordPress.

45
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.800
And so let's look at the next one.

46
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.900
Remember, this was a full screen large large image 919 520 pixels wide, 249 K.

47
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.900
This is about as large as I'd like to have an image.

48
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.480
I like to keep them under 100k if I can.

49
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.550
But if I have a full screen hero image, I'd like to resize and compress those images down to below

50
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.300
300k and hopefully below 200k if possible.

51
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.110
Here's a very small logo image that's only five K.

52
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.500
It's a PNG file, and you can see by the checker in the background that it's a transparent background,

53
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.470
so it could go on many different colors and still work as a logo file and be visible on different colors.

54
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.580
Next is the final image a big large 1920 by ten eighty and it's only one hundred and sixty nine k.

55
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.720
Later in the course, we'll talk about different methods for optimizing, resizing and compressing images

56
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.420
for your WordPress website, as well as using plugins to do that automatically.

57
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:39.240
If you if you want to set up something like that, you can have a plugin in WordPress, resize and compress

58
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.730
your images as you bring him in, especially if you're going to have clients uploading images into blog

59
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.670
posts or editing the content of their pages.

60
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.090
And you want to make sure that their images don't come in in the size of multiple megabytes, which

61
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.620
can really eat up your server space.

62
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.730
But even worse, load your website a lot slower for the.

63
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.020
Visitor, so make sure you have small, compressed images, even if they are large in terms of image

64
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.560
size.

65
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.290
I'll close that modal window down and let's take a look at the pages that were created now.

66
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.070
So there's a number of pages that have been created by importing the content from the sample site XML

67
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.490
file.

68
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.420
And as you can see on my example here, one of the pages start here is labeled with a dash and then

69
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.950
it says front page.

70
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.010
Let's go and make that change right now in your site.

71
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.870
Go to settings and reading and you'll see that you probably have your latest posts selected by default

72
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.310
when you want to do is collect.

73
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.720
Select a static page and then from the dropdown, choose the Start Here page for your home page and

74
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.000
then go down and click Save Changes.

75
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:57.230
Now, if you go and roll over the site name and right click and open your site in the new tab, you're

76
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:03.500
likely to have something that looks exactly like this a nice pre-designed layout, including footer

77
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.110
and header and content within each of your pages.

78
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:16.250
However, if you roll over the menu items, if you look at the URL at the bottom left as you do that

79
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.530
or if you click through, you'll see that this does not actually point to your current website.

80
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:29.420
It points to the Frost WP sample site because by importing the XML file, it brought in the navigation

81
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:37.550
menus you URLs exactly as they were, and this is another interesting part of Frost WP in the header

82
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.070
design.

83
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:45.620
They have a highlighted menu item that you can use, which really is a great thing to have in a modern

84
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.310
website.

85
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:53.810
And so the next thing will do is go and just edit the navigation menu at the same time as we took.

86
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.510
Take a look at the site templates and the template parts that are in use in Frost.

87
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.590
Let's get to it.
