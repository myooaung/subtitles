1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,750
In this lesson, we'll check out the sample site that the designers of the 2022 theme set up as an example,

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,180
and we'll start preparing to recreate it in the sandbox or in your own WordPress site if you're working

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,600
that way.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,910
You'll make sure you have the images you need in the media library and explore the sample site to see

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,820
what it is will be creating by the end of this video.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,080
You'll have everything you need to begin customizing your site with the 2022 theme.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,280
Let's go.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:38,940
Now, if you opened up this 20 22 themed site within your sandbox here, then you'll you'll your dashboard

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:47,340
will look like this and you'll notice that you probably have some images already populated within your

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,330
media library.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,960
But if not, and if you're working on your own server and your own hosting account, you may have an

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,550
empty media library here.

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:04,230
And I've provided you in the course with a link to some media files that you can get, which are prepared

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,150
from the pre-designed site here.

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:15,450
And so what I'm going to just show you is I'll just take in my File Explorer or the Finder on a Mac.

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,530
I'm going to select these seven images and just upload them into the media library here so that I have

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,710
something to work with to build out the different pages and posts of the website that we're building

18
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,250
right here.

19
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,530
But first, let's just take a look at this theme and where we're going to find the demo site that shows

20
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,440
a built out version of the 2022 theme.

21
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,530
And so if I go to WordPress dot org, I've got it open in another tab right here.

22
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:55,050
I'm going to click themes and then if I just start typing 20, you could see that the 2022 theme is

23
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,500
here.

24
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,980
You may be aware that all the default themes that come with WordPress start with the word Twenty-Something.

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,270
So twenty twenty twenty twenty one and here's twenty twenty two.

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:13,790
And so if you just click more info, you'll open a page that describes what this theme is all about.

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,350
You can download it if you're using a local development environment or if you're using your own host.

28
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:27,210
Now, of course, you can install a theme in your own WordPress website, as you probably know by going

29
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,280
to appearance themes and then clicking Add New.

30
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,100
Now in the sandbox, I am curating the themes that we're using inside the sandbox, so there's no add

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,740
new button, but this is where you would be able to add any theme that's in the WordPress theme repository

32
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,820
over here.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,580
And so you don't have to open up WordPress.org and go ahead and download the theme unless you need to

34
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,060
do that.

35
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,980
For some reason in your local development environment or you want to take the theme and save it to your

36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,360
computer, if you really want to look at the code and customize it and check it out.

37
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:09,720
Now over here at GitHub dot com slash WordPress slash 2022, if you just go to GitHub HOCAM, you can

38
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,400
also use the search function to find the 2022 repository.

39
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:21,480
It's been archived by the owner, but here's where you can find the original code and repository where

40
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,590
they were working on updating this before it was uploaded and accepted into the WordPress theme repository.

41
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:37,320
These are the contributors and volunteers that created this 20 22 theme during Stad, and it's been

42
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:45,810
released in WordPress 5.9 and so down in the messages here in the Read Me file in GitHub, where they

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,600
house the code, it's a code repository.

44
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,570
It says that this theme has been merged into the word press corps, and so it's no longer maintained

45
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,200
on GitHub.

46
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:04,080
And so the reason I went here, though, is so that I could come down here and find the demo site while

47
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,110
they were building this site.

48
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:13,290
They created a demo and they said after the theme Stable, There will be switched to automatic updates,

49
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,060
which is which is where it is now.

50
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:21,300
But there is a demo located at this address right here, so I clicked and clicked open link in the new

51
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,280
tab and you can do the same thing.

52
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:31,620
Or you could just navigate to twenty twenty two dot WordPress Dot Net, where it will show you a built

53
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:39,090
out version of a simple website for a company that has an event page and a film page, as well as an

54
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,820
about page and a series of blog posts.

55
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,360
And so let's just take a look at this theme here and see how it's different from the original twenty

56
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:55,380
twenty two that was default out of the box and how it comes in a fresh WordPress installation.

57
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,530
And so if you look at the fresh WordPress installation, it's got the name of the site and there's a

58
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,620
menu across the top and this is the header image.

59
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,110
It comes with by default.

60
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,740
And so if I go over to the sample, the demo site could see that there's a logo here now and like a

61
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,470
like a little pair of binoculars, and it's clickable to the homepage as well as a clickable site title.

62
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:27,140
And then there's also a series of navigation menu items that go to different pages on the site.

63
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,690
And so that's the only difference there.

64
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:38,690
And you can see if I go back to oops back to say no, there's really not any content as far as imagery

65
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:44,330
in this Hello World blog post, but you could see that as I scroll down here, there's a series of blog

66
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:51,650
posts with a featured image, and the featured image is also clickable to the blog post, as well as

67
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,460
a date and some some of the content of that blog post.

68
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:05,870
And then here's a second blog post going backwards in time and then a third blog post and then we go

69
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,240
down to the footer, which definitely looks exactly the same.

70
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,220
Of course, the name of this site is different than mine over here.

71
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:13,760
Oops.

72
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:21,020
That's as Greg Davis two, is the footer on my site, and it will be whatever you called it, in the

73
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,480
sandbox or on your own personal site there.

74
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,660
And so the homepage has three blog posts.

75
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,730
The biggest difference being that there's a featured image within each of those blog posts.

76
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,090
So we'll have to create some new blog posts and add those images.

77
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:42,200
And as you remember, back here in the dashboard, we have those images here in the media library.

78
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:51,020
And so here's this image you could see the size of the image, how big the file is and the URL of the

79
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,730
image right there.

80
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:59,100
One of the easy things you can do within the media library is you can open up a model window here.

81
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,630
You can scroll through to each of the different media library.

82
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:11,330
Items in your library can also copy the URL to the clipboard, open a new tab and just quickly paste

83
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,170
it to just get a version of that image.

84
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,950
And that could be a way.

85
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,710
If you want to save the image from one website and use it on another, you could right click it, say

86
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,320
save image as or something like that.

87
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:31,680
In any case, back here, I'll just close the media library model and let's go back and continue to

88
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,690
compare these.

89
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,210
So there's a home button and that, of course, goes to the same place as these two items.

90
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,920
And let's look at the about page.

91
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:49,070
Now the about page here has a larger black background with a really large, nice looking heading and

92
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,250
a big image on top of that black background.

93
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,890
And then it goes to the white content area.

94
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,680
And this content area is a section which shows the latest blog posts in a grid format.

95
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,370
And there's a view all button here, which if you look at down at the bottom left here in Chrome, you

96
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,300
can see what you are.

97
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:15,470
You'll be going to this view all link in the demo doesn't go anywhere because it's got just a hash symbol

98
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,960
right after the the URL.

99
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,040
So if you click that, it basically just goes to the top of the page, same page.

100
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,270
And so this is labeled latest posts, and each of these featured images you can recognize as the same

101
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,140
images that were on the homepage, and they're clickable again to the blog post.

102
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,200
This time, however, they're cropped into a square instead of being that rectangular image.

103
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,020
And of course, the title is clickable.

104
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:46,250
There's that same excerpt of content and the date.

105
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,410
And then here's another section that says, Watch birds are your inbox.

106
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,710
Join our mailing list.

107
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,100
And here where the line is, you would put an interactive contact form or an opt in form to opt in to

108
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:58,910
your email list.

109
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,960
And then there's the footer that appears the same on every page again.

110
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,210
So let's just take a look at the next page.

111
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,770
This one says event.

112
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:12,530
And so here's kind of the a page that might be created for an event.

113
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,210
This is a purposeful page.

114
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:22,340
Here's a section that has a heading or a title, and it has a vertical large image right here not clickable

115
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,090
to anything.

116
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,860
And then over on the right, there's an icon or an image right here.

117
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:35,480
Then some different typography, you know, some you know, some italics and then a date and location

118
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,740
and then an address and a name of a place right here.

119
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,410
And then as we go down, you know, it's basically one big section about this event.

120
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,230
And then the last one will take a look at is film.

121
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,110
This one has a different color background on the entire page, doesn't it?

122
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,710
And you can see there's some differences here on this particular page.

123
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:06,530
There is no header or there's no header at the top, so the menu is missing the links to the the homepage

124
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:12,080
and the site icon or logo and the name of the site are missing at the top.

125
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,970
This is something that you might use for a landing page or or a page where you bring the person to to

126
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,550
a certain page of the website that represents one thing you want them to do like a call to action and

127
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,110
so you don't want it to click away from.

128
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,060
The page, so you eliminate the navigation and you just have whatever you need on this page, and this

129
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,520
page is also set apart with a different background color.

130
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:43,580
And so again, a nice heading and then a second heading smaller, maybe an inch to three or four and

131
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,690
something there and a button an interactive button that has a nice rollover effect.

132
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:55,640
And of course, a nice image that seems to come off the edge of the page, and it shows the background

133
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,770
color through that image.

134
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:04,820
Down here, there's a different section on the same background color that has kind of a grid layout

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,520
with some columns, you know, a narrower column on the left of video on the right side.

136
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:17,660
And then as we go to the bottom, there's a footer, and now the footer does contain the same navigation

137
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,050
links.

138
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:27,380
And over here, the you know, the recognition or the signature down here in the footer doesn't have

139
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,780
the link able WordPress word as well as it's not in white anymore, it's in different background color.

140
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,420
And so you can see those are the differences.

141
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,630
Let's see if I go back to home.

142
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,850
That takes us back to the home page.

143
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,790
And so how are we going to make this look like that?

144
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,520
You can imagine what we'll have to do, but your challenge now will be to open up your own site and

145
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,170
begin playing around with it.

146
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,490
Now you might.

147
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,490
As we go forward here, we're going to be learning how to use the different blocks, how to create posts

148
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:09,020
and use featured images, and how to edit the templates with the site editor so that we can have different

149
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:15,470
pages like the film page that doesn't have the header and a different background, etc. And so let's

150
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,430
get into that next.
