00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.870
In this lesson, I'll show you how to set up Amazon six and a CRM within WordPress to be able to send

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.810
broadcast email directly through the WordPress website.

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.020
You'll learn how to enable bounce handling to comply with international spam laws by using the Autonomy

4
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.070
CRM plugin in WordPress and the Amazon Simple Notification Service with a web hook to automatically

5
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.870
convert subscribed contacts to bounced status by the end of this video.

6
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.480
You'll understand how to enable bounce handling so that Amazon six can be used as a broadcast email

7
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.970
provider while maintaining best practices.

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:45.210
Let's take a look at a system that I have that's live that's set up in this more advanced way for broadcast

9
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.690
email.

10
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.770
Now this is set up at leverage WP Dotcom.

11
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:59.070
You may have received emails or been on my email list that is powered through Autonomy and Amazon a

12
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.820
WC, so I'm able to send broadcast email as well as email automations for when people either join a

13
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.510
particular thing, like the leverage WP sandbox that you may have joined, as well as other things like

14
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.800
courses that I deliver.

15
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:22.680
I can set up email automations and all of my transactional email, as well as broadcast email is powered

16
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:32.760
through Amazon six using the Autonomy CRM and the fluent SMTP plug in connecting my outgoing emails.

17
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.190
So I wanted to show you guys around the leverage WP Dot website just a little bit in the background.

18
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.210
In the back end, I should say and show you how you can set this up in the same way for any of your

19
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.610
websites or your client websites.

20
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.740
So I'm here under autonomy, under autonomy settings and in the email tab, you can see that I've just

21
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.050
got basic settings like my from address and my reply to email, but here's my sending limit.

22
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.630
I matched that to what my Amazon see is.

23
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.750
Sending limit is fourteen emails, a second 50000 emails in a 24 hour period.

24
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.630
There's a footer unsubscribe text.

25
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.750
There is standard for adding to my emails that I send out, as well as I've enabled the bounce tracking.

26
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.950
And this is very important to set up in order to make sure that if an email bounces that you stop sending

27
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.830
to that email and that works for complaints as well.

28
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.800
And this is what I'm going to show you how to set up right now with WordPress connecting to Amazon.

29
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:50.550
So as you remember, I do already have the SMTP or outgoing email setup to work with my Amazon SWC account,

30
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.950
and we've been in this in the previous lesson.

31
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.400
You can see my daily sending quota is 50000 emails and then the send rate is fourteen emails per second.

32
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.690
And you could see that's what I have set down here under sending limits right here in email settings.

33
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.750
Now I have something here when I check this box under bounced tracking, and I selected Amazon six as

34
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.220
my email service.

35
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.200
It gave me a web hook here.

36
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:28.740
Now, webhook is just a URL that's designed to receive notification, email notification web hooks actually

37
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.330
from an external service, and Amazon allows you to set that up and really to find a more detailed guide

38
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.600
on how to set this up and the way that I've followed.

39
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.890
Setting this up is to go to the Auto NAMI website from the company that that's called build woo funnels

40
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.080
dot com.

41
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.540
They make the autonomy plug in, which is designed to work with with WooCommerce E-commerce and the

42
00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.010
Woo Funnels plug in in order to automate certain things like check out abandonment sequences and automated

43
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.560
sequences for after purchase communication with customers and that sort of thing.

44
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:15.090
And so you can use it for all that, but you can also use it for broadcast email, as I've shown you

45
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.690
a little bit here.

46
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.980
So what I do is I went to the documentation by clicking docs at Build, which funnels dot com, and

47
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.740
I went to the search and I just searched for the word bounce and I clicked this article here, setting

48
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.790
up bounce handling.

49
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.960
Now this particular article goes through bounds handling for a number of different services.

50
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.660
The first one is for Amazon six, which is the outgoing email service that we're using, and it does

51
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:53.400
show that the the way to do this on the original and previous console that Amazon X used to have now

52
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.820
it looks a little bit different now, but it does all the same things.

53
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.810
And so I'll show you what it looks like now.

54
00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.880
So you can even.

55
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.670
Really set up a bounce handling within your Amazon account.

56
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.600
And so I'll go to the, you know, the tutorial here at Build Blue Funnel Scam and need to log in to

57
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.970
your account and you create a topic.

58
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.660
Now this is under Amazon S and S, and you can see that that's not as easy.

59
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:28.550
Amazon says is this simple notification service, and so we leverage the notification service in order

60
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.710
to have these notifications go out and send a web hook in order to unsubscribe someone.

61
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.990
An email address that has bounced or someone that has complained.

62
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:46.550
And so it's a great automated system that you want to definitely use to comply with the spam international

63
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.270
spam laws.

64
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.080
And so I have these up here because I favorited.

65
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.230
They is the simple email service is the one that I'm using and then the simple notification service

66
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.270
I have clicked right here.

67
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:07.520
Now, if you open the services bar here, you'll find that, gosh, there's so much that it can be hard

68
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:15.200
to hard to find, but it's easy to go up and just search for simple notification.

69
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.170
You can find it right here and you can stop it so it'll appear up in your window right here.

70
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:29.630
So when Amazon and what you do is there are topics and there are subscriptions and topics, it's something

71
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.220
you've set up that connects to a particular domain that you have verified.

72
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:41.150
And then subscriptions are what set up the actual web hooks, and this is where you paste in your web

73
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.510
hooks.

74
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.870
And so this is I actually have two in here.

75
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:53.180
I'm using I'm using both of these are connected to the same webhook because I recently switched from

76
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.990
leverage WP Dot SEO to leverage WP dot com.

77
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.300
That's why I have two, but you only need the one in here.

78
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:05.480
But following the tutorial, you just have to set up a topic so you would click Create Topic here under

79
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.770
topics on the left.

80
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.630
And if you create a topic, you would do these.

81
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.830
I f oh, and let's see you go down here and under.

82
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:22.550
It's not a fiasco, actually, but you want to go with a standard and so you would go in and click standard

83
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:28.790
and then you'd follow the tutorial just to, you know, create a name and then click Create Topic.

84
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.110
That's really all you need to do.

85
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:38.360
You just do that and create your name so you know what it is, and then you create a new subscription

86
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.540
and you want to assign that subscription to this topic.

87
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.350
So under here, what I would do is let's go back to my topics here and if I create it, if I clicked

88
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.780
one of these topics, I could go down below and click, Create a subscription.

89
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.270
And here's where I have this subscription creator.

90
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:04.460
But once you click Create a subscription, you need to choose a few things up here select a protocol

91
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:10.160
and that's an HTP protocol, and it tells you how to do that right here.

92
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:16.760
You, you create a subscription and you go back to your autonomy settings and you find that webhook.

93
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.280
That's what I showed you down here under bounce tracking.

94
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:25.400
So you'd go here and you'd copy this or just click copy right here and go back under here.

95
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:32.090
And once you click HTTPS, as you scroll down here, it'll tell you, Uh, let's see you choose that.

96
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:32.720
And here we are.

97
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:41.900
Choose the protocol as HTTPS and then paste the endpoint you URL and click the checkbox for Enable Raw

98
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.130
Message Delivery.

99
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:49.490
And so you would go in here and you would, I would, you know, paste that webhook and I would enable

100
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.760
there.

101
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.700
And then I would just go down on the bottom and click Create subscription.

102
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:59.210
Now I'm not going to do that because I already have my subscriptions and topics created that I need

103
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.420
it.

104
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:05.540
But then once that is in place, then you can.

105
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:14.210
You can go to the after a few minutes that will show you status confirmed under your subscriptions.

106
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.260
And here it's showing confirmed on both of those because it'll check.

107
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.730
And then you want to go to where you have an email address.

108
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:28.970
And if you don't already have the email address associated with your website here, your outgoing email

109
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.810
address verified with Amazon, you'll want to do that.

110
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.170
And so let me pause the video here and get to the proper screen under Amazon simple email service.

111
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:50.630
I went to my verified identities from the side menu over here, and then I selected the orange button

112
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:56.870
create identity so you would create an email address, and once you enter an email address that you

113
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:03.860
can receive email at, then you can, you know, it'll you can click Create Identity and it'll send

114
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.420
you a verification email.

115
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.400
You have to be able to open its inbox to open the verification email once you've clicked the verification

116
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:10.730
link.

117
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:18.230
Then that email will be verified and you can go in under email addresses and under that verification,

118
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.110
you can open the notifications area here.

119
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:28.700
And this is the final step before you can go ahead and test your balance and complete notification system.

120
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:36.530
And so back under a WC, I'm going to pause the video now and go back to my verified email address.

121
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.710
So he went back to verified identities, and I clicked my verified email address.

122
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:50.300
Now I can go down and click this notifications tab and I can go down under feedback notifications,

123
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.650
where I've said you can set up bounce complaint and delivery.

124
00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:01.220
And because we've already created the essence, topic and subscription, we can go ahead and assign

125
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:01.920
that to here.

126
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:08.150
So you would click Edit over here and then you would just pick it the one from the from the dropdown

127
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:15.260
that you need and you leave original email headers unchecked and you can click no topic for delivery

128
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:15.950
feedback.

129
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.820
Otherwise, you'll receive an email every single time a bounce go.

130
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.860
An email bounces and so you might not want to do that if you have a larger list.

131
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.140
And so you can just configure those two topics.

132
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.550
And again, this is going.

133
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:37.730
Following this build, we funnel scrum bounce handling tutorial where it shows you how to set up the

134
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:47.000
notifications and then you set it with, you know, you uncheck the feedback you don't check include

135
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.020
original headers.

136
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:57.230
You can email feedback forwarding you want to have on disabled, and that is at one level higher.

137
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.600
I believe in this new.

138
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:11.000
FWC says screen and under notifications, this is here email feedback forwarding, you can edit that

139
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.650
and leave it at disabled.

140
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.590
Once you've set up your feedback notifications here.

141
00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.000
And so following this, the next thing you just you do is just test your settings.

142
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:27.380
Amazon provides an email address that will bounce and so you can test your settings here.

143
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:33.970
And so I've already got this email address set up, so I'll go back and under autonomy contacts.

144
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.460
I'll open that contact and I'll pass the video here and do that.

145
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:47.460
So after I created a contact called Bounce Handler and I put I assigned that simulator Amazon email

146
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.870
address to it, I assigned it as a subscribed person.

147
00:12:52.320 --> 00:13:00.210
Then I sent them a message using my autonomy and my, my automated, you know, fluent SMTP system that's

148
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.110
already set up sent them an email or something like bounce test.

149
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:10.950
And then I just clicked send, and a few minutes later, I refreshed the page here.

150
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:16.440
And then this changes from subscribed to bounced.

151
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:25.110
And now in my system, that subscriber has been changed to bounced, which means that I will not be

152
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:30.810
able to send to that address in the future, which complies with the international spam laws and is

153
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.760
a best practice for setting up your, you know, broadcast email system.

154
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:42.210
So now, you know, all I would have to do, I could go to broadcasts and, you know, I could duplicate

155
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:53.220
one, or I could just click, add new and you know, any time I want to, I can use my CRM here in WordPress

156
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.610
and you know, I can even do a B testing.

157
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:03.750
You know, I can choose the number of the contacts that I want to send to, whether it's all of them

158
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:12.780
or, you know, I filter them and then I can open up an email editor that's provided by autonomy, where

159
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:18.360
it has a lot of great functionality, like pulling in merge tags like a person's first name, last name,

160
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.220
link triggers that I can use.

161
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:26.310
So if I ask a question like in a poll, Hey, are you interested in the video tutorials or do you more

162
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.610
like to read tutorials with screenshots?

163
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.980
And I click this link for videos and click this link for written tutorials.

164
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:41.340
And then when they click that link, it will automatically do something in my CRM like tag them so that

165
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.080
I can send them particular content that they are interested in in the future.

166
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.420
You can also save email templates.

167
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:54.360
It's just a really powerful system that you can use for sending broadcast email through WordPress.

168
00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:04.860
And now I am using my Amazon IWC simple email service for those outgoing group emails, not my WordPress

169
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.250
system.

170
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:10.770
So I've got a managed IP address and all the power of Amazon behind my broadcast email.

171
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:16.980
And like I said, it only will cost me if I had 10000 people on my list and I sent them four or five

172
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.700
times a month.

173
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:23.850
That would cost me less than $5 a month instead of the MailChimp solution for that costs about $100

174
00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:24.140
a month.

175
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:31.920
So it's a great system and it is really powerful and compliant as far as international spam laws and

176
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.200
bounce and complaint tracking, it's awesome.
