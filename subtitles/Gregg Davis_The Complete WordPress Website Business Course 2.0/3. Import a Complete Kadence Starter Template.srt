1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,310
In this lesson, we'll explore the Cadence Theme Settings panel and compare the free version to what

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,690
the pro version offers.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:13,080
You'll learn the nuances of installing starter templates in cadence as a whole site or individual pages

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,550
by the end of this video.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,460
You'll know how to choose and install a complete website design, including header footer and global

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,680
elements like typography and colors in preparation for designing a custom site fast.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:34,740
Well, now we have cadence activated and the cadence blocks plugin activated in our WordPress installation.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,090
You can.

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:43,410
You can see that if you open your website in another tab and just press refresh, it comes in pretty

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,370
basic, right?

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:52,020
We've got just a header right here with the single page that is by default, included in a new WordPress

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,770
installation.

13
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,190
We've got a content area that has an interesting display of WordPress posts.

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,390
There's just one default post, of course, and a default WordPress installation you can see.

15
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:12,060
It's got kind of a very light gray background with a drop shadow and, you know, got a blue link here.

16
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,020
Read more The link and then a default footer at the bottom.

17
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,290
You know, if you click the the category, you've just got the name of the category.

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,850
This is just a basic blank theme that you can use, and you can use this as a starting point.

19
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,760
When you start to build cadence websites, and one of the things we'll go over in this section is how

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,210
there are wireframe layouts available in the cadence environment so that you can, instead of bringing

21
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,860
in a predesigned starter template that has images and and and pictures and different colors already

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,290
set, you can really start from scratch if you want to with the cadence theme and take advantage of

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,520
all those cadence blocks, as well as the design library, which is similar to block patterns in the

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,900
WordPress ecosystem.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,800
But let's go back in to the the WordPress dashboard.

26
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:15,330
There's one more thing I want to just show you inside of the dashboard here, and that is under appearance

27
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,190
cadence.

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:24,210
If you just click the the cadence kind of cadence theme setup screen, you've got a few tabs across

29
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,430
the top that you can take advantage of.

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,280
There's a dashboard that shows you some global areas global colors branding for your logo and favicon

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,400
for your site, like the title image up here.

32
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,940
The typography sitewide, the header and footer, as well as the general page layout.

33
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:54,900
Now all of these will open the customizer, which by by default in a WordPress theme that is not a full

34
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,400
site editing theme, will be available over here under appearance customize.

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,320
And we're going to be going over all the different areas in the customizer and the very many settings

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,760
that you have over there.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,750
But I wanted to point out also down below, there's a little, you know, an ad for the Pro add on for

38
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,230
cadence.

39
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:21,000
Now, cadence is a freemium plug in and theme, and it's developed by a great set of developers owned

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,090
by the IE Themes Company now, and they they do a great job of supporting cadence.

41
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:35,190
There's so much great functionality within the free version of cadence and the cadence blocks plug in

42
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,870
that that's what we're going to be using.

43
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,320
You'll see that's really all you need to start with.

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,390
If there is some functionality that is more advanced that you that you need or want.

45
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,900
Then there is more in the Cadence Pro add on for the theme, as well as the Blocks plugin.

46
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,110
And so there's an inexpensive upgrade that can be made right now.

47
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,560
We're just using the free version, but you can see there's more headers.

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,540
There's an ultimate menu.

49
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,720
Add on that that gives you, you know, multi column mega menus, hood header and footer scripts.

50
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,560
Hooked elements gives you more functionality as far as putting items within your website in different

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,820
places like the header.

52
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,950
There's just some extra stuff that comes with the pro add on.

53
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,190
That's pretty awesome.

54
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,710
And I'll be going over all those things later in the course and showing you around that, but also across

55
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,120
the top.

56
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:32,700
There's a getting started column and a tab where there's a video here and then links to a set of video

57
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,210
tutorials and the knowledge base, which is really full of awesome written articles to help you with

58
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,650
cadence.

59
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,210
If you're stuck or you have a question about how to do something that is a great place as a reference,

60
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,580
I often keep the knowledge base open in another tab when I'm making a site with cadence.

61
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,610
The changelog just tells you what's been made in the last updates, and then this is just a link to

62
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,670
the starter templates we already have in.

63
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,510
Old and so let's go ahead and open that starter template screen by clicking that blue button or under

64
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,670
cadence starter templates.

65
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,890
Let's go over how to bring in a starter template and how that works.

66
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,320
There's some different options that you have here and some different things that you should be aware

67
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,770
of when you're bringing in a starter template into the cadence environment.

68
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,990
And so one thing I'll show you is just if we click the first one coffee shop here, if you just click

69
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,530
it once it's going to open a customizer window.

70
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,920
There's a column on the left side with some selections, and then there's an example of what the Full-Size

71
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,430
site will look like if you bring it in to your website.

72
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,770
And now so we have not imported this design into the website as of yet.

73
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,530
This is just showing us a preview.

74
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:56,400
And you can go through and click the different menu items to look at all the different layout options

75
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,860
within any of the starter themes in cadence, for example, the contact.

76
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:08,610
You know, here's an example of a style contact form, and you can see what the footer looks like,

77
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,870
et cetera.

78
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,950
You know, here's a menu in the coffee shop one.

79
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,090
And so the thing you can do is just check out all of these starter templates, you know, at full size,

80
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:25,200
and then you can even click this the X at the top left to go back to where you were, and you can check

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,710
out, you know, other ones and open them up and look at what you have available.

82
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,650
Some of the advantages of, you know, using cadence and cadence blocks is that look at this.

83
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,110
You can bring in a background video in your header just by default.

84
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,020
By using the free cadence theme in the cadence blocks plug in, you can see what these dropdowns look

85
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,410
like.

86
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,070
Now, you know other things in each of these.

87
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:00,900
These designs are very well designed starter templates that you can then leverage in order to build

88
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,580
your own custom sites.

89
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,760
Now, this one, you might notice, has a shopping cart and you know it has a shop.

90
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,210
These are products you can, you know, add them to the cart.

91
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,300
There's these little rollover effects for these products.

92
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,940
A great looking store built with the free WooCommerce e-commerce plugin.

93
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:29,250
Now, some of these starter templates do have plug ins that are required to use, and they are listed

94
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,050
down below the color and font family options down here on the left hand side.

95
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:42,030
And so required plug ins will be installed when you import a starter template if they're not installed

96
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,750
already.

97
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:49,830
And so some of these do require the Cadence Pro add on the paid version of cadence.

98
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,630
This leather shop is one of them.

99
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,360
The Cadence Block Pro not installed and the Cadence Pro theme upgrade not installed.

100
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,210
Now those are, you know, less than $200 a year.

101
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:08,940
They do have a lifetime price for around six to seven hundred dollars for Cadence Pro and very affordable

102
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,490
if you're going to be using cadence to build multiple sites.

103
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:18,150
But this, for example, it wouldn't be a good option for building a real live website if you didn't

104
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,430
plan on getting Cadence Pro.

105
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,520
But you know, WooCommerce is free.

106
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,150
And so some of the ones that you'll see here, for example, coffee shop that we were using before are

107
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:36,030
not required to have the cadence blocks pro and Cadence Theme Pro add on.

108
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:43,290
Those are packaged together when you go to cadence and look at what the pricing is like there, but

109
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,770
the required plug ins will be installed on import.

110
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:52,830
And so you'll find that if you do import one of these designs that has an e-commerce shop, you'll see

111
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,980
that WooCommerce will be imported as well.

112
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,320
One more thing I wanted to show you, I think some of them have courses.

113
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,360
For example, here's a course website where you know you can explore the courses.

114
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,520
Let's see if we just look under courses here.

115
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,020
It'll show a grid layout of different courses that you could have.

116
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:21,330
This one uses a course plug in called LearnDash, which is a paid courses plug in for WordPress.

117
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:28,470
Again, if you weren't going to be using that plug in, you could substitute a different courseware

118
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,940
plug in for WordPress.

119
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,930
But this one has been built with LearnDash in mind, and so it styles it really beautifully for the

120
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,000
course itself.

121
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:45,660
You know this right here is these are examples of the way LearnDash shows the different courses and

122
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,700
these different materials and things like that.

123
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,610
It shows you, of course, progress and that sort of thing.

124
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:57,030
So just be aware that there are required plug ins sometimes associated with the cadence, starter templates.

125
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,710
And the final thing that I want to show you is that.

126
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:05,370
You can choose to bring in either a single page or you can bring in the full site.

127
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,650
And what I'd recommend generally, especially when you're practicing with cadence, is that you bring

128
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,460
in the full site.

129
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:20,790
Let's go back and look at one of the one of the starter templates that we are going to be looking at

130
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,880
and customizing it.

131
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,910
That doesn't take any extra plugins.

132
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,800
That's the real estate one here.

133
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,410
If I click Click Real Estate, you can get a good idea of what this might look like.

134
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,820
There's a lot of nice little design elements in this starter template, and you can see if we scroll

135
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,100
down.

136
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,050
It only requires that the cadence blocks plugin be activated, and so using the free versions will all

137
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:52,590
be able to get in here and customize this template and different pages, including the header in the

138
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:52,950
footer.

139
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,890
And so that's why I suggest you bring in the full site.

140
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:02,880
When you do that, it actually creates all the pages and it creates the custom header and the custom

141
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,450
footer that comes with the whole starter template.

142
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,670
Now, if you do bring in a single page, at some point you can just choose which page you want to bring

143
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,180
in, and it just imports that single page when you click on it.

144
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,000
You can hit the back button right here, and let's go back to that real estate.

145
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,690
Starter template.

146
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm going to click on it and then finally, you can choose your colour scheme.

147
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:37,560
Now both color scheme and the font family are easily changeable later, but this is a nice place where

148
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:45,600
you can go ahead and maybe choose a font family and then choose a color scheme which creates not only

149
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,500
four but seven or eight different colors that all match and are used throughout the design.

150
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,820
And so it's really nice.

151
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,210
It saves a lot of time to be able to choose a color scheme right now.

152
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:04,830
Choose a fast family, which will give you two different themes that match four different places on

153
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:10,680
the website, like the header versus the body, text, etc. And then all you need to do is click full

154
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,850
site down here.

155
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,810
And I usually leave these as the defaults under import details tells you what color palette you've selected.

156
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,450
I could see there's five colors here and then what the actual font pair is the names of those.

157
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:33,000
That's useful if you want to take and make any graphics or logos within Photoshop or another program

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,110
like Canva, where you can go and find those fonts and use them in other graphics you might create for

159
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,130
a custom website.

160
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:47,370
And then under advanced settings, I usually make sure and have these two selected where it's importing

161
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:53,190
the customize or settings for this starter template and also importing the content itself so you can

162
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,000
see what it really looks like.

163
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,960
And now this little window is totally optional.

164
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,560
You can subscribe to the Cadence newsletter and hear about when something new comes out and features

165
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,690
for cadence, but you don't have to.

166
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:14,160
You can go to the bottom and click Skip Start Importing, and then it should only take a few seconds

167
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,560
and it will import the content.

168
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,740
It imports the menus and the header.

169
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,670
The footer.

170
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,470
The Customize content.

171
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,590
And then you'll get a result in just a few seconds.

172
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,510
All right, that took about 10 seconds when I did pause the video while it was doing it.

173
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,310
And now I've got a message in for complete finished view your site.

174
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,670
So I usually don't click that, especially if I have my site already open in another tab.

175
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:48,220
But I just go ahead and go back to, you know, just somewhere here.

176
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:54,610
I might go back to pages, all pages within the dashboard and you can see what pages it created.

177
00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:04,060
It did get rid of the sample page, and it did create the labeled the home as the front page or the

178
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,090
home page and blog as the Post's page.

179
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:14,200
And if you remember, those can be chosen, you know, when you look at settings reading.

180
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:21,610
That's a place where you choose a static page four for your home page on your posts page and the the

181
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,840
under appearance.

182
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,520
Customize is also a place where you can choose your home page settings.

183
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,430
Also under posts all posts.

184
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:38,680
It also created a series of posts, six posts to be exact for this starter template, and then this

185
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,570
Hello World post was left here and it's just uncategorized.

186
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:48,640
It doesn't have any images or anything, so I usually go in and just put that in the trash so that it's

187
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,190
not visible within the theme as I'm looking around.

188
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,060
And so I'll go over to the live site here under my second tab and refresh the page.

189
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,050
And what we'll see is this website.

190
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:09,760
It's it's really awesome when you can get a fully designed website imported into your own environment

191
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,730
as a really great starting place.

192
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,160
There's this nice back to top button up here.

193
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,790
You can see that there's, you know, different layouts.

194
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,820
This is kind of a standard header with a shorter image different than the home page, but the same menu

195
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,750
navigation.

196
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,940
You know, here is the about page.

197
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:38,110
There's the blog page works to pull in each of these blog posts, as well as clickable to the blog post

198
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:46,510
itself, which has the title inside of a bigger top image, which is the featured image of the blog

199
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:53,320
post and a lot of great stuff about this starter template.

200
00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:01,540
So next, we'll get to customizing this starter template within our WordPress dashboard, using all

201
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,930
the features of the cadence block's plug in, as well as cadence theme itself under appearance, customize

202
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,460
and a few other places.
