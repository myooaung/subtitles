1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,000
In this lesson, we'll use the layout that we saved to the DV Library to create a global footer as well

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,700
as create a new footer to be used on different pages.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,580
You'll learn how to duplicate a section of any layout to use for your global or page specific footers

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,080
in the DV theme builder.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,110
By the end of this video, you'll understand how moving sections and layouts to and from the DV library

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,970
can be useful for customizing a global footer design from pre-designed layout packs.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:35,070
All right, now that we've saved the parallax footer that was part of each of the page layouts in this

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,960
travel agency layout pack from Divvy, we can bring it into the theme builder and make it into a global

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,470
footer.

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:51,180
And so let's go back into the media, excuse me, into the WordPress dashboard and open up divvy theme

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,660
builder.

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,510
And now I can see that I can add a global footer here for the default web site template.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,790
Here's where I can add a global footer and say I could say add from library, except what I have is

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,920
a section, you know?

15
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,810
So let's see what my saved layouts are.

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:17,190
I don't actually have a complete page layout saved inside of my div library, so that would be not the

17
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,150
way I'd want to bring it in.

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:26,310
Instead, I want to add global footer and then I can click Build Global Footer.

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:35,100
Now that opens up a layout where I just have an empty section and I can add a row and within that row

20
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,620
I could add modules, right?

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:46,650
And so you can build from scratch or right here under this section, I could I can go, Let's see.

22
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,130
Oh, you know what?

23
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,160
I really want to do is click this little plus sign down here so that we add a new section and I want

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,530
to add a section from the library.

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,620
Now I know I have the parallax footer section.

26
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:04,320
I needed to know that it was a section that I saved to the library because you can't really pull, say,

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,210
a saved module.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,700
Using a section like this, you'd have to save modules as modules and sections, as sections and page

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,370
layouts as complete page layouts.

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,890
If you remember from before in a different lesson, the previous section.

31
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:32,130
In the course we used down here, we used this plus to pull in full complete page layouts from our library.

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,860
Right now, we don't have any saved layouts in the Deivi library that we had saved.

33
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,160
And so, like I said, we use this plus button under section.

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,410
The blue is four sections we click add from library and we can choose parallax footer.

35
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,710
So now here's this entire footer, right?

36
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,200
And we have it the whole thing there.

37
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,990
But there's an extra section up here that was created when we first said Build custom footer, so I'll

38
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,820
just click the little trashcan icon.

39
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,410
And really, that's it.

40
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,270
That's us done.

41
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,720
We have the entire section that we had saved the Disney library now imported as a global footer, and

42
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,860
if we click save right here, let that save and then use the X at the top purple bar at the right there.

43
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:25,200
And we have global footer that has it has duplicated itself across all of our templates that we have.

44
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:32,580
And so if I wanted to change the footer for the same number of pages that are the custom header or,

45
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,890
you know, even make a custom footer out of this global footer, I can do that.

46
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,680
But for now, I know that I want to have the footer the same on every single page because it's going

47
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,670
to look great on any page as long as that page ends in a white color.

48
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:57,510
Because if you remember that footer ends with a, it takes a blend and it uses a gradient to blend itself

49
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,400
back up into the white.

50
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,500
If you remember, we'll just check it out here under the sections and the background image.

51
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,850
This background image right here has a gradient over it.

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,290
Is this gradient.

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,580
This gradient isn't here.

54
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,440
It ends in white in any case.

55
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,440
And so then as far as design, um, I wonder where that gradient was.

56
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,590
It wasn't in the section.

57
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:30,930
It was in the row, which is interesting, so the row had a background set where it didn't have an image

58
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,140
at all.

59
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,090
But what it had was a gradient which sits on top of the section background.

60
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,220
And so that gradient, as you remember, was transparent all the way up to white.

61
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:49,320
And so what that means is that this layout for the whole footer really works well for a page that ends

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,360
in a white background color.

63
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,910
And so I'll just make sure and.

64
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,740
Save my changes, I don't think I did make any changes.

65
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:05,030
But what that's going to do, the last thing we have to do is take a look at the pages that we have.

66
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,750
For example, this homepage ends like that.

67
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,160
Let's just go ahead and refresh the page and see what we have.

68
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:19,760
Well, we're going to have is a duplicate page footer, so we have that footer coming into play and

69
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,750
then, Oh.

70
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,350
It looks like, let's see, it looks like it replaced.

71
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,560
Did it replace that footer?

72
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,470
No, it didn't replace the footer for some reason.

73
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,950
So this global footer should be working on every page of the website.

74
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,470
Let's see.

75
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,620
This is the same footer that we're editing, the global footer layout is here.

76
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,740
Looks like I'm still using the default footer.

77
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,450
Maybe I have to change, save my changes here to make sure I had saved all the way through.

78
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,060
That's right, I hadn't saved my changes.

79
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,490
So that's something that can happen to you too.

80
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,240
If you don't notice that right here.

81
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,280
If this doesn't say all changes saved, then your changes aren't saved yet, and it will reflect itself

82
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,120
on the life site.

83
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,380
So what I have is this page content has this footer already present?

84
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,470
But then there's another copy of it down here.

85
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:23,560
You can also see that the gray footer and the bottom bar has disappeared because this global footer

86
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,680
has replaced that default footer that comes with Devi.

87
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,570
And so what we have to do is go through all the pages and if there's a footer that is duplicated, we

88
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,220
have to remove it from the page content.

89
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,260
Pretty easy.

90
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:40,240
Just click Enable Visual Builder, let it load and then go back down to the bottom.

91
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,090
And when we get to the first one, that's part of the page content.

92
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,620
We just click the blue trashcan and there we go.

93
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,780
And now we see that green at her foot footer template come up just like up at the header.

94
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:59,170
We can edit edit that template when we're in the visual builder, but that footer is the global footer.

95
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,300
And so I'll save this page layout because I removed the duplicated page footer.

96
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:12,280
And this is us taking what was given to us as a page layout that we imported from Devi and the elegant

97
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,370
themes layout packs, and we duplicated it into a global footer to use on every page.

98
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,770
So I'll just exit the visual builder and you can go ahead and pause the video and go through this same

99
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,280
process.

100
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:31,360
But what I'm going to do is go into every page and make sure that the footer has is not duplicated and

101
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,620
looks appropriate.

102
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,620
So I'll pause the video now and go through and do that.

103
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,730
Well, have that go?

104
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:43,690
You may have noticed that some of the pages didn't have that actual footer, so you didn't have to remove

105
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:43,840
it.

106
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:49,210
But a lot of those pages didn't end in a white colored background section.

107
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,710
And so it just kind of ends in a line here, for example, on the contact page.

108
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,180
There's this.

109
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,800
Join our newsletter!

110
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,400
Call to action at the bottom of the contact page.

111
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,640
And so, you know, I don't think it looks bad.

112
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:09,640
So one option would be to leave this global footer on every single page and then still have this call

113
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,540
to action here.

114
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,770
But one argument would be that, well, you're kind of duplicating the call to action.

115
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:21,430
A call to action, by definition, is something that usually you'll want to only give the user one option

116
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,340
for the thing that you want them to do from that page.

117
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,440
And so there's either, you know, join the newsletter or a second option, get in touch.

118
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,780
Well, that's kind of, you know, two items could be confusing.

119
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,060
Generally, the more different options people have, the less action they take.

120
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:48,640
And so one of the things we could do is look at, you know, the contact page was in the blog page,

121
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,170
I think, as well.

122
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:58,420
I had a yeah, it had that same, you know, different footer, the our newsletter footer.

123
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:07,570
So one option would be to take and make a copy of this our newsletter section and make that into a DV

124
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:15,730
library item as a section and then bring that into the theme builder and make it a different section

125
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:24,160
only visible on certain pages and then make this global, you know, global footer visible on the different

126
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,540
pages that we want.

127
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,210
And so that might be a good challenge for you at this point.

128
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:34,440
And then I can come back and show you how I would accomplish that by doing it.

129
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:34,930
So what is it?

130
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,010
The contact page?

131
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,330
The blog page?

132
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,660
I think the shop page is that right?

133
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,010
The shop page also had this newsletter call to action instead.

134
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,420
So really, it's these three contact blog and shop.

135
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,480
And I think that was about it.

136
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,370
I think the about page, maybe, you know, there's an example even go into the gray background here.

137
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,760
You know, what you might try is to maybe switch these two up or even just make this background color

138
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,440
white instead of gray to eliminate this solid line right here.

139
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,860
Just an option on the team page the about page.

140
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,810
Let's see what the about page looks like, the about page that has a nice gallery, doesn't it?

141
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:27,720
Yeah, I love that the about page has another call to action for viewing packages.

142
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,740
And then below that, it has the footer.

143
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,310
And so there are a lot of different options here that you could do.

144
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:45,570
Do you really need to have a a footer that's only, you know, visible once on one page to be a global

145
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,980
item in the theme builder?

146
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,870
You could, but you don't have to.

147
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:55,200
You can see how it might take a little bit of thought to organize your global footer items and your

148
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,980
single page footer items and then arrange them.

149
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,350
But for now, let me give you this challenge.

150
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:09,480
Like I mentioned, go to the contact page, blog page and shop page and have the newsletter call to

151
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,400
action, be the footer instead of this other footer with the parallax that we created before.

152
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,310
Pause the video and when we come back, I'll show you how I accomplished it.

153
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,110
So the first thing is here from one of those three pages, I'm on the contact page here.

154
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,410
I want to take this section and make it something I can use from the DV library.

155
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,120
So I hit, you know, open the visual builder.

156
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,430
And I'll go down to this section.

157
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,780
Let's just make sure, yeah, we're that other blue border and the plus button is is where that ends.

158
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,960
And so that's my section.

159
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,360
So I'm going to use the down arrow in a circle, and I'm going to say this is the.

160
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,180
Newsletter footer.

161
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,810
Oops!

162
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:07,330
I just Typekit correctly with my space, saved the library, and then really, I'm done with the visual

163
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,660
builder there, so I like that the visual builder, it knows I didn't make any changes.

164
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,280
I just saved something to the library.

165
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,400
And so now I'll go back into the theme builder.

166
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:23,470
Now what I want to do is I want to leave the the global header the way that it is on all these pages.

167
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,160
But what I want to do is make a footer.

168
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,070
That's a custom footer that's only visible on certain pages, those three pages.

169
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,410
And so I'll go add a new template.

170
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:43,880
And what I want to do is add this template to specific pages and I want it on the blog page.

171
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,240
So this is assigned to another template, right?

172
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,680
OK.

173
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,360
So that's not going to work because that's going to be a different template.

174
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,230
It's already assigned to a page.

175
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,360
So we'll do this a little bit differently.

176
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:06,130
As far as let's see that you know, what I can do is let's see what pages do I have right here on this

177
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:06,400
one?

178
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,430
I have the team shop, blog, contact and packages.

179
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,750
All right, let's this is going to take a little bit of planning.

180
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,010
So you might have run into this if you were trying to do it on your own.

181
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:25,480
And what the shot page, the blog page and the contact page to be different shop.

182
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,950
Blog in contact.

183
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,190
So what I'll do is I'll remove shop.

184
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,170
And blog from here and contact, shop, blog and contact.

185
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,200
All right, so let me save that, and now I'm going to make a new template and I'm going to put it on

186
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,190
specific pages, the shop blog and contact pages.

187
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,810
Let's create that template.

188
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,110
OK, now it did that for me.

189
00:13:52,110 --> 00:14:00,840
It, you know, it's got specific pages, blog and two more, and it tells me, OK, it's put the global

190
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:07,350
header on here the way that I want, and it's got the global footer as well.

191
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,390
But I know that I want to switch that out.

192
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,890
I want to change this and edit the edit the footer.

193
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:19,380
But you know what I don't want to do is edit the global footer on every page of the website right from

194
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,740
there.

195
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:25,710
And so really, what I want to do is I want to disable global.

196
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,770
And so what that will do is it will make a custom footer for me out of the global footer.

197
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,810
And so now I can go ahead and edit this footer for these specific pages.

198
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,900
So next, I'll just go into the pencil icon there.

199
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,070
And instead of having this section, I want to replace this section with another one so I can go ahead

200
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,080
and hit ad add from library.

201
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:55,130
There's my newsletter footer and I could go back up here and click the trashcan and that's it.

202
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,330
Now I have that footer saved as a custom footer, I can go ahead and save my layout.

203
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,360
Make sure that finishes and then click close on here.

204
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:12,440
Now there's one more thing I need to do, and that is that I know that certain pages I wanted to actually,

205
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,600
I didn't want to use the global header here.

206
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:22,550
I wanted to use this custom header that had the different color menu items.

207
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:29,660
And since all three of these pages were here using this custom header, one thing I can do is just remove

208
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,220
this right here.

209
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:38,750
I can just, you know, delete that custom header there, and I can take this custom header and I can

210
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,830
click copy and then I can right click there and click Paste.

211
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:50,120
Now I've got this customized header on this customized set of three pages and I can click save changes,

212
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,730
and that should have finished everything that I need.

213
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,060
So if I go back to home, let's just go ahead and refresh.

214
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,460
Of course, that should show my original global global footer great.

215
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:09,710
Now, if I look at the shop page that first of all, it shows the right color header menu colors and

216
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,180
then when I go to the bottom.

217
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,410
Great.

218
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,150
Look that I've got the footer there.

219
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,270
And as you know, I have to remove this from the page content, so I'll just enable Visual Builder while

220
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:20,780
I'm here.

221
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:28,830
And get rid of that copy of the footer, because there's two of them here, so I'll do the upper one

222
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,580
since that's part of the page content and not part of the footer template.

223
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,900
So let me go up here and just to this footer control bar and hit the trashcan.

224
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,400
There we go.

225
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,750
You may have noticed on our products this This layout pack is designed to use the WooCommerce plug in,

226
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:53,460
which is the free e-commerce plug in for for WordPress itself, which is the really awesome e-commerce

227
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:53,790
plug in.

228
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,300
And the shop module is one that uses WooCommerce.

229
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:04,020
And so you'd have to have that active to use products and have an e-commerce store using this layout

230
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,710
or the different woo modules that Devi comes with.

231
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,740
And we're going to talk about Wu models in Devi a little bit later.

232
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,980
So let's go ahead and save this layout now.

233
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:19,350
Then there's two more pages to check on and make sure that there's no more edits that we need to do.

234
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,420
So I'll click Edit Visual Builder.

235
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,460
It's shop, blog and contact that we're looking to edit.

236
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,830
So in the blog page, we can tell that by putting that featured image, our blog post now looks pretty

237
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,130
good.

238
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,160
Now, if we had more, if we had at least three or even six, it would look nice as a grid layout here.

239
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,810
But again, we have two of these footers.

240
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,840
I just noticed that in the animation, it was like a like a hinge hinged animation on that footer.

241
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,870
I don't know if you caught that, but we'll look at it on the next one.

242
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,720
Let me delete this one as a part of the page content and just click Save down at the bottom for the

243
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,090
page, then exit the visual builder.

244
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,510
Now I can go to contact and on this last one, as I scroll down, look at have a name.

245
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,210
Hinge is open for this right here.

246
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,290
Keep in touch and the form is a module.

247
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,330
A contact module that hinges open.

248
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,890
Looks pretty neat, huh?

249
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,290
OK, so let's enable the visual builder that'll force us to scroll back down again.

250
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:28,170
But we can get back down there once it loads and go ahead and edit.

251
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,520
Oops!

252
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,430
Get rid of this right there.

253
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,230
Now we have that other footer present and ready to go.

254
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:38,890
Awesome.

255
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,760
Now I've saved that page and we can exit the visual builder.

256
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:49,450
Lastly, I'll just make sure that on a page like packages, we don't have anything duplicated and that

257
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,600
we have the correct footer down at the bottom there.

258
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,200
Awesome.

259
00:18:53,620 --> 00:19:00,190
So now you can see in using the template theme builder, I should say, using the theme builder in Divvy.

260
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:06,190
You can start to create these different website templates that are visible on different pages of the

261
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:13,750
website, including making a backup template that's not used at all here in red and either global or

262
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:20,920
custom footers and headers that we can use on different pages or different page types inside the website,

263
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,850
it's really powerful.
