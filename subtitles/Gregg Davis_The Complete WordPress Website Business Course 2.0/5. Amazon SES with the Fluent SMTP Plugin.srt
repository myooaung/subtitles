1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,600
In this lesson, I'll show you how to set up an Amazon AWB account and verify a domain to be used with

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,230
transactional email through the Amazon Simple Email Service.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:17,130
You'll learn how to set up the free fluent SMTP plug in to connect Amazon six with a WordPress website

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,970
to take advantage of the low pricing and high quota levels available for outgoing email with ease.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,340
By the end of this video, you'll understand how to set up fluent SMTP, verify a domain with Amazon

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,290
six and apply to get your Amazon account approved and out of the sandbox mode.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,010
It starts with Let's go over how to set up Amazon simple email service as a transactional email provider

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,950
for your WordPress website and for client sites.

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:52,920
So what I've done is click sign in to the console and you know, here's where you would go just to get

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,490
your free WC developer account first.

11
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,610
And then you'll have to set up billing information to get that very small billing amount for any transactional

12
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,220
emails that get sent from you or your clients websites.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,850
I tend to sign up all my clients under my account and go ahead and pay for those transactional emails

14
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,630
that they use out of my website care and hosting programs.

15
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,460
Just I bundle it in.

16
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:25,230
And so if you sign up for that and then I've got one of my identities here, verified open, you could

17
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,070
see that I've got.

18
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:35,070
The summary is the this domain is verified and I have the DKIM successful, which is something that

19
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:43,290
you do by placing more DNS records here for me in Cloudflare under the domain names in your DNS provider.

20
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:51,270
And so these sea names right here, this one, there's actually three sea name records that you place

21
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:59,550
in order and one text record in order to verify your domain ownership with Amazon and make sure that

22
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,720
this is successful and you can use the IP address then.

23
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,260
Now, let's talk about the plug in that I recommend using.

24
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,540
Here is at WordPress.org is the free plug in fluent SMTP.

25
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,080
Of course, it's got a longer name WordPress Mail, SMTP, and for all these different providers, it

26
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,120
certainly works and there's a description right here.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,450
But you can install this plug in directly through your WordPress website, and once it is installed

28
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:37,020
and activated, you can go over in your WordPress website to settings and click Fluent SMTP, and then

29
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,770
you can begin to set up an active email connection.

30
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:47,940
And so when I've already got one set up, so we're just going to tour how this works and how this setup

31
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,240
works.

32
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,270
You can see the fluent SMTP works with all these different providers or even another one that's not

33
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,860
on this list.

34
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:01,890
If you click other SMTP and you just all you do is set up a few settings here and fluent SMTP will walk

35
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,570
you through getting this set up.

36
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,360
There is a little bit of setup needed with Amazon, and I'll walk you through that a little bit and

37
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,130
how to find that information.

38
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:19,380
But what you do is you get your access keys, a secret access key or an access key ID and then a secret

39
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:26,400
access key that you place either in the database using a form right here in the WordPress website's

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,030
settings.

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:36,240
Or you can copy and paste this piece of code and replace these asterisks with your kid and your secret

42
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,110
access key.

43
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:44,730
Then Amazon gives you inside of the WP config file, which is just a little bit more secure of a way

44
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,670
to put in the access keys to your Amazon account.

45
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,310
And then it's very important that you choose the correct region that you're sending from, and that's

46
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,840
defined within your Amazon settings up here when you're signed in with Amazon.

47
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,010
You choose where your your accounts are sending email from.

48
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,730
And usually you would choose the location close to where your website host is or where most of your

49
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,260
website users are.

50
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,700
And it doesn't really matter.

51
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,890
Email can be delivered all over the world from any of these locations, but choose the one that makes

52
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:23,760
sense for you, and then you always need to use that location in your fluent SMTP setup.

53
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,630
Otherwise, it won't work, and so you can.

54
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,750
The best help doc is under this.

55
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,230
Read the documentation at the fluent SMTP website.

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,220
So I just clicked right, clicked and clicked open link in a new tab.

57
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,580
And I've got that article up here at the fluent SMTP XCOM website, and this walks you through just

58
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:53,760
setting up the plug in itself, but then getting your Amazon six and AWG account and getting your access

59
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,060
key.

60
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,080
And the secret key.

61
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,010
Like I just discussed, there's some screenshots and video help.

62
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,650
Right here.

63
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,270
You need to choose your security credentials.

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,760
You need to add a user and that be for that email address and the domain name that you want to verify

65
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,580
and you can do this for each.

66
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:19,260
You can choose and are a different user for each of your client sites as well and separate those, but

67
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,110
have them use your own Amazon account.

68
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:31,920
And then you just follow these instructions here to set up Amazon and get your access key through Amazon

69
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:39,390
and then copy and paste that into either the settings here in the database or using FTP.

70
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:45,150
Opening up your WP config file and pasting that piece of code in there with your secret key and your

71
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,850
kid.

72
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:54,410
Make sure you choose your region properly and then there's something else you do need to do with Amazon

73
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,110
six.

74
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:02,280
Now one of the things is you need to choose the right region here and verify your email addresses by

75
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,790
sending and receiving a confirmation link in the email address.

76
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:14,940
If it's a live email address and then you can verify your domain by clicking domains in Amazon, as

77
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,110
I've done over here.

78
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,510
And then it will.

79
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,230
They will give you some different codes to put in your DNS provider.

80
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,950
It'll give you these names that you have to put in, and there's three different ones.

81
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,420
One.

82
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:37,830
You know this one, this one and this one where the Amazon see name records that need to be in there

83
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:46,410
so that Amazon can verify and verify your domain name so that it can begin sending email from that domain.

84
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:53,730
So continuing through the fluent SMTP help doc, here there's one more step moving out of the Amazon

85
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,990
sandbox.

86
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,680
You're starting out just in a sandbox where you can only receive email at that particular domain name,

87
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,220
and so you can watch these videos about moving out of the sandbox.

88
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:16,740
It really just takes filling out a certain form in Amazon and asking for a certain rate of sending.

89
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,190
And also a maximum number of emails per day.

90
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:29,640
And the way I have that setup at leverage WP is, you know, Amazon generally when I asked for a very

91
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:36,510
low number of emails say, you know, a thousand emails per day, and I had no idea with the rate at

92
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,720
first, you know, I asked for you and one email per second.

93
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,900
Anyway, it seems their default really.

94
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,450
Their lowest level is 50000 emails per day at a rate of 14 emails per second.

95
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:58,500
And so in subsequent applications, I've asked for those rates 14 emails per second, 50000 emails per

96
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,040
day and for 20 for a 24 hour period.

97
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:10,320
And in a day or so, you'll be you'll receive an email from Amazon MWC being approved for that amount.

98
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:21,330
And you can also ask for approval for larger amounts if you need to hear under my Amazon six dashboard,

99
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,240
you can see that under account dashboard here on the left.

100
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:32,670
Here are my sending limits at 50000 emails per 24 hour period and my maximum sentry at 14 emails per

101
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,120
second.

102
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,380
But here's the button where you can request a limit increase, and that just sends you to an Amazon

103
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:48,450
MWC form where you can just, you know, if you want to increase your sending quota, you can go ahead

104
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:55,830
and go ahead and come down here and click this button to request a quota increase.

105
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,300
And then, you know, it'll ask you what you want that to be.

106
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,340
And then you click the request button.

107
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:10,710
I've always received a reply within about a day when I ask for a sending quota of 50000 emails per 24

108
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,910
hour period and a maximum send rate of 14 emails per second.
