00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.920
In this lesson, we'll look at how registered domain names are pointed to Web sites servers.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.580
You'll learn how name servers point all traffic together and concede the DNS controls and records to

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.510
another location.

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.700
By the end of this video, you'll understand the common use of name servers and how they work using

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.890
a simple site ground hosting example.

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.510
Let's talk about domains and pointing them correctly to your website, hosting and ways to point traffic

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.940
for different purposes like email.

8
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.780
Separately, from the website traffic that you want to go to your website host looking at the, well,

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.430
average WP framework here.

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:48.210
This is where we are focusing right up here at the domain name and the DNS control here in this segment

11
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.000
and this section of the course when we say, start here, you know, make this a little bit bigger so

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.460
you guys can see it better when we say, start here.

13
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.650
The domain name is something that you register and rent.

14
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.740
Honestly, you don't own that, but you register it from a domain authority and a registrar.

15
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.460
And there are a lot of different registrars, some of whom are resellers and mark up their costs and

16
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.750
some who are more directly connected and give you at cost.

17
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.180
Domain names and domain names represent a name, plus an extension.

18
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.960
So in this example, you is the domain name and dot com is the extension, and dot com is, of course,

19
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.520
the most popular domain extension and is something that you should seek out as far as finding a domain

20
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.190
name for a business of yours or for clients.

21
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:58.200
It's best to recommend that you find the shortest domain that's easiest to spell at a dot com extension.

22
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.940
Now, there are appropriate reasons for using a different extension.

23
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.860
Something like dot net is pretty popular as well.

24
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.930
If the dot com extension is something that's already taken and you really need to have your business

25
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.160
name in a certain way.

26
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.400
You can settle for a different domain extension.

27
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.000
There are other vanity extensions like a Dot online or dot cloud.

28
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.920
Other domain extensions that are available, they cost a little bit more, and sometimes they're usable.

29
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.150
For example, in my business website for client web sites, I have a business company name called Up

30
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.870
Draft Media, and I got that name because I was able to find a domain at the Dot media extension.

31
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.760
My business name for collecting payments and and charging for website care and projects is up draft

32
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.930
dot media.

33
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.960
Now, that's not something that I would really use if it was a part of my branding, and I really needed

34
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:09.300
to be up draft media as a visible brand and recognizable brand that I would be marketing because people

35
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.450
would invariably try to navigate to up draft media dot, which is something that is a great domain name,

36
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.890
but not something that I own.

37
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.770
And so I settled for up draft media because it works for me, and I'm basically just sending links out

38
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.400
to clients.

39
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.270
At that point, but domain names wise, you can.

40
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.990
There are a number of different places to purchase and register domain names and then directly from

41
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.370
your registrar, you can point domain names right to the website.

42
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.700
Hosting went to the website hosting, I should say.

43
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.590
And there are two ways to point websites to a web host.

44
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:55.050
Now one is called name servers and name servers point directly to the website host, and they point

45
00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:03.270
all of the traffic and they transfer the DNS control to wherever you're pointing the name servers.

46
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:12.240
And so, for an example, in a simple, simple example, if we look at site ground account here.

47
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.510
If I were to look at the dashboard for this veil Sinochem site, it's one of my client sites.

48
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.930
You can see that I have a reference over here and recite information for the site, IP address and the

49
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.340
site name servers.

50
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:34.710
And so if I wanted to, if I registered that domain name somewhere like GoDaddy.com, for example,

51
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.960
I could just define at GoDaddy these name servers within the domain name settings and then all the traffic,

52
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:51.660
including email traffic, website traffic and everything would go to the site ground hosting area.

53
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.400
And in that case, and the DNS would be managed over here under domain DNS zone at.

54
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.910
Here at site ground, and so in that case, the DNS records and these are all here because this was

55
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:14.410
the original setup when I had, you know, Vale Sinochem registered at GoDaddy, where I've registered

56
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.030
domains a lot in the past.

57
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:24.040
I use name servers to point to site ground and then site ground defines the a record, for example,

58
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.280
which would point the domain name itself right here.

59
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:34.240
Here's the domain name under a name and it isn't a record, and it records always point to IP addresses.

60
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.400
And so this a record points to the IP address.

61
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:49.360
And then you can also form a C name record to point the UWW version over to that same address.

62
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.080
And in that way, sea name records go to domain names themselves.

63
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.340
And so this basically points to that same name.

64
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:06.100
If someone were to point their browser to UWW, that veil sidecar, then it would just redirect right

65
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.680
to Vail signed dot com without the WS.

66
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:16.900
And then the internet knows to bring that website traffic to this IP address, and this IP address is

67
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.670
managed by Sacrum, the website host, and it's defined right here.
