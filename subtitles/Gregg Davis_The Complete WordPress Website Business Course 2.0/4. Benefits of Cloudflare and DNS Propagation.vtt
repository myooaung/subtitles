00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.760
In this lesson, we'll continue the setup of the demo domain connecting the registrar to Cloudflare.

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.430
You'll learn the additional benefits that using Cloudflare brings and experience the waiting time that

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.970
sometimes necessary for DNS propagation across the internet.

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.210
By the end of this video, you'll understand that many reasons for using an outside DNS provider and

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.800
learn about DNS propagation.

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.750
Now, it hasn't alerted me yet that it is finished, and I'll just show you what happens when you click

7
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.340
check name servers.

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.400
If you want to do that, it's checking now.

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.340
It says wait a few hours for an update.

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.190
They'll let you click that check button and kind of initiate a new check every 24 hours or something

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.610
like that.

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.540
But like I said with GoDaddy, it tends to happen fairly quickly.

13
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:55.110
And the last thing I'll say as a part of this lesson is that if you do register your domain names with

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.190
Cloudflare, then you really don't have to do this.

15
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.660
Name server pointing from your domain registrar over to Cloudflare, because being that Cloudflare is

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.320
your domain registrar and also your DNS provider, they're already connected.

17
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.350
And so that again speeds up the traffic through your website.

18
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.630
And I'll just again pause the video and let you know when this has propagated and show you what can

19
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.270
be done then to set up the website and get started managing the DNS here at Cloudflare.

20
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.580
So it happened right away after I pause the video.

21
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.320
It says Greg Davis, Dot Club, has been added to Cloudflare over here in my email.

22
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.180
It says what my current name servers are those ones that are at Cloudflare CNN.com.

23
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.880
And now, if I refresh the page at Cloudflare, I should get a different message, which is great news.

24
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.060
Cloudflare is now protecting my site so automatically because I've run traffic with those name servers

25
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.770
to Cloudflare for this domain.

26
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:06.620
It's already doing some things, like using caching and using a sedan and other benefits, and even

27
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.980
doing things that I'll show you right here.

28
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.980
So it is setting me up with a web application firewall even in Cloudflare.

29
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:26.620
And so oftentimes, if log in traffic or attack traffic for distributed DDoS attacks comes through Cloudflare,

30
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.010
it knows how to block those before they ever reach your hosting or your web site.

31
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.320
A cordon is provided by the Cloudflare Free Service CD and stands for Content Delivery Network, which

32
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.070
means that your content that needs to load like images, for example, can load from different places

33
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.590
around the world, which Cloudflare owns.

34
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.840
And they provide those, you know, cached pages and images from different places around the world closest

35
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.550
to the person who's browsing.

36
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.940
And then there's, of course, instant DNS change results in Cloudflare.

37
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.890
They're so closely connected to the internet and the the DNS system in the internet that when you make

38
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.310
changes like adding an Amex record for an email account, for example, it happens instantly or changing

39
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.270
IP addresses.

40
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:29.870
If you migrate a website from one place to another or from one server to another, for example in your

41
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.020
grid paying account, if you clone a server or clone a website over to a new server, you can change

42
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.920
the DNS to that new IP address, and it will really propagate instantly across the entire internet.

43
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:52.850
And so let's go back back to the Cloudflare and the DNS for this domain name is now set up so that I

44
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.130
have an AA record and a C name record.

45
00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.720
This domain connect is from GoDaddy, no longer necessary, so I can delete that one.

46
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.710
And so this is pointing to this IP address, which was that GoDaddy IP address.

47
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.170
If you remember the let's see what's my my IP here?

48
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.920
Does it even say no?

49
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.180
In fact, it's just parked.

50
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.580
And so this the domain control dot com IP address is reflected here.

51
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:32.180
It's just not my server IP address at grid pain, but now that my Cloudflare account is ready and Cloudflare

52
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.470
is my DNS provider for this domain, now I can go over and complete that setup here for Greg Davis,

53
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.510
Dot Club at Grid Pain.

54
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.650
And so I'll show you here how easy it is just to add and build the website and just clicked building

55
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.310
right there.

56
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.480
Bill ad site.

57
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:58.820
And what it's doing is it's building the website here among all my other sites, and it will just take

58
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.420
a few minutes to install WordPress, install the software stack on the server that protects my site

59
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.480
and delivers my say super fast, as well as the caching, the staging if I wanted that available.

60
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.250
And there it is.

61
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.870
It's successfully updated.

62
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.930
It's also changing the DNS settings.

63
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.690
I'm getting these messages over here on the right side, so it's doing the initial build.

64
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.570
You know, it's putting the site up at the server.

65
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:35.660
The DNS integration is telling me that it's started now SSL, so it's beginning the to put the security

66
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.080
certificate on that domain for me here at grid pain.

67
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.410
And so as this goes through its process, I can wait until this is completely finished.

68
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:53.270
But even now, I can go to Greg Davis Dock Club and I can look at what's going on here, the security,

69
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.050
it says.

70
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.370
Site Greg Davis, Club Dot Club was successfully updated.

71
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:06.370
I can close this message, and I already have an active site here, so if we look at I didn't have a

72
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.240
wsf or a web application firewall set up yet here at grid pain.

73
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.030
But if I look under domains, I already have an active SSL certificate.

74
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:28.840
And so when I navigate to Greg Davis Dot Club, I should get to a Oh, it's still pointing to my GoDaddy

75
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.810
parking page right here.

76
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.990
I think the reason is you could see it's not secure over here.

77
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.980
I think the reason is the SSL certificate isn't quite finished propagating.

78
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:47.350
If I go to the DNS records, I've gotten some records that have been added and I know that grid pain

79
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.400
is still in the process of adding some different things.

80
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.210
Here we go.

81
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.780
It's it's the SSL certificate has been provisioned.

82
00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:04.480
Now it's reconfiguring my server, which is under Engine X. Now it's successfully updated its writing

83
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.380
the database.

84
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:12.760
It's completely rewriting all the records in the database to you to use HTTPS now at this domain.

85
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.130
And this is what I was looking for.

86
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.130
Thank you for your patience.

87
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:24.790
You can close this and the previous notifications, and that means that Greg Davis does club now.

88
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.780
I likely have an active website.

89
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.510
Let me just close that down.

90
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.690
Make sure I've got.

91
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.530
Um, let's see.

92
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.750
Oh, you know what I can check to?

93
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:46.560
Let me just go here and refresh the DNS records under Cloudflare, now 30 for one or two, I think.

94
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.990
But I want us to do this.

95
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.310
I want to change.

96
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.430
I want to copy this IP address for this domain name and my server over dedicated.

97
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.130
And I want to put that over here.

98
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.780
Edit that and point that to my server.

99
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.640
Click Save right there.

100
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:16.890
OK, so now I can be pretty sure that if I go to Greg Davis Dot Club, Oops, and I'll get a freshly

101
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.880
installed WordPress site.

102
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.660
Nope, not quite.

103
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:28.080
Now I can check by opening up the the Chrome developer tools and right clicking on the refresh and just

104
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.230
saying empty the cache and reload the page.

105
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:37.080
OK, so now I've got a little bit of an issue, so there's an unsupported protocol.

106
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.790
There's an SSL version that's out of whack or something.

107
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.730
Let's just go back to the DNS and look at SSL.

108
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.140
This sometimes can happen where it might be set on full or full.

109
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.360
Strict, full strict is the way to go.

110
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:58.650
And now we're still waiting for DNS to propagate across the entire internet, and so that can be an

111
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.680
issue sometimes when you switch to full.

112
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:09.610
And then maybe switch back to full strict, which is what really we want to be using when working with

113
00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:10.240
grid pain.

114
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:19.480
We could see if that opens, so it'll just take a few minutes for this to be a correct and without any

115
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.860
of these details.

116
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:27.460
And so when that happens, we can come back and see the website in the next lesson.
