1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,910
In this lesson, we'll explore some of the more than 50 divvy modules available in the divvy builder.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,840
You'll see how to customize several of the modules, including an image module and a couple number counter

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,930
modules, as well as see how a gradient can work in a section background to allow for an interesting,

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,320
overlapping image design by the end of this video.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,350
You'll see the power of the various modules to hold and design any kind of content you can imagine,

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,230
all within a visual interface using TV.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,790
Let's look a little bit deeper into the divvy modules in this next section.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,710
Now, if you remember from the outline the mind map for the TV theme and builder, the modules was one

9
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,170
of the largest and longest sections with the most items in there.

10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,560
These are all the different modules that are available in DV at this point.

11
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,670
All these modules do different things, and you can see by their titles what they are.

12
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,480
Now, we're not going to go through all of these individual modules because once you know how a module

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:17,070
works, it's easy to get in there and explore what it can do and what it's for and how to edit it using

14
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:24,810
those three tabs, the content design and advanced tabs inside of the editing window.

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,020
And so there's two categories of modules.

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,550
There is a full width module section that has just a few.

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,930
There's a four with map, four with header and menu and a slider module, as well as a portfolio module

18
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,170
that's designed to kind of break out of the box of the website and go full width.

19
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:54,060
It's a good way to design hero images and things like that, but a regular module, for example, you

20
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:01,380
know, an image module or even just using a section with a background image and just making that go

21
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:08,940
to the size of the full screen is another way to get a hero image or some content to stretch all the

22
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,950
way to the browser window.

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,120
And so I don't use the full width modules very much, but you may find them useful and quick for designing

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,710
headers or things like that.

25
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:27,450
But let's just take a look at some of the modules by going back into our layout and just look at a few

26
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,430
of the modules in the case study page here in your sample site in the sandbox.

27
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,080
And so let's click Enable Visual Builder and go in there and check out some of the modules.

28
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,280
Now I've showed you the text module and what that is all about.

29
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:55,020
And so as we go down a little bit further inside of this specialty section, there's a module here and

30
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,420
a module in each of these sections.

31
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,540
It's an image module.

32
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,710
And so I'm just going to click the Edit Section Edit button here for this image module.

33
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,380
And so it says image settings.

34
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,100
The image module is pretty self-explanatory.

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,380
You know, it's got a place to load an image.

36
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,710
There's a Settings panel, or if you just click the image, it will bring up a window that lets you

37
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:27,870
either upload a file to the media library or look at the media library and find an image for that area.

38
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,520
So there's the image module, and let's take a look at.

39
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,550
Let's take a look at some more down here.

40
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,730
Let's see what we have going on right down here.

41
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:47,330
This section, then we have I can see a row layout where it's outlined in the green and that rolling

42
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,640
out goes all the way down to where this green plus is.

43
00:03:51,570 --> 00:04:01,260
And then this one called the numbers is overlapping, and I can see that since this is a section and

44
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,280
the yellow comes up here, we can try to discover why that's set up or how that setup is there a negative

45
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:16,860
margin, maybe in the sections settings here that would be maybe under spacing.

46
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:25,710
So there's a there's some padding right there and that's padding on this section that's showing just

47
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,370
top and bottom padding for the content going in there.

48
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,490
So that's not really where that is overlapping.

49
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,770
Let's take a look at.

50
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,200
So this I see that this yellow might actually be part of the upper section.

51
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:48,720
Let's take a look at this section now and see design wise or actually under the content.

52
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,070
What what is the background?

53
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,880
There's not really anything as far as the background, but what about the columns?

54
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,460
The left column doesn't have any background, so you can hit this back button if you're editing a.

55
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,840
Column within a row.

56
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,570
That's something to know for sure.

57
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,310
How about this right hand column?

58
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,470
No, that's not there either.

59
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:15,980
So let's go back and I'll close this row layout, and let's see, let's look at this section layout

60
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,690
now, see what the background looks like.

61
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,120
OK, I can see what's going on here.

62
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:31,180
So this right here is a gradient, and that's how they got this background section to have mostly white

63
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,570
and then change into the yellow background just at the very bottom.

64
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:43,600
So it's a linear gradient at a direction of 180 degrees, which is up and down and a start position

65
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,470
of 80 percent and an end position of 80 percent.

66
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:56,830
And what that means is that that makes a solid line instead of a gradient where the percentage is,

67
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,420
you know, at a different spot and it gradually fades to the color.

68
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,210
These are the two gradient colors.

69
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,580
One is white, the next one is yellow.

70
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,520
So it's going from white to yellow.

71
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,800
It's going in the 180 degree direction, so it's going from top to bottom.

72
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,060
The start position is a percentage up or down.

73
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:25,930
And so if they are exactly the same, it starts in one spot and then it ends in the other spot in the

74
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,130
same spot, I should say.

75
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,650
Same percentage that makes a line in a particular place instead of a gradient.

76
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:40,210
So instead of using negative margin to bring a background color of a section up, what it's done is

77
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,680
just it's use an illusion by matching the background color from one section to the next and used the

78
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,380
gradient function in background.

79
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:57,640
So that's a really interesting design method that you can do without code and make some interesting

80
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:06,010
layouts like what what happens is it appears as if this image is overlapping the lower section.

81
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,360
But really, it's not.

82
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,220
This yellow is part of the upper section.

83
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,220
So that's a very interesting piece of design work there in Divij in this pre-made layout and this look

84
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,430
at these these modules that we have here.

85
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
It says the numbers.

86
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,790
Now this one is a bar counter module.

87
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:32,830
And so I don't know if you noticed, but if we refresh the page and then bring back this section here,

88
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,100
you'll see that the bar counter animates itself.

89
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,420
Oops.

90
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,990
I've got the visual builder open, and so it's not going to animate correctly.

91
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,820
Let me exit the visual builder here.

92
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,520
And then as we scroll down, you'll see that bar counter will animate there.

93
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:56,280
And if you if you caught that and as well this, there's no counter below animated as well.

94
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:02,670
And so see if I refresh the page here, you can see there's the bar counter and the number counter.

95
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,690
So let's take a look at these two modules enable the visual builder, and then I'll scroll down to that

96
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,280
section of the page.

97
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,350
And let's look at those no modules.

98
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:23,970
So the the bar counter, you know, when you add a new bar counter just gives you some options.

99
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,320
The text of it, the percentage, how much is it going to go up?

100
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:35,690
You know, maybe it goes up to 88 percent if there's a link to that bar itself, whether there's a background

101
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,110
or anything within that bar, you can do a lot of design for it.

102
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,060
The text title goes here.

103
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,080
This is the number of.

104
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,040
Something.

105
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:48,670
Hmm.

106
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,730
Now, of course, that's capitalized, right?

107
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,570
Where do you think that's found under design title text?

108
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,110
And there is title font style capitalized.

109
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,260
Right?

110
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,460
And so that's what that is back here under content.

111
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,660
That's where you would put it in a new a new bar counter.

112
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,470
Let's go ahead and get rid of that one for these as well.

113
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,810
You know the elements that you want to show, do you want to show the percentage or not?

114
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,560
And that's just making it a little bit big.

115
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,720
The percent there in the title instead of just showing without.

116
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,650
Is that right?

117
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,510
I'm not sure what that elements.

118
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,910
What's changing there?

119
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,940
Oh, conversion rate 90 percent, right?

120
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,330
So that's actually in the text title itself.

121
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,270
And then under design for this particular bar.

122
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:55,750
Anyway, let's go back, we're doing the the module settings right here showing the percentage.

123
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,300
Oh, I don't know what that is.

124
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,610
Anyway, there's a lot of things you can discover here and then if there's a background in the entire

125
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,990
module itself.

126
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,630
But design wise, you know what, text, what the text would look like.

127
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,140
The bar design here as far as the background color.

128
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:21,320
In the entire settings and then all the other different settings that we went over before, also the

129
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,280
advanced settings in terms of the seaside etc position, scroll effects or transitions, this would

130
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:36,500
be like if it comes behind an object that's next to it or not, etc. And so that's the bar counter.

131
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,510
There's so many settings to play with.

132
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Each of these is a number counter.

133
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,460
And so again, it animates the counting up from zero.

134
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:55,460
And then there's different things that you can that you can actually control like, you know, the the

135
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:02,990
spacing, the text size, the color, the alignment, the font, all of these things are available.

136
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:11,510
And as far as that and what elements are shown, whether the sign is shown or not in there, whether

137
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,500
there's a link, a background ET.

138
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,420
And so like I said, I'm not going to show you all of the modules that are available in DV because there

139
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,320
are so many.

140
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,070
But you can discover a lot about them by inspecting some of these pre-made layouts as well as trying

141
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,970
them out yourself.

142
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:35,510
Now this one's interesting if to put an embedded video in a DV page.

143
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:44,960
There's a really nice default layout in the video module where you know it has this hover overlay,

144
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,260
a nice play button and then a customized image.

145
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:56,540
No matter whether you're, you know, you might be just bringing in a video from a URL like this one

146
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:03,770
is you can just put the YouTube URL right in here and it will place that video in.

147
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,840
So, for example, I'm not going to pull one in right now, but you get what I mean.

148
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,390
If.

149
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:20,620
Let me just go back out of that, you can use a webcam file on your website or you can use a video actually

150
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,830
coming from the media library, which is not recommended if you want to put, you know, video on your

151
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,380
website.

152
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:34,600
You should actually hosted at YouTube or Vimeo Wistia, someplace that can host your video for you instead

153
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,160
of having it come from your web site.

154
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,210
But then there's different things like the overlay, whether that's an image and overlay image, you

155
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,400
can generate it from the video or not.

156
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:52,540
You can use, you know, a background if you want to and then choose the video itself.

157
00:12:52,870 --> 00:13:00,730
As far as the design, you can choose the different play icon and what that size might be.

158
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,400
You know, you could bring that video play icon larger or smaller.

159
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:13,810
There's just a lot of design options the overlay options, for example, for that roll over.

160
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:20,980
You know what, if I wanted to actually go, you know, oof, yellow now that that went all the way

161
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,180
to a solid yellow.

162
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:30,400
But if I edit that and then bring the opacity down now, I could do a yellow overlay in that video instead

163
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,420
of a gray.

164
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,210
And that's interesting and matches the website.

165
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:41,260
And so that's a good overview of some of the modules that are available in DV.

166
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,120
There are so many more, but that will give us a good start.

167
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:53,260
And as we modify and create more websites in DeFi, as the course goes on, we'll be exploring more

168
00:13:53,260 --> 00:14:00,700
of these modules and what they do and how we can leverage them in order to build unique websites quickly

169
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,630
and easily.
