00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.910
In this lesson, we'll set up a free 60 day trial account with flywheel hosting and install a WordPress

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.990
demo site in preparation for learning the free version of Cadence theme.

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.330
You'll sign up and verify your account at the managed WordPress host and see how it's super easy to

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.880
create a demo site by the end of this video.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.490
You'll have experience setting up a fresh installation of WordPress at a temporary domain ready to practice

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.860
with.

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.230
Take live or pass on to a client to get started installing and working with the free cadence theme and

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.260
the cadence blocks plug in at WordPress.

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.060
The first thing I want you guys to do is to go get your free flywheel hosting account for 60 days that

10
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.080
they've offered us in this course.

11
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.020
Now go to students dot WP Dev Course, dot com and there's a resources page.

12
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.110
Now it might look a little different than what you see here in the video, but you'll be looking for

13
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.350
the link to the Flywheel student hosting.

14
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.160
And if you click that link, you'll be brought to a flywheel sign up page that has my course, logo,

15
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.390
et cetera, up at the top.

16
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.380
And you just need to sign up with your name, username and password and an email address and you can

17
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.610
create an account.

18
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:25.740
Now, when we do this, it might show up as a 14 day account because this is normally what Flywheel

19
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.420
offers new users when they first start out as long as they verified their account.

20
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.460
But before they've included a payment method or anything like that, you're allowed to set up a demo

21
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.480
account and set up one WordPress site for free for 14 days.

22
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.740
But we have a special deal with Flywheel for members of the course.

23
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.630
Congratulations, you get 60 days to play with a free site of your own at Flywheel.

24
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.120
And so I'm just going to, woops, I'm just going to choose a password.

25
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.180
And then put a correct email address.

26
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.910
Because you can use that for account verification, as well as SMIC's SMS text to verify your account.

27
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.870
So you just click the agree checkbox and click Create Account, and then Flywheel will bring you to

28
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.100
their welcome page.

29
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.450
And really, all you need to do is click Create a new site right here, or you can click around and

30
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.630
see what other things that they have on offer.

31
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.120
Flywheel is a great managed WordPress host that has a really easy to use interface.

32
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.320
Very quick, and you get this 60 days free.

33
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.000
And so one thing you can do under your at the top right here is either click new site or create a new

34
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.720
site here.

35
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.510
And what I'd recommend that you do is instead of going through and choosing the owner of the site and

36
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.950
creating a plan.

37
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.910
Go over to the right side and click Create a demo site.

38
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.160
It's a demo site that we're setting up so that we don't have to enter any payment information right

39
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.460
now.

40
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.900
Now they do require that you verify your account, that you're a real person before they'll let you

41
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.690
create a free demo site on their hosting platform.

42
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.200
And so without having to put it in any credit card information, you can use text message to verify

43
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.980
your account here.

44
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.720
You'll also receive an email that's a welcome to fly will fly.

45
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.970
We'll email, and I'm looking over at my email program here, and I see that there's a button where

46
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.010
I can verify my account by clicking that button in my email.

47
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.410
And so it's just taking me to the Verify account page like I was on before.

48
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.150
And so you'll want to use text message to verify your account if you have a little trouble with the

49
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.700
country code dropdown.

50
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.640
I had to go just now on my cell phone and navigate to the website and sign in.

51
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.060
And then I was able to verify my account via text message.

52
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.800
And now it's verified.

53
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.540
So once you verify your account, this will be the next page you get to when you want to create a demo

54
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.380
site and you can see free for 14 days right here.

55
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.590
But signing up with our special link will give us 60 days, and you'll see that reflected once we create

56
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.180
our site right in here.

57
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.110
And so you could see you get zero of one demo sites used so far.

58
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.170
And then I'm just going to create a site.

59
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.360
I'm going to call it Greg Davis cadence.

60
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.770
And let's see, I'll just go get cadence 13.

61
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.560
Because that was the email address that I used.

62
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:48.010
And you can select a data center and then select a username and password that you'll remember and confirm

63
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.670
the password.

64
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.590
Right and right, and then you click Create demo site.

65
00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.260
If your passwords match and everything, it's going to give you a little flywheel here spinning and

66
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.040
it'll say it's being created usually takes about five minutes and they'll send an email to let you know

67
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.470
when it's ready.

68
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.620
So I'll pause the video here and you should go in and do the same.

69
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.570
Create yourself a demo site and then I'll show you around Flywheel a little bit and we'll open up the

70
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.920
demo site and install cadence and get started customizing a new website.

71
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.250
OK, and so that only took about one minute, and I got an email that says, Your site is ready and

72
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.940
it tells me the temporary domain and the WP admin dashboard URL as well.

73
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.680
And it tells me what my username is, and there's a button over there that says View Site.

74
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:46.040
Now if we go back here, this is what opened up inside of the flywheel dashboard.

75
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.000
And you can see now up at the top left is this little orange banner that says 60 days left of this demo

76
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.450
site.

77
00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.800
And you know they prevent you from taking the site live until you've set up billing information or transferred

78
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.140
the billing to a client or something like that.

79
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.590
The way they do that is down here at the bottom right.

80
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:14.630
They force you to have privacy mode on which basically is HTTP authentication, meaning if you try to

81
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:21.140
browse to your website or to the dashboard, you have to put in a username and password in order to

82
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.820
open it up.

83
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.900
And that's where you find that on the main page of your demo site right here.

84
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.390
And so there's also a link right up here to the demo site itself.

85
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.150
And another thing that you can do, which is a good idea, right when you first start out, is to go

86
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:45.020
and click Enable SSL, and that puts in an SSL certificate on the site so that you don't get any kind

87
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.380
of a browser warning or anything while you're working with your temporary URL and building your site.

88
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.950
And so I'm going to just click Enable SSL, and now I get a welcome message.

89
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.590
Your SSL has been enabled.

90
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.450
I can close that little banner if I want to, and I can see some information about the domain name right

91
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:11.780
here on the Flywheel Dashboard, and that just shows me the little green lock symbol.

92
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:22.700
And so what I'll do now is just click the the site itself, and here's where you can see the HTTP authentication

93
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.390
in place.

94
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:33.170
The username is always flywheel, and then there's an easy to remember password delightful parade with

95
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.550
a hyphen down here.

96
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.610
So I'll type that in.

97
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:49.020
And now that prevents, you know, the search engine parts or any people from going in to see the site

98
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:54.690
or the dashboard, if you're not already logged in with HTP authentication like that.

99
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:03.060
And so you could see a familiar 2022 theme, the home page just has the latest posts, and it's just

100
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:08.950
a default installation of WordPress that we can easily work with to set up a practice site.

101
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:14.010
So I'll go back into the Flywheel dashboard and over here.

102
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.250
There's also a WP admin button.

103
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:22.650
If you click that, that will open up your site in another tab in the WordPress dashboard.

104
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:28.290
Of course, like we did before, I'll dismiss the welcome message and then I'm ready to go.

105
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:36.930
So now if you set that up, you've got a nice, free practice site to work with on the very fast flywheel

106
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.040
hosting program.

107
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.910
And let's get started next, installing cadence and the cadence blocks plug in and I'll show you around

108
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.300
how to customize the site and bring in starter templates to start from.

109
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.190
And it'll be exciting.

110
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:50.550
Let's go.
