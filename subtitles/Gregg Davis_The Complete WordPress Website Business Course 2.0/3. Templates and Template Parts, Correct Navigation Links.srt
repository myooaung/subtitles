1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,430
In this lesson, we'll check out the Frost themed templates and revert the template parts for the header

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,440
and footer to correct the layout.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,710
You'll also convert the navigation links to individual URLs like we did with twenty twenty two and correct

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,110
the addresses so they point to your site instead of the Frost demo site and add the site logo to the

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,860
header as well.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,510
By the end of this video, you'll learn what changes you might need to make when importing content from

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,040
one state to another and fix the differences between the demo site and your own.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:37,220
So let's go back to the WordPress dashboard, and we'll take a look under appearance editor.

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:45,170
And just like in the 20 22 theme, we'll be able to take a look at the different templates that are

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:52,520
in use and what they're how they're set up by default after we've imported the content into the site.

11
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,810
As I mentioned in the last lesson, let's go ahead and start with looking at the navigation menu and

12
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,320
changing it to have the correct links.

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,850
You also notice a difference here.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,360
With that, we're looking at the the site editor template and a couple of things.

15
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:18,680
The navigation menu is on the far right, whereas when we first imported it, there's no logo and it's

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,340
on the left side here.

17
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,090
So right here you can see that there's a dotted line where the site logo should go.

18
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:33,780
And there's also a dropdown here which shows that this template, the site template, has no title.

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,470
So let's just leave it alone for now.

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,020
Let's go ahead and just look at templates.

21
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:46,850
So there's a template called no title that has been added by the theme, as well as a few other sitewide

22
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,660
templates here.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,690
Not quite as many as are included in Twenty Twenty.

24
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:58,850
But Frost the frost theme is still under development, and you'll probably see more as time goes on

25
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,060
here.

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,220
And then let's look at template parts.

27
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,030
So there's a footer and there's a header, and I can see there's a little blue dot here, as we saw

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,130
in the 2022 theme.

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,720
It says this template has been customized, so I might suggest that we just go and go back to the three

30
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:24,560
dots and clear the customizations to revert this template part back to the default setting.

31
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:31,820
Now, after doing that, if we go back into our site right here and click Refresh, you can see that

32
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,710
something has changed now.

33
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:41,240
It does have the site title at the top left, no logo, but also there are a number of menu items here

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,220
and they are over to the right hand side and then down in the footer.

35
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,470
You can see what this looks like here.

36
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,720
I just noticed that the template part has also been quote unquote altered.

37
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,730
So let's go back to the original.

38
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:04,190
OK, so that is reverted back to the way that it comes in.

39
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:12,650
Now, of course, these are basically just like in 2020 to I'll bet this is showing all the pages on

40
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:19,460
the site and even the sample page that's included that we would want to maybe put in the trash there.

41
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,090
So let's just go ahead and let's look at the templates.

42
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:32,630
And again, if we go to tight, no title, this just has post content there.

43
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,330
And so let's go ahead and go back to.

44
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:47,440
Template parts, and let's edit this header template that was our purpose anyway, so here's the header

45
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,260
template part, and it's got this navigation here.

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,060
Let's look at the list view, as we did before and as 2020 two.

47
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:01,360
It's got, you know, nav a navigation block can open the settings over here, too on the right hand

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,420
side, as well as it's just a page list.

49
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:13,060
And so if we if we want to edit this without changing anything else, let's see what happens if we just

50
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,420
have navigation selected and then we start hitting the plus sign.

51
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,200
So let's see the there's a sample page.

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,130
Contact us.

53
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,500
Hello, world.

54
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,680
So there's a few in the sample site.

55
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:37,810
Let's go look back at the Frost WP sample site that we'll just match, at least to start with what this

56
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,370
looks like here.

57
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,260
So start here is the home page.

58
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,550
So we've got start here, our services, and so I'll just start typing start.

59
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,020
Here it is.

60
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,040
Start here and you can see it's added it here.

61
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,200
If I want to, I can just get rid of this page list to get it out of our way.

62
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,990
And so click Navigation.

63
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,290
And again, oops.

64
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,520
You have to get that plus sign.

65
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,930
And the next one was called our services.

66
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,200
Start typing it, there we go again, click the navigation.

67
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,220
Maybe click away from there, click now.

68
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:29,810
Oops.

69
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,230
So that's in the way.

70
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,550
If I could click navigation.

71
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,460
No, but I really want to do is.

72
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,550
I need to find that little plus button there, don't I?

73
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,150
Oh.

74
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,690
You go.

75
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,190
It's hard to find that little plus button.

76
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,110
Let's open the list to you, OK?

77
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,280
We have those two.

78
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,090
Hmm.

79
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,710
I wonder if I pull this over here, maybe if I move it over.

80
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,950
I just need to find that little plus button.

81
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,430
This is an interesting issue.

82
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,540
I could select menus.

83
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,030
There's header navigation.

84
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,010
That's a good way to do it.

85
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,080
Let me bring this back out.

86
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,220
Oops!

87
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,410
I'm going back out to full screen.

88
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,140
All right, so it added the header navigation instead of doing it a page at a time.

89
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:45,190
What I did was I selected it, selected navigation here, and then I click select menu and I chose header

90
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:45,950
navigation.

91
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,060
And so that put the navigation in there.

92
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,320
Now I can click Save.

93
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,890
And yeah, I'm going to save the header and the navigation menu.

94
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,390
Click Save there.

95
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,030
And now let's look at our own site.

96
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,620
And refresh the page.

97
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:01,730
Great.

98
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,540
Now.

99
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,150
It clear that it did bring in the wrong links in there, but it does look right.

100
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,180
Isn't that right?

101
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,580
So let's do this.

102
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:19,030
We'll take the address and copy it, so let's select the whole thing.

103
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,130
Hit controls, see?

104
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,970
And now let's edit each one of these.

105
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:30,370
So the home page link here, just while start here is selected, you can click the link.

106
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,860
Hit edit and instead of frost of up.

107
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,940
We'll click the address of your sandbox site, then you can hit enter or click the little arrow there.

108
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,460
Let's go through and now on our services a little bit different.

109
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,460
Click the link, click the edit button.

110
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,370
Now you want to go ahead and leave the services you URL name, which is the name of the page there,

111
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,980
and leave the slash.

112
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,000
Also, because I didn't copy the the forward slash.

113
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:08,670
So if I had paste right there, you can see that that shows, oh, it did put the slash in.

114
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,060
So you want to erase the slash two slashes won't work.

115
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,100
And so there's services.

116
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,990
Let's go to service plans.

117
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,790
Hit the link button.

118
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,080
Hit the edit button.

119
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,610
Let's take these.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,060
The forward slash out from before plans and hit paste.

121
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:26,730
There we go.

122
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,470
And hit the little arrow to add it.

123
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,550
Design blog, which is putting the correct URL in each one of these.

124
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,740
It's just slash blog.

125
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,290
And one last one gets started.

126
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,430
There's the link.

127
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,800
Here, edit, erase the forward slash before contact paste.

128
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,100
And click.

129
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,180
That's great.

130
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:57,590
Now let me just point out, while we're here, you can see with this get started navigation link block,

131
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,790
it's called a custom link.

132
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,670
There's some styles that are included in Frost, and this is one of the benefits of frost that they've

133
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,460
brought in some really interesting styles that you can use that are really well-designed.

134
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,490
So this one's a fiddle style, so there's default fill.

135
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:20,120
You could change it to just an outline or fill with white or outline with white.

136
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:27,320
But let's just use the fill and let's click Save because we're saving that header navigation template

137
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,740
part.

138
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:34,640
And now so when we go back and refresh the page on our site, you can see that each of these goes to

139
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,890
the pages of our own website.

140
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,360
Great.

141
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,600
And now let's go ahead and put the logo in here.

142
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,470
If if I go back, let's see.

143
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,330
Let's just go back to the templates.

144
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,550
Now there's no title template.

145
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,100
You can see that it's OK, it's showing here.

146
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,310
What we want to do is add the site logo.

147
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,690
So let's see if we go to template parts and go to edit header again.

148
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,600
Let's see what we might be able to add here.

149
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,440
So there's a row.

150
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,150
Here's the site title.

151
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,740
Maybe I'll click this row, and what I want to add is a logo.

152
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,400
So let's add the site logo right here.

153
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,210
Now it added a site logo down below.

154
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,020
And let's see what it looks like in the list view.

155
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,820
Yes, site logo way down here.

156
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,340
So, you know, I could hit this up arrow.

157
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:37,470
You bring that up above, or I could use this drag and put it right next to before or after the site

158
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,280
title whips.

159
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,220
Now I've got it before the site title.

160
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,710
Looking at my options here, what's.

161
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,620
So the site like logo now is to the left.

162
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Let's actually just add it in the media library.

163
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,680
Frost is the site logo.

164
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,760
Let's select that and now it brings it in in a nice size.

165
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,110
Right?

166
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:06,430
So let's go ahead and remove the site title now, and that's going to make it look right.

167
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:14,110
So a click, save and save again to save this template and the template parts and close this down and

168
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,330
click away and you can see what it looks like.

169
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:16,900
All right.

170
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,890
Let's go back here.

171
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,510
Refresh the page.

172
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:29,440
Now we've we've modified the navigation links and the logo, so it's clickable to the home page and

173
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,320
start here goes to the home page as well.

174
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,130
Great.
