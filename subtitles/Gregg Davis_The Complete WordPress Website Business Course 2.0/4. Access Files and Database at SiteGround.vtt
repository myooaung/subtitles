00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.880
In this lesson, I'll show you how an included file manager is convenient for accessing files at safe

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.500
ground and other shared hosts.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.530
You'll also learn how to access the database using the common phpMyAdmin program.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.350
By the end of this video, you'll understand how to access the files and database when the host provides

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.360
direct access to those resources.

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.540
Let's look at another resource for accessing the files.

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.690
I know that we've already looked at local and accessing the files just within our file explorer on the

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.600
computer, or it would be the finder on a Mac.

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.830
But if you're using a shared host or a host that has its own control panel, you might have a file manager

10
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.420
utility that you'll be able to use.

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.560
Let's look at the Vale Sinochem website that I showed in a previous section and look at the site ground

12
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.460
tools for accessing both the files and the database.

13
00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.660
And so here I've got the site tools open for this website, and if we look under site, the first option

14
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.860
is file manager.

15
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.620
And this is a utility that makes it easy to access your files just as easily as if as if they were on

16
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.670
your own computer.

17
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.570
You don't have to download an FTP program in order to access the files.

18
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.420
Unlike some other, more advanced hosts.

19
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:25.080
And so if you just look here generally on website hosting, you'll have a public HTML or a folder called

20
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.040
public or call the HTML that houses the folders and files for the website.

21
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.380
And as you can see under public HTML, we've got three folders.

22
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.780
Here's an extra one called CGI bin.

23
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.480
You'll often have that you don't really necessarily need to deal with on your server, but inside the

24
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.990
file manager here we've got the three folders that WordPress uses, and we've got the other files here.

25
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.420
For example, here's the WP config dot file.

26
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.260
Now, if I were to click that and then I could click the edit button.

27
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.650
That's where I can go in and I could look at the database credentials for this.

28
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:17.280
And so we'll look at how we access the database manager called up my admin in order to do any database

29
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.290
changes here through the hosting company.

30
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.120
But you can access the WP config file right here, and this is where you would be accessing it.

31
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.400
So I could just click back in the breadcrumbs here to go back, Oh, I can close all the tabs.

32
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.230
There we go and back to the files here, and then we have these folders.

33
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.780
So if you needed to troubleshoot something at this host or a website at this host, you could go into

34
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.400
double WP content and I double click that and then I've got a folder called plug ins and you can see

35
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.800
what plugins I have installed.

36
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.070
And so, yeah, you can see I have a few plug ins here.

37
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.220
If I wasn't sure which one was causing the conflict, what I might do is just go in and rename each

38
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.300
of these plug ins.

39
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.680
One at a time in between going back to the website and seeing which one makes the website work again.

40
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.090
If you wanted to see if it was a plugin conflict at all.

41
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.120
You could even go into WP content and you can rename the plugins folder itself.

42
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.420
The result of that would be that you would deactivate all the plugins on the entire website and you

43
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.630
know, if the website's down anyway, it's not a bad idea to to try and figure out narrow down what

44
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.250
the cause of the problem might be.

45
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.070
So that's where you can access files in site ground or a similar shared host.

46
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.310
It has a control panel.

47
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.990
A lot of times something called cPanel that stands for control panel and also under the site tab.

48
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.480
Here on the left side, we also have my sequel.

49
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.060
Now, if you remember from the beginning of this section, my sequel is the type of database that we're

50
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.600
using for WordPress and under databases.

51
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.220
We've checked this out in the hosting section, but under phpMyAdmin, you can see that there's just

52
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.550
a an orange button that says Access phpMyAdmin, and by clicking that what it'll do is open a tab in

53
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.320
your browser and it will show you all the databases that are associated with this website.

54
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:25.140
Generally, you'll have one database associated with each website unless you have multiple WordPress

55
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.910
installations, you know, installed at subdirectories or something like that, which isn't very common.

56
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.750
But if you click the name of the database, you can see that I've got tables here, and it's more than

57
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.120
just a standard installation.

58
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.920
I have the I themes security plugin enabled, which does create these.

59
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.190
It's like database tables.

60
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.330
And so those are extra tables, but you can see all the traditional tables here.

61
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.470
There's the WP posts where the content of the posts and pages would be.

62
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.970
There's the user's table right here and you can see that.

63
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.250
It's using a different table prefix.

64
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.420
Remember, when we inspected the WP config file, we were looking at the table prefix, which by default

65
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.830
is WP underscore.

66
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.490
And oftentimes, when your host installs WordPress for you, it will choose a random string of numbers

67
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.510
or letters to use as the table prefix just to make it more secure.

68
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.790
And so all the same things that are here, if you were going to manage the user accounts and potentially

69
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:34.960
go in and want to edit or add or change the password of an existing user, you could do that right here.

70
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:42.510
It works very similarly to the admin or database manager that works with the local, but phpMyAdmin

71
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.980
just looks a little bit different.

72
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.040
You can use the edit button.

73
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.630
Here's my user account use the edit button.

74
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:57.150
For example, if I were going to change the password right here again, it's using the MD5 hash, and

75
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.870
so it's under the function dropdown where you would place your new password here and then you would

76
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:15.030
select MD5 in in the dropdown right here and then go back to down to the bottom and click Go or go right

77
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.420
here.

78
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:22.710
And that would save say it would save your changes and then you would be making those changes at the

79
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.400
database.

80
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:32.610
And so that gives you an idea of how to access the database and how to access the files in a site,

81
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.320
ground host or similar.

82
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.590
It's really convenient that it gives you a file manager.

83
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.790
And now we're going to talk about FTP in the next lesson.

84
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:50.370
FTP accounts are another way to access the files on a hosting server, and an FTP program is something

85
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:57.090
that you need to install on your computer and then use the credentials that you create when you create

86
00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.440
a new FTP account.

87
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:06.450
FTP credentials are a hostname, along with likely a port number that you're supposed to use, as well

88
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.490
as an account name and a password.

89
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.830
Again, it's different from the WordPress username and password, and it's different from the database,

90
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.810
user username and password.

91
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.050
And so FTP stands for file transfer protocol.

92
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:25.530
It's just a way that you can access the files and you can download from there and upload to the server.

93
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.900
New files, if you need to do that.

94
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:35.250
And so in the next lesson, we'll check out how to access files at both flywheel and at grid pain.

95
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:41.640
Some more advanced hosts that we've talked about in the last section that don't have a file manager

96
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.880
built in, but they require you to use FTP if you do want to access the files at the server.
