00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,940
In this lesson, we'll explore how you can develop or migrate a WordPress Web site at a live host before

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,840
the DNS is pointing to the domain.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,740
This time on a Mac, you'll learn how to edit the hosts file with the terminal and the nano program

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,260
on your Apple computer to fool the browser into thinking the domain is live at your server's IP address.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,930
By the end of this video, you'll understand how you can set up a working site behind the scenes using

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,580
the terminal on Mac OS and then point the domain with DNS after you're finished.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,730
So let's look at how to edit the hosts file on the Mac.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,760
Just like we did on Windows before, it's just a little bit different if we look at this.

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,120
I'm using Chrome on my Mac now and I've navigated to my test domain BCom, and you can see that it's

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,250
at a different website.

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,840
It's looks like they've got this for sale.

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,520
It's at a web developer website called Web Development XCOM.

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,760
And so what you need to do is use the terminal on a Mac computer.

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,820
And if you're not used to using it or don't have it down on your toolbar, you can just hit command

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,570
spacebar and open up the spotlight search and look for terminal.

16
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,770
And so I'll just hit enter when it's highlighted.

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:22,440
And now we have just a code terminal in order to execute commands to the Mac operating system.

18
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,700
And so one thing you have to do is know which code it is.

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,290
And I just have a note here on my other computer about how to do it so that I can remember.

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,020
But what you do is you type a few commands.

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,040
One is a pseudo studio space.

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,570
Nano Nano is the program we'll be using and then another space.

23
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,970
And then you go slash ETSI and slash hosts.

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,820
Now that might look familiar.

25
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,530
That's the same location that it was on the Windows operating system, the ETSI folder and then the

26
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,430
hosts file.

27
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,150
So I'll hit return and ask me for my password for this computer.

28
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,910
My user account on my computer.

29
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,530
And it won't show in the terminal while you're typing it, but you have to type it in and then hit return.

30
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,680
And if you've done that successfully, it will show the file at the top in the black highlighting.

31
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:25,450
And this is a program called Nano two oh six and it really can't use your mouse very much, but you

32
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,790
really use the keyboard to put the cursor where you need to.

33
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,660
And so now that I'm editing this file, it's kind of the same as the Windows one.

34
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,990
You can see the local commands that are in here, some of the ones that I've created at the top here.

35
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:48,400
So I'm just going to go down below the normal kind of default header inside of the terminal here.

36
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,380
Put a couple of spaces in here and make some space for myself.

37
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,800
And so now I need to know the IP address and the domain name that I want to use.

38
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:10,210
So I do have to go into grid pane and let's go to my my grid pain control panel and I will have to log

39
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:16,360
in here so that I can get that correct IP address and I can either take a look at it.

40
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,880
I can do it right here under servers.

41
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:27,400
I could copy it because the terminal will allow you to paste for wherever the wherever the cursor is.

42
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,950
So go down to the bottom here and click terminal again.

43
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:38,890
OK, so wherever my cursor is, I'm going to hit Command V for paste and then I'll put a space and then

44
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,150
I need to type the domain that I want, which is my test domain dot com.

45
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,400
I want to make sure you spell out exactly correctly.

46
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,290
And then again, you can use the hash mark and make a note for where this is.

47
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm just going to say it points to four good pin Payne and Mitovich server, and once you have that

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,620
in there, the commands are here at the bottom for this nano program.

49
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,410
And so the one two things you need to do is command.

50
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:18,280
Oh, and that's to write out, you know, write out the the file, the changes that you've made here.

51
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,780
It's command.

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,080
Oh, and it's actually control.

53
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,240
Oh, I should say not command on the Mac.

54
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,410
So you hit control.

55
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,040
Oh, and then just to exit, you just hit.

56
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,170
You have to hit enter after doing controller and to exit, you just hit control x.

57
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,910
And so I'm going to do that right now.

58
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,990
I'm going to hit control.

59
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:45,100
Oh, and it says its file name to write slash ETSI slash hosts, and I'll just hit return.

60
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,220
And then it tells me that it wrote some lines.

61
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,730
It wrote 46 lines.

62
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,220
Those are the total number of lines here inside of the hosts file.

63
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:01,930
And then if I want to inside the terminal here, I can just hit Control X that will exit the nano program.

64
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,650
And now I'm back where I started with the terminal open.

65
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,710
You can go ahead and hit command queue for quit or just go up and you know, you can just go up to a

66
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,420
terminal and say, quit terminal.

67
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,960
But now when I go to my test Dominican, I'll just close the tab out of Chrome.

68
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,830
Maybe just in case the the browser cache would show me the old page, I'll go to my.

69
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,680
Test.

70
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,780
Oops!

71
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,540
No space.

72
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,490
My test domain.

73
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,460
And let's let's see where it goes.

74
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,680
Excellent.

75
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,470
So there's the site that I just installed using my Windows computer.

76
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,110
And so it looks like it's working.

77
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:51,990
And as I said before, if you, you know, everything should be working as if this domain was actually

78
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,520
hosted at that IP address.

79
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,620
And we know that it's not, but I can log in if I want to and develop the site.

80
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:05,260
Behind the scenes before the DNS is pointed for this domain to the correct server.

81
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,270
And so it's a great way to either migrate sites, update sites or do a site redesign at a new server

82
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,910
behind the scenes without having any downtime.
