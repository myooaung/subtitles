00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.330
In this lesson, we'll import the Jason file downloaded from the Disney blog into a global template

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.880
area to replace the default header of the site.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.660
You'll also check out the design of the transparent and partially sticky header, including the negative

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.310
margin that brings the call to action button up to overlap the top bar.

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.220
We'll also explore how to use a conditional element to make the button disappear for logged in users

6
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.780
by the end of this video.

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.300
You'll know how to import a header template into the DV theme builder and check out some of the advanced

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.420
design used in the transparent and sticky header.

9
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.590
Now, if you remember from the last section when we were looking at customizing the header and the menus

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.260
under the customizer header and navigation here, we're going to totally change this header by importing

11
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.350
that header that we got from the blog post here.

12
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.860
I don't know if you went through and looked at how that blog post was created, but quite a lot of steps

13
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.000
can be avoided here by going ahead and importing that.

14
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.730
And here's a challenge for you because we did go over this process just quickly.

15
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.730
And one of the lessons in the last section if you want to give it a try yourself before I show you how.

16
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:27.300
Go ahead and import that JSON file that we downloaded in the last lesson into the theme builder as a

17
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.270
customized header and make it a global header and save those changes to your website.

18
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.010
If you'd like, pause the video and make that a challenge, and I'll show you in just a moment how I

19
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.970
would go about doing that.

20
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.810
OK, well, I know I have this file right here in my downloads folder, and so I'll just go into the

21
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.810
I don't want to make any changes in the customizer here, but where I want to go to import that header

22
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.700
layout as a global header is here under Divij theme builder.

23
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.820
Now, this theme builder is where we can manage global headers.

24
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.600
Global body areas and global footers.

25
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.410
And different theme elements that might be called templates that we can choose to place on either all

26
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.440
pages of the website or only particular pages.

27
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.620
And we're going to explore custom templates and headers and footers now in the next few sections and

28
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.920
lessons of this devi part of the course.

29
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.790
You just need to go up here to the portability icon, which is the up and down Arrow Cookie Import tab

30
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.370
and click to choose a file.

31
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.880
Go to that JSON file that you downloaded and click open and leave all the defaults right here for now

32
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.860
and click the import button that'll give you the green checkmark.

33
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.260
And now this green global header area is here and labeled default web site template.

34
00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.870
Now, when you save changes here at the top that will place that design in and replace the header,

35
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.760
that is the default header that comes with Divij that we've been playing with previously.

36
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:15.100
So if you go to your website and refresh the page now you've got a nice header that has a logo, has

37
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:24.070
a call to action button is transparent so that the bottom row here, which is the main menu, is transparent.

38
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.500
And then there's a black line at the top here as you scroll, it turns white with the lettering turning

39
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:37.600
into black and then the contents of the page sliding underneath that fixed or sticky menu item.

40
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.260
So let's check out what this custom header is comprised of inside of the page editor.

41
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.870
So now that you have this global header here inside of the theme builder, you can go ahead and click

42
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.900
the little pencil icon to open up an editor, and you can see you'll have this purple bar across the

43
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.770
top that says Edit Global Header Layout and nothing else behind, except you can recognize these different,

44
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.490
different toolbars, which are the Divij visual builder.

45
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.060
And so now we have all these different sections now, depending on what items are overlapping, sometimes

46
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.080
you can't get to the gear icon for certain items.

47
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.680
When you're editing a header like this because you can't scroll around, you can't really see what different

48
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.370
parts are.

49
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.740
In this case, it looks like we can add and edit each of the different parts.

50
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.140
And so let's take a look at it here.

51
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:39.550
Also at the bottom, you'll recognize the Purple Page Editor toolbar at the bottom there.

52
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.440
That's where your save button is.

53
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.830
Same as editing a page with the visual builder.

54
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.500
If you go ahead and change something up here, for instance, if you're looking at, you know, this

55
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.220
top section, for example, looking at these section settings, if you make a change and then click

56
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.600
the green save checkbox here, you also have to open up the bottom page editor and click Save down here

57
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.120
in order to save your changes.

58
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.230
Or it'll give you a warning that you just in case you don't want to leave the page without saving.

59
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.330
You can either discard your changes and leave the page or save your changes and do that.

60
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.920
And so it'll rescue you if you forget to hit the save button down here at the bottom right.

61
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.440
But looking at that section, we're looking at the black colored section right here.

62
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.100
There's a background, and of course, that's a background color in straight back, straight black.

63
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.210
Be the Hex Code six zeroes.

64
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.110
And so you could see that there there's no link for the whole section.

65
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.620
And design wise, it's really just a standard section.

66
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.710
There's, you know, all the sizing is on auto.

67
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.810
There's not, you know, padding.

68
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.270
There is a zero pixel top and bottom defined in this.

69
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.200
And so just taking a look at it, we can close out and see what else is in here now.

70
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.900
Inside of this section is a row layout.

71
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:12.160
So if we look at this rollout, we can see that it's got a single column and inside of this column,

72
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.120
nothing really is, is there.

73
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.110
But inside of the column itself is a gray module.

74
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.760
Now that's a text module.

75
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.050
So these are the text settings.

76
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:30.490
Here's where you can change what that text says, you know, of course, and you can look at the design

77
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.910
of that.

78
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.420
So let's see in the content area if we click there could see this is paragraph text.

79
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.480
So here under design, that would be determined under text here.

80
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:47.110
And one of the default, the default font in this theme is Oswald.

81
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.540
It matches the the layout pack.

82
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:56.710
I should say not the TV theme, but this Oswald Font is a default layout inside of this travel agency

83
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.340
layout pack.

84
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.700
And so it's also been altered.

85
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.010
It's.

86
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:06.800
It's not bold, but it's a regular font weight, but it is made into all caps right here.

87
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.770
So if you take that away, of course, that won't be all caps.

88
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.660
And that's where that is now.

89
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.070
The text color is white.

90
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.890
That's the Hex Code six F's.

91
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.260
And then you can see the text size is a certain size for desktop.

92
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:28.520
And then if we look at the tablet view, it's well, it's one pixel smaller, and in the mobile view,

93
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.140
it's 16 pixels.

94
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.320
And so that even looks a little bit large.

95
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.400
Go into two lines.

96
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.590
It might be better down at 14.

97
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.670
This one looks good at 18 and this one's at 19.

98
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.240
That's fine.

99
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:47.480
But you can change things like letter spacing if you want to spread it out a little bit, etc. and all

100
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.890
those things, it's center aligned instead of being left aligned inside of the module itself.

101
00:07:52.870 --> 00:08:00.560
Yeah, and the color text color here either lighter dark is actually not relevant because it actually

102
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.910
has a defined text color right here for that, for that text.

103
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:12.260
And so they're sizing and spacing options, which are probably just left as the default rate here,

104
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:16.860
but that's where you would edit all that stuff if you need to change anything there.

105
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:25.490
I did change the text size for the mobile device view, and so I am going to go ahead and save that

106
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.800
header, so I've saved my changes right there.

107
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.090
And that's all that we have in this top section of the header.

108
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:38.510
Now, if we go down below, there's also a second section down below here.

109
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:46.190
So for this section, the background is a color and it's determined as a transparency, in fact.

110
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:54.980
But that color is right here, and it's an RGV with a fully transparent, color defined and that's what

111
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.780
the background is right here.

112
00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:04.520
And as you remember, as we go back here, that is a transparent header which shows the image behind

113
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.780
right through.

114
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:11.990
And then let's look at what else we have here for settings as far as the defaults.

115
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.000
We have a row, and if we look at the row, let's just look at the columns layout.

116
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:22.280
What we have is a large area and then a second column way over to the right.

117
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.710
Now what do you think is inside that second column?

118
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.700
Yes, it's the read call to action button over here.

119
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:35.360
The way you can determine that is if you look at this column layout, you can see that the different

120
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.490
modules there's one module in the left larger column, which is a menu.

121
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.620
Let's see.

122
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.040
Yeah, that's a menu module.

123
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:48.080
It's showing both a logo and a menu over here.

124
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:54.890
The the elements of the menu, etc. the design and the menu over there.

125
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.750
So we can close that up and then we can define, you know, which which menu that is.

126
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.850
That would be select a menu right here.

127
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:10.950
If no menu is selected, then it defaults back to just listing every page inside of the website.

128
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:16.320
And as you can see, it's also listing the uncategorized and the news.

129
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.500
It's listing all the blog categories there.

130
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:26.040
So we want to define a menu for this after we leave the global header editing area right here.

131
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.750
That would be something that would be a nice challenge for you after you close out of the global header.

132
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.650
How do you change from the default menu to a menu that you can select here?

133
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.870
Well, there is none to select, and so we can't change that yet.

134
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:46.080
But if we close out here, let's go ahead and look at what's over here under the second column and how

135
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.430
that has been moved up to be overlapping inside of this next section.

136
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:57.210
You might remember we looked at some overlapping section backgrounds in the last couple of sections

137
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.690
looking at the div part one section of the course.

138
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.340
And so let's take a look at it.

139
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.630
So it's a button module.

140
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.580
It's says get in touch.

141
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:11.040
There will be a link eventually that you could place to the contact page or something like that or however

142
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.700
you want to do that.

143
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
If you remember in leverage div scum.

144
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:23.940
I made that into a log in button over here and I also made it conditional so that if a person is logged

145
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.770
in, like right now, I'm logged in.

146
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.690
You can see the admin bar up here.

147
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.690
If you're logged in already, then that login button doesn't appear because it's not necessary.

148
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.570
And I'll show you about that right now.

149
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:41.130
The conditional power of divvy modules is really pretty awesome.

150
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:48.360
And so let's just take a look at two things how is overlapping into the section above and also how I

151
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.040
made it into a conditional element.

152
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.960
So let's just look at the design and the alignment is to the right.

153
00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:01.080
You can see that this module itself is right aligned over to the very edge of its column.

154
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.440
If we put it to the middle, it would go there to the left over here.

155
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:09.480
But it's a nice design to have it way over to the right there and the design of the text.

156
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:18.280
The design of the button itself with the colour, etc. and the icon that it is being used.

157
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.190
The button icon is a right arrow.

158
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.200
You can see that comes through there.

159
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.600
The button icon colour is black, you know, and since it's a white button, it's probably going to

160
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.820
look better if we change that over to a white icon, I think, and it looks great.

161
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:39.870
And then under advanced a lot of the items here that will go over in later lessons in this section,

162
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.500
one of all those one of them is conditions.

163
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.530
And so just taking a look here, you can add a condition.

164
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:52.980
And because that was a log in button on the leverage device icon website, what I used for a condition

165
00:12:52.980 --> 00:13:02.070
was the under user logged in status and I can say display only if user is logged in or if a user is

166
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.270
logged out.

167
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:11.070
And that's what I had had used in the other website display only if a user is logged out, otherwise,

168
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.020
it just will not display that module itself.

169
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.240
The button will just completely disappear if you're logged in.

170
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:26.220
And so that's a really powerful thing that you can do in DV, and I'll click the green checkbox to save

171
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:32.400
that because I changed the colour of the button icon and then I'll click Save right down here.

172
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:38.160
And the last thing, let's just look at how that's pulled up into the top there.

173
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.490
Do you think you can find that on your own before I show it to you?

174
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.330
I'll give you a second pause the video if you need to see if you can figure that out.

175
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:55.920
Well, I am going to go under design, and then if I look at spacing, I can see that there's a margin

176
00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.300
set a top margin of negative 70 pixels and that's how it's done.

177
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.530
So the negative 70 gets it right, basically to the middle of the button.

178
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.920
You can use this slider right down here to change that.

179
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:15.490
But putting in a negative margin can easily get you the ability without any code to do a, you know,

180
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.060
kind of overlapping look right there.

181
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:24.720
Now, of course, using that slider, I can use these little buttons to to get it to where I want back

182
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.010
to the 70, right?

183
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:30.340
And then what happens when you scroll?

184
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.790
Let's look at leverage Devi again.

185
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.260
And in fact, how can I show you guys this when you scroll?

186
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:43.380
What happens is that call to action disappears, I believe.

187
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.360
In fact, let's go back and and let's just take a look at the layouts library.

188
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.710
Is that going to work?

189
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.060
No, that's not going to work, either.

190
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.830
So you know what I'll do.

191
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.470
This is a good thing to know about.

192
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.780
Also, you can go and open up.

193
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:06.370
A year, I'll make this a little bit smaller, moving in and you can in Chrome or Firefox, you can

194
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:12.970
go over here and you can open an incognito window and that will be a different window and your log in

195
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:22.450
sessions will not be will not be persistent there when you're, you know, between two browsers.

196
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.500
And so I go back to leverage Diwekar.

197
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:31.300
And when we look at the site here now that I'm not logged in in this incognito window, you can see

198
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.530
that the login button is there.

199
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.380
So what happens when you scroll that does something.

200
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:42.730
It gets rid of the negative margin and it puts it back inside of the sticky part of the menu there.

201
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:49.630
And that's something that you can't see without any content here when you're in the other editing window

202
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.480
because you can't really scroll as I scroll my wheel here.

203
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.280
There's nothing to scroll, so I can't see what happens.

204
00:15:55.630 --> 00:16:02.890
But if I go back to sticky now, that shows me in this editor here what it would look like when it's

205
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:03.850
a sticky menu.

206
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:13.060
And of course, for this section, this button over here gets a zero top margin instead of the 70 pixel

207
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.850
negative margin on the top right there.

208
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.450
And if we look at this top section, you know, let me close this up.

209
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:24.070
Also, if you look back at the incognito window that I had open.

210
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:25.870
What happens here?

211
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:31.900
That top section, the black background top section totally disappears to make the area smaller and

212
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.480
let the content slide underneath.

213
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:41.530
And so to show you how that works, let's go back into the section settings for the top section here.

214
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:49.300
It might be advanced visibility and you might disable it went on scroll.

215
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.220
Or maybe it's a scroll effect.

216
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.810
Do not stick.

217
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:05.510
This so the sticky position for this section is do not stick for vertical motions, not we're not enabling

218
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.370
any vertical motion here.

219
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.540
So basically the sticky position is do not stick.

220
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:18.110
So if we have stick to top right here, then when we scroll, it'll stay instead of disappearing.

221
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.920
So that's how you do that.

222
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.680
We have that to do, not stick.

223
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.200
When the user scrolls.

224
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.780
And that's how that works in there.

225
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:34.070
So I'll just click any to save any changes here and we can close the X at the top right of that purple

226
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:40.070
editing bar and then make sure that if this doesn't say all changes saved, that you go ahead and click

227
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.810
that button to save your changes.

228
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.090
And then, of course, you can go back here and refresh the page to see that everything's working or

229
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:52.220
any of the changes that you made like this white button icon are still persistent there.
