1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:07,000
In this lesson, I'll show you how I use staging at good pain for efficient updating and redesign projects

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,410
for my client websites.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:14,650
You'll also learn how to set up redundant backup systems both locally and offsite, so that there's

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,640
always an easily restore built backup ready in case of any problems.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,860
By the end of this video, you'll understand the best practices with WordPress backups, as well as

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,430
several ways of working with staging to update sites safely.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:34,330
As you know, I love my grid pain staging area management system, and so let's just talk about it a

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:34,680
little bit.

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,960
I know that I've introduced grid pain and staging a little bit as far as in other lessons in the course.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:48,130
But relative to managing client sites and managing multiple sites, especially as regards updating,

11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,740
I often use a staging area in two different ways and at grid pain.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,530
You know, I highly recommend grouping because one of the reasons is because of their staging management.

13
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:07,900
They automatically will create a staging area at a subdomain like staging dot domain, BCom, for example.

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,630
All you have to do is just simply turn it on if you don't have it on already when you set up the website.

15
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:20,530
It uses a plugin called Force Login to make sure that that staging domain doesn't get listed in Google

16
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,660
and isn't accessible to the public, meaning you have to be logged in as an administrator in WordPress

17
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,960
to see the site at all and to see the back end as well so you can work on it without risk of having

18
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,580
anybody else seeing it.

19
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,540
And then you can easily with one click push the site from live to staging and easily back again from

20
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:47,930
staging to live, and that makes it super easy for doing updates and for testing.

21
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:55,780
And so, as far as updates of the word press corps software, updates of plugins and themes, and even

22
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:02,620
site redesigns, or creating extra sections of a, say, changing themes and things like that, and

23
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:08,560
reconfiguring in the background without having the live site go down or the live site change at all.

24
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,540
Using the staging area is great for that, but for updates, I mentioned two ways.

25
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,580
So most of the time what I'll do is create a staging copy.

26
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:25,690
That's a clone basically of the current site at the staging subdomain just by clicking this single button

27
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,500
live to staging.

28
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:33,970
And then I'll work on that staging site to go in and do my update and then test those updates in the

29
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,930
staging domain.

30
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:41,140
And now usually what I'll do is that I'll just say, OK, well, everything seemed to work, so I'll

31
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,960
just go back to the live site and repeat my work there if it was easy and it wasn't too involved.

32
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,610
And so that's the first way.

33
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:55,240
The second way would be for a more involved redesign or something like that or changing of themes,

34
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:04,210
something that has more changes that would be more of a pain to just redo on the life site after practicing

35
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,590
at the staging environment.

36
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:12,070
And so in that case, like if I were changing themes or doing a big site redesign, I would do that

37
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:18,730
in this on the staging site and then use this staging to live to bring all my changes that I just made

38
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,120
and tested back and overwrite the live site.

39
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,130
And so both ways work.

40
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,920
Honestly, it's more of just a workflow choice that I make in the moment to say whether I want to just,

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,730
you know, make a quick update as a test and then just make that update in the life site or to make

42
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:43,570
the updates at staging and then bring the staging over to the live site, meaning overwriting the live

43
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,560
site as it is.

44
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,500
And so that's one thing I love about grid pain.

45
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:54,820
Now, if we look at other hosting environments that I use and have used for client sites, Flywheel

46
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:01,510
does include a really robust staging environment, just like grid paint does, and so recommend Flywheel

47
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,410
for any type of hosting for your sites or for your client sites.

48
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:12,460
And then I would limit it if you're using a shared host or you're using site ground for shared hosting.

49
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:20,680
I've mentioned it before, but only the grow big and the go geek levels of shared hosting include staging

50
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,690
as a part of one of their features.

51
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,860
And so the the the Groberg is a good place to start.

52
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:34,030
The go geek basically gives you double the amount of web space and four times the amount of visits so

53
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,880
that you can host more sites on Go Geek.

54
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,070
So I might recommend just starting with Go Geek until you get, say, more than 20 sites under your

55
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:49,960
belt and then migrating to manage WordPress hosts like Flywheel or a self-managed host like Grid Pain,

56
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,020
which is the lowest cost per site.

57
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,540
If you're up in multiple sites and so as far as staging areas, that's the way I like to do it.

58
00:04:59,560 --> 00:04:59,980
Let's talk.

59
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:09,190
About backups now, it's a recommended best practice that you have multiple backups in place for each

60
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,850
one of your WordPress web sites.

61
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,650
And so if I go to the actual live sites here at grid pain and I'll show you at just an example of one

62
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:28,180
of the sites that leverage WP Dotcom, there's a backup system tab here for each one of your websites

63
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,870
that you're hosting with good pain, and they have a really robust backup system, both local backups

64
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,550
and remote backups.

65
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,440
And you can see that I don't have remote backups activated for this particular site.

66
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:48,850
But what I do have are remote backups backups activated using a WordPress plug in a free plug in called

67
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,450
updraft.

68
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:55,540
Plus, it's not related to my updraft media website, but just has a similar name and I'll show you

69
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,760
around that plug in as well.

70
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,790
During this lesson.

71
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,900
And so I just wanted to show you around local backups here in grid pain because it's so robust.

72
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:12,070
What you're able to do here is, first of all, if you store hourly backups, as you know, complete

73
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:18,070
restore backups in a traditional fashion, you'll really fill up your server storage space super fast.

74
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,740
And so they use a program called Do Duplicity.

75
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,340
They use a program called Do Duplicate.

76
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:36,370
See that in the background that using that software would cost you $50 dollars per year per server,

77
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,360
but it is something that is included in grid pain plans.

78
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:51,940
And in my site here, I am now able to do hourly backups that I choose the time of day by the minute

79
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,820
of what time I want those backups to run so that I can have different sites on the same server, take

80
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,150
their backups at different times during each hour.

81
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:10,720
And so one of the greatest things about these hourly and daily and monthly backups is that they are

82
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,940
self-healing and self purging.

83
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:19,570
So by default, the thing that happens, I'm just looking at one of the the knowledge base articles

84
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,170
about the backups configuration in grid pain.

85
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,130
And so it's a good way to get to know how this works a little bit.

86
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:35,500
One of the things is that they're stored in these non-human readable chunked files, and this is what

87
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,510
enables them not to take up a whole bunch of space on the server as far as backups.

88
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,060
They're also easily restore dribble.

89
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,960
You know, if you go back here, you could see there's a Restore tab here.

90
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:54,640
So I could just say, OK, I want the restore, what type of restore and I can go back and select my

91
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,940
backup to restore from once I have a list of backups by hour by day or by week or by month.

92
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,660
And then I can also define the purge schedule.

93
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,690
Basically, what I'm going to show you in that knowledge base document is that, you know, you keep

94
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:17,800
daily backups for a week, keep weekly backups for a month, keep monthly backups for a year.

95
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,920
And any backup that's older than three hundred and sixty days or older than a year gets purged permanently.

96
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,670
And so this is a self healing or self pruning backup system that's saved locally.

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,820
And that's the initial backups strategy.

98
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:41,050
So if the entire server were to go down and disappear, these local backups are also lost with the server

99
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,410
very, very rare.

100
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,930
I mean, you can prevent that by using a failover system that grid pain can offer where you have a synchronized

101
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,030
backup server in a different location.

102
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,870
But I don't use that on every one of my client websites.

103
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,450
It's a more expensive way to go.

104
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,390
It's only used.

105
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:05,230
I only use it on my highest dollar websites and mission critical websites that businesses pay for that

106
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,160
level of of security on their website servers.

107
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,980
And so, you know these these local backups are very, very often as well.

108
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:22,690
So if you have a website, a client site or your own site that has a web store, for example, where

109
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:29,110
there's always orders coming in, you know, an hourly backup is a more powerful backup to have versus,

110
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,350
say, a daily or a weekly backup, which would actually lose, you know, if you had a weekly backup

111
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:41,800
on a popular WooCommerce store and you needed to restore last week's backup where you would be losing

112
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,010
all the orders that came in since that backup was taken.

113
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,520
And so hourly backups are a really great advantage.

114
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,020
And in this way, don't take up that much storage space on the server.

115
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:01,210
And so you can enable automated backups at an hourly level at each one of your client websites, a grid

116
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,880
pane, which honestly is a better backup system than any other that I've found.

117
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:13,630
And so you can also multiply the the redundancy of those backups.

118
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:21,320
And give yourself a second backup copy, and you can do a second and a third and enabling remote backups

119
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:29,570
with grid pain, which can be placed on other servers like Amazon RWC and a number of others automatically

120
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:36,080
so that if the server were to go down for some reason, you could easily restore backups that are placed

121
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,770
on a remote server away from the website's server itself.

122
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:49,280
And so let's discuss another way to easily do on any website hosted a at an offsite backup.

123
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:57,320
And let me pause the video and bring up a website where I'm using updraft plus plug in for remote backups.

124
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:05,810
So here at Leverage WP RT.com, I'll show you how to set up the updraft plus plug in and let's just

125
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,230
go.

126
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,180
If you'd like to follow along on any one of your sites, you could do that at your flywheel life site

127
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,170
or your own host.

128
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:21,830
If you just type the word updraft in the add new plug ins, you'll see that this one updraft plus backup

129
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,310
plug in.

130
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,010
It's a great plug in that is free to use and has a lot of great features.

131
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:35,810
And the greatest thing about it is it can store upload backups up to a remote location and store them

132
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:43,010
and manage that storage so that it can delete older plug ins to purge your storage space in a similar

133
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,470
way to good paying, but not quite as robust.

134
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:50,780
Also, you can restore backups from that plug in directly and so can see.

135
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,490
I already have this installed and activated on my website here.

136
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:04,240
You can go down and if once you have it activated onto settings and updraft plus backups, and I do

137
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,330
already have this connected to my Dropbox account.

138
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:16,220
And so if I scroll down under Settings tab, you can see I've got weekly backups said I like to do on,

139
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,890
you know, most of my websites for this, you know, plug in based remote backup system, which is really

140
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,970
my my third line of defense in my backups redundancy system.

141
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,810
I like to keep two copies at Dropbox, but when you set it up, you want to.

142
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:39,410
As far as at least with the Dropbox remote storage option, go in another tab and log in to your Dropbox

143
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,780
account and and just be logged in and another tab while you're setting this up.

144
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,900
It just makes it easier when you click the Dropbox button here.

145
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:55,580
It will open up another tab where you can click to allow the updraft plus backup plug in to connect

146
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,660
to Dropbox for you.

147
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:03,440
And in that way, what it does is on the weekly basis, it will create and upload a backup to Dropbox

148
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,770
for you.

149
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,030
It'll manage that.

150
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,430
There are two.

151
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,660
There are only at any given time, so it'll delete the older one when it puts a newer one in there to

152
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,980
manage your storage space.

153
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,790
And then you can choose whether you want plugins, themes and uploads included, et cetera.

154
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:24,680
Any exclusions you'd want, then you could click save changes after you approve that to be connected.

155
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,860
And then once that's connected, you can go to backup restore.

156
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,680
And what I'll generally do is just click backup now and allow that to start.

157
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,000
And so it usually will take just a minute or two to create the backup and upload it into your remote

158
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,130
storage location, whatever that is.

159
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,680
And so you can see that it's doing this in batches.

160
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,740
It gives you these log message messages right here, tells you what's going on and a progress bar right

161
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,710
here, and that allows you to monitor that backup.

162
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,600
And then from down below, if you have an existing backup here, it just allows you to restore using

163
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,620
this little button.

164
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:10,190
And so you don't really have to go into your Dropbox account and see the backups, although you have

165
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:17,030
them saved here and you can bring them back to an empty WordPress website, put them in the right place.

166
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:22,850
As far as the way that updraft, media likes to see them, and then you can restore them once it sees

167
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,450
them there.

168
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,700
And so it can be, you know, basically protection against a catastrophic failure.

169
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:35,350
If you need to restore one of your backups that was either done in the last week or in the last day

170
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,370
if you have daily backups being saved.

171
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:44,840
And so, like I said, I like to do both the local and the remote backups on most of my sites within

172
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,980
my grid pain system.

173
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:56,330
You can do local backups in flywheel and then as a backup of the backup, I recommend that you do install

174
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:02,600
a backups plug in and remotely save that to somewhere other than the website's server.

175
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:10,850
And so that is really the the way to go is to have at least two redundant backups available for easy

176
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,930
restoration, if not three, just in case.

177
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,180
The worst possible case is that you lose a website and you don't have any backups of it.

178
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,210
And so I rarely ever have that happen.

179
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:29,720
But like in rock climbing, you always want to have redundancy in the system so that nothing catastrophic

180
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,830
can ever happen.

181
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,210
You can always restore the website from one of the backups that you have in place.

182
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,340
Hopefully, the most recent one.
