00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.060
In this lesson, will install a free cadence theme at your flywheel demo site and two other plug ins,

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.460
you'll get the cadence blocks plug in and the starter templates plug in and explore what the templates

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.970
look like.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.250
By the end of this video, you'll understand why the blocks plug in offers much more than the standard

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.960
WordPress blocks and how turning off the blocks individually can keep your sites fast.

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.950
Loading for visitors.

7
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.910
OK, so of course, the first thing you'll notice is that we're running the 2022 theme, as we showed

8
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.170
in the last lesson.

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.510
So let's go ahead and go into appearance themes, and we'll get and activate the free cadence theme

10
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.900
now its cadence with a K, so click themes and if we click add new appear.

11
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.250
Generally, cadence is you don't even have to search for it.

12
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.670
It's in the first few themes and the most popular themes in WordPress for good reason.

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.260
So a click install right here only take a couple of seconds.

14
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.080
And then before we click Activate, just take a look over here.

15
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.580
We've been working with 2022 and then the Frost full site editing theme.

16
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.600
Now we're looking at ender themes.

17
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.730
You know, it's got the editor with that little red beat up hill right there when we activate a non

18
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.360
full site editing theme or what you might call a non block based theme, which most themes in the WordPress

19
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.230
ecosystems a system are right now you're going to see the kind of the old interface come out, which

20
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.370
is very appropriate and much more popular.

21
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.390
Now two things you'll notice when you click Activate on the cadence theme is that under themes now we

22
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.100
have, you know, the customize and widgets and menus menu items come up under appearance.

23
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.550
And those might seem more familiar, of course, than the new site editor starting in WordPress five

24
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.150
point nine.

25
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.240
But, you know, we have many, many more themes operating in this customizer environment than we do

26
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.290
at this point with block based full site editing themes.

27
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.780
Now that's going to change slowly, and there's good reason for it because block based themes allow

28
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:27.000
you to do a lot of editing of things that used to take some code or special, you know, functions within

29
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.740
the child theme that you might create.

30
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.680
And really, that's slowly going away.

31
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.980
But cadence and other themes like it compensate for the the, you know, the the lack of customization

32
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.410
by adding their own functionality to it.

33
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.460
And we're going to get into all those details with the cadence theme right now in this whole section

34
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.210
of the course.

35
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.870
So the next thing you'll notice is that immediately you're offered up to install the cadence starter

36
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.590
templates plug in, which I am going to have us do.

37
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.530
And you should do, you know, because it just makes it easier.

38
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.090
It makes it so easy to get started and even to learn cadence.

39
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.060
What we're going to be doing is installing the starter templates, plug in and activating it, and it's

40
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.990
activated too.

41
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.810
And you'll see that if you click that button right there, it immediately opens the Starter Templates

42
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.260
Settings section, which is linked here under appearance and under the cadence menu item.

43
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:36.480
And you can see right away that you have a large selection of starter templates in their screenshots

44
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.600
here show you that they're all in, you know, different types of industries labeled a little bit and

45
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.730
really like anything else.

46
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.880
And like with block patterns that we were using before, they're really they really can be used for

47
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.760
any type of website.

48
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.130
They all have their own look and feel different typography and different color schemes available to

49
00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.460
them.

50
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:07.950
And not only do we have all of these starter templates freely available to us, but they we also have

51
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:15.510
a lot more blocks and a lot more block patterns available within the cadence ecosystem.

52
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.910
Now, block patterns are a little bit different.

53
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:26.340
They're not exactly called block patterns, but it's called the design library within the cadence ecosystem.

54
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.390
And so before we go ahead and download and install any of these starter templates, go ahead and take

55
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.890
a look under plug ins, installed plug ins and you can just see that, of course, in our flywheel installation,

56
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.130
the cadence and started templates is the only plug in that we have activated yet, and I wouldn't want

57
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:53.220
you to go ahead and click Add New and then search for the word cadence and what you'll see.

58
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.700
The first one that'll come up is the Gutenberg Blocks by Cadence Blocks Page Builder feature.

59
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:07.490
Years is the title of this plug in, and you should always pair this block's plug in with the cadence

60
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.490
theme because it pairs with it perfectly, it adds a ton of functionality and different blocks.

61
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:22.250
In addition to all the default WordPress blocks in the block based in the block editor and the The Gutenberg

62
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.790
editor.

63
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.420
This blocks plug in is one of the best.

64
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.540
Now it can also work with other themes.

65
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.740
It's not required that you use the cadence theme with it, but they really pair well together.

66
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.040
So click Install now and then.

67
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.580
Once that is installed on the server, you can click activate and then it brings you to a cadence blocks

68
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.370
welcome screen, which is really the Settings panel.

69
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.470
And if you look, this is where we are under settings and then down here.

70
00:05:51.710 --> 00:06:01.040
Cadence blocks and you can see that there's an assortment of blocks that are available and activated

71
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.130
within the cadence ecosystem here.

72
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:10.160
So as far as the cadence blocks plug in, you can see there's a number of different plug ins that give

73
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.150
you a lot deeper functionality than the default WordPress blocks currently in WordPress.

74
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.310
And as you go down to the bottom, you can see that there's what how many come with it?

75
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:30.970
12 different block types that are included in the cadence blocks plug in a couple of things to note.

76
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.810
Look right here.

77
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.990
There's the second one in the list is a form, the contact form or marketing form block.

78
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:47.510
And so inside of cadence box, there's actually a very functional forms plug in that's actually a block

79
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.530
within the environment.

80
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.170
And it's part of the cadence blocks plug in, which means you don't have to install a separate forms

81
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.370
plug in unless you need some extra functionality that this doesn't include.

82
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.480
This forms plug in is great, and it does have really all the functionality you need for both a contact

83
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.400
form plug in and you can use it as a marketing and email opt in form as well.

84
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:16.970
It does have some limitations which will go over later in this section, but I also want you to notice

85
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:26.090
that you know there's some repeated functionality like gallery buttons headings down here, but each

86
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.460
of these is called Advanced Advanced Gallery, Advanced Button and Advanced Heading.

87
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.210
And these give you a whole lot more functionality and customizability on top of what WordPress Core

88
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:43.770
offers in their gallery, block buttons block and heading block.

89
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.490
And so that's something that we'll be checking out here.

90
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:53.180
And then the final thing I want to show you in the cadence blocks plug in Settings screen is that each

91
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.270
one of these block types can be deactivated.

92
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:03.470
Now, cadence theme is known as one of the highest performance and fastest themes on the front end.

93
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.120
We'll do a little bit of testing later in the course when we're talking about speed and performance,

94
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.980
and cadence is one of the fastest loading themes out there for the front end.

95
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:21.020
So a user will get a really high page score in Google Page Speed Insights, as well as metrics and other,

96
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.800
you know, testing areas that let you test the loading speed of your websites.

97
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.810
And so there's no extraneous code in cadence.

98
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:36.080
It's all native code, and there's not a lot of, you know, short codes or code bloat that you might

99
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:36.740
say.

100
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.040
It comes with some of the page builders in the WordPress environment.

101
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.430
And then in addition, there's all these deactivate buttons.

102
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:51.500
So for example, if you're not using, say, any tabs, if you're not using the tabs block, then you

103
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.550
can deactivate that block from your entire WordPress installation.

104
00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:03.230
And then you'll never load any of the extra CIUSSS styling or any code that's necessary to power the

105
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.160
tabs block.

106
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:09.080
And in that way, you can streamline your website and make it super, super fast.

107
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:15.500
And so in the next section, we'll go in and check out the different starter templates that are available,

108
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.680
how they work, as far as bringing them into your web site.

109
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:24.800
And we'll go ahead and get started taking apart and analyzing and changing one of the starter templates

110
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:31.430
as a part of this section to learn how cadence works and how you can build amazing, unique websites

111
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.530
really fast once you learn the tool.
