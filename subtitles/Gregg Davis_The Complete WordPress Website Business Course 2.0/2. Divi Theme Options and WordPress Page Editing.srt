1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,310
In this lesson, we'll go over the Disney theme options and how did he works within the customizer?

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,700
You'll see how I set up a Disney site when I first install it.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,680
As far as the defaults in the settings, by the end of this video, you'll understand how editing a

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,590
page within WordPress has some functions, but most of what you do within a DV site is in the visual

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,950
builder.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,430
First off, as far as DV overview and options, if we look down here, what will be going over are the

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:34,860
options tabs in that divvy theme options area inside of the sandbox, or if you own TV on your own personal

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:42,330
website and then using the customizer, which we've used in the past when we were looking at the cadence

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:42,660
theme.

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,710
The customizer is a place where DV does have some of its settings and then the project's custom post

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,400
type, as well as the DV controls within the WP page or post editing screen.

12
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,820
And so the things that we have later that we'll look at down here are the visual builder.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,740
But outside of the visual builder, you can also edit some of the settings within a page screen.

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,780
And so if we go back to the Disney theme options that's located on the TV theme options here in the

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,860
general settings.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,680
This is where you would set a logo for the default header if you're using the default header and then

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,970
whether that navigation bar is fixed or not like it is by default right here.

18
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,430
It's a fixed navigation bar that gets a little bit smaller when you scroll and this is the logo.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,000
That's that area is referring to over there.

20
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,770
And then some of the things that I usually set up as I first set up a TV site.

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:49,020
I'll generally leave Google Fonts, but I'll turn off and cueing the Google Maps script if unless I'm

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,840
using a Google embedded map as far as using the Google Maps module in Devi.

23
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,230
Oftentimes, I don't use it.

24
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,880
As we've learned, it's pretty easy just to embed a Google map or use a separate plug in.

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,650
And then as we go down here, I'll often just I want you to take note that there's a custom CSS area

26
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,090
that you can use for sitewide CSS if you're going to add something like that.

27
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:21,390
There's also a back to top button that I'll sometimes enable, because that's pretty convenient as far

28
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:29,100
as when you're, you know, creating some pages or using a layout that has some links to the page as

29
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,370
you go down a little bit, get down certain, you know, a mount and you could see this little back

30
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,780
to top button appears.

31
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,590
So that's a real convenient user interface and good UX or user experience to use as well.

32
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:50,620
I usually enable responsive images or leave that enabled as well when you save changes in these divvy

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,980
options and also in other places in TV, but especially here, it's also not exactly clear when you

34
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,870
have saved the only little little indicator you get when you click save changes.

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,640
Is this little green checkmark right there so you can keep an eye on that?

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,630
The performance settings are, you know, enabled by default in Devi, and these are the things that

37
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,990
I was indicating before inside of our outline that we'll talk about later.

38
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,500
But those are all enabled, except for deferring additional third party scripts usually comes up disabled

39
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,040
at first.

40
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,380
This is a place just if you're having any kind of a plug in conflict or something that's happening.

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,770
You can use this to troubleshoot how to fix that a little bit.

42
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:42,450
The navigation as we go across the theme options navigation settings, you know, as far as the navigation

43
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:50,880
bar, this stuff is talking about the default navigation bar with Vivi, and often I'll use a different

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,170
custom made header with a navigation bar that I've created, and the built in navigation system called

45
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,860
appearance menus is something that's different here.

46
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:09,180
So this is just if you're using the existing pages in the default navigation menu, you can turn off

47
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,750
certain ones you want to and whether you display a home link or not, etc. And then when you're looking

48
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,210
at categories, do you put a category navigation in that default menu or not?

49
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,360
And then general settings, this is an interesting one.

50
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:31,800
If you are using a default menu and you have a dropdown menu, say, you know, we might have portfolio

51
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,530
pages as a drop down here, you could disable the the top menu.

52
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,840
So when you click it, nothing happens and the only thing is available are the dropdown items.

53
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,610
That's what this setting is for right here under the buildings builder settings.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,830
Basically, unless you're if you're not using the project's custom post type, which is just a different

55
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,640
type of post.

56
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,710
In addition to pages and post, it's over.

57
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,770
Year under Divvy Projects is basically like a page, but has a, you know, a separate section as a

58
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,850
custom post type.

59
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,370
We'll learn about KPIs or custom post types later in the course, but if you're not using them at all,

60
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,280
you can turn off the TV builder for that custom post type.

61
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:22,220
And then as far as advanced, if there's any issues where you're seeing your changes, don't come up,

62
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,570
say you're on a different host or something like that.

63
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,320
It works as far as the sandbox here.

64
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,360
And if you're using grid pain like I use for hosting again, we'll talk about hosting in a future section

65
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,870
of the course.

66
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:41,660
But you can turn this off or clear the clear the cache of the access if you need to.

67
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:47,210
If your changes aren't being saved, and then I'll generally turn off the product, or which basically

68
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:53,700
is kind of pop ups that have links to show you around TV when you're first starting out and these two.

69
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,120
You can also leave disabled and then so layout some of these things.

70
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,630
I don't really change unless I'm, you know, changing things in the future as I set up blog posts or

71
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,350
things like that.

72
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:14,090
So when you're having a blog post be displayed using the post module in Devi, you can choose whether

73
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,920
to display, you know, the author or the date, the categories or the comments.

74
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,480
You can click it to grey it out or click it to bring it back again.

75
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:29,180
And then whether you show comments on posts and whether you place a thumbnail image on the posts by

76
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,020
default or not.

77
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,650
And then the single page layout, not the posts under a blog section, but as far as pages, whether

78
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,570
you place those thumbnails that are, you know, coming from the featured image of the post or not,

79
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,270
and whether you show comments on the pages or not.

80
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:52,280
And then general settings again, you know, the post info, that metadata, whether you show those

81
00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:01,670
things and showing the thumb thumbnails for different dynamically generated images from index pages

82
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:06,220
like, say, the home page shows your blog posts whether you want to show that featured image or not.

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,890
As far as ads, I don't really use, you know, Google ads or AdSense ads, but this is a place where

84
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,530
you can control some of the things for that.

85
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,290
SEO is a is a good place.

86
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:24,890
This has a lot of the features that an SEO plugin like Yost SEO, which I recommend built right into

87
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,310
Devi.

88
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:35,720
And so there already is, you know, a custom and a title method for displaying, say, up here in the

89
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,350
tab.

90
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:45,470
You know, for example, this is the page title and then this is the site title after a vertical line.

91
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:54,500
And so that's where down here, if custom titles are disabled like they are right now, then what is

92
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,420
my, you know, what do I have here?

93
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:02,510
You have the name of the page and then the description or whatever it is so you can control that here.

94
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:10,700
Integrations are, if you want to put, say, a Google Analytics code in the header section of every

95
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:17,510
page of the website, you can enable these code sections for putting different things in sitewide that

96
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:23,750
can help you for things like Google AdSense or for doing some marketing tracking, like using a Facebook

97
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,110
Pixel and things like that updates.

98
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:33,230
You just leave this as it is if you're in the sandbox, but if you're using your own device version

99
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:40,310
that you've purchased on your own site, you could go in to the Devi website area and you know, in

100
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:48,770
your account area, username and API key, you can set individual API keys for your sites and different

101
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:55,820
client sites so that they can be turned on and off at will, and that enables devices to be updated

102
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,920
from WordPress easily.

103
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:04,850
It also enables the pre-designed layout packs to be imported, and so that's a good tour of the theme

104
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,690
options.

105
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:13,550
Just a couple of more things, you know, using the customizer, the projects, I showed you a little

106
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,270
bit what that is.

107
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,060
It's just another type of page, and it's organized in a separate place so that you can use it for things

108
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,250
like maybe its services, that a business has different types of services or projects.

109
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,950
If it's, say, a web design company and you want to show a project on each of those types of pages

110
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:36,680
and keep it separate from the pages of the website that are just like about or the contact page and

111
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,400
things like that.

112
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,170
But let's quickly look at the customizer and and the editing screen of a page inside of Devi.

113
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,860
And so if I'm here, you know, I'm here in my in my Devi website, if I open appearance, customize.

114
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:59,420
Now here is where with the default header, if I am not using the the theme builder and.

115
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:08,360
Building a customized header for using, you know, using divvy modules, then this header is controlled

116
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,100
here in the customizer.

117
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,310
So you get just like in when we were using cadence, you get a representation of the website here inside

118
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,510
the customizer window.

119
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,210
And then there's things like general settings, you know, the typography, what are the what's the

120
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:32,240
default theme font, etc. You can set that you can set the, you know, a link color wide.

121
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,530
I'll often do that here.

122
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,400
This is the default blue, but if you want it to select a color, you know, you could say, Well,

123
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,970
I want the link color to be, you know, red or something different like that.

124
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,360
And you can set whatever color you like there and then you'd hit publish, of course.

125
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,600
So, you know, the layout settings.

126
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,360
This is a forward player, or you could have a boxed layout that would have kind of a border.

127
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,780
And then all the content within the site is not as common these days, and you can control the website

128
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,060
content with the accent color.

129
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:14,390
If I want to just change that into red to kind of go and set off against this yellow.

130
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,660
That's something that you might change and we're just exploring, you know, the background color.

131
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,670
This site with this design has a white background color on all the different sections.

132
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:31,790
But if you wanted to put a background color or a background image site wide, that's something that

133
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,580
you could do might just change that into this white.

134
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,370
Not going to change anything, really.

135
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:43,880
Using this imported layout site identity is a WordPress standard, and so that's the title and the tagline,

136
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,520
but also the site icon.

137
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,120
This is where you would have.

138
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:57,980
Instead of this WordPress W in blue, you could put a 512 by 512 pixel icon in here that matches the

139
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,640
brand.

140
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,670
And I always do that for clients with either a version of their logo or something that symbolizes their

141
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,360
business there.

142
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,630
And so again, under the customize are other things that are kind of standard WordPress things like

143
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,320
menus.

144
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,960
But there's also this header and navigation.

145
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:21,920
And so when we look at look at customizing this navigation, when we look at customizing this a little

146
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:30,110
bit further, we'll look at the primary menu bar here and the fixed navigation settings as far as when

147
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,220
you scroll.

148
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,400
How tall do we want this?

149
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,550
So that's 40.

150
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,700
But if I want to make this say even a little bit smaller, 35 pixels, you saw it get smaller there

151
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:47,600
and that's called the primary menu when you're scrolled all the way up and the fixed menu height is

152
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,200
right there.

153
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,420
So that's a change that I could make right there.

154
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:57,260
They're the secondary menu is one that would be like above this menu right here, and you can control

155
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:04,670
the background color, the dropdown for dropdown menu items here, matching the website design that

156
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,040
you're working with their header elements.

157
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,830
This has the search icon over here, you can see.

158
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,240
So you could take that search icon out, or you could place other things, social icons over there.

159
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,890
That was interesting.

160
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:23,540
That brought in social icons at the top of my hamburger menu there.

161
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,660
And then you could put a phone number or an email up in the header if you wanted to there.

162
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:36,170
Not something I use very much that her format is, by default, this kind of left and right, but you

163
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:43,880
could have a centered one with the logo in between all the menu items or the centered with the logo

164
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,870
at the top.

165
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,010
Like that?

166
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:53,300
And just these are kind of the original divvy header formats, and I'm going to get out, you know,

167
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,910
I'm going to go back to the default format.

168
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:01,730
There are also there's a slide in that's what we were looking at before, where there's a hamburger

169
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,140
menu and a slide in.

170
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,480
And I can't use that with the bright red color.

171
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:14,750
But and then the a full screen menu would be something like this that would kind of be an overlay instead

172
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,850
of clickable buttons up at the top.

173
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,900
And so generally, I'll use again.

174
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:28,370
Like I said, I'll get rid of this default header and go ahead and build a header using the theme builder

175
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,830
and then you can control it and put different headers for different types of pages or even specific

176
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:40,910
pages, or even remove the header altogether, something that we've done a little bit in some of the

177
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,180
other themes, but Devi makes it easy.

178
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,770
So again, a bunch of the other things in here that the bottom bar is something that a lot of people

179
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:57,980
will want to edit where it says, you know, designed by elegant themes and powered by WordPress and

180
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,270
then these social icons.

181
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:05,820
That bottom bar is customisable down here, you could just disable the footer credits over here or put

182
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,420
your own.

183
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:13,260
Oftentimes, I'll just be building again a site wide global footer in a different place called the theme

184
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,680
builder.

185
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,370
And so that's what that is right here.

186
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,660
Footer elements and footer menus.

187
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,300
The layout of the footer.

188
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:28,770
And then you can use widgets, which is kind of an older, traditional style of building a footer areas

189
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,780
inside of WordPress using widgets.

190
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,680
But we'll be using a more modernized way of doing it using the theme builder.

191
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,920
There's a few more things the home page settings.

192
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,140
Of course, that's whether you're showing a static page or your latest post on the home page again available

193
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,360
under appearance or excuse me, under Settings General in WordPress, anyway.

194
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,320
And so that's an overview of the customizer.

195
00:15:52,590 --> 00:16:00,540
Finally, let's quickly look at the Pages all pages section and look at one of the pages.

196
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:06,960
Let's just maybe take a look at this landing page that we have that's built with the DV builder.

197
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,940
And when we're in here, you could take a look at landing.

198
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:17,910
Here, it shows you with those little indicators, whether this is built with the Block editor or the

199
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,100
default editor or built with TV.

200
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:27,030
But it tells you right here in the content editing area that this layout is built with Divij.

201
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,230
And this is important if you're working with clients that open up the website to edit.

202
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:38,850
There's, you know, if one of the things that it's important to know is that if this is built with

203
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:45,930
the DV builder like it is and you click Return to Default Editor, this is actually going to erase all

204
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,680
the content.

205
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,220
That's a part of this page right here.

206
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:56,250
Now there are ways with revisions and with the editing history feature inside of Devi that you'll be

207
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,210
able to bring the old layout back if this accidentally happens.

208
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,370
But it's important to know that you don't want to return to the default editor unless you really are

209
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,950
aware that you're going to be throwing out the current layout.

210
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,070
But there are some things you might use this traditional WordPress editing page for one of which is

211
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,730
the title.

212
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,260
You could use it for the page title.

213
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,210
And also you can change that when you're using the visual builder using Devi as well.

214
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:30,480
But if you look on the right hand side here, this block editing settings area, you might use that

215
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,080
you can use the default template or there is a blank page template that you can use for landing pages.

216
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:44,820
If you want an easy way to remove the header and the footer, but still use a divvy layout, that's

217
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,810
if you're using the original traditional header and footer system.

218
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,250
Later, we'll be using the theme builder in DV.

219
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,930
And so this makes the template area here kind of irrelevant, but the permalink is where you would change

220
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,060
what the URL is for the page.

221
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,030
And that's something that you might want to be aware of.

222
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,790
And lastly, I'll just show you when you do, click edit with the DV builder or you're up here in a

223
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:15,540
page and you enable the visual builder, it puts a layer and editing layer on top, and this is something

224
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,810
that we'll talk about in detail in the next section.

225
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,100
You'll see what it does.

226
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:27,480
It actually loads the page the way it looks on the front end, and it puts an editing layer on top where

227
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:35,160
when you roll your mouse over things, you can see some of these, you know, the blue line here and

228
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,260
the little control bar for a section.

229
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,820
And these are the rows.

230
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:46,420
And then each of the design elements or sections where there's content are called modules in DV.
