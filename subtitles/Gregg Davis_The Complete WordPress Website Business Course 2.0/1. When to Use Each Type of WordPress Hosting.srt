1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,760
In this lesson, we'll explore shared hosting, managed WordPress hosting and self-managed WordPress

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,150
hosting.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,210
You'll follow along as I diagram what each one is and in what situations it makes sense to use them.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,880
By the end of this video, you'll understand when shared hosting is appropriate how managed hosting

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,760
works for multiple sites in a done for you system and how self-managed hosting is the most economical

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,750
for multiple sites.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,070
Let's talk about WordPress website hosting.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,680
Now, as far as the leverage WP framework, here's where we are.

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:39,030
This is the entire framework and you know, we've been talking about design as regards the website itself.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,870
But now we're going to focus on hosting a WordPress website.

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,600
What it takes to do that, what are the different parts that come into play and how do you judge what

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,080
WordPress website hosts are best for you?

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,280
There's a lot of false information out there with reviews and affiliate links, and so it's easy to

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,570
get confused regarding what WordPress website hosting is best and best for your situation.

15
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,470
And so as I zoom in here on the iPad and look at the the system that we're talking about again right

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,680
here under website hosting, which might include, you know, landing pages in e-commerce shopping cart

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:28,200
opt in forms on the website, we're going to be focusing on the hosting portion, which as you look

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,540
at the framework here, it has a red checkbox checkmark, which means it has a cost to it, you know?

19
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,130
And then in blue, because I've marked this in blue, it needs hosting.

20
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,780
It needs somewhere where the WordPress site can live and the data can live.

21
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:49,860
Just like other places like email, which we'll talk about later and hosting a contact list and automation

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,400
needs hosting, etc. the website is the thing we most think of when we talk about hosting.

23
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,860
So as we scroll down here on the iPad a little bit as far as WordPress hosting, you know, I've got

24
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:10,230
a little left hand side key over here where I communicate kind of the level of cost and whether a hosted

25
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,270
solution is necessary here on the leverage WP framework.

26
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,460
But if we look at hosting, there's as an overview three types of hosting.

27
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:28,560
I've categorized three category categories and types of WordPress hosting, some of which are appropriate

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,780
for some situations and others that are not.

29
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:38,790
And so each of these and it has their place shared hosting, managed hosting and self-managed hosting.

30
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,220
And so we're going to be talking about these three different levels in some different lessons coming

31
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,430
up.

32
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,240
But this is the overview about what each of these are and where and when you might want to use this

33
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,990
type of hosting in your business or for your WordPress websites.

34
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,090
So starting with shared hosting, these are all relative to WordPress websites.

35
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,460
Now shared hosting if you look at this section up here at the top right.

36
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:13,860
Shared hosting means that there's a server, a box where the website files and the database have to

37
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,670
be hosted connected with a really fast connection to the internet.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,720
And each of these boxes represents a single website.

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,470
Each website needs its own database and needs its own set of files and website storage.

40
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:37,230
So each of these little boxes here represent not only a website, but often shared.

41
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,510
Hosting includes the domain registration.

42
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,100
It includes email addresses and email hosting of emails themselves and controlling the domain name and

43
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:55,410
the way that it points to the website hosting and controls the traffic that goes from either the website

44
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,150
or the email.

45
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,660
The DNS stands for domain name system and again, we'll go into detail later in the course.

46
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,680
I have a whole section dedicated to domains and the DNS system.

47
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,610
And so the concept here is that with shared website hosting, first of all, it's the lowest cost.

48
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,720
For good reason.

49
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:24,240
The shared hosts are able to load up one server with multiple web sites virtually separating them.

50
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,200
However, even though they're virtually separated, meaning the managers or the website owners don't

51
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,910
have access to each other's websites, the resources that each of these sites are using is shared,

52
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,150
and that's the big definition of shared website hosting.

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,570
One of the things about shared hosting is that oftentimes it's the easiest to get started with, because

54
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:54,540
when you're looking at, you know, going in and putting up a website, the shared web site companies

55
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,230
make it easy.

56
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,000
They'll register the domain for you.

57
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,740
They'll include email hosting.

58
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,370
They'll.

59
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,640
Hosts the website, and they'll just take care of pointing the website correctly.

60
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,310
All in the background without you having to deal with it.

61
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,860
And so they're able by loading up a server with multiple web sites like this.

62
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:19,570
They're able to serve websites at the lowest cost level, and I would recommend shared hosting for someone

63
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:28,000
that's just starting out or if you're just hosting one to two to three websites for yourself as far

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,430
as selling websites, hosting and website care to clients.

65
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,130
I wouldn't recommend starting with shared hosting.

66
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,890
There are better ways to go, although the costs go up just a little bit for each of these kinds of

67
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,430
hosting.

68
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,920
And so let's define the other two types that types of hosting.

69
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,640
Let's go to managed hosting.

70
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,470
Now you've already plugged into a company called Flywheel and gotten your free 60 days of hosting with

71
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,770
flywheel hosting, and that is a managed WordPress host.

72
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:07,240
Now what manage WordPress hosting does is it kind of takes care of the, you know, the do it yourself

73
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,970
problem where there's a lot of complex parts needing to be connected properly and they take care of

74
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,140
that.

75
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,650
That's the managed part of it.

76
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,140
And what they do is they they still manage the servers for you.

77
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:29,440
Although instead of sharing resources between customers and filling up the servers with many, many,

78
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:35,710
you know, hundreds or thousands of websites, the managed WordPress hosts limit the amount of websites

79
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,720
on each of the servers.

80
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:43,600
Now they're not as transparent as getting your own and managing your own WordPress hosting because you

81
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,540
don't really know when you're working with a managed host.

82
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,060
You know what they're doing in the background with the servers and how many sites they're loading up

83
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,600
on each one.

84
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:59,290
However, they're very, very managed, meaning they take care of the resources that each site is using.

85
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,940
And though they do, they do limit the resources at your pricing level.

86
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,690
They do take care of everything in the background for you.

87
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:15,430
It's the highest cost per website, but it's also the most service and oftentimes the best customer

88
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:22,120
service and support as far as managed WordPress hosting now managed hosting is a place where I would

89
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:29,020
recommend if you're wanting to host multiple websites for clients or for your own business, but at

90
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:36,420
the same time you're wanting to have it done for you type of system where everything is taken care of.

91
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:42,970
You don't really want to know the resources of each site and how you know whether the server needs to

92
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,440
be upgraded at any point.

93
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,470
That is all managed for you.

94
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,290
And as far as cost, that's the highest cost, and we'll talk about exactly what those costs might be

95
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:59,500
and where I might recommend you go as far as how many sites you're hosting, how much support you think

96
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:07,240
you're going to be needing, and you know, whether you would like that taken care of for you or you're

97
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,880
willing to put in a little bit of learning time to figure out how to manage this for yourself?

98
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,710
Now, self-managed is something that oftentimes I will recommend over either one of these types of services

99
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,570
shared hosting or manage hosting.

100
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,840
Now, where I talk about shared is like I've done for you type of system, everything taken care of

101
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,840
least expensive, but not as powerful as far as expanding and growth.

102
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:43,030
And you may encounter kind of when you when you buy a discounted price at the beginning, it kind of

103
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,830
goes up and it can be sort of like three times the price you paid originally.

104
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:53,020
Once you get off the discount period with shared hosting and you have the disadvantage of everything

105
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:59,350
you know, hosted on the same servers and not as separate, that's called the noisy neighbor problem,

106
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:07,000
where if you have too many sites and services hosted on on a on a box or on a server, you may end up

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,290
with slower website or the problem where your neighbor, who you don't even know might get popular post

108
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:20,410
or popular growth on their website, which affects the resources and speed that your visitors are able

109
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,340
to take advantage of.

110
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,400
Managed hosting really takes care of that for you.

111
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:33,190
But again, if you grow or if you exceed the resources in your plan, you might go up as far as cost.

112
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:40,360
Now, self-managed hosting is kind of the best of both worlds in both of these types of hosts, both

113
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,130
managed and self-managed.

114
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:51,280
The domain is separate, and it recommended that you register your domain name separate from the hosting

115
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,790
company.

116
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,390
Rather, it's managed or self-managed, and then the email also recommended to host email.

117
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,230
It's a best practice.

118
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,800
Is to host your email.

119
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,470
Regular email addresses that need hosting, send and receive email separate from the website.

120
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,060
Now the website is hosted at the Managed or the self managed host.

121
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,600
The website again kept separate from the domain and from the email, and then the DNS.

122
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:26,150
It's recommended that you control your DNS yourself and use a high speed domain names system service

123
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:33,110
so that when visitors want to go to the website, they go through the DNS at a very high speed something

124
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,690
that's called time to first byte.

125
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:41,930
Be Whitey Time to first byte is very fast with certain DNS services.

126
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:47,180
If you're using shared hosting, which is hosting your domain for you, you're kind of beholden to their

127
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,280
system loaded up with other customers.

128
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,530
And so your website is likely to be slower as far as performance and loading speed for your visitors.

129
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:03,830
And so with self-managed hosting, you're actually buying the website server itself and choosing the

130
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:11,330
power and cost of that website server yourself independent of the self-managed hosting company.

131
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,540
Now, a company that I recommend is called Grid Payne.

132
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,650
There are others out there that basically layer a software stack for managing the server, and they

133
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:29,660
also offer customer support and support for your WordPress websites and your hosting system for you.

134
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,010
And for that, they charge a monthly or yearly fee here.

135
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:41,420
And then you get your website server yourself, and you can choose to have multiple servers and you

136
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,850
can put only your own clients on servers, or you can even put a single website on a single service.

137
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,920
And that is more along the lines of cloud servers and cloud hosting, where as one website grows, you

138
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,070
can be aware of that and you can grow with it.

139
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,980
Also keeping your DNS, separate your website, separate your email, separate and your domain name

140
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:10,400
registration separate so that there's not one point of failure as there is with shared hosting.

141
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:17,390
If anything were to go down or anything were to fill up as far as resources with your hosting server,

142
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:23,840
then you can address just that point and everything else remains working because they're not all connected

143
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,620
and reliant on the same piece of hardware.

144
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:33,530
The server and so self-managed server self-manage hosting is generally a medium cost.

145
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:40,940
I would recommend shared hosting for just starting out, managed hosting for just starting out as well.

146
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:48,110
However, it has the highest cost, but you can just leave everything to the managed host and then self-managed

147
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,460
really has a range.

148
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:55,460
If you're only going to be hosting one website or just a couple of websites, self-managed hosting really

149
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,780
isn't that cost effective.

150
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:03,980
But when you get up to, you know, almost 10 websites or 10 websites and higher self manage hosting

151
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,150
is by far the lowest cost solution per website.

152
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:13,040
And if you're going to be hosting client sites, self-managed is the one that I recommend.

153
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,620
And so over here on the left side, you can see that there is a big range of cost as far as hosting

154
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,610
web sites.

155
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:29,780
And then if you're talking about web sites that need dynamic and logged in users and by dynamic, I

156
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:36,440
mean that the website pages can't be, you know, served statically.

157
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,880
A lot of web sites can be cached on the server so that when WordPress delivers the page to the user,

158
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:50,030
those static page pages have already been created and saved on the server, and they can just be delivered

159
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,560
instantly and with speed.

160
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,860
However, with other types of more advanced web sites, like with LMS systems or courses, learning

161
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:05,120
management systems or membership sites where you have the user needing to be logged in so that they

162
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,150
can know whether they are able to access the private content in the membership, and especially e-commerce

163
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:18,710
sites where there are users making a shopping cart in real time and logging in to enter payment information

164
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,900
or to change their payment information.

165
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:29,210
Those types of pages all should be served separately and really they should be given a higher level

166
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,760
of resources for the website.

167
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,510
Now I'm putting an up arrow here to mark, you know, higher level of resources.

168
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:43,760
And so for each one of these, I would recommend either managed or self-managed for each of these three

169
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,470
types of websites.

170
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,560
And I'll show you around my hosting that I've used, I use, I've used, shared hosting in the past

171
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,610
and migrated and upgraded to managed hosting, especially with Flywheel and with some other great companies

172
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:58,790
like.

173
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:06,670
Engine and Kinaata is another great managed WordPress host, and lately I've moved almost everything

174
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,220
over to a self-managed system on grid pain.

175
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:16,930
Next, we're going to get into the specific recommendations I make for WordPress hosting and talk about

176
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:22,150
real costs as far as hosting either single websites or multiple websites.

177
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,960
Let's get into it.
