1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,640
In this lesson, we'll export the files and database of a working WordPress site from local and look

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,050
at the resulting zip file.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,130
You'll see how locals export can be used to bring the site to any host.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,540
But it's easy to drag it into local on any computer to make a working copy.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,940
By the end of this video, you'll understand how local can easily create a backup file for migration

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,690
or storage.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,930
Sometimes you need to migrate sites from one host to another, and in the next few lessons, I'm going

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,180
to demonstrate a few different ways of doing this, and I'm going to use the local development environment

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,340
to show you a few things about doing it.

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,860
But that doesn't mean that you need to use local to migrate websites.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,540
It just means I'm using it as a sample environment.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,330
You can migrate a WordPress web site from any host to another host, whether it's hosted locally on

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,380
a computer or whether it's at a live host.

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,450
And I've done this quite often with lots of different client sites, from one hosting company to another.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,520
And there's a few different methods to it.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,830
For starters, let's just take a look at one site that I have in my local development environment.

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,520
Using local called Kadence and the reason I'm starting with Kadence is because it's just obvious when

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,140
we open it up, it's at the address cadence dot local here on my computer.

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,530
And you can also see that it is one of these starter templates that we worked on in the cadence section

20
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,340
of the course.

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,990
Here all the pages are here.

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:34,860
The About page and the blog page and the brokerage page and all everything is working, and it's just

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,740
a working site with multiple pages.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,070
And so I'm going to show you how you can migrate this site into some different environments.

25
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:50,790
And let's just start with bringing a site and making a copy of it inside of local itself.

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,210
Now, if we use local, one thing that's neat about local is that you can right click on the site title

27
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,320
and you get some options.

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,000
First of all, you can save it as a blueprint and then use that when you start new sites later.

29
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,770
That's pretty cool to do.

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,320
You can clone the site, but I do want to show you how you can export this site.

31
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,740
Now I've already clicked export and chosen a name for it.

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,820
And so if I open up my file explorer on my desktop, I've got a folder called cadence.

33
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:28,740
And here is what I named it Kadence Dash Local, and it created a zipped folder with a few things in

34
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:28,980
it.

35
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:37,020
So if I were to go ahead and extract everything out of this zip file, it will just take a few minutes.

36
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,860
And what was it, a 40 or so megabyte zip file?

37
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,470
And it looks like it's going to create in about a minute, 30 seconds to a minute.

38
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,290
It'll show me inside this folder what it was exported out of local.

39
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,110
And now, interestingly, the reason I'm telling you this and showing you the export function in local

40
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:04,560
instead of just using the clone function is that we can take this zip file and the contents of it,

41
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,770
and we can use it to bring the website anywhere we want.

42
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,400
We can bring it up to site ground, for example, or grid pain or flywheel or any WordPress host.

43
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:21,690
And so soon, as this finishes, let's just take a look at what local gives us as an export for this

44
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,290
web site.

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,860
It's basically going to give us everything that we need to bring the web site over to any new host,

46
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,170
including back into local if we want to.

47
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,390
And so gives us three folders the app, the config folder in the logs folder from from local and then

48
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,060
a JSON file with the name.

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,040
But let's look under app and under app.

50
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,540
Here's where we have the real WordPress files and the database.

51
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:57,870
So under SQL, we have a file called local, which is a dot se que el file that is the database export.

52
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,950
And so you can you can export, you know, any SQL file from a working WordPress database, and you

53
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,190
can use that to import that site anywhere you want to.

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,170
And we're going to do that in several different ways.

55
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,580
And so let's go back up to app and look under public.

56
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:21,990
And now what we have is the entire file structure of the WordPress site, the way it was in that local

57
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,530
website.

58
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,500
And so I just want to show you what, what actually is there?

59
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,650
You know, you could look under the WP content.

60
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,710
Of course, under themes, I should have the cadence theme there.

61
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,060
Yeah.

62
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,750
Also under the plugins theme, I also have the cadence blocks and the cadence starter templates plugins

63
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,650
in there.

64
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,940
And so that's where the the changes live under WP content.

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,870
Now, as I've said before, the minimum that you need to migrate it somewhere else is you need the WP

66
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,740
content folder like this.

67
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,940
And then you also need an export of the database in the form of a dot SQL.

68
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,360
File.

69
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,040
And that's what this is right here.

70
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:09,930
And so it's easy to take a local website that you create just on your computer and migrate it over to

71
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,880
a live host if you want to, or even to a different computer where you have local installed or something

72
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,330
like that.

73
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,680
But let's start with just the easiest a local to local import or migration.

74
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:30,750
So if I have local open on my computer and I also have an export file, let's go back to Kadence and

75
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,370
just look at this zip file.

76
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:40,080
If I just take and drag that zip file over into local, it brings me to an import screen and it will

77
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,780
automatically unzip and install that whole site exactly as it was under a new name.

78
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,890
And so that is really just an easy local to local migration.

79
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,710
So I'm going to I don't want to call it Kadence.

80
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,310
It would be the same name, so I already have one in here called Kadence Import.

81
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,170
Let's call this one Kadence import two.

82
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,490
So I don't have, you know, I don't have a repeated site name and I'll know which it is.

83
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,320
And so I just click Continue.

84
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:14,610
I can choose the server type that I want, and it's just like installing a new site in local, but it's

85
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:21,720
extracting the import and it will only take a few seconds and then we'll be able to look at the results.

86
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:28,170
Now, if we go over to the original site, this is at the URL cadence dot local.

87
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,510
And you could see, as I showed you before, it's just, you know, working site with this real estate

88
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,140
starter template and let's open local back up.

89
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,100
And as it finishes up, it's telling me what it's doing now.

90
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:48,360
It's importing the database and it's provisioning over here and it's changing the site domain.

91
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:55,320
And in just a couple seconds, I think it will be finished and I'll pause the video and just give it

92
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,220
a few more seconds.

93
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,860
Well, he only had to pause the video for one or two seconds and this screen popped up.

94
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,150
And so it gives me a couple of little messages.

95
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,010
Sure, I could do one click admin, but when we look at it, this is cadence import two now that we're

96
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:18,900
under and the domain is cadence import to dot local and everything should be the same.

97
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:27,660
So if I click the open state now I have a site under the URL cadence import to dot local and we'll see

98
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,410
if that opens up the site.

99
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,910
There it is.

100
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:38,850
So it's an exact copy of that site and by importing the zip file that I exported from local, it's just

101
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,570
really easy to migrate and make a copy of that site.

102
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,640
It's actually the same functionality that you would get if you right click and hit clone.

103
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,300
It just doesn't, you know, bring the zip file on to your computer.

104
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:57,900
But having that zip file is a good way to store a copy of this WordPress web site that you could actually

105
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,830
bring anywhere.

106
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,890
You don't have to bring it back into local.

107
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:09,450
And so that's kind of the first start and easy way to migrate a site from local into local and change

108
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,680
the name and make an exact copy of.
