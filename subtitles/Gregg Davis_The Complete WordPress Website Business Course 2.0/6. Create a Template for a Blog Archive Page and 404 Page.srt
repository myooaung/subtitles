1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,210
In this lesson, we'll explore more customizations we can make sitewide to the 404 not found page,

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,540
as well as creating a custom template for a blog page.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,470
You create a blog template and a blog page to use with a query loop block, which pulls in blog posts

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,810
dynamically by the end of this video.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,900
You'll see how, with a block based theme, you can customize a photo for Page without editing or adding

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,610
code, as well as again, how to customize a template to use for a blog page.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:41,580
One thing you might notice is that this design blog button that we went to a slash blog page doesn't

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,070
go anywhere.

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,150
There's a 404 error, which is a page not found.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:54,210
And by the way, we'll take a look at the 404 page template that we can customize, which is unlike

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,560
old style editing.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,470
This is great inside of block based theme.

13
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:04,080
You can easily customize the for a four page without using any code or a plug in or anything.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,450
But let's fix this design blog and create a template that we can use.

15
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,420
But first of all, let's create a page.

16
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,350
There's no blog page, but we did this using the 2022 theme before just going to a type blog.

17
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:30,180
And of course, there's no blog page that that is available to us just the default template.

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,810
Now that default template lets just click publish.

19
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,970
I can uncheck always show the publish checks right now.

20
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:46,680
And so since I've published a page called Blog Now, this should actually go somewhere, but there's

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,730
no content in there.

22
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,590
The default template isn't really showing anything but the page title.

23
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,880
And so let's go back in the WordPress dashboard and let's look at Appearance Editor.

24
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,760
And we can see that.

25
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,620
Of course, this is the No.

26
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:15,240
Title, no title site template, I should say the no title, no title template.

27
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,060
Hey, here's the four oh four displays when no content is found.

28
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,870
And so here is the index that displays posts.

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,420
But let's take a look at this 404 template first.

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,360
This has some content they're not found.

31
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,240
Oops.

32
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,960
You know, sometimes you can see on some websites, there's sort of a funny, funny joke, and a search

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:44,410
is really a good thing to have or even page navigation or suggestions of places where people can go

34
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,890
if they've navigated to the wrong page or something like that.

35
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,850
But that's great that it's editable there as far as templates.

36
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,580
Let's look at this indexed template here that shows the posts right?

37
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:05,560
Shows the posts in reverse order, and it's got the proper header and footer.

38
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,340
And so let's go back.

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:18,130
You know, what I'd like to do is create a blog post template like we did in 2022, so we can look at

40
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,360
the query block.

41
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:25,270
Let's go in the pages, all pages and back to the blog page that we created.

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,750
And over here under page, and you know, with the Settings panel open, let's click new.

43
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,740
And I just want to create a blog of blog posts template.

44
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,510
Click Create right here.

45
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,460
And, OK, here we go, we've got the blog posts template.

46
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:53,180
Uh, let's go ahead and let's look at the list view and we've just got a few different different things

47
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,790
right here inside this, this group and then a second group and then a group there.

48
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,180
And so really, what I want to do is first, you know, inside of this group.

49
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:15,760
Or even below this group, let's look at adding the oops I spelled template wrong.

50
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,150
Let's look at adding the header template part with choose an existing template part.

51
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,450
And will choose that header.

52
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,160
Great first thing that I wanted to do.

53
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,110
Look at the list view here, and let's take this group.

54
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,020
Just click the three dots and remove it.

55
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,310
Great.

56
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,840
Okay, now there's the top.

57
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,060
We've got a separator here right there.

58
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,760
I can get rid of that separator.

59
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,400
I can have the title there.

60
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,920
So this has the post title.

61
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,140
In fact, now we don't want to have that in there.

62
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,360
Let's inside of this group.

63
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:08,390
Let's go ahead and get rid of this group here, so we've got the post content there.

64
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,940
There's nothing really there, right?

65
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,400
So I'm just going to get rid of that post content.

66
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,330
But inside of this group, what I want to add is, well, let's go to browse all that'll bring us over

67
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,400
here as if I hit this plus button over here.

68
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,670
Look at patterns and then let's look at is it query or page that I want?

69
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,830
I think it is.

70
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,110
Query open up the explorer just a little bit bigger.

71
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,830
A grid of posts in three columns is the one that I usually like.

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,300
That's great.

73
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,010
I don't have many posts in here to have.

74
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,770
Well, let's see what our options are over here.

75
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,340
Styles default or box shadow brings a shadow in there or, of course, full height.

76
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:58,070
And there's some other options over here, so let's just so for the blog posts.

77
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,400
Template.

78
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,340
Let's go ahead and update that.

79
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:12,000
This page has been modified yet, and so has this template, so if we save that?

80
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,680
Let's see what we have to work with here.

81
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:22,650
All right, so really, I just have two posts, a sample post and a hello world post, but what I'll

82
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,250
show is a three wide grid that goes down the page.

83
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,220
I'm missing a footer, though, so let's go back here.

84
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,240
Others hit back.

85
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,590
Let me go.

86
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,220
I like to edit in the site Ed itself, I know that blog page is already using the blog posts template,

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,200
so I'll toggle the navigation going to templates and open the blog posts template.

88
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,680
And let's just look at the list for you to see what we have.

89
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,000
There's that header.

90
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,700
All that stuff over here, OK, here's a group, and then there's a second group, so I really don't

91
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,770
need this group.

92
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,760
All right, but down below, you know, there's a spacer, there's going to be pagination here, that's

93
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,240
there if there's more than one page of blog posts.

94
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,700
But really, what I want to do is add.

95
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,350
I want to add that footer down there.

96
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,320
All right, we'll close this group and.

97
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,670
So what do I have?

98
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,510
I have a group here which goes all the way down here.

99
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,750
I want to add a block, I want to add something below this group.

100
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,030
That looks like it's a little bit wider.

101
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,950
Let's see what we have in the list of, you know, I have a group that's well outside.

102
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,310
And if I add it, I can add a template part.

103
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,610
Choose an existing template part.

104
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,960
It's the footer that's looking better.

105
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,310
Now that I have that, I can just save this.

106
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,950
Now the design blog should work correctly with the footer at the full width of the page.

107
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,150
Great.

108
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,890
All right, that's great.
