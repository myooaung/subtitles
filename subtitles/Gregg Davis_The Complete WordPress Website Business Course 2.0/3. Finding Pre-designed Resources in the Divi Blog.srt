1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,420
In this lesson, we'll look at the Divvy Resources on the Elegant Themes blog.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,840
You'll see how I usually look around the blog for the most recent new designs, as well as find the

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,730
layout packs that have matching headers and footers and custom page templates, too.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,370
By the end of this video, you'll understand how you can find the most useful and modern resources while

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,740
using layout packs in Devi when looking around for pre-built resources, using the Devi theme and the

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,610
layout packs.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,430
There's a couple of places that you need to know where and how to look to find everything that you might

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,210
be able to use.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,300
Looking at this homepage here, we talked about how this is the original or traditional header layout,

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,070
as well as a widget based footer layout down here at the bottom.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,570
Later in the course, we'll talk about how to pre build and create global header and footer templates,

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:59,280
as well as specialized template pages that work with specific page types like blog posts or different

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,940
custom post types, and still use the divvy layout while maintaining the ability to edit and add new

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,140
content using the Block editor.

15
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,570
The Gutenberg Page Editor.

16
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:20,430
With that said, I'll always keep the elegant themes XCOM Home page open, and I will often look for

17
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,960
the most recent and the most modern resources from the blog, which, interestingly enough, is not

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,330
accessible at this point through the top header.

19
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,140
But scrolling down to the bottom, there's kind of a blog section down here.

20
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,300
I'll generally click blog and then take a look at the most recent posts.

21
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:47,460
Often, the Elegant Themes blog has multiple posts released every day, and they released at least one

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,790
new layout pack every week, and they release headers and footers that match the layout packs, for

23
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,580
example, as well as customized pages.

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,570
And so the most recent posts are listed from the top.

25
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:07,050
And as you go down, you can see, for example, this accessible layout pack has been available for

26
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,780
a little while, but now they've recently released a free header and footer template for that layout

27
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,170
pack.

28
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,950
And so I know that they're supporting that modern design in this layout pack, and the header and footer

29
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:27,840
is a theme builder template that you can freely import and customize for this layout pack.

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,780
You can also look for headers and footers that have been custom made and adapt the colours for different

31
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,520
layout packs, making completely unique and customised designs.

32
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,970
And I've done that quite often.

33
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,870
The way this works is in a blog post that has the templates for header and footer.

34
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,370
They both teach you how to use the headers and footers or whatever they're giving you access to hear

35
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,110
the shoe, what they look like here at the top.

36
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,760
On different screen sizes.

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,720
But then there's a button that says, download the files.

38
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,800
And then below that, there is a whole to tutorial about how that layout was built from scratch.

39
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,430
And so it's a really good educational opportunity as well as it makes it really easy to go ahead and

40
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,280
just import this super easy into your own website without having to build it from scratch.

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,280
But you can delve into the tutorial to educate yourself on building your own custom headers and footers

42
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,320
and other page templates later.

43
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,320
Just real quick, we're not going to import and customize one of these headers and footers yet in the

44
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,920
course, but I wanted to show you how to access the files.

45
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,360
Generally, you'll click download the files, and if you haven't already signed in in this web session

46
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,330
right now, you can see I clicked to download the files and I ended up with a zip file that came into

47
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,710
my downloads folder here.

48
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,950
But if you're not signed in, it'll basically open a window where you can enter your email address.

49
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:05,790
Basically signing up for the newsletter at elegant themes, and if you're already signed up, you won't

50
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,930
get signed up again.

51
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,290
It'll just enable this download button here, where you can click and then download the zip file.

52
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:20,940
So if I just open this up and take a look at it here, I'll drag my file explorer over into the window

53
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,210
here.

54
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,580
You can see that inside that in inside this.

55
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,840
When we look at my downloads folder here, it's actually a zip file.

56
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,770
So if I scroll over here, you can see the type of file that it is.

57
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,870
It's a zipped file, a dot zip.

58
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,050
And so that's usually with the little zipper.

59
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:47,550
So on windows, you can right click and click Extract all, and that will unzip the file into the same

60
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,940
folder where it exists on a Mac, you can just double click and it'll open an archive, which is basically

61
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,470
the unzipped zip file.

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,790
And so I can open this folder and within that folder, what I see is a.

63
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,180
Jason Gesso n File, which is named for whatever it is.

64
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,200
And so if I were to open up that file, you'd see that it's a bunch of code.

65
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,630
It's a JSON file that does something when you import it into the Devi website.

66
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,960
And what that does is it imports all the content, puts it into the database, as well as the graphics

67
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,810
and the images that are pulled from the example say into your own websites, media library.

68
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,530
And again, all the layout, pack and graphics and images are freely available.

69
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,030
Copyright free for you to use when you have a DV license.

70
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:47,850
And so if I know where this this file is, I'll go back into my dashboard and suppose I just wanted

71
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,800
to show you quickly and we'll do this in detail later on when I'm teaching you guys about the theme

72
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,250
builder.

73
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,680
But if I were to go into the theme builder here, this is where you can have global headers, footers

74
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,350
and also customized body areas for custom pages, for blog posts and things like that.

75
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:12,390
But the way you bring these these JSON files in is you use this up and down arrow icon over here that

76
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,590
says portability.

77
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:20,100
And then you would click the Import tab, select this file and then your options here and then click

78
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,210
the import button.

79
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,570
And that would import that layout into your DV website, where you can then use it later and define

80
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:33,540
on which pages it's going to be used, whether globally on every page of the website or only on particular

81
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,620
types of pages.

82
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:41,760
So that's an overview about how you find some of the things that you can use and import from DV into

83
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,320
your DV powered website.

84
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,930
Also on the blog.

85
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:53,550
If I go back just one more technique, I'll often go and just search for the word header and then I

86
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:00,960
can find the header and footer layout packs that are available for all the different layout packs that

87
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,390
are available in DV or elegant themes.

88
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,670
Now, not all the layout packs have a header and footer, and so you can kind of look for which ones

89
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,160
have it.

90
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,840
And it's generally a better idea to use a customized header and footer.

91
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:19,440
And even if your layout pack that you like doesn't have one, it's a good idea to find one that has

92
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,780
the functionality that you want and the look.

93
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:28,470
And then you can always change the color, the size, eliminate certain items about it, but it's a

94
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,250
good way to go.

95
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,790
Also, if you go through the different posts of the blog, there are some tutorials that are useful

96
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,740
to know also, for instance, how to create a custom sticky header for mobile.

97
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:46,980
For example, if you wanted the menu to be available with, say, a menu button and a call to action

98
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,740
all the time in mobile when people scroll so that it's easier to navigate when they're when they're

99
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,600
visiting your website on the phone.

100
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,310
Different things like that.

101
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,150
And there's other resources in there under header and footer.

102
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:10,860
Oftentimes, I'll go and also search the elegant themes blog for like page layout or the word template

103
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,610
or blog.

104
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,480
There's let's see if I can find one right here.

105
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:22,730
There's some how tos there, but here's one a blog post template for the software layout pack.

106
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,770
And that's again something we'll go into later in the course.

107
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:32,070
In the next device section where we'll talk about how to build a customized template for just individual

108
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:40,440
blog posts, and that can allow you to enter content and edit content if it's you or the business owner

109
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,870
or their employee going in to create blog posts.

110
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,890
They don't have to learn everything about Divij and risk breaking the website.

111
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,290
They can use the standard block editor, but you can still take control of all the content they put

112
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,250
in there and design it to match the website for your blog.

113
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,690
So that's a really powerful way you might search for blog post template.

114
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:09,990
Oftentimes a category, there could be a category page template that's available in the Elegant Themes

115
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,490
blog.

116
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:18,030
So be if you're using a blog and you want to customize that category page to have a list of of blog

117
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:23,010
posts under a certain category and have it look really good and match the layout pack.

118
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:29,760
So that gives you a good idea of how to search around and navigate for really good resources available

119
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,380
at the Elegant Themes blog.
