00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.670
In this lesson, we'll explore the options for hosting multiple web sites, either for clients or your

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.300
own sites.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.960
You'll see how shared hosting can be a good place to start, but managed or self-managed hosting offers

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.480
advantages that are hard to beat.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.730
By the end of this video, you'll understand what plans with grid pain, flywheel and safe ground work

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.250
best for hosting multiple WordPress web sites.

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.090
Let's start by talking about hosting for multiple web sites.

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.500
It could be your own multiple websites or client websites, but let's review some of the hosting concepts

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.140
that we talked about in a previous section of the course.

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.460
Relative to the hosting programs that I recommend and use in my business.

11
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:49.380
First of all, grid pain grid pain is a self-managed cloud hosting system where you pay grid pay and

12
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:57.150
a singular fee for their software stack that builds WordPress on top of servers that you pay for separately,

13
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.400
and you also have support with them at some different levels.

14
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.620
And so if you're hosting 10 sites or more, especially client sites, that potentially might need to

15
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.430
be changed around or scaled up or down.

16
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.900
This is the best way to go.

17
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.330
If it's a little bit more money initially, then if you're just starting out, you may want to choose

18
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.110
something different and we're going to go over a couple of different options in this lesson.

19
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.910
But good paying offers a starting panel plan for $50 a month.

20
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.200
Now it's the same per month, whether you build it annually or monthly.

21
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.560
But the big difference is that if you choose monthly, they allow you to host 50 sites through the program.

22
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.770
If you pay annually, you can have an unlimited number of sites.

23
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.240
And as we talked about in the hosting lesson earlier in the course, you can set up an unlimited number

24
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.620
of different servers and pay for those servers at a rate of, say, 10 or $20 a month for maybe 20 to

25
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.830
40 websites that you can fit on each of those servers.

26
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.940
If you have a larger client site or your own site that requires either like a busy WooCommerce eCommerce

27
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.490
store or an LMS or learning management system or a membership site where a lot of people have to be

28
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.890
logged in and using the site at once, you may want to limit the number of sites that you have on each

29
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.340
server.

30
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.920
But that's so controllable with the grid ping system it's super, super easy to use.

31
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.340
I do recommend the developer account if you're going to be hosting client sites and especially many

32
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.640
sites, but you can see that the price is a little bit more, of course, than the panel site.

33
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.500
The big difference is that you get direct support with experienced WordPress developers and system administrators

34
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.420
for the hosting and server, whereas in the panel site you get the community where the grid ping professionals

35
00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.430
do plug into the community help and forum section where you can post your questions and research, and

36
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.820
look and search through four for other things that you might need to know.

37
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.660
But you don't get direct support tickets unless you use the developer level.

38
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.890
Now, I do recommend that you start a few client sites and charge for website care and hosting so that

39
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.880
those client accounts can pay for your hosting.

40
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.620
You can easily upgrade from panel up to the developer account with grid pain, and it allows you to

41
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.570
have the most flexible plans for hosting multiple websites.

42
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.620
But let's move on to Flywheel, which we've practiced with a little bit using the 60 day free trial

43
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.420
that they've offered students of the course and built one of our sites in Flywheel.

44
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.530
Now, Flywheel is a great managed WordPress hosting company, and with that they do the same type of

45
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.000
thing as it was doing.

46
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.550
You know, they use very powerful, cloud based and scalable servers, but you don't really have transparency

47
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.370
or control over the particularities of those servers.

48
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.990
They manage that for you.

49
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.230
And with both good paying and flywheel because they're more advanced, they use the best practice of

50
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.870
not including email bundled into the hosting of the website.

51
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.920
So email hosting will have to be done in a different place, as you've learned in previous chapters

52
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.520
of the course.

53
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.230
And with Flywheel, one of the things that they specialize in is just making it easy for a freelancer

54
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:37.500
or a website agency owner to use the all inclusive platform to provide hosting for client sites as well

55
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.210
as within flywheel.

56
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.410
They have some of these features that include client billing client communications, which makes it

57
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.530
super easy to manage client websites.

58
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.400
And we'll go into a little bit more detail about the growth suite that Flywheel offers as far as things

59
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.580
that you're able to do managing your client websites.

60
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:07.500
Now, another thing that Flywheel offers is you can pass on the billing to your client.

61
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.490
And I just wanted to point out this about about flywheel hosting.

62
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:22.260
When you are hosting with Flywheel, you can choose to pay for your own bulk plan or multiple website

63
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.170
plan with flywheel in that you can host multiple websites for clients ET.

64
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.130
But you can also choose to build sites using the demo sites feature and then just pass on the billing

65
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.090
to the client.

66
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.750
And what this allows you to do if you'd like the client to pay for their hosting directly to their hosting

67
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.650
company at Flywheel, they can still have you as their support and their developer.

68
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:55.020
However, it places Flywheel as the first line of support in case the WordPress website goes down for

69
00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.900
some reason, or they're having an issue where they need to contact the hosting company, say, in the

70
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:07.050
middle of the night or something like that, Flywheel will offer their support directly to your client.

71
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:15.360
Skipping over you as the first line of defense as far as any hosting issues, I personally prefer to

72
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:22.860
provide hosting and website care to my clients directly for a price, and then I pay for those sites

73
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.590
myself within my hosting companies that I use, particularly grid pain at this point.

74
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.610
However, I never really have to, you know, have to answer questions in the middle of the night.

75
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:42.990
And rarely, if ever, do I have clients asking that to to access the hosting account behind their websites.

76
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.710
I just manage all of that for them, and because I manage it well with very good support and companies

77
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.170
like Grid Pain and Flywheel, I really never have any issues in the middle of the night or get any calls

78
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.120
from the client like that.

79
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.780
But some people prefer to pass the billing on through a company like Flywheel directly to their clients,

80
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.610
and that's something that you can do if you're just starting out.

81
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.070
Site Ground is a great shared hosting company.

82
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.620
And there's a few options here, but let's talk about pricing a little bit with a company like site

83
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:23.610
ground that offers shared hosting now shared, meaning that the servers that your websites are hosting

84
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:30.030
on are also shared by other clients that you don't know, and a site around is splitting larger servers

85
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.430
among many, many, many clients.

86
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:38.880
And so you potentially could have the noisy neighbor problem where client sites might get, you know,

87
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:45.540
flagged for spam, or they could get a whole bunch of traffic and a rush on resources.

88
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.700
And you're only left with the leftover resources in that case, and you don't really have control over

89
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.640
what other sites are doing on that server.

90
00:07:53.970 --> 00:08:00.030
And so I don't really recommend shared hosting for reselling client sites, but it is a good place that

91
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:06.810
you can start out as long as you're aware that you may need to migrate your sites to a stronger host

92
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:07.640
in the future.

93
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.110
And it is the way that I started out in my business.

94
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.800
So if you're starting out, it is a good way to get a low dollar hosting program.

95
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:24.090
If we work at the look at the hosting plans, the shared hosting plans site ground that they offer here.

96
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:30.540
You know, we've talked about this in the hosting section of the course before the start up.

97
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.060
I don't recommend because it's very limited.

98
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:39.870
It is the lowest cost, but it only allows for one website, and it also doesn't include a staging environment

99
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.870
for doing controlled updates and things like that.

100
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:50.430
And so starting with either grow big or go geek, you know you can get a certain amount of discounted

101
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.910
hosting if you pay for it all in advance, like up to a year or more.

102
00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:00.150
However, think of it as the real price, so this is a twenty four point ninety nine per month.

103
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.910
It does say unlimited websites, but you're limited in terms of your visit, number of visits and then

104
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.700
number of gigabytes of web space that you're allowed.

105
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:15.480
So starting with Groberg, I would probably only put up to 10 sites on that server and that shared hosting

106
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:15.810
plan.

107
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:23.790
Go geek, you might go from up to 10, maybe 20 static or brochure type simple WordPress websites,

108
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.480
but eventually you may want to move up from there.

109
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:34.680
And if you're already hosting email for those sites that is bundled within the shared website hosted

110
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:41.520
here, I know that's convenient to set up, but it's a little bit of a pain to migrate away from that

111
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:47.640
once you're already entrenched into the shared website hosting environment, especially with email bundled.

112
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.460
And so it's not a recommended spot.

113
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.420
Moving on and scaling, but it's a good place to start out with.

114
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.310
If you're just starting from scratch and you're getting some of your first client sites, then this

115
00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.670
is a good.

116
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:05.970
Place to start out now, a second does offer something called cloud hosting.

117
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:14.520
That is a little bit closer to a scalable, you know, server based website hosting program.

118
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.520
And I did host many websites.

119
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:26.130
I host between 40 and 60 client websites on a site ground cloud hosting program for many years, and

120
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.920
I do think that it's a great program.

121
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:36.660
Although looking at the overall cost per month and per year, I was able to move over to Flywheel and

122
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:44.310
then subsequently to grid pain and save a lot of money as far as my business's costs for even more power,

123
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.960
better support and more easily scalable services.

124
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:56.280
Also website cloning better staging a whole lot of advantages for moving to grid pain from this.

125
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:04.230
However, if you look at the say, jump start $100 a month gets you a four CPU core and eight gigabytes

126
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.920
of memory.

127
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.200
You know, server.

128
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.720
However, as you remember, you may remember looking as we talked about the hosting programs in the

129
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:21.720
hosting section of the course, you know, a four CPU, eight gig memory server only costs $20 a month.

130
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:29.760
And so what you're paying for here is the site ground layer of, you know, control panel and, you

131
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.900
know, email bundled.

132
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.680
You do.

133
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:40.130
You are able to control each of your client sites in a control panel based on web hosting W.H.

134
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:48.780
Am Control Panel, meaning web host management system so that you can control each of your client sites

135
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.500
individually.

136
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.740
And basically, what you're doing here is you're setting up your own shared website hosting plan, but

137
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.130
it's only shared between your own websites, your own client sites.

138
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.600
Same thing we're doing over here at grid pain, except it's just more expensive.

139
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:10.290
You do get good support with site ground and you're just not in control of your resources here.

140
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.730
And as you grow, it's going to go up as you go.

141
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:20.670
So, you know, an eight CPU, 12 gigabytes of memory might only cost you $40 a month at one of the

142
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.920
server plans if you're using something like good pain, but you could see that this is a bit more.

143
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.780
And so that is available.

144
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.290
But as far as site ground, it's a good place to start out.

145
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:36.600
And I would recommend the Groberg or the Go geek program for hosting multiple sites.

146
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:43.380
But above and beyond that flywheel is an excellent managed choice if you just want to leave it to the

147
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:51.120
professionals to manage the server and grid pain is a great sort of hybrid setup where you are having

148
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.790
really the best and fastest performance for any WordPress site in the world with the software stack

149
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.300
that they use.

150
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.280
You have 100 percent complete transparency over the servers that you're using, and you are able to

151
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.050
control scaling servers up and back down as needed.

152
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:13.080
And so the cost per website for multiple sites is going to be the lowest if you're using a system like

153
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.170
grid pain and getting your own servers yourself.

154
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.390
However, you do have to do a little bit of management and, you know, control where those sites are.

155
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.600
It is super easy with grid vein to clone and move sites between servers, and so that makes it easy

156
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.050
to use.

157
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:35.250
Also, if you are and be able to get to the developer account above and beyond the panel, you get the

158
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:40.080
best support there is of people that really know WordPress and really no system administration.

159
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:45.900
And so they can help you to manage scaling up and scaling back down or if there are any problems with

160
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.820
your WordPress sites.

161
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:53.190
So that's a good overview as far as hosting multiple sites for yourself or client sites and reselling

162
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:59.370
those as a part of your hosting and website care plans and the way that I would recommend moving forward

163
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.500
is one of those three paths.
