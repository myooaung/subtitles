00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.850
In this lesson, we'll set up a new free MailChimp account and connect it to a WordPress web site using

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.220
a plug in and the MailChimp API.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.250
You'll learn a simple method of using the plugin to display an opt in form on your cadence website,

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.290
hosted at Flywheel and connected to MailChimp to begin collecting emails easily.

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.850
By the end of this video, you'll understand how to connect MailChimp to a WordPress website.

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.680
Enable the MailChimp API key and display an opt in form on the website.

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.540
Let's look at setting up MailChimp to collect an opt in to an email list on a real world website example

8
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.880
and get started with a free service for building an email list.

9
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.650
Up to 2000 contacts.

10
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.880
So what I've done is I signed up for MailChimp, which go to MailChimp dot com.

11
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:55.980
I clicked sign up, just ask me for email address, etc. password and sent me a verification email which

12
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.730
I then went back and verified and then clicked.

13
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.280
Yes, I'm not a robot, and so I'm logged in and it brought me to the account setup page and I can click

14
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.490
this free account.

15
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.240
It was already pre-selected for me with a 2000 contact maximum, and I can just click next.

16
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.010
So there's a few things that it wants, of course, in order to send broadcast or marketing emails.

17
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.960
You need a few things like a business name.

18
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.230
The website URL and phone number are optional, but it's going to ask you some things that are required

19
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.720
for the international anti-spam laws.

20
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.550
There you can use.

21
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.550
You can use a physical address alternative.

22
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.350
You can put an address in.

23
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.530
You can use a P.O. box.

24
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.010
And so I'll just pause the video while I put that stuff in.

25
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.510
And then we'll get started setting up a WordPress site to collect email addresses as if we were setting

26
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.240
up a website for ourselves or for a client.

27
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.340
So after putting in the address here, if you already have contacts, you could say yes and it'll let

28
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.120
you know or bring you to the airport where way of importing your contacts through a CSV file or another

29
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.450
way.

30
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.490
And so I'll just click No and then click Continue and then just asks you a little bit about what you're

31
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.940
doing.

32
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.270
Do you intend to sell?

33
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.500
No, I'm just going to click No and continue.

34
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.530
And this is whether you're going to receive emails, whether you choose to receive marketing emails

35
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.880
from MailChimp itself.

36
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.280
And then this is how you'd like to start.

37
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.760
And so really, I'll give you a little tour of how to set things up over here.

38
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.590
Really, what you'll do is not send the first email or an automation or build a website they can host

39
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.740
for you because we already have is a WordPress website.

40
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.690
And so if you scroll down here, it says there's one on the audience that's that's me.

41
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.540
And so really, all I need to do is look at the audience page itself.

42
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.490
This is the audience dashboard, and if I look under signup forms now, I can go to the sign up form

43
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.480
for this audience.

44
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.030
Now, under one MailChimp account, you can create separate audiences.

45
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.090
Those would be like separate email lists so you can manage multiple businesses through one account if

46
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.480
you like.

47
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.390
But now I know that each one of those contributes to the 2000 contact limit.

48
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.850
So I would recommend if you're setting up multiple lists to set up a new account for each one.

49
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.670
So you have that full 2000 person limit for each one of the businesses or websites that you're setting

50
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.880
up.

51
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.900
And so from here, you would go to the under sign up forms, go to the form builder.

52
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.960
You can click over here or click Select Over on the right and it tell it brings you to kind of a form

53
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.760
that MailChimp will provide for you, that you can embed on a website.

54
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.530
And we're going to do this a little differently working with WordPress, meaning we're going to use

55
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.980
a MailChimp enabled plug in there kind of just does this automatically once you connect it via the API

56
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.750
to your MailChimp account.

57
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:26.150
And so we can just leave this as it is, or if we want a very, very simple contact form, we can get

58
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.790
rid of first name and last name.

59
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:37.220
So, you know, if we just select that and it'll highlight yellow, we can click Delete and you have

60
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.000
to click Delete in our caps to confirm that.

61
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.030
And let's get rid of the last name field also.

62
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:55.850
And just make this into an email address only with a subscribe button, and then so that's the sign

63
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:56.360
up form.

64
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.870
You can also configure things like the confirmation thank you page, a welcome email when they sign

65
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.700
up and those sorts of things.

66
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:13.220
But once we've configured the form itself, then we can actually go back to just sign up forms here

67
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.550
and look at embedded forms.

68
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.190
And this is where it brings us to, you know what the form would really look like if we embedded it

69
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.240
on the web site?

70
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.890
And you can just click continue and and you can actually just take and copy this code and place it in

71
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:39.530
a code block or another raw HTML block on a WordPress web site and embed this this form, and it'll

72
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.050
be a working form on your WordPress web site.

73
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.080
But let's do it a little bit more advanced.

74
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.600
Let's return to forms just to get back here and under the account.

75
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.630
If you just click the account profile, pic right here and click Account.

76
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.060
Let's go over to extras and API keys.

77
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.600
What we want to do is create an API key that we can use on the website with a MailChimp powered plugin.

78
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.130
And so we don't have any API keys, so just click create a key.

79
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.330
I know it's created a key if you're going to create multiple keys, you can label it.

80
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.170
But just for convenience, I'm just going to click to highlight and click control.

81
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.860
See, I'm a keyboard to copy that.

82
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.510
And now I have the API key on the clipboard, and this is always copy about later.

83
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.970
If you just navigate to your account page and then under Extras API keys, you can get access to your

84
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.260
API keys there.

85
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.380
And so let's go to an active website.

86
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.650
I've got my flywheel cadence website that we created open in my flywheel account.

87
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:57.120
And here's the Greg Davies cadence WordPress dashboard, and in another tab, I've got the website itself

88
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.540
open.

89
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.080
If you remember, the home page looks like this.

90
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:09.120
And I figured maybe right on the home page here on the left hand side, we could put an opt in form

91
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.940
for joining the newsletter right on the home page there.

92
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:20.850
And so I'll go back into the dashboard and go to plug ins, add new and I'm going to look for a particular

93
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.030
MailChimp plug in if I just type the word MailChimp.

94
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.500
Let's see what we get here.

95
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.230
There's a bunch of different choices, right?

96
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:35.190
I look for plug ins that have a lot of active installations and that have, you know, a good reputation

97
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.530
and have been updated lately.

98
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:37.860
Right?

99
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:45.960
And so here's the actual MailChimp plug in, and I've honestly had better luck using a plug in not maintained

100
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.460
by MailChimp itself.

101
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:54.540
Well, this one looks like it has been updated etc and so I wouldn't hesitate to use this one with 800000

102
00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:01.210
active installations, but I do recommend this MailChimp for WordPress plug in by Iberico.

103
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.330
It's been working for years and years.

104
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.680
They do keep it updated.

105
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:11.250
There's two million active installations, so I'm just going to click Install now and then click the

106
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.210
Activate button.

107
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.990
And so now we have at MailChimp for WordPress activated and I can click settings right here.

108
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:25.950
Now it says it's not connected, but all I have to do is paste my API key right there and click save

109
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.610
changes.

110
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.830
And it says that it's connected and then you can go to your lists here.

111
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:39.120
If you have multiple lists, then you can choose which list each of your forms you want to to join on

112
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.840
this website.

113
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:46.530
And so now that I have that connected, I go over here under the MailChimp for WordPress Settings panel

114
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.630
on the left side and click form.

115
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.510
And now I can just I can have a forum title.

116
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.680
And then here's where you select which MailChimp list should this form subscribe to?

117
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.960
That's the name of the list I could click.

118
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.130
Add new form.

119
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.170
Of course, I never selected a title.

120
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:08.190
I can just select newsletter, a newsletter often.

121
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.400
I think this will probably just be a title for me.

122
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.480
And and let's say I can choose to add some different fields.

123
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:23.160
I really just want the email address and the sign up button right there.

124
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:30.020
So once I have that, I can click save changes because I say I changed the name of the form.

125
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.120
And then you can have some things change here, like when you opt in.

126
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.250
When a user opted in, opt into the form.

127
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:46.800
This will pop up and in order to give them a success message or an invalid email address message or

128
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.700
things like that.

129
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.930
And then there are other settings specific form settings.

130
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.500
So use the double opt in yes or no.

131
00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:02.520
So you know, it's a good idea to have a double opt in enabled to prevent any kind of conflict with

132
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.990
spam laws or anything like that.

133
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.750
What a double opt in means is that the person who signs up from the form doesn't really join the email

134
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.360
list until they get their email.

135
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.180
The first email you send them and they click the confirmation link.

136
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.050
And so using the double opt in, you can click yes or no right here.

137
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.920
You can update existing subscribers, meaning instead of creating a second subscriber, you can just

138
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.850
update an existing subscriber if they join that list again.

139
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.020
And there's other different changes you can make down here as well.

140
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:40.950
The appearance of the form, you can inherit it from the theme, or you can use some themes that they

141
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:41.910
include right here.

142
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:48.180
Let's just take or even just choosing basic would be like no styling and just would come from from MailChimp

143
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:48.900
itself, I think.

144
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:55.200
But let's let's choose in here from cadence theme, and we could see what this looks like.

145
00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:03.400
And so all you do is select the shortcode and I'll click Control C to copy the shortcode now, and I

146
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:11.050
have everything so created and selected, so I'll go to all pages and that homepage and which is my

147
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.640
front page home right here.

148
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.530
It'll open up the block editor.

149
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:20.200
Now, of course, if you were already navigating to your own page and you want to edit that page, if

150
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.540
you're logged in, you get this edit page button as well.

151
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:27.250
But I'm going to go here and we're looking at now, the block editor here.

152
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:34.360
And suppose I wanted to do something like, you know, instead of having this, this profile right here,

153
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.040
I'm just going to have.

154
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.430
Join our newsletter.

155
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.160
I like the typography here.

156
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.490
It looks nice.

157
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.400
I'm going to remove all these blocks.

158
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:59.940
So that I have room I can leave, maybe this text block to talk about, like announcing what you'll

159
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:07.920
get if you sign up from with the newsletter, you know, and then just below it, what I might do is.

160
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.400
And a short code block.

161
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.210
So I'm just going to click there and click Control V and paste it, and let's click Update.

162
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:26.200
Now that's showing me the shortcut, but if I go to the homepage and click Refresh, see what I got

163
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.380
here.

164
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.450
Oh, nice, and in your email.

165
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.720
And this might be a description about joining the newsletter.

166
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.930
And so, you know, I'll just go.

167
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.230
Put my leverage WP scam email address and.

168
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.260
Click sign up, OK?

169
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:48.050
There's my sign up confirmation, all right, so let me check my email.

170
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.410
Oh, I've already received it.

171
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.240
I'm looking over at my other monitor.

172
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.830
I've received a MailChimp.

173
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:57.990
Email.

174
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:59.670
You know, this is great.

175
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.140
Let's see.

176
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.060
Can I bring this over into the window?

177
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.370
Sure.

178
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:14.440
Just bring this over here, says, please, please confirm subscription if I allow, it gives me a little

179
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.060
MailChimp link, of course.

180
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.240
And yes, subscribe me to this list.

181
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:26.200
And then so here it's asking me to confirm that I'm not a robot so that I will subscribe.

182
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.610
And I've just now double opted in to the website.

183
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.930
And so that's as simple as that.

184
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:40.330
Now, if I go back to the MailChimp account, let's look here at the audience dashboard.

185
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:46.180
And actually at all contacts under under the audience, I should now have to.

186
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:46.810
There we go.

187
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.150
So I've just joined the email list.

188
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.970
I'm subscribed.

189
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.980
It has the date.

190
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:59.410
So now within MailChimp, all I would have to do is go to an email campaign and click Create a campaign.

191
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:07.300
And now it's opening up, you know, a an email designer that I can use within MailChimp, which is

192
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.110
quite powerful.

193
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:15.970
And when I choose, you know, the the recipients and the from address the subject, and you can then

194
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.260
design the email using the classic builder or the new builder.

195
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.040
It looks like here and you can even save templates that you build from.

196
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:30.380
They have a lot of templates that you can start from here and you can build and send your group email.

197
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.960
It's as easy as that.

198
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:36.970
What a great system to be able to use to collect emails and build an email list for free.
