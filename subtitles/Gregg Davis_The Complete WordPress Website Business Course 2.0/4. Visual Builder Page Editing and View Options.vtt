00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.880
In this lesson, we'll explore all the page wide controls in the Disney visual builder interface across

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.020
the bottom of the page.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.390
You'll see how to navigate the different sections, utilize the edit history, look at the different

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.310
screen sizes while building for mobile responsivity and the wireframe view.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.770
By the end of this video, you'll understand the page controls in Divij to be able to navigate while

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.100
looking at the design as it looks on the front end to the user.

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.130
Now, oftentimes when I'm editing and building sites with DV, I will keep a second tab open with the

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.840
live site here and another tab with the dashboard open where I need to do dashboard or appearance customizer

9
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.180
or device settings over here.

10
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.210
And when I want to edit content on the pages, I'll go over here to the live site and I'll use the Enable

11
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.580
Visual Builder button.

12
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.830
And so this then again puts the layer of editing on top of the actual content of the site as it will

13
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.410
look and down here at the bottom.

14
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.580
This purple button, you can open and close this page wide toolbar here, and I just wanted to show

15
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.240
you around this a little bit before we end this lesson and go on to the next one.

16
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.780
But that I showed you the save button over here on the right.

17
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.920
One thing that you have over here on the right as well is a find button, but in the middle is a Layers

18
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.550
tab, and this opens up a little window that shows you the different sections and then how they are

19
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:38.130
nested within each other and all the way down to the module level for what the different sections are

20
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.390
similar to the WordPress editor when you're looking at the block editor of a page.

21
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.080
The list view and so that's a good place to get around.

22
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.520
If you click one of them, it'll show you, especially if it's not labeled yet, which is something

23
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.880
that will.

24
00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.900
I'll show you how to label those in the administrative section anyway, but it's an easy way to find

25
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.220
what you want to work on.

26
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.770
I generally don't open that very much, but it's good to know that it's there across the bottom.

27
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.140
Here in the middle, there are a few different things.

28
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.240
This is a portability button which opens up an exporter and importer so that you can actually export

29
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.050
your whole page layouts into a file.

30
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.640
It's a dot JSOC or a Dot Jason file that you can export and then import into different websites or even

31
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.450
the same website.

32
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.590
You can also import JSON files, and that's this is where you would do that.

33
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.360
If you get JSON files from, say, the Elegant Themes blog, for example, for page layouts.

34
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.360
And we'll be importing JSON files as we used the theme builder to build custom headers and footers and

35
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.080
things like that.

36
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.820
But that's where that exists.

37
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.610
There's also this revisions and editing history section right here with the little clock.

38
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:05.040
You can go right back to different places that are saved within the divvy builder here and save them

39
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.290
to past instances.

40
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.810
And so it's easy to go back and you won't, you know, you have a very low chance of losing any of your

41
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.890
work, for example, or if you make a mistake and you kind of go down the road and you're like, You

42
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.550
know, I don't like the way that looks, I want to go back four steps.

43
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.580
You can use that to go back in your editing process.

44
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.580
There's the settings, which gives you the page title and just a few other things which I've showed

45
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.450
you before and then to the left of the open and close button here.

46
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.670
There's a way just to clear the layout so you can just start over again from scratch and then save to

47
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.140
the DV library.

48
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:52.410
This is to save an entire page layout to a place that exists over here under Devi Devi library.

49
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.700
Now, right now, if I open Devi Library, you can see that there's nothing there.

50
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.090
And it looks like just a list of something pages or posts.

51
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.020
These are layouts that don't appear on the front end of the website, but they're saved layouts that

52
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.070
you can save.

53
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:15.000
And not only can you save complete pages using this down arrow, but you can save things like, you

54
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.440
know, just a single module.

55
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.280
For example, the down arrow here would allow you to save this module and label it to that Devi library.

56
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.720
So if I were to go like this, you know, save this entire page.

57
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.610
This is called the home page.

58
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.630
So this is, you know, agency home just so I know what it is.

59
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.590
You can also categorize them and click Save to Library.

60
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:45.390
Now, when I go back over to the library and refresh the TV library, now I have that agency home here

61
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.260
in the library.

62
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.170
And you can bring it in to a blank page any time you want to, including.

63
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.460
You can do that with sections and you can do it with row layouts and you can do it with individual modules

64
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.400
and we'll be playing with that.

65
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.420
Later, also, and then finally, this plus this is where you would just load a layout from the library

66
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.930
and so you can actually load from the elegant themes library if you have a page open just like we did

67
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.050
before, and you can look at your saved layouts.

68
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.380
Now this is navigating itself to where I showed you here in the layouts of the Disney library.

69
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:31.030
And so this layout, this button will only import full layouts like full page layouts that you've saved

70
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.660
in the library.

71
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.000
It won't show you individual sections or row layouts or modules.

72
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.960
You can get those from within the page itself.

73
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.830
And then you can even import or clone existing pages, and then you get to choose whether you want to

74
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.430
replace the existing content or just add to it.

75
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.410
So you can close that right here.

76
00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.850
And then finally, the mobile responsive settings over here, these are a good way to look at the site

77
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.820
as you're designing in the visual build there.

78
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.390
For different page types and screen sizes, you can do screen sizes just like I showed you in the last

79
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:17.380
section in the browser, as well as you can drag it left and right to see you know how the site responds

80
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:24.100
in terms of different sizes, and you can click these three kind of a standard phone view, a standard

81
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.800
tablet view and then back to the desktop view for whatever size your browser is at the moment.

82
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.150
Then finally, over here is the wireframe view.

83
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:41.260
And if you're familiar with DV from a quite a while ago, this used to be the only view in DV.

84
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:48.040
But this gives you a nice way to edit and move around the different sections, and it gives you a great

85
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.680
idea of how they're nested together so that you can see that, OK, Blue is four sections.

86
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.930
Then within that section you have rows and this is a two column layout.

87
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.310
And then within the left column, there are four three text modules and a button.

88
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:10.330
And on the right hand side, there are no modules, and that's what makes up this layout here.

89
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:18.250
The top section has a two column layout and there are three text modules and then a button module.

90
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.990
And over here, the background of the section is showing through.

91
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:31.180
And if you if you open up the gear icon on any of these toolbars, you'll see what the how that background

92
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.640
color or other options are set.

93
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.540
And so there's actually no background here in the section.

94
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.040
The background that we're seeing here is within the row layout.

95
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.910
So within this row layout, I can see that there's two columns.

96
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.690
Let's look at see see if there's a background, OK?

97
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:57.370
So there's a background color as well as a background image, and you can see this this little kind

98
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:06.400
of half circle, quarter circle image that's overlaying on top of this background color and that exists

99
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.650
in the entire row.

100
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:15.880
And so there's also two columns on top of that in the right hand column, I would suspect that it has

101
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.770
a background image, and there it is.

102
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.210
And that's how that's built.

103
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:25.210
You can take apart these pre-designed layouts and divvy to learn how they're created so that you can

104
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:31.480
use that knowledge in your design process in the future as you either modify layouts that you import

105
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.240
or create your own from scratch.

106
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:39.790
One of the greatest things about the layout library from Devi and elegant themes is that all of these

107
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:47.500
graphics and images and everything that icons everything that you can possibly import on any of the

108
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:54.730
layouts is commercially available for you to modify and use as much as you want.

109
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.470
I mean, there's no attribution needed.

110
00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.560
There's a lot of stock photography and awesome graphics that you can find throughout all the available

111
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.190
layouts.

112
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.700
And when you hit Exit Visual Builder over here, then it'll ask you if you want to save your changes

113
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.980
or not or discard an exit.

114
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:18.250
And before we do that, just one last thing over here on the side in this gray toolbar, this is these

115
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.350
are some settings for the builder itself.

116
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:26.050
And if you change any of these, they'll be persistent throughout your site for future edits that you're

117
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.510
making on different pages.

118
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.750
And so there are different settings for what you want to have in the toolbar.

119
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.870
And, you know, for example, the page creation flow when you create a page.

120
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:45.460
Remember, I showed you those three options you could clone a page, you could bring in a pre-made layout

121
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.830
or you can start from scratch.

122
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.750
And that's give me a choice.

123
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.130
But you can have it.

124
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.210
Just choose one to save yourself a step.

125
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.180
If you always use one of these, you can just change that there.

126
00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:58.930
So those are your.

127
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:05.500
Builder wide and site wide builder settings right here again, once you make those changes, don't forget

128
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:14.440
that even after hitting this green checkbox on a module or a section or row, you still need to go over

129
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.990
and click Save here on the right hand side.

130
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:23.200
And if it's not open yet, you definitely need to open this and click Save.

131
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.230
If you fail to do that and you click Exit Visual Builder or navigate away from the page, then what

132
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:34.510
it'll do is bring up this unsaved changes warning and so you can say save and exit.

133
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.310
For now, I'll just hit, discard and exit, and then it opens the live page.

134
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.870
And that's what I mean by designing here on the live site.

135
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:49.660
I'll set up all these pages with a navigation, so then I can go through and I can open each of the

136
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.700
pages as a live page.

137
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.940
I can look at it and then say, OK, I'm ready to edit this.

138
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.130
I click Enable Visual Builder.
