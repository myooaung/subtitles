00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.960
In this lesson.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.960
We'll expand on the concept of pointing domain names through controlling the DNS records at a separate

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.560
provider.

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.310
You'll learn how a Cloudflare free account can be used for DNS and also for the most affordable domain

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.030
registration.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.850
By the end of this video, you'll understand the power of Cloudflare as a separate DNS provider, as

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.250
well as one of the best domain registrars.

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:33.000
Now, a different setup is, and a little bit better is to bring your DNS control away from your website

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.600
host and let it stand alone over here.

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.420
And so I'm using a company called Cloudflare.

11
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.410
And let's take a look.

12
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:50.220
Cloudflare is a great company for controlling the DNS of websites, its Cloudflare dot com.

13
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.630
And when you when you sign up with Cloudflare for one of your domain names, the DNS service is free.

14
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.400
You can use a free DNS service.

15
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.660
They do have paid services, which include some more above and beyond extra services.

16
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:11.490
But even at this point in my business, I use the Cloudflare free version for controlling the DNS and

17
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.200
pointing the website traffic to the web host.

18
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.880
And so here is an example of I bring it back here.

19
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:30.690
You can use Cloudflare to control your DNS so you can point the website traffic using in a record and

20
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.800
using, you know, the sea name record to the website, while at the same time pointing email traffic

21
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.560
to an external email host.

22
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.160
Like I've recommended, it's a best practice to host email addresses and email itself at a different

23
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.600
provider from your website.

24
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.350
And so by taking control of the DNS, that is the way that that is controlled.

25
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.960
Let's scroll down a little bit here in the document into the domains and DNS section in my little leverage

26
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.420
WP framework document here, and let's talk about domain names.

27
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.630
So again, the cost associated and then hosted costs for domain names is quite low.

28
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.070
And this is what I wanted to address in this first video about domain names.

29
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.710
After that little introduction, the I'm not using the blue color here because domains are not really

30
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.190
hosted.

31
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.160
You're just renting the domain name and then defining where you want to point the traffic that goes

32
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.210
to that domain name.

33
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.610
And that's where the DNS system comes in.

34
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:45.150
So I'm suggesting that you use the inexpensive Cloudflare service not only for DNS registration, but

35
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.760
also for domains and domain registration because it's the least expensive.

36
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.210
They have just released out of beta their domain registration system.

37
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.680
And let's just take a look back to the website here and compare.

38
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.590
If you go under any in your Cloudflare account under registrar, you can register, transfer or manage

39
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.610
your domain names there.

40
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.690
And if I just look for a fictitious domain name that I don't own.

41
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.850
Greg Davis websites dot com.

42
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.090
If I look, I can see that I can get a dot com domain name at Cloudflare for eight dollars and fifty

43
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.930
seven cents a month.

44
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.810
Now, one of the big things about Cloudflare and why I recommend them is that not only are they a great

45
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.710
DNS and domain name service company, and they give you a lot of benefits for running your traffic through

46
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.210
their service, even for free.

47
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.560
But now that they are a registered registrar for domain names, they don't mark up the registrations

48
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.190
at all.

49
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.530
They charge you whatever it costs them to register the domain names with internet.

50
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.380
The International Domain Name Registration Authority.

51
00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.450
And so if you look at Gray Davis websites, dot com, for example, if I wanted to purchase or rent

52
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.510
this website domain, then I would pay eight seven a month for that.

53
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.240
Now let's compare that to over at GoDaddy.

54
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.670
Now I still do have domains registered at GoDaddy, and I've recommended them in the past because that

55
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.180
is their core expertise as a domain registrar.

56
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.450
And so if I were to look for Greg Davis websites dot com here at the GoDaddy, it's a little bit more

57
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.680
convoluted and you have to kind of navigate what they're doing here for you, but they will give you

58
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.730
this domain name for one penny for the first year as long as you agree with a two year registration.

59
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:47.540
And then after the first year, the second year is charged at whatever the cost is for.

60
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.110
Dot com domain names and that at Good Eddie is 1899.

61
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.130
So GoDaddy charges eighteen point ninety nine cents per year for dot com domain names, even though

62
00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.670
the.

63
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.270
Real cost is 857 with internet for those domain names.

64
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.040
Now you do get your first year for for a penny at dot com domain names.

65
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:18.490
Here's the 1899, but you are forced to start with a two year registration.

66
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.600
So even if you take advantage of this sale, you're actually still paying a little bit more than you

67
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.050
would be paying for two years at Cloudflare.

68
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.310
Cheap is another domain registrar that is a very well-respected registrar that costs a bit less than

69
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.270
GoDaddy as well.

70
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.280
But at this point, there's nothing better than Cloudflare for domain registration.

71
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:49.720
And one other thing if you're using Cloudflare anyway for your DNS and controlling the DNS records of

72
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.690
your domain names, then it's just that much easier to register your domain names there, too.

73
00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:03.070
Right now, I'm in the process of transferring all my GoDaddy account domain names over to cloud Cloudflare

74
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.360
before they expire.

75
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.780
It's easy to do, and I'm saving myself about half per year for each domain name.

76
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.510
Now you can see that there's different suggested extensions available as well.

77
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:24.940
Dot com and Dot Net are some of the most inexpensive extensions, but you can see that Dot online costs

78
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.290
$25 a year.

79
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.110
Dot Lt'd is 15 bucks.

80
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.560
Dot Blog is a $20 per year commitment.

81
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.780
These are all the real costs with no markup when you look under Cloudflare.

82
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.180
And so I would recommend that you register domains and search for them at Cloudflare.

83
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:50.110
If you already are registering domains and have domains hosted and registered as places like GoDaddy

84
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:56.590
or at your website host, I would suggest that you look at transferring domains into Cloudflare because

85
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:03.160
I find that it's it's going to be some of the fastest performance and the most convenient and of course,

86
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.830
most important, the least expensive.
