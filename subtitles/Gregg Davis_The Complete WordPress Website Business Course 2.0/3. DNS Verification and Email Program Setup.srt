1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,400
In this lesson, I'll show you around one of the live email hosting systems at Rackspace that I use

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,180
in my business.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,630
You'll learn how I set up hosted email and verify the domain with DNS records and how to get the credentials

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,780
needed for setting up an email program, as well as how you can set up email aliases at a domain instead

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,090
of creating additional paid email accounts.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,030
By the end of this video, you'll understand the concepts around hosted email at a custom domain, including

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,940
the DNS records for verification and the email server, hostname and port numbers required for your

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,280
own or your client's email program set up.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,390
Let's take a look at an example of how I've set up a custom domain name email address using the rackspace

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,580
service that I often use for client work.

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,720
Now this is a domain name of mine leveraged WP dot com.

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:57,180
You're probably familiar with, and I've set up my new domain as well as a new email address here at

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,900
Rackspace.

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,890
And when I set that up, it did force me to choose, of course, the email address, but then a password

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,790
and that.

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,500
So the email address is.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,090
The username and password, of course, is the email password.

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,920
And so you'll need to remember those or write them down to be able to deliver those to your client.

19
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,340
If you're setting up email addresses for your client.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,560
So now, once I have this email set up, this is now a live hosted email address at Rackspace.

21
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:37,200
I can go over into the setup tab over here and it you can open this client config tool, which opens

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,740
another tab and makes you log in and gives you a little information about setting up email.

23
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,630
And so there is a wizard that will walk you through different email clients like Mac Mail for the Apple

24
00:01:51,630 --> 00:02:02,190
Mac or Mozilla Thunderbird or Microsoft Outlook, depending on your website email program, and that

25
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,980
that can give you the right credentials and everything.

26
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,700
But here on the left hand side are really the only other credentials that you need to set up an email

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,980
program like Mac, Mail or Outlook.

28
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,340
And so you need an inbound, secure email server Gqom hostname.

29
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:26,850
So that's the inbound host for incoming email, and it also gives you a reference to a port number and

30
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,370
then you'll need an outbound email host and that's the SMTP server.

31
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,010
And so it's either called the email server name or the email host you'll need to put into your email

32
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:46,740
program like Mac Mail or Outlook, and also on your iOS devices like your iPhone or an Android device

33
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,790
where you're checking your email.

34
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,390
Now, often clients and you might want to check emails on multiple devices and therefore, instead of

35
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,740
using Pop three or Pop three email, choose IMAP.

36
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:06,400
Instead, IMAP saves copies of the email on the server and it loads them on each device.

37
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,930
Keeping the email on the server until it's deleted and what that means is that those devices are all

38
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,510
synchronized with the email server so you can check email on your phone and then turn off your phone.

39
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,980
Open your computer.

40
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,340
That email can also be checked on your computer.

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,860
Now, when you delete it from your computer later, when you check email on your phone, it will also

42
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,560
be deleted out of your account on the phone.

43
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,730
So IMAP is synchronized email and it's the best way to go these days with hosted email.

44
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,540
So those are the only two pieces of information you need, along with the port numbers in order to set

45
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,070
up an email program.

46
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,910
So over here you also need to verify the email address and point your domain name properly.

47
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:59,970
So if I look at this domain name at Cloudflare, I have these DNS records for the leverage WP dot com

48
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:13,140
domain name and over at Rackspace, I was able to get the this information to set up the DNS.

49
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:21,090
So what I did was open up support, and I clicked how to and I've right clicked how to and opened it

50
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,620
in a separate tab right over here.

51
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,270
And then there's a get started with Rackspace.

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,580
Hosted email.

53
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,840
And then what I want to do is configure my domain to receive email.

54
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,150
And so once I did that, it scrolled me down to configure your domain to receive email and there's a

55
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,950
link to set up DNS records.

56
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,100
And so now, as I scroll down, it explains what this is all about, and then I can configure the DNS

57
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,360
to send and receive email.

58
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,270
And so I need to put these four records in my DNS for that domain name.

59
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,130
And all I do is use the at symbol or leave it blank at Cloudflare.

60
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,060
You use the at symbol to have it be for the domain name itself.

61
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:09,510
And then you can see here that I've created one text record and an Emacs record, another Emacs record

62
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,690
and then a C name record for Auto Discover.

63
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,410
And you could see that these email server Akamai reflected the host name the Amex one and Amex two that

64
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,100
also need a priority number Priority 10, Priority 20.

65
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:31,650
And it tells you all that over here at the The Help Document for Rackspace, Google Workspace for Gmail

66
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:37,740
set up will have this kind of information for you as well, and you need to verify and set up the DNS

67
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,380
entries so that sending and receiving email will work separate from the domain name pointing to your

68
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:43,890
website.

69
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,260
And so that's really all there is to it.

70
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,710
The TETO, which is time to live, you can just leave it by the default, usually as far as the way

71
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,790
Cloudflare works.

72
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,710
The TTL is on auto.

73
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,990
It kind of knows what it's doing as far as that.

74
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,040
But now I've got an email address set up at Rackspace with 25 gigabytes of storage at a protected and

75
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,850
managed IP address, which makes it easy for me to send and receive email and keep that separate from

76
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,280
my website IP address, which is here.

77
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,810
And so that's managed and the best practice as far as supporting hosted email for your sites and for

78
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,030
your client sites at custom domain names.

79
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:31,380
Now, if I wanted to, I could just go and click email Bayda here to create another address and forward

80
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,600
it to this existing address here at Cloudflare.

81
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,320
Or it could forward it to any address I like, and that's just a way to create aliases of this email

82
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,490
inside of Cloudflare.

83
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,730
But also, Gmail allows for this as well.

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,380
But inside of Rackspace, you can also add an unlimited number of aliases that will basically forward,

85
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,000
you know, extra email addresses.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,780
If I want to have one that was something like info at leverage WP Dotcom and just have that forward

87
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,210
to my real email address that's called creating an alias.

88
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:12,090
And so I often use that to create additional email addresses instead of paying a fee for each email

89
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,540
address.

90
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,400
And so that's really the all.

91
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,420
All it takes to set up, send and receive email at custom domain names.

92
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,100
And I hope that was helpful for you.
