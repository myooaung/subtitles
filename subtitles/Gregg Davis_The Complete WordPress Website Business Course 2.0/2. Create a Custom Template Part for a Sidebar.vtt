00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.630
In this lesson, we'll convert the sidebar into a sitewide template part and also edit the navigation

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.500
links in the site.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.260
You'll learn how to make any content area into a template for use in other parts of the site, making

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.770
it available as a global element that can be changed sitewide later.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.150
You'll also customize the navigation links in the header and footer by the end of this video.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.270
You'll understand how to create template parts to be used globally, and also how to change navigation

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.590
menus into custom links that can be different for various pages of the site.

8
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.610
On the about page, in the 2022 theme that we've created, we have a section here that shows the latest

9
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.220
three posts, says latest posts, and then on the right hand side in the previous section, you might

10
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.150
have remembered we created a view all button, which would lead to our blog page.

11
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.100
Right now, it doesn't click anywhere.

12
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.790
It just has a hashtag in the URL you can see up here.

13
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.210
And so really, we just need to edit the about page and go in there and make that link correct.

14
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.220
So you just go to pages all pages and we'll go to about.

15
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.320
And as we go down here, there it is, there's my view, all right, there all I do is click the edit

16
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.310
and now where am I going to come up with that new URL?

17
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.140
Well, I could just go over here if I right click my link there, I could say.

18
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.270
Copy, link, address and get rid of this hashtag and paste it right there.

19
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.550
Click there and click Update.

20
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.590
That should solve it.

21
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.110
Let's see.

22
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.820
We'll refresh the about page as I go down here if I click View.

23
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.900
All that brings me to the blog page with the sidebar.

24
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.190
Great.

25
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.740
Now here's another little project.

26
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.480
I know that the the blog archive template re-created is a, you know, kind of a self-contained block

27
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.510
pattern that has this sidebar on it.

28
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:03.100
What if we wanted to create this sidebar as a template part so that whenever we edit the content of

29
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.100
this template part, we could actually use this sidebar on multiple types of pages.

30
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.500
Maybe there's a category page that would be a category archive page or a different type of page that

31
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.410
we want to use this sidebar.

32
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.020
We might have a use case where you put, maybe, you know, an interactive Facebook sidebar widget,

33
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.380
something like that where you want to have that on all the pages of the site or particular pages where

34
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.120
that sidebar does show up.

35
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.790
There might be other pages like the film page, for example, that doesn't show the sidebar and then

36
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.640
particular pages you might go to that do show the sidebar like blog.

37
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.290
And so how will we go about that?

38
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.770
Let's go back into the dashboard again.

39
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.750
And if we go into appearance, Ed, let's see if we can define the template.

40
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.230
The sidebar as a template part over here.

41
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.290
So I'm going to go into blog and now I do have.

42
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.950
OK, let's see what we have in the list view right here.

43
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.290
This group is right here.

44
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.430
It includes both of them.

45
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.470
There's a query loop and there's a column block right now.

46
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.150
This column, that's a single column.

47
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.360
Here's the columns block and is defined as two columns.

48
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.380
The second column right here, you can see it outlined in Blue.

49
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.550
That's our sidebar.

50
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.930
And I wonder if I just click the three dots over here.

51
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.380
Look at that.

52
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.810
I can click make template part.

53
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.400
OK, so this is going to just be called sidebar.

54
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.460
And what kind of an area is it?

55
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.220
It's not a header.

56
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.170
It's not a footer.

57
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.980
It's just a different a general type of template part.

58
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.370
So I'll leave that selected and click Create.

59
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.010
Down here, it says template part created.

60
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.990
Now I can ex out of that.

61
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.760
Really, I didn't edit this template over here at all.

62
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.670
But if I go to template parts right here now, I have a sidebar template that is created by me, not

63
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.660
by the theme.

64
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.670
What that means is that if I use that sidebar template part within another page, maybe I've got a page

65
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.450
over here.

66
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.510
You know, I could edit this page.

67
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.750
And if I wanted every page on the website to have that sidebar, I could add that template part over

68
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.650
here on the side.

69
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.290
I'm not going to do that right now, but you can imagine the power of using these templates and template

70
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.710
parts to control global elements on the site.

71
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.060
Great.

72
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.720
Let's get into editing the navigation just a little bit.

73
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.860
If I go back, I'll just go back to the dashboard in the WordPress dashboard and open up the site.

74
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.340
There is, you know, we talked about these navigation items being a page list.

75
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.050
And so if I added a whole bunch of pages, every page I add will be added to this page list.

76
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.160
And it's often desired that we customize each of these links so that we can have a navigation menu that

77
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.370
is customizable, customizable to each page.

78
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:16.520
One thing I noticed is that on the film landing page, when we go back down to the bottom, it has a

79
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.150
home custom link, and it also doesn't show the blog because this is a different type of navigation

80
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.020
menu down here.

81
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:32.270
So let's take a look at what we can do to first add the blog archive page link down here to the footer

82
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.000
navigation on the film page.

83
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:42.350
So if I go down here, I'm going to go in the navigation in the I'm going to go in the WordPress dashboard.

84
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.360
Go to pages all pages.

85
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.000
And let's take a look at the film page.

86
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:55.910
If you remember, we created that footer down here as a specific footer just on this page, it's actually

87
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.530
within the page content.

88
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.580
And you know, this is using a blank template.

89
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.480
So a blank template in 2022 out of the box just has no header and it has no footer.

90
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.870
And so that's why we had to add the footer right here.

91
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.120
And so let's look at the list view again.

92
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.180
If you need a little bit of room while you're looking at the list view, you know you can always close

93
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.380
the right hand toolbar there with that settings gear icon.

94
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.890
And so if I go down here, let's take a look at what we have.

95
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.920
Down at the bottom, I can roll over things, as you remember in that blue line comes up.

96
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.330
So I've got a group here.

97
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.800
We put a spacer in.

98
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:44.990
There's a row there is a navigation right here and you can see that it has a home link and it has these

99
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.830
specific pages about event and film.

100
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.100
So let's go ahead and click that navigation right here.

101
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:59.780
And really, all we have to do is add another piece of navigation and that's done with the navigation

102
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:06.380
block selected by coming over here and using this plus button to add a block so we can add a custom

103
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.030
link or a page link.

104
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.940
Let's add a page link and then it'll give us, you know, recently updated list, or we can search the

105
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.900
pages on the site.

106
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.700
Let's add this blog page.

107
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.900
Great.

108
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:23.510
So let's put it in the same order that it was at the top of the other navigation menu, which was between

109
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.670
about an event.

110
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.670
And so if you can see instead of up and down, the arrows are left and right now, so I can take this

111
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.830
blog navigation link and move it left one and you can move it, left one more.

112
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.420
And there we go.

113
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.460
That looks great.

114
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.120
Let's go ahead and update.

115
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.650
Now we're updating a particular header navigation that was that was created down here, and that's fine.

116
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.380
This is the navigation header navigation seven.

117
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.480
So we'll just update that.

118
00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:01.090
I can go ahead and, you know, leave the page editor and let's go back and take a look at the film

119
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.290
page, I'll just refresh it.

120
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.480
Great.

121
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.750
That's going to show navigation to our blog page right from the bottom here.

122
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.670
We go back to the homepage.

123
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:18.610
Let's check out the next navigation up here, where it's showing in the header navigation.

124
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.110
You know, the four pages that we've created on the site itself.

125
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.950
Let's change these into individual custom links so we can limit what pages showing in the navigation

126
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.950
menu and also add a home link over here.

127
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.260
So it takes a little bit of experimentation.

128
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.180
If you edit the template part, you may have some spacing issues that you might have to deal with.

129
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:46.570
And I'll show you how I go about doing this and did it in the 2020 22 theme successfully.

130
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.160
So I'll go to Appearence Editor and let's go.

131
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.110
Open up the navigation and look at template parts and then the header.

132
00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:00.700
So that header is being used in all those different template parts and templates.

133
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:06.670
And you can see that if I open the list, view the navigation that we have over here.

134
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.160
On the right hand side is a page list.

135
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:15.580
And so the first thing you want to do so that we can preserve the layout and how these elements are

136
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.580
lined up with each other correctly.

137
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:26.710
Before we delete this or change it, just use this little add block button and let's begin adding links.

138
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.090
So the blog.

139
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.320
And a quick navigation again over here again, click the plus oops.

140
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:40.020
Sometimes it thinks you're clicking the actual link and not the plus button.

141
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.230
So we'll ad film again, click the navigation and this plus button.

142
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:56.330
To add a custom link, so we want to add the event.

143
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.140
And then seen to be working.

144
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.000
Let's see.

145
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:05.870
Oh, there it is.

146
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.700
It needs to go in there and search for it.

147
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:14.210
OK, so we have, let's see, blog film event and then the about page is the next one.

148
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:21.110
You can see these are dropping themselves in as individual custom page links in the navigation block.

149
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.250
So that's what we want.

150
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.110
Go and click the plus again.

151
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.750
So you thought I hit the event, but I didn't.

152
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.740
I hit the plus.

153
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.640
There we go.

154
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:35.030
The last one I want is about and I don't see it here, so I'm going to type about and let it search

155
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.390
for it.

156
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.310
It's a page.

157
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:36.830
There we go.

158
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:44.690
So now that I have these four in there, I can take this page list and just click Remove Page List.

159
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.430
We're almost there.

160
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.740
Let's put these in the correct order.

161
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.360
Let's see what we wanted here about blog, event and then film.

162
00:10:54.530 --> 00:11:00.140
So I want to take the about and I can just click the left arrow here and move it.

163
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.700
About blog and event and film.

164
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:06.600
I want to switch.

165
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:08.670
Here we go.

166
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:09.540
OK.

167
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:16.050
And then lastly, I want to add in the navigation menu a custom link to the homepage, so I'll click

168
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.860
Plus again.

169
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:22.860
This time it's not an existing page, so I'm going to type home with a capital h and you could press,

170
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.090
enter or click it.

171
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:31.920
Now I have home, but I need to click this little chain link to add the link and click the edit button.

172
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.620
And you can see the URL would be incorrect here.

173
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.840
So I'm going to go back and I'll just right click and say Copy Link Address on the home page link.

174
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.870
Or of course, you could just select this and then copy it, and I'm going to paste it.

175
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.590
We've been here and click that little arrow.

176
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.130
Finally, I just need to move this HomeLink over a little bit.

177
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:59.520
You could also drag it like there, but I'm going to use the little arrow.

178
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.410
OK, now I'm going to click, save and save one more time.

179
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.850
Now, if we take a look, the spacing usually gets messed up here.

180
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:16.460
All right, so now there's no space at the top, and then even below this, you know, head or group,

181
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.170
I need to add a little spacing.

182
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:28.190
It took a little experimentation, but what worked for me was to look at this group and add a spacer.

183
00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:38.540
And I'm going to move it up so that it's above and then make it 80 80 pixels, what is what looked the

184
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.050
best?

185
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.370
And then I'm going to go back to the list view again.

186
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.310
And from that group, I'll add another spacer.

187
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.260
Below, in this time, 60 pixels.

188
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.370
Looked about right.

189
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.440
I'll click save and save again.

190
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.120
And now, if I refresh the page, I've got the correct spacing.

191
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:11.470
So the home button works, the spacing looks good on the about page that looks good now on the blog

192
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.950
page.

193
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.460
You can see it still matches, even though it's the white background.

194
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.430
It's pulling that that header template part in there.

195
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.740
And so there's the blog page, the event page looking good.

196
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:29.950
And oh, on the event page, it looks like it's has a different header here.

197
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.420
And in the film page, of course, doesn't have the header because it's using that blank template.

198
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.790
So the reason is the the the event page, let me go back.

199
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.650
The event page is using a different page template.

200
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.530
And so we can add that header into the page template, and that will probably fix it.

201
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:59.570
OK, so what I did to successfully change the event page over and have the spacing work correctly was

202
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.020
that I edited that specific page.

203
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:09.080
No title template that we had created before, and I added the header template part that we were just

204
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:09.800
working on.

205
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:15.290
So I'll just walk you through what I did, and I went to appearence editor.

206
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:22.010
And, you know, I went over to the toggle navigation here and under templates.

207
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.740
I edited the page No title.

208
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.250
And then what I did was I went to the list view.

209
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:38.100
And I added, I went to this group and I went up to the ad a block, and I wanted to search for that

210
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:38.880
template part.

211
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:44.880
So I added the template part I clicked, choose existing and I clicked header.

212
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.650
And of course, now it's telling me the black cannot be rendered inside of itself.

213
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.120
And so, you know, that is what I did.

214
00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:00.510
And then I went in and I just, you know, selected the other header and I went here and removed that

215
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.390
group and then saved the template.

216
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.750
And then there was an extra spacer at the top.

217
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.400
I just needed to remove that spacer by clicking remove spacer here and again saved it.

218
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.070
And that's how it was able to be fixed.

219
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.920
So I'll go back without changing anything here.

220
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:24.990
And if we refresh now, we've got the home page with a nice navigation that's customized for whatever

221
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.460
pages we want it to include.

222
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:34.290
The home link is included in the event page and all the pages are working nicely.

223
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:35.490
All right.

224
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:41.400
A little bit convoluted to work with the different layouts inside of the site editor, but you can figure

225
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.830
out how it works and that's how it works with 20 22 theme with the site editor.
