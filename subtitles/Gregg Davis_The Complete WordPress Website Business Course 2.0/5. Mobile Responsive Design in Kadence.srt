1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,640
In this lesson, we'll continue editing the header, moving into the mobile responsive options to make

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,610
sure our design looks good on all screen sizes.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,760
You'll also learn how to view your results in the browser developer tools using the device toolbar and

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,620
then add an anchor link as we begin editing page elements by the end of this video.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,860
You'll be able to design for all screen sizes using cadence.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,860
Now, if you follow it along and edited the header along with me, you may have noticed something you

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,070
might want to fix, and I sure did that.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,320
This logo is quite close to the edge of the bottom of the header with its line in here.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:45,870
And there's also one other item that I'd love to change on this 14:13 Norman Street post that will show

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:53,280
you a few things about how to edit content and customize the look and feel of your website within the

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,420
cadence environment.

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:04,260
And so we'll go back to the customizer under appearance, customize, and let's look at the header layout

13
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,680
here.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,070
In fact, you can click right in the customizer.

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:15,690
You can click through to another page if you like, and if you're if you're done adding things to the

16
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:23,130
header over here and you want to hide that header editing area, the header builder, it's called,

17
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,450
you can hide it and you can always get it back by clicking this button down here.

18
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,970
But one thing I'd want, one thing I want to do is just change the height of this slight bit to get

19
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,610
this line a little more breathing room here.

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,240
My design sense says that on this header, I want to bring that down a little bit.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,460
So is it under header design?

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,180
No, this is just shows that whether it's sticky when you scroll, we're not going to do a sticky header.

23
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,370
We can maybe explore those options later, but it's not under header general.

24
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,510
But if we bring back the header builder, I'll get more options.

25
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:06,270
As you remember by clicking the gear icon on the main row because we're only displaying the main row

26
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,750
here, you can see that there's items in the main row and those rows are divided into a left, right

27
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,450
and centre areas where you can add content.

28
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,800
And we don't.

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,510
We're not using the top row or the bottom row, just two areas of the main row, left and right.

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,180
And so, you know, you can really you can see how you can just drag items around if I wanted to put

31
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,120
the primary navigation over here.

32
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:33,950
Oops.

33
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:41,370
Over here, for whatever reason there and I could, I could bring that over to the left side if I think

34
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,510
that looks better.

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,830
But let's bring it back over to the right side where it's supposed to be for this layout.

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,590
And let's continue looking at the header height here.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,030
So if I click that main road gear icon now, I'm customizing the header, but not just the header,

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,060
the main row.

39
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,120
And so right off the bat, I can see that there's a minimum height of 100 pixels, but let's bring that

40
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,200
up just a little bit.

41
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,990
I like about 130.

42
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:18,460
You can type in here and you can use the little up and down arrows, but to me, one 30 looks way better

43
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,960
and it doesn't really get in the way of the image because you can see through it.

44
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,670
And it definitely gives a little bit more breathing room, you know?

45
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,940
I actually do 126 as I look at it.

46
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,970
Um yeah, you can fine tune it however you like.

47
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,880
And now let's look at mobile responsive options here just a little bit, because this is a good place

48
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,000
to bring it up because you know, when you have a minimum height defined in pixels, then depending

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,070
on the person's screen size they're looking at the website on, it may change.

50
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,720
You may not want to have one hundred and twenty six pixel minimum height for the header.

51
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:05,420
So what you can do is use these three different screen size icons in any place that you're working with

52
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,150
in cadence.

53
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:13,290
If you see these three screen sizes here, it will allow you to make mobile responsive changes that

54
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:20,610
will be persistent and only be affected when the user's screen is at a certain size or below.

55
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,430
And so that's mobile responsive editing right there.

56
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,630
Very powerful.

57
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,200
So I clicked the tablet size and I can see that what happens with the tablet size is that the menu itself

58
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:39,990
goes to the hamburger icon and it goes to an overlay menu here instead of just a full menu.

59
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:47,490
And that's so that the menu items will fit correctly in the smaller header, and I can see that, you

60
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,550
know, this is a lot bigger than it needs to be.

61
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,860
And so it's it's the same as the desktop height right now.

62
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:02,670
But if I start to drag the slider back, I can make that height, you know, more like.

63
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,400
What do I like about minimum pixels about about 60 looks pretty good.

64
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,470
And let's look at it with.

65
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,740
The phone, you know, we might bring that back down to minimum height.

66
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,910
Well, it's actually got some padding that's not even doing anything.

67
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,310
So let's go ahead and take that away.

68
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's look at the tablet height and 60.

69
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,250
Also, the logo is very close to the top, so that's not ideal either.

70
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,760
Might be something that we need to change a little bit.

71
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:45,170
And so since I noticed that let's look, where are our options for the logo?

72
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,720
This is just the design for the main row.

73
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,470
Let's go back and under general.

74
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,580
Let's look at the logo options now for the logo options, we've got a logo.

75
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,540
Max width.

76
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:05,120
And when that max width is selected in the tablet layout, it goes back down to 150.

77
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,270
And you can see the spacing is not ideal right here.

78
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:15,080
And then down to the phone, 150 looks fine for a size because it doesn't get in the way of the menu.

79
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,260
And so that's not something I would change, but I will go into design and look at the padding.

80
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,720
So there's a 12 pixel padding.

81
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,180
Let's see what happens if I make that a little bit less.

82
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,760
Actually, I can just raise that up.

83
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,340
I like the zero padding actually a little bit better since I've added that space.

84
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,770
And now let's look at it in the tablet layout.

85
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,840
I want to now add some padding to the top of that logo that looks better.

86
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,860
Maybe 10.

87
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,050
And then how about the phone?

88
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,880
Yeah, there's a little padding at the bottom that I'll reduce.

89
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,080
And let's bring the padding up.

90
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,030
Here we go.

91
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,390
Yeah.

92
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,540
Like 10, maybe 10 pixels at the top, 10 at the bottom.

93
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,770
And then on tablet.

94
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:11,360
Let's see, yeah, like about I think, on tablet, I want to make the the size of of the header itself

95
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,110
a little bit bigger, but ten pixels, I would maybe bring that up.

96
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,960
A little bit more, even though it's not affecting it because of the header size.

97
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,610
So let's leave that the way it is right now, let's actually put a little padding at the bottom.

98
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,390
Got to make the header minimum.

99
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,570
Minimum height a little bit taller.

100
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,830
So let's go back to the header.

101
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,260
Design header, general, excuse me, and for the logo.

102
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,590
Let's make the design.

103
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,240
This is where I was.

104
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,910
Let's see, what do we have?

105
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,590
We had a little more padding at the top.

106
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,250
Yeah.

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,860
Let's go ahead and make that padding zero.

108
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:04,260
Let's go back back to the header and back to the main row of the header and under design.

109
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,890
No, I want it to be the minimum height.

110
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,340
There we go.

111
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,260
So 126, I had made that a little bit bigger than 100.

112
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,040
So yeah, I think I like, you know, 120.

113
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,560
Now that I've changed, the padding looks pretty good to me.

114
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,820
Let's look at another tablet.

115
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,730
Let's bring that bigger now since the padding.

116
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,150
I've reduced the padding, so yeah, I might leave that at 80 for the tablet view, that looks great

117
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,600
to me.

118
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,780
And let's look at the mobile phone view.

119
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,030
That padding looks great, too.

120
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,970
I might even let's bring the the minimum height down.

121
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,960
We had it at 80.

122
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,300
Let's bring the minimum height back down to about 70 for the phone.

123
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:47,580
Great.

124
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,620
Now that's looking a lot better, so click publish when you're done with your changes up here at the

125
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,400
top left at the top of the customizer editing screen.

126
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,920
I just closed the customizer.

127
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,510
And let's look at what we have over here on our 418 Norman Street page.

128
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, that's looking great.

129
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,170
All right.

130
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,030
And another thing that we can do is if we right click and click Inspect.

131
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,290
Or of course, in Chrome or in Firefox, you can you can go over to the panel for settings over here

132
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:24,330
and you can open more tools and you can go to the developer tools.

133
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,250
That's another way to open the dev tools.

134
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,180
And so when you're looking under the Elements tab here, you can click.

135
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,290
Right next to it is the toggle for the mobile responsive settings.

136
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:46,830
So that is the the device toolbar it's called, and that enables you to get a drag able, mobile responsive

137
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:55,020
inspector so you can see how the website acts at all device sizes so you can go out to whatever size

138
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,440
you want.

139
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,280
There's the break.

140
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,530
Points are actually illustrated here.

141
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,760
Tablet mobile, mobile apps mobile a medium mobile large.

142
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,830
And this is how the website is defined in the background for mobile responsiveness.

143
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,230
And so you can also go and open up here and say, OK, for iPhone 12 Pro, what's it look like?

144
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,590
And then you can see the mouse is a little shade here.

145
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,990
You could see what the menu looks like.

146
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:27,960
The mobile toggle, the device toolbar in the Chrome or the Firefox dev tools is really powerful.

147
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:36,510
And so you can also just, you know, you know, put responsive and then drag it and watch what happens

148
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,630
as you do that and you can close the DevTools with this little x ray up here.

149
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,430
So that's great.

150
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,980
We've worked with a little bit of the mobile responsiveness.

151
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:49,980
We've changed the visibility of the header, so it works on any page, no matter how light the image

152
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,910
is behind.

153
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:56,100
We've changed the spacing a little bit for the logo here and made it look really good.

154
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,930
The last thing that I'll show you within this video is this little view details button.

155
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,900
Now, when I when I click it, it doesn't do anything, but you can see from the URL at the bottom left

156
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:13,590
as you roll over and at the URL at the top since I clicked it, says hashtag info.

157
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,410
So that shows me that that's an anchor link.

158
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,710
And there's also another name for it.

159
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:26,700
But if you I can tell that, you know, because nothing happened to click view details, what you'd

160
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:34,170
want is for the user's browser to scroll the page down to about here to look at these details and the

161
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,190
description, right?

162
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,470
And so let's go back to the page editor and find and add that anchor tag.

163
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,290
Let's go ahead and go back here.

164
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,220
I'll go to pages all pages.

165
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,560
Let's look at 4:18 Norman Street again.

166
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:55,410
And as we scroll down and look here, I'm going to open the list view again to make it easy somewhere.

167
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,230
You know, first of all, I can look at view details.

168
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:07,500
This is just a paragraph, text link, paragraph, text block, I should say, and the link if you click

169
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,520
the link icon will will it'll pull up this.

170
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,730
You know, the link that's put in here is a hashtag info.

171
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:21,360
OK, so that you know, that's the hashtag info doesn't exist on this page, but where can it exist?

172
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,460
There's only a few sections or types of blocks.

173
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:32,490
I said sections, there's row layouts, and then there's headings that give you the ability to add an

174
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,960
anchor tag very, very easily in cadence under advanced usually.

175
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,960
And so let's go ahead and look at this section, not this section, but down here, there's the row

176
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,500
layout.

177
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:49,650
If I look at row there and look under advanced, what I have is that's what it is row layout and advanced

178
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,160
heading.

179
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,620
So under rollout, there's an HTML anchor field right here that I can add, and this link will open

180
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:02,850
enough up a new tab and it'll show you as a support page at WordPress.org about page jumps.

181
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,970
There were sometimes called an anchor link or an anchor tag, an HTML anchor.

182
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,670
And so Page Jumps give you the ability to program that into your theme.

183
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,360
And so cadence has taken care of it for us over here, where if there's a row layout, you can add an

184
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,910
HTML anchor here, but you can also add an HTML anchor to a heading.

185
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,940
So for example, if you had just a blog post or something with lots of text on the way down the page,

186
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,440
you could have each of your H 2s or 3s, each of your headings.

187
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:45,450
You could have those marked with a marked with a page jump tag or an HTML anchor tag.

188
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,550
And then at the top of your blog post, you could have a table of contents that's clickable and each

189
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,830
to each, each heading that you click, or each part of the table of contents that you click would scroll

190
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,430
the user down to that area.

191
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,320
And so that's a great thing to do for us at 4:18 Norman Street.

192
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,370
Let's add to the row layout the.

193
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:12,230
Info Anchor Link, and so all you have to do is go down to advanced and under HTML anchor, you just

194
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,560
use the word with no hash tag mark.

195
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,260
And so that was info, right?

196
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,890
Hashtag info and then just click Update.

197
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:29,210
And now if I go and refresh the page when I'm navigating, oh, I refreshed it to with the with the

198
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,380
info tag already there.

199
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,740
So if I refresh the page just with the regular URL, as it is as I'm looking at this, I can say, Oh,

200
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:43,130
click this view details that brings me right down to that section and leaves it in a nice, readable

201
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,550
area.

202
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:50,180
So those are page jumps and WordPress or what you might call anchor tags that we just added right here

203
00:14:50,180 --> 00:15:00,500
under advanced and also in the in the list view, it conveniently marked if you do have a row layout

204
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:10,070
block or an advanced heading block that has a page jump or an HTML anchor tag on it, it'll tell you

205
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,590
what that is right here in the list of you.

206
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,000
Very convenient.

207
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,810
Here's one.

208
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:20,300
There's one under heading here that's came in with our with our pre-made layout.

209
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,770
Our starter template.

210
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,660
And it says I'm interested.

211
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,610
And what's that?

212
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,780
It's the heading that says I am interested above the contact form right here.

213
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,530
Let me just close this so we can see it a little bit better.

214
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,420
So this I'm interested.

215
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:41,840
I dash m dash interested is a label on this H three tag, right?

216
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:51,350
So what I can do is if I if I click that that h three tag right here and I inspect the link, is it

217
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,220
right here on this heading?

218
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,510
Yeah, it is.

219
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,590
Somehow it's not marked right there on it.

220
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,190
But in any case, that just marks when you have an anchor tag.

221
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,240
Just like up here, the info anchor tag on this rollout makes it work for us.

222
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,610
So when we click view details, it scrolls us down to that part of the page.
