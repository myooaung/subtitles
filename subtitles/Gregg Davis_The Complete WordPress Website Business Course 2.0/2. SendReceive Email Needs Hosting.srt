1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,640
In this lesson, we'll explore a few different email hosting providers and the cost levels of each from

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,710
free to several levels of cost.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,650
You'll learn why I shared hosting that includes hosted email is not the best practice and how to host

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,130
email.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,380
Even when you're using a shared website hosted by the end of this video, you'll understand why and

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,660
when it's appropriate to provide email hosting for addresses at a custom domain name not only to look

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,850
professional, but to take advantage of better deliverability and plenty of email storage.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,930
Send and receive email is one to one email that requires a sender and a receiver, and the receiving

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,150
email address needs to have hosting.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,980
And so you might think of sending receive email as traditionally a free service, and it is with companies

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,370
that provide email like Gmail, for example, from Google.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,490
Now, if you look at Google Workspace here that I'm showing on my screen, you could see that Gmail

13
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:04,770
is also a possible paid service for your email at custom domains, so it could be, you know, your

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:08,490
name at your company, dot com, whatever the domain name is.

15
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,200
And in order to provide hosted email at a custom domain that is a paid service and it's worth getting

16
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:24,210
in order to host email at a business's domain, you can imagine it's much more professional to send

17
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:33,300
and receive email at a custom domain name like your name at business named outcome vs. business name

18
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,160
at gmail.com.

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:43,350
Now, just using your personal Gmail or a business name at gmail.com email address is something that's

20
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,100
done a lot.

21
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,280
It's just more professional to have email addresses at your custom domain name, and so we'll talk about

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,540
set ups with your WordPress website and how it set up different levels of expense and different levels

23
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,170
of service.

24
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:06,780
As far as send and receive email now, you know the first and free way of having business email would

25
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,580
be to create an email address like your business name at gmail.com.

26
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,070
As I said, not as professional, and there are better ways to do it now.

27
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:25,110
Gmail does provide a custom hosted service, which at this time is $6 a month per email address.

28
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,830
It does come with a good amount of storage, 30 gigabytes of storage, a lot of other good benefits

29
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,930
that it provides.

30
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,480
It's basically robust business email as well as other services like scheduling, calendaring, online

31
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,370
meetings and those types of things.

32
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:49,650
I prefer to set up all of my clients custom domain names with email addresses at Rackspace because it's

33
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,830
just as robust as service and it's about half the cost.

34
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:02,760
It's 299 U.S. dollars per email address per month, and that's 25 gigabytes of email storage and as

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,510
well as both professional managed IP addresses.

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,050
And we'll talk about IP addresses and website systems.

37
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:17,250
As regards your website in this video, as we talk about different setups for WordPress, for send and

38
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,420
receive email now, the way that I work it in my business is I include business emails, oftentimes

39
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:30,510
with my website care and hosting plans, which start at $100 a month anyway.

40
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:37,560
So another $3 a month for each email address for that business is something that I usually just roll

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,470
in as an expense of mine included in the hosting.

42
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:47,850
And you can do that, however you like Gmail, like I said, $6 a month per email address, and there

43
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,400
are three ways to go about doing this.

44
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:57,660
The two, there's actually three different levels of free email hosting.

45
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,240
One of them isn't really hosting, but it's a way to forward emails automatically to someone's personal

46
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,050
email address.

47
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,550
But the first one I'll talk about is with a shared website hosting account.

48
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,400
Now I do use site ground and I have in the past.

49
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:18,270
I recommend site ground for shared hosting, and here's an example of a domain name that I manage.

50
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:25,110
That includes in my in my hosting program with second email addresses and email hosting.

51
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,030
And there's there's kind of one issue that I'll go over with you as we talk about the different levels

52
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,700
of email hosting that this creates.

53
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,570
And as I look under this email, excuse me, this website hosting account that includes email addresses,

54
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,930
you can add as many email addresses as you like.

55
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,290
As you can see here, I've got two email addresses and you can see that there's a quota level and a

56
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,470
current usage level here in these graphs as psych ground.

57
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,920
And so they come with 250 megabytes as storage level.

58
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:06,270
By default, and then you can see that I've upped this one to four gigabytes of storage because this

59
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,910
user has over two gigabytes already stored after just a couple of years in business.

60
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,210
And so you could see where twenty five gigs or 30 gigs is a good place to be as far as hosting email

61
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,320
in the long term.

62
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:25,200
For somebody that uses emails and doesn't have a system that automatically deletes them if they want

63
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,870
to save emails on the server and be able to refer back to them and archive those for a long period of

64
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,260
time.

65
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,430
A large number of gigabytes for email storage is wise.

66
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:44,370
Now the one problem here is that if this green bar goes up and exceeds the allocated amount that affects

67
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,350
the website resources that are available for even just loading the website itself.

68
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:56,310
And I've had this happen to me where a client's website went down in a shared website account, and

69
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,360
the reason was that their email went above quota.

70
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,820
And so that caused the website to go down.

71
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,340
And so you do have to manage and watch out for your resource usage if you're using just an inexpensive

72
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,500
shared host and including the email.

73
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,580
One benefit is that it's easy to set up, and email addresses that are included with shared web hosting

74
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,350
accounts are just easy.

75
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,470
It's easy to set up and easy to manage.

76
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,480
It's just you have to keep your eye on it.

77
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:33,360
Another way to go that is truly hosted email that has a free level is a company called Zoho.

78
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:44,850
Zoho does offer paid email hosting, but they also provide a free email hosted solution that has a couple

79
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,810
of limitations.

80
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,980
And if you look there, they're 50 gigabytes per user.

81
00:06:49,980 --> 00:07:00,300
Plan at $4 is a great price and is professionally hosted and managed IP address separate from the website,

82
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,530
which is a best practice.

83
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:09,570
But if you go down here, you can see that they do have a forever free plan where the users get five

84
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,770
gigabytes each and there's an attachment limit.

85
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,660
And this is the big difference here.

86
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,200
Web access and free mobile apps that they provide in order to check and send and receive email.

87
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,850
And so where most people like to use either, you know, Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird or

88
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:36,660
Mac mail on on the Apple Mac computers, those are called email clients, their email programs that

89
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:43,470
are installed on your computer that check your email through one of two systems pop three email or IMAP,

90
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,990
which can synchronize through many devices.

91
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,280
That's to say that they limit that access.

92
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:54,570
You can't do IMAP or pop three email when you're using the free plan with Zoho.

93
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:01,250
So I've stopped using Zoho for free email hosting for that exact reason.

94
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:08,970
I like to provide a professional service for my clients and host all my emails at a service like Rackspace.

95
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:19,380
So Rackspace provides, as I said, to ninety nine a month for twenty five gigabytes and managed professional

96
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,310
IP addresses.

97
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,600
Gmail does provide the same thing for 30 gigabytes.

98
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,080
You get it for $6 a month.

99
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,390
Again, you're separating the IP address for email, sending and receiving from the website.

100
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:36,540
So no matter what happens with email sending and receiving here, it never affects the website.

101
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:45,510
And so finally, I just want to introduce a newer service where if you're using Cloudflare for your

102
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,190
DNS, we've discussed this as far as website hosting and the website hosting section.

103
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,570
Go back and review that if you like, but this is under beta.

104
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:00,360
It's just starting with Cloudflare, so you can't find much information if you're not already a Cloudflare

105
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,870
customer.

106
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:08,070
But if you are and I use the free Cloudflare service, you can set up email routing, which enables

107
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:17,610
you to do out or, excuse me, incoming only incoming only email addresses at your professional website

108
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,210
address.

109
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:24,660
And what it does is it just automatically forwards that email to any address that you already own,

110
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:32,880
like a Gmail address in this example, or even anyone's personal email address at Yahoo or Hotmail or

111
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,840
anything like that.

112
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,560
If that is a very simple and free solution that is incoming only.

113
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,440
And so if you have a client that just wants to email, manage their email in their own email box for

114
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,750
their business of the same as they always have for personal emails, you can set up email routing,

115
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,320
and so it's either referred to as an email alias or email forwarding, and you can set up the professional

116
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,420
looking business address.

117
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:06,480
And have that just automatically forward to a personal address or a free Gmail address for the client?

118
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:13,890
And so let's just take a look at the different setups for send and receive email as we go through on

119
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,970
the notepad here.

120
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:23,910
If we look at this first simple example, this is just a simple example of professional, professionally

121
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,690
hosted email at a custom domain name.

122
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,090
And so the custom domain name example dot com I'll use here.

123
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,710
This would be the same example as the site ground shared hosting example.

124
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,930
So if you have the domain registered at the website host again, not something I recommend.

125
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,900
But if you're just starting out, it's an easy way to go.

126
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:51,590
And sometimes your client may already have a domain name registered with their host if they started

127
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,120
it out themselves and they just went for an inexpensive host and built that system themselves.

128
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,100
And so this is a simple example.

129
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:05,130
I'll go over some pros and cons for each of these examples for setups for send and receive email.

130
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,970
The pros here are that the DNS records and the name servers for the domain name are already set and

131
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,380
email is included in the hosting expense, and so there's no extra expense.

132
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,120
The cons, however, are that you're locked into that host with the domain attached to it.

133
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,910
It's a little more complicated to transfer ownership of a domain, especially when you're trying to

134
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,200
migrate a website away from that domain, that hosting provider.

135
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,540
And so the email is also hosted at the same server as the website.

136
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,550
And that's the problem I alluded to before with the shared hosting that includes email.

137
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:49,800
If the email excuse exceeds its allocation, then you risk having the website going down because the

138
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,850
email inbox is full, and so you might be forced to increase the email allocation as you go.

139
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:04,260
And that might give you a hint that you need to think about migrating email away to a dedicated email

140
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:10,320
hosting provider like Gmail or Google Workspace or Rackspace, or something like that.

141
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,680
And so the next set up I'll talk about is similar.

142
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,040
You could set this set up on a shared host.

143
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:23,910
But then you have your domain registered with an accredited registrar like Cloudflare or GoDaddy or

144
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,270
Namecheap, a company that registers domain names for you.

145
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,620
And in that way, you use name servers to point the DNS records.

146
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:40,590
You know, you point the records to the website and then the email with Amex Records goes to the email

147
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,060
hosting again a little bit better.

148
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:52,050
The pros It's easy to migrate websites and email together to different hosts, and it's an easy setup.

149
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,070
The cons The email again, is hosted with the website.

150
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:03,120
So again, if the email exceeds its allocation, then the website can go down, which is a big con.

151
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:09,600
But using the name servers, it places all the DNS record management with the website host.

152
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,480
So again, that means that it's easy to set up.

153
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,370
You don't really have to fool with the DNS records like a records and Emacs records.

154
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,070
It really just gets automatically pointed and routed because your shared host is taking care of that

155
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,490
for you.

156
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,060
So here's an even better type of setup.

157
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,120
A better setup would be you have your domain registered with an accredited registrar like Cloudflare

158
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,880
or Namecheap or something like that, but you point DNS records to a DNS provider like Cloudflare.

159
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,910
And so that means that you have to just make sure that you have the records for the website.

160
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,950
Traffic pointed to the website and you have the Amex Records or Mail Exchange.

161
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:57,840
Your records pointed to the email provider and that email provider is now separate from the website

162
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,230
host.

163
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:07,470
And so with these two not being connected, that means that you can grow email boxes as far as you like

164
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:15,030
and keep expanding without affecting the the website at all and resource usage at the website host.

165
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:23,790
So in this case, you'd be using a provider like Google Workspace or Rackspace in order to provide email

166
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,690
hosting, and then the website is separate.

167
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:33,330
And so there's a lot of pros here that you've separated the resource usage between website and email.

168
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,180
And secondly, you're using a different IP address for email reputation.

169
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,950
And I alluded to this a second ago.

170
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:49,050
If this mail is using a managed IP address, then those companies like Google Workspace or Rackspace,

171
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:55,830
they're actually managing the reputation of the IP address and sending email through that IP address

172
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,190
instead of using the same IP address that your web site.

173
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:06,560
Is using and especially with a shared host host, if you're using shared hosting, it's possible because

174
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,070
those are either free or cheap services that some people might take advantage of that and set up spam

175
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,310
and spam sending systems.

176
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:24,680
So at times, those IP addresses get blacklisted or get compromised and so email can be slow, it can

177
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,130
go down.

178
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:31,910
The only con there is, it takes a little bit more setup, so it takes just a little bit of setting

179
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,590
up, but it's not hard to do and the best.

180
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:43,010
This is the best type of service where you're using Cloudflare or another DNS service, and I talked

181
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,010
about that a little bit a little bit up here, really.

182
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,350
Up here I was talking about using the DNS at the actual website host.

183
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:57,890
And when we separate out the DNS or domain name service, like with a company called Cloudflare, we're

184
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:05,360
not only enabling the domain name to point the mix records to a different email host like this, but

185
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,230
we're also enabling a content delivery network so that images and other media can load fast from different

186
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,370
places around the world.

187
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:22,430
There is $d or distributed attacks, protection for for malware and hacking attempts in those things.

188
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,960
There's a firewall that prevents your website from excessive resource usage from, you know, DDoS attacks

189
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,220
or, you know, login attempts by bots and things like that.

190
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,140
And there's a very, very fast time to first byte for that domain name.

191
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,560
Now, that doesn't really have to do with email.

192
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:47,420
Those are all side benefits of using a dedicated DNS service, and the Cloudflare service is free,

193
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:54,410
but in enables you then to manage your DNS records so that you can point a records to the website and

194
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,860
then mix records to a service like Rackspace.
