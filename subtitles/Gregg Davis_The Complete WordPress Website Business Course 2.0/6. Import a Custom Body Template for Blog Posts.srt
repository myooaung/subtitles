1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,550
In this lesson, we'll find an import, a custom blog post template from the Disney website designed

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,140
to match a layout pack design.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,650
You'll learn how to assign the dynamically generated content area to be used only on blog posts.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,080
By the end of this video, you'll understand how the divvy, theme builder and custom body templates

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,340
work to bring dynamic content like blog post titles, body text, featured images and blog post meta

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,370
information into a customized design, allowing a content manager to later use the default block editor

7
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,790
for creating blog posts instead of having to learn to use divvy.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,930
Okay, so we have a nice layout going right here with all the different pages, the custom header and

9
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:51,870
custom footer, and global and templated items here in the Divvy theme builder.

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,970
Now you may have noticed the body areas right here that we haven't used yet, and we'll finish with

11
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:02,790
the theme builder making a custom body for one specific page type.

12
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,630
And that would be the blog posts.

13
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,140
So if we look right here this, this is a really powerful thing that we can do using Deivi, meaning

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,360
that if someone's going to be entering content or editing content, especially blog posts, you may

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,510
not want them going in and trying to figure out how to use Divij or potentially breaking the website

16
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,710
or the layout.

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,850
But at the same time, you want them to be able to have a beautiful blog page layout that really matches

18
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,950
the design and looks great.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,900
So this is a blog archive which does look great and, you know, is laid out to look really good if

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,990
we had more blog posts.

21
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Of course, there would be three across in a nice grid layout.

22
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:55,680
But when you click through to the blog post, we're presented with kind of a traditional non divvy layout

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,070
here.

24
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,680
This is the regular blog post layout regular.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
I should say WordPress default layout.

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,770
It's got a sidebar.

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,060
There's a line, the menu, the transparent menus not working well.

28
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,640
The title doesn't match the typography.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,870
There is a featured image, but you know the buttons don't look right for the commenting form, etc.

30
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,360
Now the global footer is there and the global header, and we might want to, you know, we could we

31
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,800
could actually, you know, create a version of this global header that has the darker buttons for the

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,570
navigation in the logo and adds some space down below and still use this very, very simple template.

33
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,130
But still, it's better to use a special post template.

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,690
We can use a custom body template here for the blog posts themselves, and what that enables you to

35
00:02:51,690 --> 00:03:00,900
do is let the content editor or content creator use the Gutenberg or default WordPress Content Editor

36
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:08,010
for blog posts and not deal with the Divij editor at all, but have all that content styled by DeFi

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,440
so that the blog posts look really good.

38
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,310
And so, for example, what we're going to do is actually import one from the Elegant Themes blog I've

39
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:25,380
gone in here and searched for the word blog post template for the phrase and scroll down, and you can

40
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,710
see that there's many blog post templates available at the Elegant Themes blog, and they're available

41
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,520
to match different posts, different layout packs.

42
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:43,530
And there isn't one for the travel agency layout pack, but one that looks really good I've used before

43
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:48,300
and that we can modify for this is for the home staging layout pack.

44
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:55,050
So if I just click through to that, it's similar to bringing in a header and footer template.

45
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:03,210
But this is a blog post template where you can see it's going to take some of the content and dynamically

46
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,240
populate it into each blog post.

47
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:13,050
So the title and categories up here at the bottom, a nice read button that scrolls you down to the

48
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,910
content area.

49
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,690
This is the featured image, among some other stuff down here.

50
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,760
It has a related post section.

51
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:28,350
The comments form looks really good, and what we can do is edit the typography and the colors to match

52
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,470
our layout pack that we have right here.

53
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,010
And so similar to bringing in a, you know, a header and footer template.

54
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,190
This time I've clicked the download button and it wants me to put in an email address to download it

55
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,730
for free.

56
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,720
No problem.

57
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:56,880
I can just, you know, put any email address and you don't have to go and verify your email or anything.

58
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,940
You just click that download and submit button.

59
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:05,530
Joined the email list for elegant themes where they do e-mail you not too often, but some really valuable

60
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,600
stuff, and then just click download the files and it comes into your downloads folder there.

61
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:20,230
And then we can go find that using the, you know, File Explorer or using, you know, downloads or

62
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,140
here or using in Mac, you know, the Finder.

63
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:32,560
And so here I have the home staging blog post template, right click and extract all or double click

64
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,970
if you're using a Mac and a finder, and then you can go ahead and there we go.

65
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,490
You can go ahead and open that up.

66
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,470
I don't know why that closed right there, but.

67
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,710
There's the JSON file right there that we can use to bring in to our layout.

68
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:59,080
So let's go back to the theme builder here, and I'm going to go ahead and bring it in as a new template.

69
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,420
If I add a new template, I want it on specific types.

70
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,510
So all posts is what I'll check here and I'll just click Create Template.

71
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,710
Now what it does for me automatically is in this template for all posts.

72
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:18,970
It brings in what I already have as the default web site template, as a global header and a global

73
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,420
footer.

74
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,410
And so that will populate really great.

75
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:29,800
I might have to bring the custom header in in order to have a white background work, as you saw before.

76
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,390
But let's go ahead and add a custom body in here where we could bring this in.

77
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,170
And so that's one way to do the bring in the all post's template.

78
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:46,990
I'm going to bring in another template by using the portability icon up at the top right there and clicking

79
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:54,490
import, choosing the file from my downloads folder under this and this.

80
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,000
There we go.

81
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,170
And then I'll import this template.

82
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:05,770
Now this is the home staging blog post template it brought in right here, and all I need to do is bring

83
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,690
this over and add it.

84
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:16,620
To now, this one is unassigned now because I think that it created a blog post template there.

85
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,540
And so you know, what I'll do is I'll just oops, I didn't want to duplicate that.

86
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,730
Let me just delete that one I wanted to delete.

87
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,980
I could either drag the global header and footer over into here or I can.

88
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:39,420
Just since I already duplicated that custom body over to here, I can just, you know, uncheck the

89
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,380
all posts from this one.

90
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,980
And now that this one that I created before is unassigned, I can create the gear icon and click all

91
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,590
posts and click Save.

92
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,680
And now I could just save changes up at the top left here.

93
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,000
And let's take a look at what a blog post looks like now.

94
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,800
Oh yeah, what a what a difference right now.

95
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,460
Of course, the header is overlapping in kind of a weird way.

96
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:05,640
Right?

97
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,230
Here is something we might want to change.

98
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,250
But look at this.

99
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,970
I do have the category name.

100
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:19,380
I've got the post content excerpt right here and as I go down, there's just a little bit of content

101
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:27,360
in there and about the author related posts, a subscribe and the comments area down here looking pretty

102
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,890
good, really.

103
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,090
So how are we going to customize this?

104
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,440
You know, the white copy looks pretty good honestly in this header that we have here, but it's too

105
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,980
close.

106
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,860
I need to move everything down a little bit.

107
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,580
And first off, let's go into the post itself.

108
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,140
Let's see.

109
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,700
Uh, let's go into posts, all posts and click the post.

110
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:59,100
And now what you would do is instruct your client or whoever is using this to not click use the device

111
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:08,820
builder, but to actually just use the Post Block editor here as the editor for this post or any post.

112
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:17,040
That is, you could even make this button disappear to prohibit the editor roll or or author role from

113
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,870
being able to use the DV builder.

114
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,390
And there are ways to do that in DV so that you don't have that mistake of somebody trying to open up

115
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,210
and use the DV builder when they're not supposed to.

116
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:34,800
And so I've got a another tab open with Laura miff some generator for the Bob Ross Lipscombe dot com,

117
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:42,930
and I'll just copy a group of text from Bob Ross painting show on public TV and that's copied it now

118
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,740
to the clipboard.

119
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,260
And as I go in here, I'll just select this and paste.

120
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,170
Now I have a bunch of paragraphs.

121
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,910
That's great, OK?

122
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,740
You know, that's that's looking good.

123
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:03,390
And you know, what I'll do is maybe just insert another one and I'll just put, you know, a heading

124
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,110
in here.

125
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,470
Oops.

126
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,490
If I do slash h do a heading and.

127
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,200
Just title it, oops, I think that's an h, too.

128
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,150
Yeah, that's an H2, OK?

129
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,360
And then update the post and another thing you can do is just maybe.

130
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,150
Let's have I know there's a.

131
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:33,970
An image in there already, but, you know, if I just look for an image block, let's look in the media

132
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,140
library and pick a nice image to put in here.

133
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:46,270
And if I want to place the alignment, maybe over to the right and have the text wrap around it, yeah,

134
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,370
maybe I'll change the width a little bit.

135
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:55,420
OK, so this would be the process of, you know, adding some content, just using the block editor

136
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,790
to make it simple for the user.

137
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,990
Just a caption for the image there and click Update.

138
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,960
And we can see what this post looks like now on the front end with a little more content.

139
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:14,530
OK, so now that there's content here, I've got, you know, oh, I don't want to have that heading

140
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,470
right up at the top because that puts it in the excerpt there.

141
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,290
So you would you would coach your your editors to actually if you're going to use a heading, is it

142
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,770
below the first paragraph and update that?

143
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,790
And then, OK, let's go ahead and take a look.

144
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,500
OK, see if you click, read article.

145
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:39,070
It goes down and then it shows the now it's not showing the image right in here.

146
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:45,070
I'm not sure why, but in any case, it's still looking pretty good, especially the heading of the

147
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,090
blog post template.

148
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,720
Except I need to move it down a little bit.

149
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,520
In fact, let's see how would we want to do that?

150
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,090
Let's go ahead and look at the template itself.

151
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,380
Remember, under Divij theme builder, you can go in and we're editing this custom body template.

152
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:14,440
And so if I open that template up, you can see that what is in here is not the contents of any blog

153
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,250
post in particular, but it shows that this is.

154
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:24,460
Let's look at this module right here is a text module, but in the body, what we have is a dynamically

155
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,150
generated item, which is the Post Archive title.

156
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,920
And so you can edit this.

157
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,300
This is an excerpt.

158
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,580
Of course, this is a button that's just a button module that matches the layout.

159
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,830
This is all the different post content.

160
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,460
So here we go.

161
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,210
This is how you would style the post content settings.

162
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:51,700
That's one big module that shows examples of all the different content types that could be part of a

163
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,490
blog post content, the post content.

164
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,470
And so if you look under design now, I can see for designing the image.

165
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,080
These would be, you know, the different styles for the image that would be in there.

166
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:13,740
And so to actually fix that before we go in and maybe give some space breathing room at the top here,

167
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,770
well, let's do that first.

168
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,130
As far as this, uh yeah.

169
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,240
Let's see, what are we going to do?

170
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:25,420
So we want this whole section to be have a little bit of space at the top.

171
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,770
So if I want to add maybe some, there's some padding.

172
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,220
Would I add what are our top and bottom padding?

173
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,710
I think I would add just top margin for everything.

174
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,910
And that would leave the background color there for this post.

175
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,490
We could see what that looks like.

176
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:50,500
So I'll just click Save for the row and then let me save right there after it stops doing the autosave

177
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,270
under here and we can click refresh here and see what that looks like.

178
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,630
So that's an interesting layout, too.

179
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:04,840
If I get the spacing right and I have my transparent background here ready to go with this background

180
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,150
color, and that's kind of interesting.

181
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:13,690
Now the green doesn't necessarily match what I have, you know in the website, if I look at the maybe

182
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,530
I just go to visit site and open it in a new tab over here.

183
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,710
It's more like that grey blue background would be more appropriate for this layout.

184
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,140
I would think so.

185
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:32,560
Maybe I can grab that color if I enable the visual builder here and just go into the background.

186
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,250
Let me go over here and get the wireframe view.

187
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,460
Go into the heroes section.

188
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,780
Maybe this module and look at the background is that where the color is located?

189
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:52,300
Knope is actually in the hero full width section background.

190
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,260
Yeah, that's a color that's kind of a gray blue.

191
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:03,400
So what I can do is just double click it, copy right there, and I'll close out of that and let's go

192
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,560
back to the theme builder here.

193
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,900
And so this background color is part of the section, isn't it?

194
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,190
Let's see where I have that green background color.

195
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,790
Sure.

196
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,810
Right there, so just click here and paste, and now I have more of that gray blue color.

197
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,080
And that fits a little bit better.

198
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,350
And I also wanted to go ahead and look at the design.

199
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,100
I noticed that for the spacing.

200
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,840
Oh, you know what?

201
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,080
It was?

202
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,460
It a different spot, wasn't it?

203
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,270
It was in the row.

204
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,200
That way, we can leave that background color visible.

205
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,890
I wanted to leave a little bit more space than the hundred pixels.

206
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,510
One hundred and seven, maybe, maybe a hundred and twenty or so.

207
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,150
That might look better for that menu, getting in there and being visible for the blog post itself.

208
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,310
All right now, let's see what that looks like.

209
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,360
So you can play with this.

210
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,830
Well, it's quite nice.

211
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,780
That's a nice blog post now.

212
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,690
It's got a lot of great functionality.

213
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,560
Yeah.

214
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,380
And maybe we can fix this image next.

215
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,340
Just quickly.

216
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:20,690
So a couple of changes I can make here to improve the layout on the actual post over here as a as a

217
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:27,800
single post layout with our custom template is to maybe move things down just a little bit.

218
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,860
I did put a different image in here.

219
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,660
Using a horizontal image did make it display nicely.

220
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:42,740
All I did was click replace, open the media library and chose this image and then hit select and it

221
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,940
brought it in there nicely.

222
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:52,250
But what I'm going to do is just take some of the text right here and move it up and move it up one

223
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,760
more time and hit update.

224
00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:01,820
And what that did was it moved this heading, which was, you know, in an excerpt.

225
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,650
Heading in the styling of a heading doesn't come through as an excerpt, so it's a good idea to have

226
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:13,550
enough copy at the top of the post so that the excerpt length works and doesn't show something that

227
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,170
just looks weird when you're reading it.

228
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,470
And so I just saved that those two changes.

229
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,290
And let's see, I just refresh the page.

230
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:29,120
Now I've got a nice layout here with the content of this real move down a little bit away from the transparent

231
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,570
menu.

232
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:37,010
And then as I scroll down, you can see that here is the excerpt with the little ellipses here and the

233
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:45,620
read article button will scroll the user down to this next section, where it's goes to the first section

234
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,370
of copy.

235
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:57,980
One last thing will remove this subscribe from the post's theme builder, uh, custom body here.

236
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,300
Go back into the little pencil icon and we'll remove that.

237
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,280
I look for this section here.

238
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,840
Here it is.

239
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,290
So if I pull this section away, I can just go ahead and reduce it down by deleting the row.

240
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:22,680
And then of course, the image is there in the caption and the rest of this post looking great with

241
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,640
the comments form.

242
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:32,310
And then of course, our universal global footer is here, even at the bottom of the post's individual

243
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,970
template.

244
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:42,930
And so that shows you the power of bringing in dynamic content into an area that is controlled by you.

245
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:49,080
As far as the design, using the device theme builder and you're just defining that there's a custom

246
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:57,510
body and the global header and footer in the all posts area, so that every post that gets created by

247
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:02,160
a user of this website in the future will bring in the title dynamically.

248
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,060
The category.

249
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:09,240
It will bring in the featured image dynamically and show it overlapping these nice background colors,

250
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,910
the author, the date and the comments, whether or not you want to display those, and then all of

251
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:21,180
a content laid out the way that the user wants it laid out when they build the blog post.

252
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:28,380
And so it's a super powerful way of customizing your site design without giving the user the reins as

253
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:34,530
far as them, you know, messing up the site or having to learn Divij, which can be pretty complicated.
