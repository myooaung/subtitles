00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.120
In this lesson, we'll explore options for adding an interactive map to the contact page, you create

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.060
a Google Maps embed code first, but see its limitations in the sandbox because it's a multi-site network

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.340
which limits code to keep the network safe.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.110
Then you'll configure a map plugin to make it work and check out the advantages.

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.900
By the end of this video, you'll understand two ways to embed a map on a page and also how to use a

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.340
map plugin that can have more than one location marker, among other benefits.

7
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:38.070
Let's add one more nice customization to this contact us page, which is to add an interactive dynamic

8
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.840
map into the page.

9
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.640
And let's do this the easy way to start with, you know, the difference between, you know, a block

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.830
based theme here and the site editor and, you know, more traditional or backwards compatible theme

11
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.960
that we're going to learn in the next sections is that it's not quite as easy to add any code or, you

12
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.870
know, change what the theme is providing as far as templates, blocks and block patterns.

13
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.860
But if we take a look, if we're going to add a map right here, let's just go ahead and go back to

14
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.030
the page itself.

15
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.380
And with that in mind, let's look at this contact us page.

16
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.260
And, you know, below the contact us form, of course, up here, we could put the name and I mean

17
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.750
the address and phone number, et cetera, something like that.

18
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.150
Now there's one thing you could do, which is really to add an image of a map, but I'm talking about,

19
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.970
you know, Dragonball interactive map.

20
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.030
I wonder if there's any map blocks?

21
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.510
Nope.

22
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:55.950
Let's browse all the maps, browse all the blocks and just make sure no, no map black included in WordPress

23
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.370
is there.

24
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.690
What about black patterns?

25
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.080
So there's a footer general Twitter page query.

26
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.080
We didn't really look at this yet, but here's the interesting thing.

27
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.920
All those things that we saw in the Frost Peacock website are available for us to click and put in here.

28
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.270
And so one thing you could do is, you know, expand the footer with a call to action like this where

29
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.180
if you want a lot of text with links in the footer, this is the footer that we have currently.

30
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.400
I think, pretty simple footer.

31
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.050
Here's one with some social icons, cetera but say under general, you know, the theme is providing

32
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:42.060
us with all these block patterns that we can use as part of our site design, you can see there even

33
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.040
more versions like six items you know, or four items right here.

34
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:56.010
Bigger pricing table Here's one that's interesting a podcast episode with an audio player, but in any

35
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.920
case, there's whole pages that we can pull in.

36
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.020
A homepage, a link page and a dark link page.

37
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.400
A query block.

38
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.340
Of course, something that brings in blog posts.

39
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.270
Here's what we saw in the demo straight single column blog archive, which shows posts.

40
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:26.210
This one is a grid of posts in three columns, and then here's a list of posts using three columns for

41
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.490
the date and other information meta information on the right and the post content in the middle.

42
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.530
But nothing that's like a map is there.

43
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.300
So let's close that down.

44
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:47.890
And as far as blocks go, one of the things that we can put in here is some code, some embedded code.

45
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:57.460
So either custom HTML or code now code is to display some code snippets on the website without having

46
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.410
the website execute that code.

47
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.310
And so that might be for a technical website where you want to display code for the users to be able

48
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.740
to copy and paste it or to view the code.

49
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.900
Like I said, without executing it.

50
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:19.240
But if we're going to paste some code like a Google Map embed code, for example, we would use a custom

51
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.260
HTML block.

52
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.920
And so we could write the HTML within that block and just paste it there.

53
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.740
So let's go ahead, and I'm just going to go to Google.com.

54
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.240
I'm going to go over to Google Maps.

55
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.710
Let's click right here, and let's see.

56
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.140
Here's my little town in Colorado.

57
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.090
And, you know, I could just say, let's see.

58
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.870
South Park City is a nice living museum.

59
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:25.080
So if I South Park City Museum, what I can do is kind of arrange this and then in Google Maps, you

60
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:32.100
know, all you need to do is click share and click the Embed a Map tab.

61
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.650
And now we've got a nice, embeddable map.

62
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.900
And here's an example of what it would look like.

63
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.490
This is an iframe that you can paste and you can copy that HTML.

64
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.420
So right here, you can use your mouse to zoom in or zoom out.

65
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:56.590
And whatever you'd like to do, kind of frame your map up like that because I searched for it up here,

66
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.680
it shows this little card at the top left and I could just say copy HTML.

67
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.220
And if I go back into the HTML, let's paste that right in there.

68
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.000
Click Update.

69
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.610
Let's see what that's going to look like.

70
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.190
On the contact page.

71
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.670
And now, if you're working like I am in the student sandbox, which is a multi-site network, you'll

72
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.260
see that the map does not show up and there's a very good reason for that.

73
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:38.630
And that is because it's stripped out the iframe code instead of allowing it to execute on the front

74
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.560
end of the site.

75
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:47.420
And that's to prevent in the multi-site network anyone from pasting or posting any code that would execute

76
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.260
and affect other sites on the network.

77
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.930
And so you can't really post any iframe code into a network.

78
00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.680
Now, if you were working on your own server at your own hosting and you have a single site installation,

79
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.390
this will definitely work.

80
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.570
And so let me just show you that real quick, and then I'll show you an alternative way to work in the

81
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:15.620
sandbox and get a working map into the the sites that you're creating here in the sandbox.

82
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:24.180
So I'm going to just go over here to Greg Davis dot com, where I'm already logged in and you know,

83
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.350
I've got a contact page over here.

84
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:38.420
Contact me, and this page just has a little bit of info and what I'll do is just go ahead and.

85
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.260
Insert a block, and I'm going to do this very same thing.

86
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.690
I'm going to look for custom HTML.

87
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:55.880
And I still have it on the on the clipboard, so if I paste that iframe code and click Update now,

88
00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:02.570
if we go over and I look for the permalink and click view page, you can see on my contact page at Greg

89
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.470
Davis dot com.

90
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:10.040
I've got a great looking interactive map where I can zoom out or zoom in, et cetera.

91
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.280
I can get directions and this will work on mobile as well.

92
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:20.270
But that's probably the easiest way when you're working on your own site of embedding an interactive

93
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.070
Google map on your website.

94
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.040
But let's see what happens over here.

95
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:32.810
Also, you know, I wanted to just show you if we take a look at, you know, I did, this is saved,

96
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:33.170
right?

97
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.850
Yeah, now it previews it on the back end.

98
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:45.080
But if I go to this page and the map is not showing, I can actually see if I view the page source.

99
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:51.830
I could see the source code that is split out into the browser if I go down between the end of the fluent

100
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.300
form area and the beginning, the beginning of the footer.

101
00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:04.250
You can see that there's just an empty space right here from, you know, lines 126 to 130 before the

102
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.600
last div and then the main content area of the site.

103
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:14.960
There's nothing there, so multi-site strips out the iframe code and it's just not usable in that way.

104
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:22.460
But let's show an alternative way to post an interactive map into a multi-site installation and allow

105
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.260
network users to do that.

106
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:34.850
And so back in the contact us page, let's look at an alternative if we just go ahead and remove that

107
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.550
custom HTML block and update.

108
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:45.830
Let's go back into the dashboard itself and let's go into plug ins.

109
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:53.720
This will be an alternative for the multistate network, but also it will be another way to embed an

110
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.680
interactive map.

111
00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:03.440
But with more features than just your standard iframe code from Google Maps itself, this plug in that

112
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.060
I have installed and available to you in the network, it's called WP Google Maps, and there's a few

113
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:13.040
good Maps or Google Maps plug ins in the WordPress repository that are free.

114
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.900
One of the things that these allow you to do is have multiple markers and control.

115
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.510
You know what the markers and the flags look like and whether they're clickable and things like that.

116
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:32.630
And so go ahead and activate WP Google Maps, and then you can click Skip, Intro and create a map.

117
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:41.060
And then what we'll do is look at this, there's a new map here that we can go ahead and edit, and

118
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:47.870
that this is what is important about WP Google Maps.

119
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:58.070
And that is, instead of using the Google Maps API key, let's use the Open Layers API instead, and

120
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.400
it's just as powerful and just as useful.

121
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.880
However, now that Google Maps requires a payment method, so you have to set up a credit card and a

122
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.800
billing method in your Google account to be able to use the Maps API.

123
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:19.280
It may not cost you any money because they give you a credit every single month, and that credit is

124
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.730
about equivalent to several thousand map views.

125
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:30.620
You really would only need to use this if if you've got an interactive application with interactive

126
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:39.260
maps that are really needed, but it's quite complicated to get set up and so instead, choose the open

127
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:44.090
layers maps engine instead of the Google Maps API.

128
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:50.900
And that will make it free for you to use this plug in on any site that you want.

129
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:57.470
You don't have to sign up for an API or put a billing method in in the Google Maps API area.

130
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.800
Yeah, under settings you can, and the first thing that you see is Maps engine, and then you can choose

131
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.990
Google Maps or open layers.

132
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.030
And so we're using open layers.

133
00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:16.510
And if you go to maps and then edit the map now we'll be able to configure the map that we're using.

134
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.120
And so the first thing you can do is just name the map.

135
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.630
I'm just going to put put Fairplay.

136
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:29.990
You can choose your zoom level, width and height, and let's just save the map for now.

137
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:38.000
And let's see, we can go to markers on the map and then we can add a new marker so you either put an

138
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.960
address or GPS coordinates right here.

139
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:49.490
And I'm just going to say Fairplay Co. and hit enter and see what happens.

140
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.110
There we go.

141
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:50.890
It gives me Oops.

142
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.740
It gives me some options right down here.

143
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.770
I could just say Fair Play, Colorado, USA, just to start with.

144
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.940
I don't need any animation or the info window open.

145
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.910
I could just say, add the marker.

146
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.730
And so it put a marker there.

147
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.360
There's already a marker here, says California.

148
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.450
It shows my existing markers down here so I can just remove that California one.

149
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.880
This is the one that I have, and now that I have a marker there, I can use control.

150
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.650
Oops, hold on control to Zoom the map and zoom and pan.

151
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.260
There's also some instructions right here.

152
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.300
So you can zoom in to right where you want.

153
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:49.900
Nice.

154
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.420
So maybe I have that map right there.

155
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.880
And you can add some other different things you can draw on the map.

156
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.240
You can use lines you can.

157
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.310
The pro version has heat maps.

158
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.280
You can have circles on there.

159
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.160
There's definitely some different things you can do.

160
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:15.940
And so markers, markers is is where you add these.

161
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:21.210
But the great thing about using this plug in is you can put multiple markers on a single map.

162
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:28.050
But anyway, once you have your map arranged to sell your desired location and your Zoom level and everything,

163
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.100
you can click Save Map.

164
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:38.580
And now we've got that map right there that we can embed on the web site, so I'll just click and it

165
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.500
says shortcode copied right there.

166
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:47.550
Now I can go over to pages and I can find my contact page and we'll put this map.

167
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.580
Now you remember what kind of block we need, it's a short code block.

168
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.110
Here we go.

169
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:56.940
Quick Update.

170
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.100
And now let's take a look at the page now.

171
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:08.570
OK, so we've got this situation where the map goes over the footer, and here's how it's solvable,

172
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:14.990
you know, on this contact page, I've just got the paragraph and then two shortcuts directly on the

173
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.070
page itself.

174
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.880
And if I just add, just add a group to contain the items.

175
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.220
So if I have a group.

176
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.940
And see this group, if I put the group.

177
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:35.030
I put everything within the group inside this group.

178
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:35.760
There we go.

179
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:41.960
And it puts this little arrow that shows the paragraph is in the group, the shortcode.

180
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.500
I want to put it, you see that little blue line there on the left.

181
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:52.280
It's shorter when it's inside the group, and I want to put both short codes inside the group.

182
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:58.980
And click Update now, I'm not I think that's not going to change anything yet.

183
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.180
Let's see.

184
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:06.690
It really, it just centers it like we saw before, but now I want to have this be like a kind of full

185
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:07.140
height.

186
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:13.590
And so if I selected this group over here for the block settings, I can click full height.

187
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:20.010
And now that will make the group contain above the footer.

188
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.440
It's if I click Save there.

189
00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:23.880
Here we go.

190
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:30.240
Now I've got everything within a group and that's using a container on the page so that I can control

191
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.500
what things overlap and what things do not.

192
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.880
So that looks great.

193
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.810
And I opens open layers map right there.

194
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:45.510
I don't have to sign up for anything, and it also gives me more options for different markers.

195
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.920
You know, you can click on it.

196
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:53.280
You can control what this says, and it's close ebel, et cetera, as well as fullscreen and the Zoom

197
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:53.760
buttons.

198
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.190
And you can pan.

199
00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:00.690
And if you try to use your scroll wheel just like Google Maps, it gives you this little control.

200
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.790
And if you press control, you can go ahead and zoom in and zoom out.
