00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.510
In this lesson, we'll see how with full site editing and a block based theme, the WordPress customizer

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.830
is no longer active.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.830
And it's now missing a custom CSS area.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.000
You'll activate a custom CSS plugin to be able to add CIUSSS to edit existing layout details if needed,

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.290
as well as use the browser developer tools to find the CSE's to target.

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.360
By the end of this video, you'll get around one of the limitations of the block based theme system

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.340
right now and learn how to use the dev tools to quickly find what you need in a site's code.

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.730
So now, if there's any code that you ever wanted to add, like sometimes you want to use a little CSS

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.120
code.

10
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:48.540
You know, the the this this whole template editing system is designed so that you really shouldn't

11
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.800
have to use any CSS code to edit different content that the template or excuse me, that the theme is

12
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.980
forcing you to display on certain pages because you can create your own templates.

13
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.960
But in the case that you do want to add some CSS code.

14
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.060
In fact, I had an example just the other day where I was working on my WooCommerce site and I wanted

15
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.300
to customize the checkout page that WooCommerce was using.

16
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:25.680
And even though I was using, you know, a block based theme which was using this site editor, I didn't

17
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.370
have a place where I could add some CSS code to the site in order to remove certain things from the

18
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.350
checkout page that I didn't want people to see.

19
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.390
I just wanted to put a display none on a certain CSS class and also assist it so that I could remove

20
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.970
a certain thing and that wasn't available to me.

21
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.240
Let's go back into the dashboard and you know, if you're using a non block based theme, which most

22
00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.180
themes in the WordPress environment are these days under appearance, you'll have a customizer, you

23
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.800
know, and that that's the customizer where there's an additional CIUSSS field where you can add.

24
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.370
So let's look at an example at Greg Davis dot com.

25
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.580
If I look under appearance, customize.

26
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.180
You can see that this is a non block based theme because I have customized widgets, menus and those

27
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.140
things are available in a non-black based theme.

28
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.640
So you don't have the customizer when you're working with a block based theme.

29
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.790
And next, we're going to get into non-Black based themes and some really powerful things that you can

30
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.360
use with them.

31
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.590
But this is the customizer that's no longer used in a block based theme based on WordPress 5.9 and later.

32
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.610
But many themes still use the customizer, and this additional CIUSSS area is a place where you can

33
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.000
put KSAZ code that will execute on the entire site.

34
00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.230
It saves you from having to add a style that CSS stylesheet to your website in the background by using

35
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.060
a child theme or something like that.

36
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.430
But my point is that this whole area is no longer available.

37
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.380
Now you can see the address forward slash customize dot PHP is here in the address bar, and I'm going

38
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:25.680
to control C Copy that just so I can show you back in the WordPress sandbox in the WP, of course.

39
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.250
Sandbox.

40
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.490
Here, of course, appearance customize doesn't exist, but if I go to WP admin and after the forward

41
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.760
slash, I add Oops, not too forward slash.

42
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.940
Just add customized PHP that does still exist in the WordPress environment, if you know to put that

43
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.300
in there.

44
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.740
However, only the only thing it has is site identity, where you can add an icon and change the site

45
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.610
title and tagline, which is still available under Settings General anyway.

46
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.510
But there's also the home page settings again available under Settings General, but there's no additional

47
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:13.980
CSS area right here, so there's plenty of great plugins that you can use to put custom CC with in your

48
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.780
WordPress website, and I've added one to the network here in the sandbox just to show you guys what's

49
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.270
available to you in case you're using a five point nine block based theme or later.

50
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.780
A great one is simple custom CIUSSS.

51
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.300
If you activate that, what it does is it adds under appearance.

52
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.200
Both adds a button to the customizer.

53
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.770
First of all, where you've got simple custom CSS and you can place CC here, which will be visible

54
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.310
here in the customizer before you even save, you know.

55
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:59.850
So just let me give you an example of doing this, and then we'll go on to the next section of the.

56
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.320
Worse.

57
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.730
But just in addition to the customizer here, the simple.

58
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:13.750
Custom CSE's window is also available under appearance custom CSX, and that'll give you that same code

59
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.170
in a in a place right here where you can put CIUSSS and change the site of something, change how something

60
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.650
looks.

61
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.950
So let's do this.

62
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.730
Let's look at the home page.

63
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.580
All right, and stay down here for whatever reason.

64
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.210
Let's see.

65
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.790
Let's find using the the dev tools developer tools.

66
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.050
Let's inspect and then look at what we have here.

67
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.490
So we have an H2.

68
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.950
Architectural design, let's see, what do we have?

69
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.270
There's a pea there.

70
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.710
Something we can change.

71
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.780
How about this about us here?

72
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.560
Something where you can find.

73
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.280
Yeah.

74
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.060
Like a.

75
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.970
How about an.

76
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.110
Some anchor text, which is a WP block button with a link.

77
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:22.970
So the WP Block button link, suppose you wanted to do something where maybe you just wanted to.

78
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.740
Display none.

79
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:37.270
Well, if I put that in the CSE's code under this CSI class, I'm going to control C copy if I put display

80
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.660
none.

81
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.650
Well, then it doesn't show those.

82
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.310
Now obviously, we can do that a different way.

83
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.560
But this is just to show you that you can use CIUSSS in this way.

84
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.130
Sometimes you just can't do something that that easily.

85
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.780
And so it helps to put in a little CIUSSS to do something like display none.

86
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.610
And look, it's making all the buttons disappear.

87
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.340
Uh, right down here.

88
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.670
But you know what, if I look, what is this button?

89
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.890
It's uh, yeah.

90
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.920
And there's I can't really define that class that specifically, but like, I copied and pasted this.

91
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.960
So let's get out of the DevTools here.

92
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:25.480
Let's go back into the customizer where we have that customizer available now because of the custom

93
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.920
CSC simple custom KSAZ plugin that we have activated.

94
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.280
So if I just open that up, let's go down to where the buttons are visible.

95
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.320
Here's the buttons I was targeting before.

96
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:45.470
So if I just paste that little CSS class in there, the way you do cc's is you put curly brackets and

97
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.200
then here's where you put your your CSS code.

98
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:58.880
All right, so that shows me the result of my success code without taking it live on the site, which

99
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.460
is quite nice if you're playing with a little bit of success.

100
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.360
And so if I publish this now when I go back.

101
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:15.900
You know, the if I click custom cast that suggests that I'm using is displayed right here, and if

102
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:22.920
I open the site home page now and refresh the page, you can see that anything that had that CSS class

103
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.950
is no longer there displaying all these buttons.

104
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.420
They call the action button here.

105
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.820
And of course, the buttons under about us.

106
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.220
Now, of course, that's not something that I would want to do.

107
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:39.780
So I'm going to remove that and update and now this will bring back all my buttons again.

108
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:45.720
I just wanted to show you that that was a big difference between, you know, a previous version of

109
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.430
WordPress and starting in five point nine when we're working with a block based theme.

110
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:56.490
Now you should know that even if you're on five point nine, if you're working with a non block based

111
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:04.350
theme like cadence that we're going to work with next in the course, then you will have the customizer

112
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.600
and the widgets and the menus available to you right here under appearance.

113
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:15.120
It's just that we've got a block based theme using Frost and also using twenty twenty two.

114
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.600
So that's the big difference and hope you enjoyed that little detour that we took at the end of the

115
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:27.540
Frost section of the course, and we'll get into cadence in the next section.
