00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.760
In this lesson, we'll customize the navigation menu in the transparent header and create a copy of

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.390
it to be used on separate pages that need a text color change.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.000
You'll assign the additional template to the pages that have a different color in the background to

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.880
make sure the contrast is readable through the transparency.

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.280
By the end of this video, you'll know how to create and assign different headers in the DV theme builder

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.860
to different pages or page types.

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.600
All right now, let's take a look at an issue that I mentioned in the last couple of lessons where if

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.510
we open up, well, two things will edit this menu, which I give you a challenge in the last lesson

9
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.290
so that it's a customized menu.

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.220
We can get rid of these blog categories right here.

11
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.520
But secondly, if we look at the packages page or any of those pages that have a light colored background,

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.360
you can see that this menu color doesn't really work that well unless you scroll, of course.

13
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.340
And so we can change that and make a conditional menu that only appears on certain pages and we can

14
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.940
define which pages those are using the theme builder in that customize global header that we have there.

15
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.950
I'll go to the home page right here.

16
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.710
It automatically selected and chose that menu that we just created as the primary menu right here.

17
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.120
But if you were enabling the visual builder now, if you're editing a page, this is one of the newer

18
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.020
features in DV.

19
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.360
Is that while the visual builder is open, if you do have a theme builder, header or footer area enabled,

20
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.890
it will give you the ability to go up to the top and enter edit that actual header template outside

21
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.960
of the theme builder interface itself.

22
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.810
And while you're viewing a page and so that solves the problem of being able to scroll while you're

23
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.460
looking at the header template.

24
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.060
So now I'm editing just the header template items that we saw in the theme builder before, but we're

25
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.900
inside of the visual builder while the site is visible.

26
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.280
And so while that works well right here, one thing we can do is just let's exit the visual builder

27
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.530
outside of that page and go to the packages page that has a light colored subheading right here.

28
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.390
Also, that about has a two to light of a color, doesn't it?

29
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.810
In the dropdown as well.

30
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.870
And so on this page, now we can enable the visual builder on the packages page.

31
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.840
And while that opens, then we can go ahead and highlight this green edit header template.

32
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.160
Since there's a header template present, we can go ahead and edit that now.

33
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:52.650
Of course, if we edit this menu and we make the color a little bit darker now, that will work on the

34
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.850
travel packages page, but it won't really work on the home page.

35
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.950
The landing page, any other page that has an image here with the transparent header.

36
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.190
And so like I mentioned, we're going to have to split this and have two different global headers that

37
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.440
work on maybe one for all the pages and a different one for the rest of the pages.

38
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.530
And so I'll show you how to define that right now.

39
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.930
If we look at let's just close that up now, changing out of editing the header template here and back

40
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.690
to the page, it just gives you a purple button where you can click Edit Post content here.

41
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.600
And if I just click right there anywhere, while that's highlighted, that brings me back down to where

42
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.280
I can edit all this content that's within the page body area.

43
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.450
And so I'm going to go ahead and exit that visual builder now, discard my changes there, and let's

44
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.180
just take the let's see travel packages.

45
00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:01.770
Also, the team page has a light background, not the about page, the blog page as well, and the contact

46
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.220
page.

47
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.270
You see, these all have a light colored background.

48
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.700
And you know, it might be best to change the global header to a light background and then have just

49
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.880
a few pages that are defined as having a darker background where this light color works.

50
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.210
In any case, we're going to make a copy of this header template and then define which pages the changed

51
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.700
header template would be defined onto.

52
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.490
And so that will make more sense as we go ahead and look, let's go ahead and go into the theme builder

53
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.940
right here.

54
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.200
And what I can do is I'm going to take this global header and the whole default website template, and

55
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.460
I'm going to go ahead and click duplicate right here.

56
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.690
This is the little icon at the top left where it shows, you know, two items, one behind the other.

57
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.780
And so I've just duplicated that global header template, this whole default web site template, actually,

58
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.200
and I'm only using a global header inside of it.

59
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.930
But if I just change this to specific pages, I guess for now what I'll do is choose the pages that

60
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.040
have a light background.

61
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.010
And so I know that was the team page.

62
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.720
The shop page, I think, does the blog page, the contact, the about page.

63
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.410
And so for all five of these pages that have a light colored background, this is what I'm going to

64
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.250
edit right here.

65
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.570
So a click save.

66
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.690
And as you can see, when I duplicated this global header, it changed from a green color into a gray

67
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.960
color, which defines it as a non global item.

68
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:41.520
And since it is defined as, you know, working on certain pages where I can define that and reopen

69
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.310
it and change that is with the gear icon here, if you click that gear icon, that opens up the template

70
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:55.320
settings so that you can either use it on particular pages or you can exclude it from typical pages

71
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.280
or, you know, types of pages and specific pages.

72
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:07.110
But I was going to say you can also use it on not only specific pages, but on certain types of pages,

73
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:15.090
like all pages or children of specific pages where you can have a hierarchy of parent and child pages.

74
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.860
You can also do it on posts or certain types of posts like categories.

75
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:26.460
That's a really powerful way to define different ways that you display a header for certain categories

76
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.510
or even particular blog posts.

77
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.330
And then there's course archive pages, different custom post types like projects.

78
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.470
You might have a different header that you wanted to find on different kinds of pages.

79
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:44.550
You can really start to see the power of the template and theme builder here under Divij, where you

80
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.050
can use these different templates for different page types and different pages.

81
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.240
And so we're editing the template here.

82
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.640
Now this is one template, the default website template that you cannot delete.

83
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.440
Once you have one created.

84
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.940
But over here, there's the little trashcan icon and so you can actually delete this template.

85
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.090
You can make a copy of this template as well.

86
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.150
And here's where you'd label it for your own use.

87
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:17.820
If you do have a say, I made a copy of this template and I didn't define it as being used anywhere,

88
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.260
and I just close that.

89
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:25.470
What happens is this label turns red, and that's to let you know that it's not being used anywhere.

90
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.870
So this you might even keep.

91
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.520
Sometimes I've kept an unused template as a saved copy.

92
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:41.070
So this is just this is a backup of the global template.

93
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.690
I'll often keep a backup of the global template here, save my changes.

94
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:52.830
And so now that I've saved my changes, this backup is saved as well as a copy of the global header

95
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.890
and only define on certain pages right here.

96
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.890
So what is it?

97
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.330
It's on one two three four five different pages.

98
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.830
Use this template now.

99
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:07.460
If I make changes to this custom header, it will not affect the rest of the pages.

100
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.990
And so that's where I can go in here and hit the pencil icon.

101
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:16.530
And I can make you know now that it has a white background, I can go in here and I could say, OK,

102
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:23.630
the design of this menu for the text, I want it to be a darker color.

103
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.530
And so I don't want it straight black.

104
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:34.200
But what I might do is just to drag along the edge here down to where this is a little bit darker of

105
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.040
a gray color.

106
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.330
Now why isn't that changing what it looks like right over here?

107
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.850
And that may be because we're looking.

108
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:50.460
At the menu, text color right here, defined as if, if, if what was I changing the active link color?

109
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.840
And so the active link color, of course, we also need to be a visible color.

110
00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.030
So if that's 04:07 repeated, let's go ahead and see about this one.

111
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.390
Oops.

112
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.820
Can just drag that around now.

113
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.840
It's changing, isn't it?

114
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:11.610
So if I make this a little bit darker, like all the way down to five six, then when the active page

115
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:17.220
you could see and when we roll over it, it changes slightly lighter and gets a nice rollover effect

116
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:17.520
there.

117
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.660
And so that's really all I need to change about that menu.

118
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.430
What about the logo right here?

119
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.380
This logo was defined as now.

120
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.130
Are we going to leave the sticky here?

121
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.930
We do want to leave the sticky to be a nice black, and I think that'll look nice.

122
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.100
We could have made this black as well so that it's visible in the later pages.

123
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.630
Or we could even make this sticky version a lighter if we want to.

124
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:50.640
For now, let's just leave the menu text color as we have it, and let's look at the logo and see what

125
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.840
changes we can make here.

126
00:09:51.840 --> 00:10:01.860
So we have the logo, border image, etc. Now the image is inverted to a level of 90 percent because

127
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.550
I don't know what the original logo looks like in the media library.

128
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:14.550
But if I slide this back to zero, the image is a black image and so I can use image invert to change

129
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.490
that or even opacity if I brought that down.

130
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.420
That would kind of have the same effect, right?

131
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.800
But since they were using an image invert.

132
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.320
Anyway, let's bring this baby back to match image invert.

133
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.590
Match the color here that I have maybe 48.

134
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.920
I don't know.

135
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.490
About 30 40 percent maybe looks about right to me.

136
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.240
That looks pretty good.

137
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:42.300
And so when it's sticky, we'll leave it going back to its black with image invert being zero again

138
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:51.510
so that I can click the little save checkbox and down here, don't forget to save the whole page, which

139
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:56.010
in this case is just the header itself, and I'll click that close icon.

140
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:01.680
And because I hit the save at the bottom right now, it's showing me all changes saved up here.

141
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.480
And so now let's take a look.

142
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.870
If I'm on the about page here and I refresh, that shouldn't change anything.

143
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.500
This is the lighter color.

144
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:11.720
Look at that.

145
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.050
It did change it, didn't it?

146
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.610
And so let's see.

147
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.690
Let's look at home.

148
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.990
Yeah, it's the on home.

149
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:25.200
It's the lighter color on the about page that is the darker color.

150
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.150
It's the landing page.

151
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.440
No, where was it?

152
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.970
Oh, it's the packages, that's right.

153
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.600
So I think I have this backwards or something.

154
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.950
Let's make sure this is working.

155
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.420
Yeah.

156
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.590
So I need the packages page to be the darker color that I just made.

157
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.150
And so let's see.

158
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.660
I'll just change my settings here on specific pages.

159
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.840
Oh, I don't have the packages page selected.

160
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.410
And actually the about page is not something where I need the darker color.

161
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.370
I think I need just these five pages.

162
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.670
That's what the problem was.

163
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.810
So I just click Save now that I click Save under those changes here.

164
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.340
I still need to click save changes here or that won't be affected.

165
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.520
And so now if I refresh packages, there we go.

166
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.660
That's the darker color.

167
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.300
The rollover looks nice, and so does the sticky.

168
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:19.660
If I go to about, yeah, now it's the lighter color because there's an image right here that's great.

169
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.160
And if I look at packages was looking good, the contact was also a lighter page.

170
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.500
So now my menu is working great.

171
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:34.270
The home page and others like the about are not using this darker color that I changed, and that's

172
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:41.680
how you can do a dynamic and conditional second header layout for any types of pages or specific pages

173
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.940
that you have in the whole website.

174
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.510
Let's fix this real quick.

175
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:50.590
There's a dropdown where this is a white background and this is too light of a color for that text so

176
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.520
we can change that.

177
00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.470
It be a good challenge for you to see if you can figure out where you change that if you want to pause

178
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.840
the video here right now and make that quick change.

179
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:02.650
So how'd that go?

180
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:10.240
If I go back to the header theme builder and change this global header, I'm going to have to change

181
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.730
it in both places for that dropdown ANA.

182
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:22.930
So if I click the little pencil icon here first under the global header, if I go under this menu module

183
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:29.560
settings, there's some elements here and under design I would go to the dropdown menu.

184
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:36.400
And here's where I could change either the background color, the line color or the menu text color

185
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.330
and the active.

186
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.190
And so what do you think would look better?

187
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.580
Maybe to keep this as a light color and change the lettering?

188
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:49.330
Or you could have change the background and kept the light colored lettering that might actually like

189
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.770
look pretty interesting.

190
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.260
So if I change the background color of the dropdown, often that looks nice when the background color

191
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.890
contrasts from the menu color itself.

192
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:07.630
And so maybe I'll bring the background color down to more of a gray.

193
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.760
Oh, that looks quite nice.

194
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.120
Maybe I'll even bring it a little bit darker.

195
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.280
Yeah, and a light colored lettering looks pretty good, I think I'll go maybe up a little bit darker

196
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.390
and then the text color looking good, they're the active link color.

197
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.370
If that were active in the rollover looks good too, and that looks great.

198
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.700
So what happens when the menu is sticky and I roll over?

199
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:38.850
Ah, so when the menu is sticky for the drop down, I'm going to change that to white so that that looks

200
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.050
good in the darker color.

201
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.810
And so let's see if I go to the dropdown menu.

202
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:44.940
Text color.

203
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:52.440
Of course, that's the in sticky mode right here and there.

204
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:57.660
There's where I just hit the push pin, which is sticky that opened up the menu text color.

205
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.870
Now I can change that to be a lighter color.

206
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.750
And so I'll go down here and just make that white.

207
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:04.770
So how's that going to look?

208
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.120
That looks real nice.

209
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.520
OK, so I'll click the checkbox here.

210
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:16.290
Now, of course, if I don't click this button down here and then save when I click here, it'll tell

211
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.690
me, OK, do I want to save and exit or what?

212
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:19.830
Yes.

213
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.220
And now it says all changes saved right here.

214
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.390
I can go up here and do a refresh now as my menu working everywhere.

215
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:27.900
Yeah.

216
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:32.790
And even if I scroll, the dropdown is working well, in addition.

217
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.290
So that looks nice.

218
00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:35.210
Yeah.

219
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:40.590
But even on a on a light background, that dropdown is a nice big gray square.

220
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:41.700
It's good, in contrast.

221
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.760
Yeah, that's that's looking really good.

222
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.320
It also works on a light colored background, the dropdown as well.

223
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:54.840
Now, for a light color background, as you remember, I did not change the other.

224
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:57.950
Remember, I said you had to edit both of these.

225
00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.150
Since this is green, it only affects the ones that are affected by this.

226
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:09.540
Now these this other all these five pages that are selected right here are excluded from that global

227
00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:09.840
header.

228
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:15.150
And so let's go ahead and do the same edit that we did over here.

229
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.650
So I could go over here and let's actually before I do that.

230
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.810
Let's see if I can try something here.

231
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.550
Let's go ahead and click the three little buttons that a place.

232
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.480
Now there is a spot where you can copy.

233
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.670
Let's see if this will let me do it.

234
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:38.910
You know what it'll do if I go up here to this menu and I right click the three dots, I could say,

235
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.790
copy the module styles and then go back out of this green header.

236
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:51.270
And now let's edit the custom header and again, go to this header module right here.

237
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:58.530
And if I copy the styles over, it's actually going to overwrite all the styles, including the color

238
00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:58.830
here.

239
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:02.100
So I don't want to do that, but that's something that you can use in the future.

240
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:08.490
You can go copy styles and then paste styles, and that will change it and match everything from one

241
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:09.300
side to the other.

242
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.280
That's not what I want to do right now.

243
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:19.280
When I want to do is change the settings and look at doing the dropdown settings right for it.

244
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:25.500
So the design under dropdown menu, I want to bring that to a certain color and what I want to do is

245
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.490
really match it.

246
00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:30.290
So I need to back out of here again, discard the changes here.

247
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.880
What I want to do is look for that gray color.

248
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.460
I want to remember the gray, the two gray colors that I had here.

249
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:45.300
So under design dropdown menu, the background color itself with 6GB, 6GB, 6GB, that's not hard to

250
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:45.780
remember.

251
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.660
And then the text color.

252
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.360
Here we go, the the is this.

253
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.560
Let's see, I remember first, I'll do that 6B.

254
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:03.540
The menu, background color and then the menu text color.

255
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.610
Oh, it's just white, I believe.

256
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:06.600
Yeah, that was just white.

257
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.750
So 6b, that's what I need to remember.

258
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.370
Just close this.

259
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.660
Discard an exit exit and save my changes.

260
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:20.540
Oftentimes, I'll just paste the color into a notepad document or something like that.

261
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.940
But now I want to change my drop, my my, the background of my drop down.

262
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.760
And then make the text white, so let's go design dropdown menu.

263
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.160
Here's the dropdown menu background color.

264
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.780
Add a color right here I can just type.

265
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.160
Six B six b six b.

266
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.900
It will add the little no sign there for the Hex color.

267
00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:43.990
Click the checkbox.

268
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.920
Now I have that and we ought to make the lettering white.

269
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:55.870
So dropdown menu text color can actually just click white right here and click Save and click Save.

270
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.160
Here we go now, I've edited that so that it's going to work everywhere I can close that, make sure

271
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.240
all changes are saved.

272
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:10.950
Now let's go back and on these customized pages where we have the custom white background menus, the

273
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:17.910
backgrounds, I mean, the dropdowns, excuse me, are the correct color and they even work for the

274
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:18.810
sticky version.

275
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:19.740
Awesome.
