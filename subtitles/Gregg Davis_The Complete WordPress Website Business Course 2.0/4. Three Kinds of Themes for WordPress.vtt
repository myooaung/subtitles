00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.480
This lesson is about why the newest default theme, 2022 and block based full, say, editing themes

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.430
are a good place to start learning WordPress, but they aren't quite ready for production sites unless

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.930
the site you create a simple and adapts to the available templates and patterns in the theme.

4
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.390
It's not that it doesn't work correctly, it's just that the available options for custom design, as

5
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.520
well as the selection of different themes is still very limited.

6
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.650
Working with block based full site editing or FSC themes allows you to know what's coming in the future

7
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.340
of WordPress.

8
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.640
The original style of working with WordPress using classic themes is still very relevant and offers

9
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.190
many more options for custom design at this point.

10
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.210
The non full site editing or classic themes includes some features not present in an NFC enabled theme.

11
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.420
For example, when using a classic theme under the appearance menu in the WordPress dashboard, you'll

12
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.250
see the customizer and menus widgets, as well as site identity and additional CIUSSS sections available

13
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.800
within the customizer that are not there.

14
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.880
When an FC theme is activated and many themes like cadence that I recommend and teach in the course

15
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.090
use the original or classic way of working with the customizer, but add their own version of full set

16
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.540
editing anyway, enabling the addition of header and footer customization, as well as sitewide templates

17
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.160
for customizing the way certain pages or page types are rendered in WordPress.

18
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.800
And finally, page builders like Divij have been using their own versions of full, say, editing for

19
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.330
many years and aren't going away anytime soon in the upcoming lessons.

20
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.360
We'll explore full site editing using the newest default theme in WordPress called Twenty Twenty Two,

21
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.810
as well as a powerful classic theme called Cadence.

22
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.190
And finally, one of the most powerful design systems available for WordPress.

23
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.980
The Divij theme and visual builder By learning all three of these designing methods for WordPress,

24
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.680
you'll have a good idea of how you'll prefer to proceed, depending on your level of knowledge and experience

25
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.650
your working style or the needs of the project.
