00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.270
In this lesson, we'll talk about the benefits of self managed WordPress hosting and grid pain in particular.

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.270
You'll see why self-managed hosting is the most versatile, flexible and cost effective for hosting

3
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.120
multiple websites and also the highest performance.

4
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
By the end of this video, you'll understand how you might leverage grid pain in your business or how

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.550
you might grow into it once you have several websites to host.

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.930
Let's talk about the details of self-managed WordPress hosting and specifically grid pain at Grid PenCom.

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.630
You can get a 14 day trial to check it out and set up some servers and some sites to look at all the

8
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.260
features and the benefits of using a system like this.

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.100
But let's go over how it works.

10
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.000
First of all, and this is available right across the top, under how it works under their website.

11
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.030
Basically, you create your servers, you connect an infrastructure provider or a server company like

12
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.530
digital ocean or up cloud or a WC with Amazon.

13
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.700
There's a few others or really any other server provider that you'd like to use, and then you create

14
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.690
your website sites, your WordPress sites on those servers.

15
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.640
And then third, and this is a big one.

16
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.530
There's engineers on support 24-7.

17
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.970
There's an extensive knowledge base.

18
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.200
There's a great community help center where the support engineers at grid pain are in there, helping

19
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.110
people all the time and at the certain developer level and higher.

20
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:42.690
You've got 24-7 ticketing support from engineers that know WordPress and know servers and system administration.

21
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.540
And so if we go into creating servers, let's just go over a few of the benefits and then I'll give

22
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.360
you a tour of my grid pain account so you could see how I'm using it and why I'm using it again.

23
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.170
I would recommend that you start looking at self-managed WordPress hosting.

24
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.370
If you're hosting or planning to host 10 or more WordPress websites, it really becomes the most affordable

25
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.800
way and the most powerful and speedy way of hosting WordPress websites.

26
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.120
And so you choose your provider, Digital Ocean or Vulture, Leonard, Amazon, LightSail Up Cloud,

27
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.000
or even a custom virtual private server.

28
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.850
It's basically cloud hosting that you control with full transparency.

29
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.020
There's there's nothing hidden.

30
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.740
There's no number of visits, limitations, really.

31
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.850
You just have to use their systems to monitor the resources you're being that you're using on your servers

32
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.300
and then upskill if you need to.

33
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.570
You can easily move sites around clone sites to different servers or to different domain names.

34
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.340
There's so many benefits all to all of this, you'll see this is a really, really awesome thing that's

35
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.480
not included or managed by any WordPress hosting that I know of other than grid pain.

36
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.890
This is something that is a high availability setup.

37
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.320
Up high availability is traditionally has been used for dedicated servers.

38
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.170
Companies that have system administrators on staff to be able to manage systems like this.

39
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.500
But for the layman and for someone who doesn't like me who doesn't do anything technically as far as

40
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.440
programming the software that works on the server.

41
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.060
Listen to what this does.

42
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.800
So this you combine this with your DNS system and basically what you have is you have two copies of

43
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:50.340
your entire server that might be 10 websites, 20 websites or 40 websites on a server that you're managing

44
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.150
individually.

45
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:59.040
But at the server level, you can have a completely synchronized even by the hour set of servers, say

46
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.300
two servers, one is the primary server, and the second is the failover server.

47
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.680
What that means that is that if there is any issue as far as traffic not being able to open any of the

48
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.180
websites on the original server, the traffic gets immediately routed to the second server in a failover

49
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.350
type of scenario.

50
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:27.210
And so you have a backup server that's again constantly synchronized and available in the seconds for

51
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.150
any visitors that can't open the original website.

52
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.590
Setting this up without any code and without having to know how to program it is just amazing.

53
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.760
I'd love to show you around my good paying account, just to show you some of the things that I have

54
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.010
here and how it works a little bit now.

55
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.700
The main difference with self-managed WordPress hosting is that you are setting up your own servers

56
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.030
and you're paying for those separately, so we can talk about the pricing just a little bit and I did

57
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.460
in the hosting introductory lesson as well.

58
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.000
But as far as grid pain goes.

59
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:10.090
Starting at the panel level, there panel costs $50 a month for you to access these functions in the

60
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.310
grid pain control panel and then you need to pay separately for your servers.

61
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.870
And so if you, for example, want to set up, you know, a digital ocean server, you've already set

62
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:31.380
up your connection here and let me just go back and show you under my settings right here under my account,

63
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.080
I can look at my integrations and I've showed you this a little bit.

64
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.930
I've got certain cloud providers, Vulture Digital Ocean, I have set up and up cloud.

65
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.680
I have setup.

66
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.200
Those are my three server companies, in addition to one that's not automatically integrated, called

67
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.520
over for a large, dedicated server I use for the students sandboxes.

68
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.450
But in any case, since those are already set up, I can go into my servers area and if I'm ready to

69
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.170
set up a server, I can just go to one of my providers.

70
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.950
I can, you know, click in and look.

71
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.920
Name the server and then start to select my plan.

72
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.790
And now I'd recommend that you go with a four gigabyte ram plan.

73
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:21.760
At a minimum, that's a $20 server, $20 per month, and you can easily host 20 to 40 websites on a

74
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.550
$20 a month server at digital ocean or vulture or up cloud anywhere you want to.

75
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.090
And so one of the things that you can do is you can spread your web sites to different servers in different

76
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.100
locations around the world or wherever your website visitors are mostly from.

77
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:46.030
And therefore, you can actually spread them around so much that say, you know, I had an outage or

78
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.870
something like that.

79
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.810
You can have this automated, automated failover system set up, but as well you can easily and with

80
00:06:52.810 --> 00:07:00.820
one click clone your sites from one server to a different server and move sites around so fast it's

81
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.710
at way different than migrating WordPress that we're going to learn later in the course in the whole

82
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.060
migration section.

83
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:14.530
But now that I have multiple sites set up in great pain, I can really easily just clone them over from

84
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:20.470
one server to the next and arrange to close different servers, open other servers up.

85
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.110
They're actually charged by the minute and not by the month in this industry.

86
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.480
And so, you know, as soon as I shut off one of these servers and spin up a different one, my my money

87
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.350
is pro-rated.

88
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.560
You know, they bill per month, but they charge you per minute.

89
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.210
And so it's easy to move sites around between servers.

90
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:50.770
You also get this great monitoring program pre-installed, called Monit, which gives you some, you

91
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:56.860
know, the CPU usage, the load and the memory usage on your server, as well as a whole lot of information

92
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.920
about the space used what the server has.

93
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.650
This is, you know, the minimum I would use.

94
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:10.120
I would fit 20 to 40 sites on a server like this with, you know, two CPU cores and four gigabytes

95
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.380
of memory.

96
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:17.890
And that comes with 80 gigabytes of storage, plenty of space for 20 to 40 websites on WordPress.

97
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.310
And so here in my great pain, this is where I would set up a server.

98
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:29.080
Now, if I look at sites, if I go down at look at all of my sites, you know, what I might do is just

99
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:36.760
look at my own sites under the leveraged WP brand if I were to look at any of my sites right here.

100
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:44.440
It opens a site's control panel where I have all of these controls across the top for my sites.

101
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.640
It shows my IP address.

102
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.160
It shows the name of the server where I have this site configured and there's certain settings across

103
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:59.140
the top here, you know, using the engine next page, caching something back at, you know, under

104
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.700
creating web sites.

105
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:05.800
This is something now that we're on the site's screen at grid pain, I wanted to go down and show you.

106
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.260
So website isolation, keeping your individual web sites isolated and secure.

107
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:17.830
We created individual system users, and so that's where you can fit 20 to 40 websites on a single server

108
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.380
and they are virtually private, meaning VPNs, virtual private servers.

109
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.580
And so in a way, it's like your own private shared hosting.

110
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.950
But honestly, it's not shared.

111
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.630
We're we're sharing resources on the server.

112
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:39.460
But that server can be expanded in at a moment's notice, so it's scalable so way better than shared

113
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:39.940
hosting.

114
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:46.090
You can also control, like I said, which sites are hosted on which servers and move them around in

115
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.930
an instant using the cloning feature feature, which I'll show you in a minute.

116
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:57.130
And so web application firewalls, those are things that prevent, you know, login page attacks that

117
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.690
can eat up your resources.

118
00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:07.150
It really before the bad traffic ever hits your WordPress website or uses any of the resources like

119
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.380
like pulling pages from your database or anything, it disappears.

120
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:18.070
It gets filtered out from these web application firewalls or waifs at the server level.

121
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.600
And so it's super fast.

122
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:28.120
Websites are available with with really the most advanced caching programs that have been built for

123
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.630
WordPress.

124
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.630
The bundles are kind of like what they call blueprints at Flywheel, so you can create bundles of plugins,

125
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:40.870
themes and ways that your installations are customized so that when you create a new site, it's got

126
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:48.100
everything you want in it, and you can even create the multiple bundles to be able to turn on and off

127
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.570
different plugins or themes that you're using or not using on particular websites.

128
00:10:53.050 --> 00:11:00.160
Of course, one click staging would be here just like in managed WordPress and in some of the higher

129
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.140
tier site ground staging plans.

130
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.710
Staging is super important and really easy.

131
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.170
You can even use it as kind of an instant backup at any time if you want to make some changes.

132
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.550
Just create a staging copy and make some changes there test to make sure everything is good.

133
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:20.890
Then you can either deploy that back and overwrite the live side, or you can just leave that as your

134
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:26.200
testing environment and just do what you did on the real site because you've practiced it once it makes

135
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.450
it so easy to to work back and forth between live and staging.

136
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.490
The backups are pretty crazy if you read more deeply into it.

137
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:42.310
There's the, you know, divide up backups even by the minute.

138
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:49.720
As far as your WordPress websites being divided up into all of these tiny little files and stored on

139
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.200
the server to be restored bill back to the server at any point.

140
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.440
So, you know, they'll save, you know, hourly backups.

141
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:04.210
They'll save back in time for a month, they'll save weekly backups back in time for months and they'll

142
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.100
save, you know, yearly backups.

143
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:12.850
So there's all these restore able backups just automatically saved to your server and they are automatically

144
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.480
trimmed out of the back end.

145
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:20.560
So you always have your current set of backups up to the minute or hour however you want to define it,

146
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:27.100
as well as older backups get deleted when the new ones are created, and so you don't waste any server

147
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.430
space in that way.

148
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.770
You know, the DNS we'll talk about in the next section with domains and DNS.

149
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:40.780
They have a Cloudflare and DNS made easy integrations that make it super easy to migrate and move websites

150
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:48.190
around and have, you know, instant no downtime changes as far as either migrating websites, changing

151
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.460
email hosting or email systems and other things you might do.

152
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:58.840
And so there's so much that you can do and do your own research on grid pain, but highly recommend

153
00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:58.990
it.

154
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:00.480
And we go with security.

155
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.240
This is what I was talking about before.

156
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.990
You know, there's the 6G or 7G web application firewall.

157
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:14.200
I don't actually have turned on right now at the moment, but I should add leverage WP, the IP settings

158
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.460
that I mentioned right here.

159
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:21.250
Here's my backup systems where I have hourly and then they're saved in the system.

160
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:27.670
I can define at what minute of the hour those are done so that my sites that are on the same server

161
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.740
don't occur at the same time.

162
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.640
And this cloning feature is just amazing.

163
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:42.100
You know, I can, I can, you know, clone a website at the same domain name to another server where

164
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.390
it's not currently hosted.

165
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:50.200
I just click that Migrate Clone Now button, and in a few minutes I have an exact copy, with the database

166
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:56.470
working correctly and named correctly with that domain name at a different server, I could click and

167
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:04.120
here under new site URL, I could place a say and move it to a new site URL at either the same server

168
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.670
or a different server and migrate that over.

169
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:14.590
And you can even clone an existing site and overwrite another site that set a domain name and then you

170
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.940
choose your domain name there.

171
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.000
So the cloning feature is quite amazing at good pain.

172
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:25.390
You control your domains here where you're connected with the API, and you can manage your DNS settings

173
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:31.210
even externally through this API connection to Cloudflare or DNS Medici.

174
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:37.510
Like I said, those are the two really the two fastest time to first byte DNS providers in the world.

175
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.820
And so that's why good pain integrates with them.

176
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.960
Control your Secure Sockets layer or your SSL certificates here with Let's Encrypt and then a wildcard

177
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.920
certificate if you're using subdomains like with a multi-site installation.

178
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:59.050
And there's all kinds of ability to enable and disable the WP debug functionality with just one, click

179
00:14:59.050 --> 00:14:59.650
here and then.

180
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:04.680
View the logs, all these logs, in case there are any errors or you want to see what's going on in

181
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.980
the background are just OpenTable right here.

182
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:17.220
The say it has super good support for a subdomain or subdirectory, multi-site installations at grid

183
00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.280
pain and then a little bit further along.

184
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.530
There's the new features that they have underbody you can use and sign up for over there.

185
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:34.110
And so to make a long story longer grid pain is amazing if you're going to be hosting multiple WordPress

186
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.800
web sites.

187
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.980
I can't recommend a hosting provider more highly than grid pain.

188
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.220
In fact, there's a great community on Facebook, with people discussing ways to leverage WordPress

189
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.750
and leverage grid pain.

190
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.880
The founder of Great Pains always in there.

191
00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:02.820
This is just an amazing company that is really they've built this proprietary software stack.

192
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:08.120
They give you a great control panel without having to use any code, and then they're fully transparent.

193
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:15.570
You can see exactly what resources you're using at each server and then expand or contract those as

194
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:21.870
necessary and again, move your sites around between servers and among your servers at will.

195
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:28.620
And so if we talk about how that works, as far as you know, you know, looking at the pricing page

196
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:38.490
once again as we end this lesson for an example, if you've got the panel plan and say you have a $20

197
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:44.880
server, just one where you're going to host, maybe, you know, 20 to 40 websites say you're hosting

198
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:52.020
20 websites and they're paying you a minimum, say they're paying you just, you know, to $25 a month

199
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.860
for those 20 websites.

200
00:16:54.860 --> 00:17:00.780
So that's $500 a month of income where you only have to pay $70 a month.

201
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.880
And so you could see how that can expand into the future.

202
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:13.500
The the developer plan is really what I'd highly recommend if you're hosting 10 to 100 to 1000 WordPress

203
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:22.140
websites because it is so affordable when you're able to scale and you don't have to pay a markup on

204
00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.040
your servers.

205
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:30.510
So, you know, a company like Managed WordPress at Flywheel is using these same exact servers that

206
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.210
we're using over here at grid pain.

207
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:39.930
They are plugging into the same servers, and they're loading up their customers onto servers at a rate

208
00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:45.540
of, you know, 20 to 40 to 80 to 500 sites on each server.

209
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:49.620
They're just not being very transparent about the resource usage.

210
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:57.660
They just will look at how many visitors you have to each site and how much storage space you're currently

211
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:04.200
using and just escalate you up to the next level higher without really being transparent about the server

212
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.170
space and the resource usage on those servers.

213
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.590
However, it's a good solution if you want a totally done for you.

214
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.780
Way to do it now.

215
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.010
Great pain to me is like managed WordPress.

216
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:21.870
It has all the benefits of a done for you service, but it has the transparency of you being able to

217
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:27.390
control where your websites are located, what server resources and what servers they're hosted at.

218
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:33.300
So you really get the best of all worlds with self-managed hosting at Great.
