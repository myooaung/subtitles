1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,300
In this lesson, we'll finish and verify the SSL certificate setup and explore email routing through

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:06,960
Cloudflare.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,630
You'll learn some troubleshooting as the DNS propagates, as well as a new feature that can allow for

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,320
custom domain name email addresses without email hosting.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,840
By the end of this video, you'll understand how the Cloudflare DNS system works from start to finish

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,480
and how to set up email routing for a quick win for client sites or custom email addresses.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,150
So it only took a few minutes to refresh and have the DNS propagate for long enough.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:41,910
That I've got a real website here at Greg Davis Dock Club with the default 20 22 theme active at a secure

9
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,880
domain using HTTPS.

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,830
And so, you know, if I copy that domain name, I look at it right here.

11
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,930
The protocol is https.

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,500
I'm getting the lock symbol showing that the connection is secure in the certificate is valid.

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,680
And so that was the entire setup.

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,990
Now, you know, I can feel free to navigate to the site here in grid pain.

15
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:15,480
And what I love about grid pain as well is the ability to just click the little WordPress logo for single

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:22,410
sign on, which will allow you to just log straight in to your WordPress website without having to put

17
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,030
in the username and password.

18
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,850
In fact, I'm using a very secure automated password generator when I set up new sites here at grid

19
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,120
pain.

20
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,200
And so, you know, now if I wanted to, I could go to user's profile.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:43,440
And even if I change the password to something that's more, you know, either difficult to remember

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,980
or something that is easier for me to remember for this website, even if I change their profile password.

23
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:56,580
The single sign on will still work for this domain if I click the W symbol right there.

24
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,480
And so now I've got, you know, a real WordPress website ready to go that could go, you know, visit

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:11,280
site, and I open it in a new tab and begin developing a site at a secure domain here and anytime I

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:22,320
want to in grid pain, I could also go up to staging and I could add that as a staging domain so that

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,470
I could do that as one of my websites here at grid pain.

28
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:34,890
And so, you know, back at the iPad here, the DNS records, you know, what we've done is we've used

29
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:43,620
Cloudflare as a separate DNS provider so that we can control where a records and C records point to

30
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,430
what host.

31
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,940
And at the same time, we can do use and edit text records for domain verification, for emails, et

32
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,390
cetera.

33
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:58,350
And as we go into the next few sections of the course, you'll see that we need to be able to control

34
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:05,850
the Emacs records in the DNS for our domain in order to create and host email accounts, which is something

35
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,050
we will do in the next few sections while we're here at Cloudflare.

36
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,570
Let me talk about email routing a little bit.

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,180
I know that in a future section of the website, we're going to talk about the three types of email

38
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,860
in detail and setup and recommended best practices around email.

39
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:30,390
But for now, since we're talking about DNS domain name routing and pointing domain names correctly

40
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:37,140
under this Greg Davis Duck Club domain if we look at the DNS records, if I were to set up an email

41
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,710
address at this domain name, I would need to use email hosting.

42
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,000
We're going to talk about that in the future section, like I mentioned, but maybe I want to set up

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,140
an email like Greg at Greg Davis Dot Club.

44
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:57,990
And one of the great things about Cloudflare is their new email routing scenario, where you can actually

45
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:05,370
set up email addresses that work at a custom domain name like Greg Davis Dot Club, because it's much

46
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:12,090
more professional for a business to have domain names like info or customer service at the domain name

47
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,950
dot com for business, and that requires email hosting normally.

48
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,500
And so if you want to send and receive emails like that, you do have to set up email hosting.

49
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,950
However, if you only want to be able to have people send to that address and have that address on business

50
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:35,460
cards or on your website for people to access and receive mail, you can do a shortcut which is email

51
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:35,940
routing.

52
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:44,520
So under this website here, Greg Davis Dot Club at Cloudflare, I'll click email and this is the email

53
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,620
routing system that is recently started.

54
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,520
That's why it says beta right here, but it's working quite well.

55
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,340
All you have to do is click get started.

56
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,850
And basically what it does is you can create a custom email address that will receive email at the.

57
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:06,730
Dress, and it will automatically forward it to any email address that you like, so you can even just

58
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,770
start typing an email address like.

59
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:19,680
You know, woops, a working email address that you have at a at a different business or say it's your

60
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,520
Gmail address or the customer or your client's Gmail address.

61
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,450
It can make it really easy for you to set up a working business custom email address that without any

62
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:36,030
email hosting that you have to pay for and without having anything complicated for the user.

63
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,390
What this enables you to do is set up an email address that can be received by your client at their

64
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:49,260
website address, but it receives it at their regular Gmail or wherever they already check emails.

65
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,670
Now, one limitation is that if you set this up, it can't actually be sent from this address.

66
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,830
It's a receiving only, but sometimes it's a great solution to be able to set up custom email addresses

67
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:10,200
at the domain name and have them be received at a Gmail or the email address where the client already

68
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,190
checks their emails.

69
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,050
Great solution from Cloudflare.
