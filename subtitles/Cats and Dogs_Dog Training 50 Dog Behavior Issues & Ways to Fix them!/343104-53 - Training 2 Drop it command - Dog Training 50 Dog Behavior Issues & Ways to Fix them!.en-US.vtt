because the three time more exciting is that,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.260
additionally,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.470
you need to rotate between defend toys on a regular basis to make it more effective.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.420

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.840
understanding off the command to a level such that it doesn't associate this command on

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.450
live with this toys or the specific places.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.600
With this purpose,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.040

Drop it.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.350
Come on.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.150
Don't use unacceptable doing objects in this exercise.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.840

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.430
if you don't likes to chew on your shoes,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.720
which is generally unacceptable,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.900
don't use it to teach him this.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.380
Come out.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.050

treat further.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.510
Each session should last about 15 minutes,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.980
and you can attempt up to three sessions spread throughout the day.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.240
Difficultly the younger the dog,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.350
the shorter the session should be,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.320
because younger does tend to have limited attention.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.050
Spence.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.810

gently dropped whatever.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.390
He s bigger that don't just wants to take a closer look at item,

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.710
and once he knows what it is,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.550
it doesn't want it anyway.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.610
But then you start snatching that thing from your dog right away.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.570
You make it seem more value and therefore worth holding onto.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.260
Also,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.110
your dog learns that you always take things away from him,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.050
and therefore he's more likely to run away or swallow the item before you can grab it.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.350
And this is exactly the opposite off what you want
