00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
dogs can prove to be perfect companion petition.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:10.310
Even many researchers have computed that Children living with dogs are healthier and more

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.410
emotionally balanced than their peers.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.030
However,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.330
in case adopt develops fear of Children,

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.970
it can be nightmare.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.190
For the PAC parents,

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.950
as instead of being a companion to their child,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.850
the dough can pose a serious threat.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.690
Who is safety?

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.590
There are primarily two major reasons for a doctor.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.900
Develop fear of Children.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.050
The first reason for this behavior of dogs is lack off early socialization with Children.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.130
If a dog was never exposed to Children during his popular,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.100
he may become fearful off them.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.250
Many music them later in his life,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.620
when an adult door and compass Children for the first time,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.920
he will find their own family size,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.650
smell,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.250
noises and movements extremely frightening,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.750
thus proceeding Children Toby tracked for him.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.810
I don't may also develop fear of Children if he had some negative experience with the child

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.810
.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.650
In the past,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.200
Children have a tendency to play a little rough.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.350
Then it no good prayerful.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.500
They may be inappropriately with dogs by pulling their tails here or years,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.250
raising them and even poking their ice.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.770
Besides small Children are junkie in the movements,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.150
so they may also harder dog unintentionally by tripping and falling on the door and four

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.790
dogs.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.150
Even one such experience can create an aversion or fear of Children.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.260
Subsequently,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.550
this fear or aversion becomes a reason why so many Children are bitten by dogs.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.950
Those entered and don't know how to behave around each other instinctively.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.430
Therefore,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.530
steps must be taken to beach,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.450
both dogs and Children to interact with each other.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.050
Safety.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.310
Let's discuss what you as a parent can do to minimize your dog sphere of Children.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.100
Desensitization and counter conditioning can be really effective in managing fear off

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.150
Children in your door.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.980
First of all,

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.150
desensitize you doctor your child's presence by slowly introducing him to your child.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.320
But as a fearful dog can become aggressive and can even by the child.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.430
Therefore,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.590
it is very important to be cautious at all the times during this exercise on the count

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.500
Broken Disney.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.260
Instead,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.970
your kid to stand at a safe distance from your dog and then ask him who told your doorstep

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.150
retreats towards him.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.360
This will help him from a positive association with the presence off the check then,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.070
over the course of several days,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.590
weeks or months,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.180
depending on the severity off your dose field,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.730
you can decrease the distance between your dog and the child who I ensuring to give him.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.580
His favorite treats throughout the post is all techniques should be performed slowly and

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.970
with proper precautions,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.550
with full emphasis on safety off your child.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.950
It is always backer who take the help off a behaviorist for this desensitization program.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.620
In case you have a toddler,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.440
you can't use the previously discussed contact condition technique as you can't instruct

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.210
him who taught rates towards your door in such a scenario to make the child's presence

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.240
rewarding for your dog.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.830
For another given technique,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.970
ask your doctor.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.250
Sit calmly and quietly in the presence off your torture,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.810
and as soon as he obeys your command and sits down quietly,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.950
reward him with his favorite trees.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.390
After repeating this exercise several times,

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.460
your dog will start associating your daughter with good things and this fear we gradually

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.150
disappeared.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.050
It is very crucial to understand that you should never imposed any interaction on your door

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.050
.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.350
If a fearful dough is pushed too far,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.750
he may become aggressive towards the child and everyone else in this facility.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.490
It is very important to know dumb,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.050
that forcing an interaction will only intensify your dogs fear of Children,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.450
and in turn,

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.050
we create an unsafe situation in the house.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.280
So during any interaction with your child,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.200
if your dog seems uneasy,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.550
allow him to Ste.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:24.150
I look to you to safe and quiet zone for your dough in your home so that he can retreat to

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.750
his place whenever he wants.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.380
For example,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.280
during an interaction with your child,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.050
will then other Children visit you.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.250
Create can also be a perfect place for your dog to height,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.850
but make sure not to allow Children to go near the safe zone,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.550
irrespective of whether he is currently hiding there or not.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.720
This will help your dog and easing this fear,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.050
and we also convey him that he's safe in his own.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.210
Never allow kids to come and get your dog.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.820
Why he is in his own.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.000
Additionally,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.940
it's kids visiting your home to ignore and pay no attention to your fearful dog.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.350
This will is his anxiety and will give him the space he needs.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.040
Always supervise infants and young Children around your dog and never leave them alone with

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.150
your dog if he is afraid of Children.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.960
Another important thing that you should keep in mind is to avoid any kind of queer soup

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.300
training techniques when they see or even yelling at your dog.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.650
If you box of blouse that your child will almost certainly aggravate the problem.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.230
His fear.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.820
We only Greece because he will start feeling that every time this kid shows up,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.530
you should delegate,

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.950
upset and angry at him.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.540
The proper way of addressing your dogs here off Children requires the use of

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:50.480
desensitization and comfort condition exercise in case you are planning to adopt a puppy,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.800
The best way to prevent this fear of Children in him is to socialize him with your Children

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.750
straight away as you bring him home.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.900
Additionally,

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.520
all the interactions between your dog and Children should be supervised positive,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.450
come and a bit with a maximum extent possible,

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.850
even if you don't have kids at your home.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.760
Still,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.520
it is very important to socialize your dog with other kids in is for people.

If you have a dog who is fearful of Children then you need to establish fuels for your

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.450
Children as well.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.950
For instance,

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.050
ask them not to disturb your job when he's eating or sleeping.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.350
Do not allow your kids to interact with the dog without supervision.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.940
Teach your kids to respect the privacy off your dog.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.520

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.550

Also,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.850
tell them no to try to gather your dog's feet.

Those are not comfortable with huggy,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.850
and they may even perceive hugging as a crypt.
