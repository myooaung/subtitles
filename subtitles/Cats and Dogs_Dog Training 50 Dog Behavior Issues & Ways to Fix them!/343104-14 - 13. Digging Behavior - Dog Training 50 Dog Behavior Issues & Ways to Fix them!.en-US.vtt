00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.810
most of the behaviors exhibited by dogs are either learned behaviours.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.550
World consequences off their natural instincts,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.920
and they're digging.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.230
Behaviour is no exception whenever you see your dog digging out holes in your backyard

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.350
instead of getting upset at him.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.500
Consider,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.800
but might be prompting him to do this.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.720
First of all,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.370
let's discuss the possible reasons that can lead to this.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.650
Taking behavior in your dog does often dig out of boredom.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.050
Did he can be fun for them,

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.100
thus making it a great before them to relieve this stress?

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.950
This dress can,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.200
because because of boredom or other behavioral issues like separation anxiety.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.050
If your dog has to spend a long time alone in the yard,

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.550
then he might turn to digging in order to engage himself.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.810
Some does may also consider digging as a means to escape.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.880
If your dog lives in the fast yard and he doesn't like that place quite naturally,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.750
he will try to escape from there.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.770
In such a scenario,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.030
he may consider Digi has an option to escape to digging.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.570
Some dogs try to escape something that the field,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.040
for instance,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.950
neighborhood dogs or natural,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.530
even statist under stops in case you haven't unspoiled dog,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.780
Then to digging,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.850
he or she may be trying to escape in order to make it another door.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.860
Sometimes he might hear the sounds off underground books or my expense,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.410
something by it inside the ground.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.620
Therefore,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.450
he starts digging in an attempt to find his play.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.370
Even if you use,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.020
born or bled me to fertilize your garden,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.860
it sent.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.350
Maybe it is stable to your door.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.540
Therefore,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.330
he made big in an attempt to find that non existent born since that deeper layers of ground

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.460
tend to be cooler than the ground surface.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.790
Thus,

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.750
your dog may be digging to find the cool and comfortable sport two later on,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.840
particularly during the summers when it is hot in the open sent and the ground is valuable

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.840
,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.090
your dog may be digging a hole in order to hide this toys.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.000
Food treats for other valued items.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.570
This is his natural preservation instinct.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.580
If you don't like certain windows in his diet,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.720
then also him a turn to digging with the hope of finding them in the soil off your young,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.820
there are certain things that you can do to manage your dogs.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.030
Digging behaviour first and foremost,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.190
you need to realize that baking is your dog's natural treat.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.520
Therefore,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.190
expecting him to stop digi would be unfair.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.150
But you can read like this behavior off a dog with a permitted areas in the yacht.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.090
Give your dog a place in the yard where he is permitted to dick and then train him to dig

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.460
in that particular place only and northern other inappropriate places.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.120
So from the soil off that place.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.490
And but if every street off your dog days now,

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.900
bring your dog over to this area and then tell him to Dick.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.540
And when he uncovers the treat,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.250
praise him.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.560
They beat this exercise,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.250
and he has learned to dig in the permitted area.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.230
Now,

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.390
if you get him digging in an inappropriate area,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.990
tell him to stop with the no command and then take him to the desired area and said Dick

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.040
followed by place.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.290
If he digs with time and patience,

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.800
you don't.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.460
We learned to dig in the desired alia.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.710
You can also Dr him from digging in inappropriate areas by putting diluted ammonia or small

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.810
amounts of Citrus in that area does dislike the smell of these compounds and therefore,

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.950
won't pay for digging in such an area,

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.070
but as a precaution,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.080
it is always recommended to first consult your vet regarding safety of any substance that

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.750
you choose to use as a debt isn't.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.400
If your dog is digging out of boredom,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.760
then it is suggested to have regular interactive play sessions with him for at least 30

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.480
minutes in a day,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.950
take him for long walks and play fats games like Crispy with him.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.100
You should also provide him with two toys or interactive tools,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.210
further feeding with the help of food puzzle toys for his mental stimulation.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.030
Engaging his mind and keeping him busy are the best solutions to tackle this behavior,

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.050
and moreover,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.250
it's a good opportunity for you to establish a strong born with your door,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.050
Given plenty of things to engage himself by your away.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.130
Rotating his oil toys or introducing new toys may also help your dog to come back his

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.560
border.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.030
And if your dog is digging to get relief from the heat,

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.460
then provide him a cool,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.050
shady place to rest while his outside.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.950
It is also essential to consult your vet to ensure that he is not suffering from any mental

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.750
deficiency,

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.680
because the efficiency off menders is also one of the reasons for digging by a dough
