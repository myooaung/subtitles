After you have taught your dog to be gentle with his mouth,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.810

Never allow him to please,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.950

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.630
A lot of his energy will be expended while playing with them,

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.510
and he even no longer have the H two playoff live with you.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:08.450
Does he want the precautions that you need to take to stop his noting behavior?

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.650
First and foremost,

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.200
discourage him to play with your hands,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.550
fingers and feet.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.830
You're wiggling.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.750

Playing together strengthens of want between the two off you.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.730
Your goal should be to teach your dog to play gently Jonah,

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.350
then not to play at all.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:41.660

Grab it,

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.750
you on a plate roughly.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.840

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.440
So then they aren't much fun to play with.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:06.090
Most people react to a dog jumping up on grabbing their hand by pulling back on trying to

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.250
push the dog of A,

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.780
which only increases the intensity often already excited.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.250
Talk.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.170
Do a dog.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.960
It indicates that you also want to play,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:21.950
and therefore it only encourages him to continue the unwanted roughly behavior.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.440
Instead,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.330
stand still,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.250
fold your arms and pull your hands up so that your dog can't read them.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:35.820
Avoid looking at two or talking to him with no attention and no hands to model.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.250
