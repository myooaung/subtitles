00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
chewing is an innate characteristic off dogs and stems from the fact the dogs use their

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.350
mouth to explore the world around them.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.260
But this natural chewing becomes destructive when it is directed towards inappropriate

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.900
objects,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.570
such as shoes for nature or an owner's hands and feet etcetera.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.750
Inappropriate chewing is a fairly common problem observed in dogs.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.940
Chewing accomplishes a number of things for a dog.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.820
For young dogs,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.070
chewing is a means to relieve the pain caused by an incoming teat.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.550

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.170
The thing is a painful process,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.280
therefore,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.520
but is often to more during this period because their guns are irritated on the act of

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.050
chewing relieves this discomfort.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.530
Hence,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.350
inappropriate chewing is most likely to happen when the poppies t think.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.730
But if this problem is not corrected during his poppy hoot,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.250
then sometimes it can also become a long lasting problem.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.850
Even when the puppy becomes an adult.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.120
For all the dogs,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.150
chewing is a way of keeping their jaws and teeth strong and clean.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
Additionally,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.750
chewing is also a way for dogs to explore things.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.330

especially puppies,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.550
are extremely playful and investigative.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.880
It is quite a normal behavior for puppies to investigate their environment by sniffing,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.250
tasting and chewing on object present in the home.

Some dogs meet you because they have learned that they receive attention from the human

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.620
family.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.420
Each time,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.120

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.770
it is always recommended to consult your vet to rule out any underlying medical condition

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.750
that you don't may be suffering from.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.270
Because certain medical conditions can also lead to inappropriate chewing behavior in your

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.840
dog,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.630
for instance,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.090
nutritional deficiencies and gastrointestinal problems can trigger chewing as a coping

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.950
mechanism.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.120

or does it smell like food?

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.610
This destructive chewing can also be a result off another behavior problem,

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.350
like separation anxiety,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.670

Lose them baby teeth and experience pain,

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.690

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.150

During this face,

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.120
it is recommended to give them ice cubes.

Wash flute.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.350
As these might help to numb the TTP.

You should also teach your puppy to district as chewing to a prepared objects like his toys

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.450

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.250
Chewing isn't innate characteristic off dogs off all edges.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.460
They must bring us chewing bones,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.270
sticks and just about anything else available that showing activity keeps there's your

I'm t chewing to inappropriate optics.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.440
In such circumstances,

you should teach your dog what is okay to chew and what is not what.

Puppies and adult dogs should have a very tough,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.650
appropriate and attractive to choice to discourage inappropriate chewing.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.250
Each dog has its own preference for toys that likes to chew and played it,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.450
but be very cautious in giving him any such item,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.670
which can be easily broken down into smaller pieces.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.640
For example,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.820
be phones said small pieces can then easily be swelled by your dog,

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.550
which may result a choking hazards for him,

preferably provide him greenies like frozen carrot on dental chew sticks.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.150
To encourage appropriate chewing behaviour in him,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.800
it is suggested to introduce new chew toys on a regular interval.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.700
Although datas to toys every couple of days so that he does not get bored with the same

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.550

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:02.450
make sure that the toys or chewable you select for him a safe cannot be ripped apart on.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.640

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.280
For though you can discourage chewing off inappropriate items by spring them with your in

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.150

Didn't Jesus tree that is not harmful for your dog,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.850
but it is really bad when you first use indebted int.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.520
Apply a small amount on a piece off tissue or content full and gently place it directly in

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.350
your dog's mo.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.700
Allow him to taste it.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.400
If you don't finds a taste unpleasant,

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.250
he would shake his head and with spit it out,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.950
he won't pick up that piece of tissue or full again.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.880
This,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.110
as he has learned that based on the order of the deterrent,

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.860
he will be more likely to award chewing heightens.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.700
That's more like it spreading deterrent on all those objects that you don't want your

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.650
doctor to.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:07:00.360
The use of detonates is an effective technique for managing this behavior off your door as

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.860
a bad parent it is your responsibility to help.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.150
You don't learn the difference between things he should and shouldn't you?

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:14.970
It is very important to avoid any possible confusion by offering unwanted household items

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:20.920
like all shoes on discarded cushions for chewing and then expecting him to loan that your

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.850
new shoes are not okay to to.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.840
If you don't want your belongings in your dog smoke,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.750
don't make them available to him.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.770
Keep your clothing,

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.450
shoes,

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:32.070

Reach you shop,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.150
supervising closely while training him to cheer on appropriate things.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.830
If it begins to choose something in a pro,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.350
Putin,

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.650
tell him to stop and redirect him to an appropriate chew toy.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.660
As soon as the dog starts chewing on the appropriate item on toy,

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:59.550
appreciating and providing his favorite truths make it a point to all this.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:05.010
Praise your puppy or dog whenever you notice him chewing on an appropriate chew toy.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.860
This will encourage him to go for his own toys,

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.420
gender,

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.930

shoes and other objects off your home.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.420
If you can't supervise your dog all the time,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:24.050
you must confine him to prevent him from chewing on inappropriate things in your absence.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.690
For example,

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.010
value are invoke.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:32.150
You can leave your dog in a confined area off your home for up to six hours.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.460
You can either use a crate.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.950
I put your dog in a small room with the door or a baby.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.850

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:57.810
keep in mind that you will need to give him plenty of exercise and quality time with you

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.150
before confining him.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.320
Another way to manage your pop is destructive.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.850
Chewing is by poppy proofing your house.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:10.910
Look around the environment for possible dangers to your inquisitive poppy place.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:16.850
How for seniors and chemicals along the potentially toxic plants out of feet off your puppy

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.850
.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:23.450
Electric ones should be covered on made inaccessible to prevent your dog from chewing them

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:23.450
.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:28.110
Remove objects of curiosity that made appeal to your puppy,

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.230
such as shoes,

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:29.950
socks,

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:30.940
Children's choice.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:37.010
It's natural block his access to the rules that have not been poppy proved and consider

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:37.710
putting him in,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.450
create whenever he cannot be supervised.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:45.230
If your dog does not get enough physical and mental stimulation,

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.550
he may tend to look for ways to entertain himself.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.810
And chewing happens to be one of his favorite ways.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:52.750
To do that.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.520
To prevent the structure chewing,

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.650

Fetch games with him.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.650
You can also feed him through food puzzle toys,

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:14.450
as that will not only satiate his hunger but will also stimulate his mind.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.850
Playing together will not only reinforce,

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:18.810

Please,

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.110

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.850
try to avoid exposing him to such situations that make him stressed,

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.290
nervous or upset.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.550
Last but not the least.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.090
It is very important for pet parents to understand that punishment is off.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.340

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.050
but may even worse in your bond with him.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.880
