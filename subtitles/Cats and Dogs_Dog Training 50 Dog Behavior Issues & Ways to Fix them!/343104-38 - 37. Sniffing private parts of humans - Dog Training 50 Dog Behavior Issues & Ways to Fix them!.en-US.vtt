00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
people often get embarrassed,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.930
then don't start sniffing their drawing or pull this note in there.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.840
But it may be an inappropriate behavior,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.450
but dogs do this to seek information about that particular person.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.950
Dogs can tell a great deal about a person from his scent.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.150
Dogs offers men the rear end of other dogs as a sort of greeting on getting information

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.950
about them.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.330
It is a form of Dr Dog communication on this possibility of eight off getting a status

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.750
update from one and a do through this act of this.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.940
They also obtained other information that they need,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.190
like gender off the dog,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.290
what that dog is eating and even clues about a dog's emotional state.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.240
Since it's natural for your dog to greet other dogs history,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.180
he doesn't find it awkward.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.300
To greet humans in the same thing presents off pheromones is another reason why dogs sniff

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.760
or cockroaches and boats box can pick up the center pheromone chemicals that the EPA crime

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.110
said glands produce.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.500
These pheromones convey social information about us like our gender,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.310
our mood,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.200
our age,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.500
our health and,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.890
in case off a female.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.050
They may even convey the information if she is in her menstrual cycle or if she is pregnant

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.050
.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.200
Almost all members have feeling one.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.910
Producing epicurean plants spread all over their bodies,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.900
but with higher concentrations in the genital and anal areas on,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.710
the humans are no different,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.200
and we also have higher concentrations of pheromones in a genital and anal areas,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.380
which in turn makes them rich sources off information for our canine friends.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:01.540
If this sniffing behavior becomes a big issue on your dog seems to think that it is his job

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.960
to sniff everyone he meets Daniel.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.950
Intervention is very much required to correct this behavior issue.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.270
You don't maybe a baby,

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.250
but not everybody may have the same feelings for him.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.710
Therefore,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.380
you should take proper measures to manage this behavior off.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.970
Your dog varies around other people,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.950
beaching few obedience commands like sit and stay.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.510
Then a friend of yours comes to meet you,

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.130
and you don't start sniffing behavior immediately.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.140
Give him the command to sit or stay Eventually,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.970
over time,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.750
he will understand that he is not allowed to sniff your guest private parts,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.820
though it may take some time and patience,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.020
but even definitely see a change in your dog's behavior video.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.950
Consistent efforts always be consistent and clear Video commands.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.840
Then you don't obeys you and exhibits for appropriate behaviour towards your guest Bhatia

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.150
to revolt to as this ravine forced a good behavior in him.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.880
We showed you practice this method consistently until he developed a habit of sitting

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.280
calmly instead of broad sniffing.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.120
Whenever someone arrives until he gets properly trained to follow your sit and steak a

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.640
month,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.030
keep him on leash.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.950
Then you have visitors at your home.
