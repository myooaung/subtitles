00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
back visits are usually stressful for dogs.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.930
When you have to take your doctor vet and you have not uttered a word about it,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.890
he will start hiding from you.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.400
And we even we let tend to write the car,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.150
even though riding in the car is one of his favorite things.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.690
And when you reach the vaccine E,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.990
you normally behave.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.050
Dog will act,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.840
Bute will refuse to obey.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.250
Your commands will hide another tears and Reebok excessively.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.290
These were acts off.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.650
Your dog can even make you feel embarrassed at times,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.870
so it becomes very crucial who train your dog to stay calm and relaxed.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.510
Then you are visiting of it.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.950
They're citing pointers that you can implement to relieve distress and anxiety off your dog

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.650
whenever you have to visit of it.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.770
But before discussing these pointers,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.330
we need to understand.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.350
Why do dogs get stressed and anxious at the first place when they have to visit of it?

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.030
The family reason can be his examination at the vet's office during his examination.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.780
He is a strained by a technician and then his feet years dummy and eyes are examined,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.530
probably followed by administration off a vaccine or drawing off blood samples from his

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.950
body.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.760
This one family,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.570
a type of handling by strangers,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.720
can cause your daughter become confused,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.400
stressed,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.150
and a fleet.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.850
You know it's sick and is already feeling bad,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.650
and on top of that being handled by some strangers,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.240
some up to a traumatic experience for your dog.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.270
The fear of a back visit can set in as early as entering the car or in the parking boat,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.990
especially if the only time he gets in the car is to go to a veteran and as soon as he and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.760
physically Nick.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.170
There are various factors that can make a dog anxious like sent off other animals.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.390
See other dogs,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.790
the smell of medicines,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.270
uniform of the medical stuff,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.950
etcetera.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.770
Besides,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.770
if your dog has experienced something negative during his previous visits,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.180
then it is quite natural for him to feel anxious and afraid by visiting the vet again.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.660
This negative association can be because off a bad interaction with another animal in the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.440
waiting room or if he had to undergo a painful situation during his last visit,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.850
like getting injected or some other unpleasant experience.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.490
We believe that by now you would have a fair idea about Vital Doc's ex,

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.950
stressed and anxious when you take them for a visit.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.080
So let's proceed further and discuss the possible ways to make these back this.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.740
It's less stressful for your dog.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.460
Many dogs do not accept handling by a stranger,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.070
and the situation becomes even worse in case the handling is unfamiliar.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.520
The most important thing in such a situation is to train your dog to get used to the way

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.580
his backhanders in you can start doing small things at home to get your dog used to such

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.150
handling,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.290
handle his ears,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.820
look at his eyes and teeth,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.350
feel his belly and hold this pose,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.490
practised these exercises on a daily basis and make sure toe crazy and provide him his

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.250
favorite treats whenever he allows you to handle him.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.500
Then get the whole family and trusted friends involved in this exercise,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.590
the more comfortable your dog gets toe handling by different people.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.150
The back of the situation will be during a visit to the vet.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.270
Keep practicing this on a regular basis,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.130
and over time that examinations will no more be a big D for certain dogs.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.750
The only time they are given a car right is when they have to be taken for a visit.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.420
Therefore,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.050
their fear of that visit starts as soon as they enter the cup.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.090
If this is the case with your dog as well,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.540
help him not associate car right with that visits only for this take him out frequently to

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.950
new places in the car.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.490
Additionally,

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.840
you can make his car ready experience more enjoyable by keeping his favorite blanket and

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.010
this favorite toys on the car seat by associating a car ride with fun and positive

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.050
experiences,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.880
you can help your daughter stay calm and not get stressed when you take him for a back

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.850
visit in your car.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.500
Ideally,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.010
you take your daughter of ex clinic only when he's facing some health problem or for his

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.640
annual checkup,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.950
but to make him comfortable with back visit.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.300
You can get him used to the vets clearly before he actually faces a health problem.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.850
Planned visits to your backed just to socialize your dog with him.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.460
Pick a time.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.430
Many dogs feeling well and doesn't need to see the vet when you reach the backs.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.770
Clinic asked the receptionist and technical stuff to give your dog a few trips and some

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.850
family petting before meeting the vit.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.610
Black is going into the vax office gently during these social visits.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.420
Never force you talk to go to the VAX office and let him take his own time to get

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.270
comfortable with that.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.660
Let me,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.950
rather than dragging or carrying him inside,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.620
reboard your dog with his favorite treats and praise him as he enters inside the cleaning,

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.680
though this will desensitize and counter condition your dog to the vet visit,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.610
and we'll teach him to associate positive feelings with that.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.910
Really you and your dogs.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.000
Here's a close bond.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.850
He can easily perceive your feelings off stress,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.050
anxiety or fear.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.550
Then you visit of X Clinic and see your dog stressed and anxious.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.280
It is quite natural for you to become upset,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.950
Enver it.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.260
And once you become upset,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.380
your dog can sense it.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.880
Immediately he trusts you,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.860
and therefore,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.630
when he sees you worried and upset,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.030
he gets assure.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.010
That is reason for getting anxious and stressed is also valid to avoid this right to remain

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.390
calm during back visits,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.550
regardless off how you dope acts,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.070
try to a word patting currently or soothing him when he's acting stressed,

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.290
anxious or afraid.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.130
As in such a situation,

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.660
these actions will only reinforce this behavior.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.150
Just ignore this fearful and anxious behaviour.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.780
If you act like everything is fine,

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.710
you know will get the message to stay,

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.550
come and that there is nothing to be worried about.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.850
Physical activities also recommended in order to manage all kinds of dog behavioral issues

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.850
,

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.080
exercise increases your dogs happiness because of the release of the Happy Homan off

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.650
citizen.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.140
Therefore,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.920
making him exercise before the health check up can help him to stay calm and relaxed in the

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.330
clinic.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.110
Before the scandal appointment,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.800
they came for a long book or play fetch Otago board game with him off course.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.580
This works best if your dog is in good health and you're visiting back for his annual

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.860
checkup.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.490
If you're taking him through the vet for a less or an injury and he can't handle these

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.490
exercises,

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.150
give him the anti anxiety drugs prescribed by Ovett before visiting the clinic.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.150
If you don't becomes too difficult to handle when you visit the vet's office,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.120
then you should consider effect.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.720
Who makes house calls in such situations.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.190
It is a far better option to get him treated at home rather than making him stressed by

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.550
taking him to the vet skinny.
