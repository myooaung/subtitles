00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
old does have some level of predatory instincts,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.740
like daisy catching and killing small furry creatures like squeals.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.550
What birds?

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.670
Tradition has been natural survival instinct off your dogs.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.650
Ancestors.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.690
The entire predatory sequence in both Sergi stalking,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.630
gazing,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.450
getting biting,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.780
killing and then eating the pig.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.520
Many natural drives off dogs,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.760
including Page I,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.750
have been modified by selective breeding practices.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.350
The level of prayed a B recently Toby,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.260
for instance,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.250
books that have been bred who hardly sporting activities have a higher pay J compared to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.150
other groups.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:51.970
In domesticated does certain parts of discredit rate see tees grab and kill sequence having

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.850
diluted but have never been fully eliminated?

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.190
The most worrisome part off this predatory behavior is that it is not preceded by any

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.650
significant more change for trapping gestures.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.790
This absence of warning science bless the fact that killing is the natural end point for

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.100
everyday tree behavior is what makes it dangerous for target animals,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.930
Children,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.110
cyclists,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.270
jokers or anything else that most now let's discuss work triggers related aggression

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.050
indoors.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.350
The main stimulus for predatory aggression is movement.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.790
Also,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.520
this is one of the main differentiating factors between prenatally aggression and other

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.190
forms of aggression in the wild.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.660
This movement is in the form of running,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.480
attempted by a small pre who escaped from the predictor.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.230
But in case of domestic dogs,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.310
his otherwise dormant predatory instincts are generally a roused by jokers,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.540
skateboarders,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.710
cyclists or two movies,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.150
people on bicycles and running Children.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.660
This aggression should be Dutch very seriously,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:06.180
as the consequences off predatory aggression sometimes can be life threatening as well as

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.600
discussed a little as will.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.290
The most worrisome part off discriminatory behavior is that it is not considered by any

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.750
significant mood change.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.690
Ah,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.850
predatory dope doesn't down to own his victim.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.630
So this aggression generally seems to happen out of the in this condition that Doma tears

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.260
its prey.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.280
And when the prey is within his range,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.490
he may launch an attack.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.930
He made them either nip at the heels,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.290
form,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.690
abided cuffs or ties off his target.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.150
Sometimes other does may also be drawn into the attack that's displaying packing behavior

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.180
or group aggression.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.730
And when the Perceive pre is a young chain who is attempting to run away,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.550
the results can be disastrous.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.650
Predate three responses in dogs can also be triggered by certain sounds for situations.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.920
Lex creamy,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.850
fully abrupt sleeping and waking cycles off infants etcetera.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.580
Also that uncoordinated movements generally found in total ISS and older people appear to

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.190
be a trigger.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.140
Put this kind of aggression sometimes the sound off,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.260
a baby crying or the moment off lifting a baby out of the credit can trigger predatory

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.350
response in a door.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.220
Fortunately,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.400
predatory aggression directed towards people for other does his extremely earlier impact

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.950
jobs.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.310
As a pet parent,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.550
it is your responsibility who find out if your dog is having predatory aggression issues.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.750
You should kill the observe your dog to understand whether he has any such issue or not.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.490
But I don't notice whether he gets excited when he sees a squirrel in the backyard through

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.050
the window and whether he feels the arch Putin is it.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.440
If he gets excited and feels the edge to taste that way,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.350
he's quite likely to display the podiatry break when he watches a fast running it.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.700
Once,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.140
he has supported signs of predatory aggression in your dog.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.340
Followed these pointers to manage this behavior off your dog.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.610
Now I live your dog alone with infants.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.130
What's more,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.120
Children because predatory attack can happen anytime without any warning or significant

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.380
mood.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.950
Cheech,

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.280
The only way to counter predatory aggression is to completely over the situations that can

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.710
put humans and animals.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.350
Actress This simply means if your doctor,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.190
this cats he should not be around,

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.700
gets If small dogs are separate,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.000
then simply keep your dog away from them to our Any unwanted mishap can find your dog in

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.870
those when he's alone at home.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.050
Dogs who have given free access to back it's really practice population on smaller create

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.590
just in the yard and therefore are at a higher risk off escaping or running away from their

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.150
homes.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.230
Why it's using the API.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.380
Those that have a history off injuring or killing small animals should never be awful ish

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.250
around Children.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.150
What the potential areas where Children might appear.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.890
If you see your Doctor X stating on another dog,

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.250
child or any other running person and you have a hard time in redirecting his attention,

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.670
then it is all this better who remove him from the sea.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.740
The behavior problems in the dog are primarily motivated by an attempt who reduces

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.560
unpleasant herbal feelings off internal stress and tension that is why it is very essential

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.740
to play engaging games with him like fetch and before these games provide emotional release

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.850
to your dog because of which his US two teeth and bite small animals or birds get seduced.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.890
Doakes that are born with the natural prey drive will all visit more likely to spread this

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.380
behavior.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.940
They can't help themselves.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.080
Their behavior is neither malicious nor vindictive.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.150
Although it is unacceptable,

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.350
especially when it is driven towards humans.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.920
It is very difficult to previous predatory aggression because it is driven by his natural

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.710
instincts.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.190
Therefore,

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.190
as a precaution,

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.070
try toe over any such situation that can elicit predatory aggression in him.
