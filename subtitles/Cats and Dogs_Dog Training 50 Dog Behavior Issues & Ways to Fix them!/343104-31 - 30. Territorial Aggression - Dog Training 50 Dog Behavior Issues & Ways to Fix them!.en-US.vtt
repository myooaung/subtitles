00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
like most of the creators in the wild,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:08.250
dogs are also territorial by nature and therefore defend the area that big.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.860
Consider Toby in the domain,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.470
such as a yard for home.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:18.270
But this territorial behavior can become dangerous in case your dog turns aggressive.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.660
Are don't displaying territorial aggression is offered insecure and therefore tries to

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.550
control who all can access his perceived territory in order to be safe and secure.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.980
Hence,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.520
any unwanted visitor on his territory is seen as attract,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.850
too is safety by the door.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.740
Territorial aggression can be exhibited towards people as well as other animals who tried

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.530
to approach that.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.780
Dogs perceive property generally.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.360
People and animals were unfamiliar to him are the most likely targets office territorial

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.950
aggression.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.050
Our dog having territorial aggression issue may show the following symptoms.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.290
He must start leaving your home windows,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.110
doors,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.840
fancies and cut as its territory,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.750
and we even start guarding them.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.510
Some dogs may even claim new territory and Michelle similar behaviors at picnic areas,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.860
backbenches at section those that are confined and that prevented by a leash from gaining

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.910
access to the stimulus may become even more aggressive and might develop displacement

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.110
behaviours for example,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.120
spilling certainly self mutilation,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.750
etcetera.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.230
In such a situation,

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.360
the longer the stimulus remains within sight or hearing off the dope that greater is his

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.950
anxiety.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.120
In some cases,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.990
due to the high arousal level,

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.970
redirected aggression can also despaired by the dog words,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.790
objects,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.010
other animals,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.230
people or even towards his owners.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.340
Our territorial aggressive dog made displayed behaviours ranging from growling and bulky,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.250
who lunging,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.040
chasing,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.220
snapping and even biting where we're in the air to disperse.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.710
If territory The longer the invaders stays within the territory,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.030
the more aggressive the dog may become the goal.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.350
Other territorial aggression displayed by the job is to make the intruder leaving austerity

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.350
.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.260
Sometimes this territorial aggression is a reinforced behaviour.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.440
For instance,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.580
when the dog grants towards the fence,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.280
growling and barking at people,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.650
frightening them and forcing them to leave hysteric frequently.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.270
Therefore,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.500
when he gets what he desires through this aggression,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.250
it becomes a reinforced behaviour in him.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.170
Here are a few tips by which you can control this territorial aggressive behavior off your

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.550
door,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.010
but you need to be patient and consistent with these behavior modification techniques as it

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.110
may take time before the results are visible first off all DTM.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.740
A few obedience commands like sit Anstey because if you don't know these commands,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.510
you can use them to keep him.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.480
Come in another part of the house when someone knocks on the door.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.130
When he obeys your command,

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.450
revolt him with celebrities,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.650
distract you and redirect his attention when you find him getting aggressive,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.050
for instance,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.720
when he sees a stimulus and starts growling or barking,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.050
asked him to sit and reward him with his favorite toy like a bull.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.590
When he gets engaged in playing with his favorite toy,

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.520
he is less likely to pay attention towards the technique.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.670
Stimulus and the nothing that you need to beat him is that you control is valued items and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.160
nothing in life is free.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.840
And he has toe on it because for him,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.260
and it is a resource which he is guarding.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.740
Sometimes behavior problems occurred when this resource guarding behavior is reinforced on

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.550
intention,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.340
for instance,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.100
then your dog backs at the table and you toss a table scrap just to keep him quite later,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.470
when you try to take a were chicken bone that fell on the kitchen floor by mistake,

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.610
he goes it.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.900
He has learned over time that making this noise lets him keep the things he wants,

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:24.460
thus unintentionally reinforcing his guiding behaviour To correct this guarding behaviour

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.670
beat him that he has toe on his valued items.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.460
For example,

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.520
ask your doctor,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.650
sit before you give him his me.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.050
Asking your doctor work for everything he wants is a positive and safer to remind him that

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.950
you control is valuable resources.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.800
This technique,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.710
when implemented consistently,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.790
can correct his guarding behaviour to a large extent.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:55.060
Did you dope that quite command start indoors in a peaceful environment and values land

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.410
common gradually introduced him to more distractions if you don't tends to.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.750
But many senses attract in his territory asked him to be quiet.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.270
The idea is to reinforce it come emotional state in your door that training off white

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.540
command has been explained in detail in excessive barking behavior issue.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.820
This command can really be helpful to start off his anxiety and aggression when he sees an

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.350
intruder in his territory.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.550
While you're working on training your dog make all the trigger areas inaccessible to him.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.290
I mean by feed him in a confined space and restrict him to areas where other,

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.610
any months off people can neither be hurt.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.020
North Sea gradually introduced desensitization and counter conditioning.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.310
Hootie and your those reactions to triggers slowly and patiently introduce your dog to the

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.050
potential territorial weakness,

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.250
expose him to Lolo Stimuli and then asked him to sit.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.000
Whenever he obeys you reward him with his favorite tips for territorial aggression.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.330
Low level stimuli may include people arriving in a car,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.220
people walking past in front of your house what,

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.150
perhaps even a family member knocking on the door,

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.950
ringing the bell.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:20.410
The basic idea here is that each time some visitor arrives at the house or instable,

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.860
the dough should associate this even with his favorite things.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.230
Police in your dog,

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.510
for his aggression is off.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.990
No use as it rather tends to increase anxiety and fearing him.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.940
There are several ways by that you can prevent development off territorial aggression in

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.650
your puppy,

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:45.470
socialize him with defend people and different jobs during his popular so that he doesn't

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.020
perceive them.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.750
As in Judah's many Groza,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.710
who reduces potential fear and anxiety toward visitors and show their divide,

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.520
their idea of visitors come over to visit him while he's still young.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.590
Your puppy should be told to sit and get devoted whenever a new person or a guest visits

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.560
your house through this training exercise,

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.250
he will start associating.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.220
Visitors with good things does.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.610
Generally I let their human families by barking.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.750
Whenever stranger comes to visit the house,

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.520
however,

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.620
a dog that has been well socialized in his popular can be trained to quickly settle down

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.450
and relax once he has alerted the family.
