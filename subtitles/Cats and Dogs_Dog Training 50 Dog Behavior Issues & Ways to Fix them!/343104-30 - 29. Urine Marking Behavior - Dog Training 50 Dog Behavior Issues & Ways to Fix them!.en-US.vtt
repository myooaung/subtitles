Generally,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:36.330
this behavior is seen in intact mill dogs full of the visas for urine marking Eastern

Urine marking begins at puberty,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.250
which usually happens around 6 to 9 months off each.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.760
As male dogs begin to mature sexually,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.850
The increased level of testosterone encourages a signaling off sexual ability on territory

marking do in some cases on spayed.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.290
Females on neutered dogs are also found to be involved in such a behavior.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.050

They're in heat,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.780
urine marking in dogs.

He's also territorial behavior.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.240
Ah,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.650
veteran dog may not be induced in familiar surroundings,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.950
but as soon as he's moved to a new place,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.780
there are good chances that he even you remark to identify his territory in this new,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.500
unfamiliar police all the this territorial behavior is generally observing meal dogs,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.670
but in some cases female daughter also highly territorial,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.850
and they also urine mark to mark their territory.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.630
In case the dog distressed due to a change in the household,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.250
he might Yuri markets territory to create an environment off safety and familiarity.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.610
This stays can be in the form of introduction off a new cat dog child,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.400
some construction or remodeling activity in the house.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.520
He may indulge in this behavior,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.980
even leave a message about his ownership or to comfort himself in this face off uncertain

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.950
ity with this family oarsmen.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.850
Additionally,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.440
urine marking is absorbing.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.160
Those cases has been very an outside dog or animal visits your property regularly.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.050
Indoor marking is more common in multi dog households because dogs need to compete for

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.630
resources like Boone's toys,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.400
attention of the human family,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.150
etcetera.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.270
This competition can be very subtle.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.260
That often goes unnoticed by humans,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.120
for example,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.520
guarding a toy or a coveted sport missing my to us,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.310
but doing anxious talk,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.270
it is a very serious situation.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.980
This very anxiety off the dog culminates in his urine marking behaviour.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.970
Newly adopted dogs often have it intensity your remark,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.850
because urine marking create a sense of familiarity for them in an otherwise completely for

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.750
environment.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.250
Your dog may also mark your guests belongings for similar reasons.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.750
Urine marking is an attempt from the site to create a sense of familiarity,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.060
except putting a favorite family for two on your desk on your first day off,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.180
a new job to feel comfortable in your new place.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.040
Now let us look at the vase to differentiate urine,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.160
marking some normal urination.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.970
Generally dog units to relieve his blood.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.260
Oh,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.350
but urine marking does not involve full evacuation off the blood dough.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.480
Instead,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.920
the dog releases a small amount of fear in as a communication strategy you didn't use by a

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.100
dog for marking.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.090
Contains chemicals that provide critical information about him like his age,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.250
gender health and is reproductive status to other dogs.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.750
What male and female dogs usually lived one of the rear legs do during mark.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.720
Some dogs must specific areas or things,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.900
so just promenade,

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.170
vertical objects,

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.260
new objects,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.110
all areas,

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.250
his own exit doors or windows.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.350
Well,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.890
this may seem to mark indiscriminately for the a dog who indulges in urine marking is often

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:39.420
also from guilty off over marking that is urinating at the same sports with other dogs have

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.750
already urinated by urinating on the previous site of urination.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.890
The dog essentially marks that location as his own territory.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.050
This is the reason why some ducks never mark in their own homes,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.470
but displaced this marking behaviour.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.550
Then they visit others homes.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.710
Now let's look at the ways the managed,

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.040
this urine marking behaviour in a dog.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.200
If you re marking began suddenly or recently,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.180
I there were no changes in his living situation.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.950
Then it is advised to consult your vet.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.400
You look any underlying medical issues.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.960
No amount of behavior modification will overcome a medical condition.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.830
A urinary tract infection can cause a doctor in the minute.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.830
Small amounts of urine frequently adopts suffering from urinary incontinence is also likely

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.170
to cause house soiling accidents.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.330
In this condition,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.390
the dog leaks or completely avoid Sublette do.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.620
Because it's blood,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.450
it is unable to hold the Huron.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:52.200
These and similar other medical causes should be jeweled out before treating a door for

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.750
your remarking problems.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.680
Besides,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.100
you also need to rule out certain other behavior problems in him,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.500
for instance,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.260
submissive or excitement.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.780
Urination,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.850
Behavior problem.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.590
You don't mind if submissive or excitement urination?

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.960
Problem if they only urinates during greetings,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.970
play physical contact,

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.950
scolding or punishment.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.010
If this is the case,

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.850
you make no distant displaying submissive questions during these in directions.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:29.530
Separation anxiety is also another behavior problem that can cause him to eliminate

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.630
inappropriately.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.860
If this is the case,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.670
then your dog will have how swelling accidents.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.140
Only then he's left alone Ato,

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.350
even for a short period of time.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:47.340
If you're sure that your dog is not suffering from any other medical or behavioral problem

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.780
on display in your remarking behavior,

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:55.310
then you can follow these steps to correct this marking behaviour if you don't,

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:02.520
this unscathed or intact nutrient can be a solution to fix this issue as an intact talk

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.230
primarily marks to declare his availability for meeting.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.860
Spay your dog as early as possible.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.670
The longer dog goes before nutrient,

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.650
the more difficult it gets to train him.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.180
No to mark in the house,

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:23.710
it is important to remove the scent of previous urine marks within enzymatic or bacterial

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.890
three.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:24.350
No,

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.870
otherwise,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:31.060
the or smell becomes an invitation for him to mount the same spot again.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.950
Additionally,

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:38.680
avoid ammonia based cleaners because urine contains ammonia and therefore use off.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.680
Such project can encourages marking behaviour.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:48.970
Limited access to frequently month areas by confining him in a room by shutting does all by

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:56.000
using baby gets as you don't behavior improves gradually increases freedom in the house.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.050
Moreover,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.900
blocking or eliminating provoking stimuli is also very important.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.790
For instance,

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.120
if your doctor flees marking behaviour on the site of other dogs,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.720
then you need to cover all those windows.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.720
Very can see.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.150
Are the dogs walking by?

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.830
Besides,

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.780
you may also need to limit his existed rooms.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.750
Very might hear them as well.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.910
Additionally,

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:29.090
make sure to frequently exercise your dog to help him avoid getting agitated and anxious

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.350
with longer periods of confinement.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:37.170
Try to change the significance and association of those areas to your dog.

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:40.220
Various marked Feed him,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.550
treat him on placing him in such areas.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.040
Many dogs,

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.180
one market place.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.250
There they eat.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:52.500
Try to identify the factors that I'm making your dog anxious,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.940
which is then culminating interview,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.690
remarking,

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.670
for example,

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.010
if the arrival of a new baby in your home is causing stress to him,

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:08.360
then desensitize your dog by gradually increasing the amount of time your dog is exposed to

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.180
the new baby.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.610
At the same time,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.500
you can also use counter conditioning techniques,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.080
which means associating the baby with items that your dog wants,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.870
like his favorite treats,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.240
petting and please.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.050
Similarly,

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.000
if I didn't you cat on new doctor,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.260
your family there.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:34.170
Slowly introduce your dog to your new pit to help them live in harmony on To prevent the

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.450
feeling off insecurity in any off your pet.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.750
Also reward him in the presence off your new pit.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:47.130
Gradually the timing consistency he will start associating.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.680
These are live anxiety inducing factors with this favorite rewards.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.720
If your pet is marking in response to a new resident in your home,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.910
such as a guest,

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.950
have the new resident make friends with your dog by feeding,

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.560
petting and playing with him.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.360
After getting properly acquainted with the guest,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.990
he will not feel insecure and therefore will not.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:18.020
Your remark out of insecurity you can also establish in media outside the house we're

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.460
marking is acceptable.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.300
Exposing does something that trumps marking behaviour in him,

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:30.850
such as urine off another dog and then immediately take him to your chosen target big.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:36.930
And if he marks and then reward him with praise on his favorite treats for marking in the

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:37.950
correct place,

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.080
then you witness your dog marking never here.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.450
Let him or use other types of direct punishment.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.380
This may increases anxiety,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.870
and he may even become fearful off you,

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.320
which will lead to his marking behaviour.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.850
Then you are not present.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:11:01.370
Do not punish your dog after he is urine marked as a dog will not as a shield dis

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.770
punishment with the marking that happened the vile ago.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:11.180
If still you're finding it difficult to manage this behavior issue off your dog,

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.750
then it is always a good option to seek help some animal behaviorist.
