00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
because some does.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.090
Riding in the car is one of their favorite things,

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.150
while for others it's a nightmare.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.030
The dogs that fear car lights are often left at home,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.750
although this is not the correct approach to deal with this issue.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.540
Because there are various places where they don't need to be taken in a car,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.470
like a vax office or a groom of,

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.390
and in such scenarios,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.310
it becomes unsafe to drive it such a dope as he met unpredictably because of his fear and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.780
anxiety.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.050
There could be several reasons for this fearful behaviour off a dog for Cartwrights.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.850
Let's look at each of these reasons in detail.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.020
The first isn't for this.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.950
Behavior can be motion sickness,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.140
just like a human's.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.150
Some dogs may get car sickness.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.140
The symptoms of canine car sickness include vomiting,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.960
yawning,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.250
excessive drooling,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.400
lip smacking and wine generally.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.020
But prison,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.530
young goes,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.190
I have the maximum ease off getting motion sickness because part of the year that manages

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.350
balance is not fully developed in them.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.690
The motion of the car makes them feel imbalanced,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.780
causing nausea and possibly vomiting as the puppies age the out brother feeling off motion

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.400
sickness.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.500
But some Dokes who experienced severe motion sickness s puppies can grow to associate,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.290
Car writes.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.150
With that terrible feeling off nausea,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.270
the second reason for this fear of car rights can be a bad experience associated with the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.950
car ride.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.500
This bad experience can be anything like getting heart inside the car due to improper this

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.990
training or a trip to a back or a groomer,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.650
where he had to go through some pain or discomfort.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.640
These negative experiences can,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.310
in turn,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.450
developing to fear for the Cartwrights.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.070
If you don't fear skylights,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.140
then with proper planning and training,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.550
you can teach him to relax and enjoy the car.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.950
Right.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.550

it is also not advisable to take your dog for a car like just after he had his me.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.150
inches.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.280
If your dog's fear off car lights stems from more than just motion sickness.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.750
Then you need to put some serious efforts who get rid of his card.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.840

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.840
The board him with lords of treats and praise.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.640

you will be able to get your daughter woke up to the car in a few short training sessions,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.460

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.450
Italy.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.400
Then in the next step,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.220
take him out for short car trips.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.450

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.050

gradually start taking him out for longer Cartwrights.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.540

After repeating this for several times,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.380
Khudobin start associating car light with fun times and restart and join instead of being

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.150
afraid off them.
