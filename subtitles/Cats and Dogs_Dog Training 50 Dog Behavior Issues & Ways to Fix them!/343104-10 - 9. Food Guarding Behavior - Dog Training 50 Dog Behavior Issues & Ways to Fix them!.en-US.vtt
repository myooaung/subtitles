00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
a doctoring aggression to protect his foot can be a serious issue.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.820
Food aggression is a form of resource guarding in which a dog becomes extra defensive by

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.960
eating and use threats to force others of a.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.120
It can be directly towards other animals.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.480
Humans are both off them.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.750
The source guarding is a normal behavior indoors.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.550
Dogs can get possessive just about anything you can imagine.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.380
Some dogs only guard Cubans or toys.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.680
Some guards stolen items such as food wrappers or socks.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.970
But the most common objective the source guiding in dogs is food.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.130
Bad dogs can develop this behavior right in their popular food,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.070
especially if they have to face strong competition for food.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.900
Typical signs off food aggression include growling while eating,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.790
guiding his food or treats and sometimes guarding his food but not eating,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.430
snapping and biting.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.660
If anyone gets close to his football,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.000
attacking or growling at other dogs during the meal time,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.280
beating faster than the normal when somebody's near him,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.520
the source carding is a natural behavior of dogs,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.690
and therefore it must be managed properly so that it doesn't take the form of aggressive

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.250
behavior,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.640
food guarding,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.170
behaviour in a dog can be managed by following certain techniques,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.750
which we will be discussing now.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.780
The first technique is desensitization,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.450
coupled with counter conditioning.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.710
Let's first understand what does desensitization means in this context,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.870
and how can you don't get desensitized?

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.460
Desensitizing your dog in this context simply means training him so that he no longer

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.690
because protective when anybody approaches him while he is city and incompetent.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.190
Disney.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.550
We teach him to associate people approaching his bowl with good things.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.130
But before implementing these training techniques,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.740
you first need to understand the body language of your dog to establish whether he's

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.050
relaxed or aggressive.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.960
For example,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.150
the signs off a calm and relaxed dog include normal breathing,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.910
slight pentti heating at normal pace,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.710
bagging his tail,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.350
etcetera.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.150
On the other hand,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.920
signs of aggression include standing stiffly over the bowl,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.300
gulping the food,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.830
then single freezing,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.740
growly,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.850
staring,

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.920
snapping,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.960
snarly,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.650
biting or chasing people of it.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.290
The knowledge of the body language and mood off your dog will be very useful when we will

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.130
discuss this training.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.100
Excite in detail.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.500
The training exercise for the treatment of food guarding is done in several stages.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.130
During this exercise,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.510
you need to offer your dog,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.250
his favorite treats that it doesn't usually get.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.050
The idea is to train your dog that it is wonderful when you're approaching violence eating

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.020
because you will bring something more delicious than what he has got in his football during

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.720
Stage one Off this exercise,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.650
stand a few feet away from your dog while is eating food from his boat.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.250
Then those a special treat towards his bowl.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.190
Continue to do this every few seconds until your door finishes his food.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.740
Repeat this exercise each time you feed your dog until he eats in a relaxed fee for 10

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.600
meals in a row during the exercise.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.090
If your dog leaves the bull and moves towards you to ask,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.280
the more treats just ignored him with until he goes back to his bowl and starts eating

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.590
again before closing.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.400
More tits during stage two.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.630
When your dog is eating food from his ball,

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.650
take one step towards him and those a special treat towards his boat that immediately

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.150
stepped back.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.240
Repeat this sequence every few seconds until your dog has finished eating each day.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.800
Stand one step closer to your dog while closing.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.950
The special treat continued this until you come within two feet off the bull.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.020
Repeat this exercise each time you feed him until he eats in a relaxed way for 10 meals in

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.350
a row.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.280
Now you're ready to move to Stage three.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.320
Stand next to your dogs,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.050
pull and those a special treat into it.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.800
Then immediately turn around and vocal V.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.500
Repeat this sequence every few seconds until your dog has finished eating.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.940
When he eats in a relaxed way for 10 years in a row,

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.650
you are ready for the next stage.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.740
Do you stage four.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.300

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.180
holding a special treat in your hand band down slightly in your dog's direction and carries

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.400
him to stop eating the food in the bowl to take the treat after he eats the treat from your

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.170
hand immediately turned around and vocally,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.520
the beauty sequence every few seconds until your dog has finished eating each day.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.540
Bend down a little move when you offer those special treats to your door so that the hand

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.350
moves an inch or two closer to his boat.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.670
When you find him eating in a relaxed way for 10 meals in a row,

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.560
you are ready for the next stage in states.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.550
Fight while standing next to your dog band down and touches ball with one hand.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.750
Why offering him his favorite tree with another hand?

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.750
Continue to do this every few seconds until the door has finished the food in his boat.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.520
When you find him eating in a relaxed before 10 meals in a row,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.200
you're ready for the next stage.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.190
After the dog allows you to touch his bowl while he's eating,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.350
stand next to your dough bend and pick up his ball with one hand.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.090
Is it only six inches off the floor and drop a special treat in the bull.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.950
They immediately put down the ball on the flu so that you don't can eat from it.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.520

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.100
east day.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.720
There's the boy slightly higher off the floor on Do you can lift it all the way up your

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.600
vest and stand upright.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.290
Repeat this sequence until your dog it's in a relaxed way for 10 music.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.830
Little then next time when you pick up your dogs,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.450
Bull take the ball to a table where a counter along with you.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.220
Then put a special treat in Buddha Bowl,

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.150
walk back to your dog and put the ball on the same place on the floor after the dog allows

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.240
you to touch and pick up his football.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.510
Vialli's eating It is time for all the members of the family to practice these exercises.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.050
Make sure that your degree means come and relaxed during these exercises.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.370
Don't as you that because your dog is fine.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.160
With one person approaching his boy,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.450
he will automatically become for table with another person doing the same thing.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.390
He has to learn that the rules were the same way with everyone.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.580
Through these exercises,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.340
the dog will learn to relax and will associate positive experience rather than feeling

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.250
pregnant and become aggressive when people approaching while he's eating.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.880
Gradually,

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.030
he will learn that people approaching his food bowl,

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.980
Ben's back a revolt and therefore won't indulge in this behavior animal and other

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.570
effectively.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.310
To manage food.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.360
Aggression in your dog is by making him to work for food before you even begin to prepare

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.690
dogs,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.140
food,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.120
make him sit or lie down and stay there.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.210
Family just outside.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.450
I don't you feed him in,

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.170
train him to stay even after you have put the ball down.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.150
And he should only start eating when you ask him to eat,

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.750
always feeding after a book.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.250
Never before this will fulfill its instinct to hunt for food,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.760
and he will feel that he has under food.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.490
One of the other ways to manage this behavior in your dog is by never backing away from his

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.220
football,

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.350
because that's what your dog wants.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.100
Every time you walk away and your dog shows aggression,

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.650
the dog feels he has one.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.570
The revolt for him in this case is food,

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.990
and this just reinforces aggression.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:54.140
But be a little careful when your dog shows aggression and avoid going very close to him.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.870
As you may get bitter in such situations,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.790
you should recondition your dog with the help of his favorite treats until he learns that

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.560
he will get his favorite treats when he lets you come near him by 80.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.210
When your dog is eating his regular food,

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.250
approach him with his favorite tips.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.320
The goal here is to stop your dog from eating his food.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.750
To take the treat from this date is your dog two things.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:24.050
One that no one is going to steal his food if he looks of a form it,

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.350
and second the moving his attention from his food.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.800
When people come around,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.290
he hits to a positive reward.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.530
To effectively manage his food guarding behavior,

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.900
you need to be careful about few things.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.180
The most important point to remember is that they treat you offer him during the training

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.530
exercises should be more desirable to your dog than the food in his bowl.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:51.450
You need to manage your does behavior carefully so as to avoid any unwanted aggressive

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.250
encompass.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.110
If you don't specifically guards this food from the Children,

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.690
do not attend these exercises with any child.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.010
Instead,

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.650
seek help from a canine behavior specialist.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:08.750
Certain laws have this habit off guarding their food from guests for unknown visitors.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.560
If this is the case with your dog as well,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.450
followed these techniques to control this for decoration.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.460
If you don't and guests are in the same room,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.140
then remove all the food items from that area or room further,

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.870
it is recommended to keep your dog can find in a separate area off your home while you are

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.690
attending your guests or visitors.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.540
Be aware that jokes sometimes got the food intended for people,

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.650
even if the 40 situated on a table or a contrato.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.300
Therefore,

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.110
to ensure everyone's safety,

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.650
it is better to confine your dog in a separate area off your home.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:49.040
Sometimes I don't make even guide this food from another look off the house.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.500
If this is the case with your dog,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.210
you need to be extra cautious to prevent any fight breaking out between your dogs.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.470
Hasn't such fights they miss seriously injured themselves?

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.220
To prevent this kind of food aggression,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.740
maintain a safe distance between your dogs while feeding them and additionally,

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.450
use at least to keep the situation under control.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.000
Gradually reduce this distance between the dogs during the meal times,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.290
but you need to be very careful and and show that the aggressive dog is comfortable and is

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.170
not assessed with this exercise.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.390
If he becomes aggressive,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.350
increase their distance and start the process again.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.250
In case you have a puppy.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.270
What are planning to bring one Soon you should train him tow.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:37.610
Avoid food aggression right from this poor people for managing this behavior in your puppy

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.610
,

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.730
make sure to spend time meeting.
