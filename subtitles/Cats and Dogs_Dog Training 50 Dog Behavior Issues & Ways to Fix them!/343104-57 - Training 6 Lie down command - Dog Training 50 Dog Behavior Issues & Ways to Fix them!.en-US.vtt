00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
If you want to teach your dope to light on,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.900
you can do it by using uring technique.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.650
Luring simply means using your does devote to guide him into a lying down position.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.090
Moreover,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.250
it doesn't involve any pushing or poorly,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.940
which might hurt your dog or make him anxious for this.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.960
Ask your doctor,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.250
sit in front off you.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.550
Now hold of the treat tightly between your fingers and let him sniff and lick the treat.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.660
Hold the street in front off Fido in such a way that it is close enough for him to smell it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.660
,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.840
but not so close that he can grab it now.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.660
Slowly move the treat towards the don't as soon as you does,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.830
elbows and folks out on the ground and this stomach that is the flu quickly give him his

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.950
Valdez up treat.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.600
Once it,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.810
though,

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.150
starts falling down motion with the treat consistently and in the verbal cue,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.190
saying the word down clearly and firmly via moving the tree towards the ground.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.550
Repeat this until your dog lies down with just a verbal cue,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.050
which means that there is no treat guiding with enough practice,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.260
you will eventually be able to get your dough to lie down with.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.390
Just you've are welcome.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.970
You need to pick this distant exercise at various locations,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.780
both in those as well as outdoors.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.310
Well,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.290
there are a lot of distractions when you don't successfully lies down on.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.150
You were Welcome on it's time to introduce your release word like Okay,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.030
this is what you will use when you want to permit your dog to get off course.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.320
When you ask your doctor,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.040
lie down.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.850
You normally won't want him to get a right away.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.780
You will definitely want to add some duration for your down.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.250
Come on.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.160
To achieve this,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.950
start training him with small increments off time.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.570
Initially,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.740
make your dog like Don't for no more than 30 seconds before releasing him from this

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.450
position.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.460
As he gets proficient in this,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.650
gradually increase the state period.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.350
Once you have got a 32nd ST start to increase the distance between you and your door,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.250
take a step away from him and then come back.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.640
Revolt him.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.210
If he maintains the down position over several training sessions,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.750
gradually increase the number of steps that you take to move away from you too.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.650
The goal here is that you should be able to walk several steps away from him and sit in a

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.290
chair on the other side of the room for a few seconds in case you're having trouble getting

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.370
your dog to lie down with tweaks,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.720
you can try marking the behavior next time when you don't naturally lies down,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.950
sit down and then place and revolt him black business every time you catch him.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:07.550
Langdon,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.430
once it does,

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.990
starts this poor Nikola down que gradually add in distractions to increase the difficulty

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.450
level.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.440
Once the dough becomes an expert at Langham,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.660
you no longer need to give him a treat every time you command him to light.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.850
Oh,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.350
but it's a good idea.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.250
Give him treats occasionally to reinforce this behavior.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.150
In addition,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150
never forget to praise him when he obeys.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.550
If you don't doesn't respond well to the usual treats,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.450
I am more valuable treat like these
