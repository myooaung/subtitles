00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.050
the generally assumed that a dog being a natural socializing will always get along with

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.970
other dogs.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.500
And that is exactly.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.250
While many of us don't even think twice before bringing another dog into our homes.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.240
In this process,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.610
we completely overlooked the fact they're just like us.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.700
Humans and video cannot get along with every other dog in a multiple dog household.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.470
One of the most disturbing situations for a pet parent arises when they're incidents off

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.350
aggression between his dogs.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.600
This not only disturbs the peace and happiness off the human family,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.260
but also proves to be quite dangerous for the dogs on for the people who try to intervene

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.700
and break up the fight most of the times,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.160
these aggressive dogs remain peaceful on their no conflict.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.420
But whenever there is an outburst,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.350
it is usually pretty intense and violent,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.750
many times requiring a trip to the vit.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.050
Multiple dog households occasionally have fights between the male dogs,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.350
majority of the dogfights on generally between female dogs.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.880
According to a research around 32% off the aggressive incidents in what conflict between

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.080
two means well.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.450
In the remaining 68% females were the active participants box and really fight only in the

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.560
presence off the owner.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.390
On most of the times,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.450
the younger dog initiates the fight.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.250
Now let's understand what are the triggers that leads to this aggression and outburst among

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.850
dogs?

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.170
The actions off the owner,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.840
so just being more attention to one dog than the other are a trigger for aggression and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.080
fight among talks don't select IDs,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.170
and when this is such injustice,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.380
they're sworn by taking out the revenge on the sibling.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.090
Additionally,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.270
excitement involving arrival of the Ono hearing the dough been PlayStations,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.110
walks,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.030
carriage,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.550
etcetera can also trigger aggression among dogs.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.970
Conflict over food,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.830
toys,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.600
treats,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.630
sleeping beds,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.250
etcetera are also some of the other triggers for this aggression.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.620
The pair of dogs involved in conflicts.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.540
They'll have at least one member suffering from separation anxiety.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.380
Any kind of phobia or any other forms of anxiety for the dominance hierarchy can be another

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.250
reason for fight between dogs.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.130
Do you do an established hierarchy?

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.330
The dogs get along fine in that sense,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.360
off the owners.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.880
In such cases,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.470
aggression is generally absorbed in the presence off the owner.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.110
The possible cause for this can be that's a body need talk feels protected.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.160
Then owners are around and therefore does not.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.990
That subordinate to the dominant dog does the dominant up starts a fight to reinforce and

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.650
re establish his position.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.220
Dolphin,

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.450
not socialized with other dogs during their pop ute,

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.450
can also be a reason for this aggression towards other dogs.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.480
But very not in the dog.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.050
Aggression can be managed on prevented by keeping a few things in mind.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.450

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.140
toys,

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.730
preference.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.250
Resting places are owner's attention.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.490
In these instances,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.910
dog should be fit,

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.800
given treats on played with separately.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.350
Moreover,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.500
it should also be insured that the greed owners separately in case the dogs are separated,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.260
make sure that they can't see on aggressively pause it each other through gates,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.650
doors or windows.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.840
If your dog's air having conflict over food treats and toys,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.450
then you need to teach them that nothing in life is free.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.000
Basically,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.880
teach them.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.010
Then they will have to one everything they get,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.060
including food treats,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.710
toys,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.590
petting an owner's attention.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.490
For this,

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.160
it is very crucial to teach your dog Ah,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.250
few basic obedience Commons.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.750
These include a simple come sit and steak a month.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.350

Ignore attention seeking or pushy behavior off any off your dogs.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.610
Every interaction should be initiated and start for you,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.950
not the dog working each time individually first,

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.380
then together.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.910
Once it is safe to do so by learning to sit on the down in the presence off a resource dogs

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.850

Use this approach every view,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.260
then they're fed.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.350
But it or let outside,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.910
this is basically the back mentality in the back.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.750
The stronger on the dominant talk gets everything first.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:31.650
That same dynamics need to be established within your home has been for establishing this.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.950
She was a senior dog who will get everything First.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.240
Senior doesn't necessarily mean in each.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.460
It means sonority off who has been videoed the longest giving priority.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.640
Excessive resources to one dog reduces conflict because it reduces unpredictability and

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:57.840
therefore they exactly know what to expect and how to react in such situations when using

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.600
combination with the teaching that nothing in life is free dogs long the order in which

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.220
they will receive a resource on the dog that receives the resource.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.900
Second must treat until the first dog on the resource does,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.750
reducing competition on eventually the fights between them.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:24.010

this program involves gradually exposing your dogs to each other in such a way they start

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.750
associating positive experiences with each other's presence.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.060
For this first,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.930
determine the safe distance at which your dogs can be kept in each other's presents.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.350
This is called the threshold Distance.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.660
If one dog has a great potential distance than the other,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:11.630
work with them greater distance during this exercise to handlers will be required to handle

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.850
the dog separately.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:19.480
Each handler and dog should be far enough from the other handler and talk that neither of

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.050
the dogs shows any signs of aggression.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:29.310
The dog should then be made to obey obedience commands and subsequently should be rewarded

with treats.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.500
Play our attention for the heat consecutive session.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.650
Gradually decrease the distance between the dogs.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.560
If aggressive behavior is absorbed,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.280
increase the distance on.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.850
Proceed with distance reduction more slowly.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:52.520

use hand holders and ensure that the handler walks between the dogs.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.660
If this works fine,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.270
then gradually promise to dogs walking side by side.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.370
