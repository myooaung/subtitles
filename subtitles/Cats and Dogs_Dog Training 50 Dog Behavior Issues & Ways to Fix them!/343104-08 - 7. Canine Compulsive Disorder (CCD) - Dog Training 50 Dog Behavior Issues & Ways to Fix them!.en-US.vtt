00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.150
.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.250
Therefore,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.630
in such scenarios,

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.110
then the problem can be treated with the help of proper medication.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.970
For example,

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.570
if a dog licks of particular joint repetitively because of the pain in that joint,

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.630

We have a dedicated lecture on managing attention taking behavior.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.450

if your dog is stressed because of the aggression of your other dog,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.200
then you need to separate your stress dope from the aggressive.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.860
And if this stress is because of shifting to a new place or introduction off a new path at

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.230
home,

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.050
