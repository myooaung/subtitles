00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
bagging behavior off dogs.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.450
Is it common complaint off majority of the pet parents?

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.320
It can be devastating to see your dog begging for food every time you take out some snacks

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.310
or sit down for a meal.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.670
But the truth is,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.320
we are sensory enforced this unwanted behavior by feeding our dog from the table every time

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.010
they back.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.850
You would be surprised to know that bagging in Doc's is a learned behavior.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.740
To get a better understanding off this,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.950
let's discuss how dogs develop begging behaviour.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.710
Imagine yourself sitting at the dining table and having you.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.050
Me,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.370
certainly your dog approaches you and pose that your leg not is your elbow winds drools box

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.270
or simply gazes on your plate.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.610
And in the done,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.450
you offer him some off your food out of pity,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.250
concern or love without even realizing you just introduced bagging in your door.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.440
As we already know that food is an excellent reinforces for a dog.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.690
Therefore,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.260
delivering food as a revolt immediately following your behavior is likely to produce more

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.150
off that behavior.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.950
The same thing happens when your dog hangs around the kitchen by meals are being prepared

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.980
in set scenarios.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.030
The dog is often devoted with tickets off food.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.090
This,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.710
in turn,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.450
makes get in a perfect location for him to back for food when it is being prepared,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.020
because bagging and dogs is a completely human initiated problem.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.020
Therefore,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.050
the humans also have the power to regain control of this situation.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.750
They're not a few things that you can do to stop your dog from backing.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.070
First and foremost,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.150
stop rewarding your dogs bagging behavior if you want to curb it.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.850
We agree that it is easier said than done,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.950
and it can be really difficult to resist or soulful eyes longing for foot.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.970
But if you packed bags and you revolt him with this desire,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.780
treat food,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.450
etcetera,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.750
then you're directly teaching him that begging works.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.950
If you keep on giving into his demands,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.450
he will continue to back in future as well.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.980
On the other hand,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.070
if you stopped responding to his bagging gradually,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.250
he will learn that backing doesn't work.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.440
The next dip to stop bagging in your dog is consistency you need to ignore is begging all

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.450
the time and make sure your friends and family members to the same,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.750
they should only be eating food from its own bowl.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.300
Additionally,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.910
make sure you ignore your dog's attention seeking behavior,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.620
but avoiding any eye contact with him while you're eating do not give him attention by any

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.550
of the means as well,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.710
like talking,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.050
fighting or yelling at him for his actions.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.840
It's critical to be consistent in this step,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.880
no matter how loud your dog barks at you.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.060
But how in the centres looks out when you're eating your leader.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.030
You can't expect your dog to understand mixed signals,

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.950
so be clear and consistent at all times.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.460
If you stay consistent,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.170
he will figure out that bagging doesn't get him the desired results,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.450
and consequently he will stop backing.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.390
Whether it's it also reinforces good behavior off,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.030
not backing.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.550
For instance,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.330
if you're eating popcorn and your dog starts begging for popcorn,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.850
then just ignore him at that moment.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.390
If it goes of it and stops his bleeding behavior,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.350
call him after some time and reward him with a few popcorns or his favorite trips.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.950
This would reinforce Noto back behavior in him.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.450
Another tick that you can use to stop this behavior in your dog is by feeding him his meal

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.550
before they sit down to eat as he would already be full.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.130
This will make him less likely to back for foot alternately.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.350
You can also feel here with me at the same time when you're having yours.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.250
If yours and your those meal times don't coincide,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.790
then make it a point to keep your dog occupied and to make the dining area inaccessible to

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.250
your dog during your means.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.550
You can teach a dog to go to a specific location at your dinner time,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.110
such as a bad bet,

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.140
but it peaked where he can get busy playing with the born but an interactive food to it by

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.320
you.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.910
Sit down to eat human illness,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.450
favorite toy or a small treat toe and praise your dog to go to that place.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.240
If you don't disobeys the command,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.900
giving must on no and start the training process over again,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.850
this training may require patience and time,

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.080
but with consistency it will eliminate is bagging at the dinner table.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.180
If you don't want to talk to come and back for food in the kitchen area by look,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.060
book a word giving him food by lays in the kitchen.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.030
Decide where you want your doctor be instead and revolt him for being in that sport with

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.750
his own food or human food that is nutritious for him.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.950
Last but not least,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.590
if you want to give you dog table scraps,

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:06.310
give them once we have finished eating and make it a point to place them in his food bowl a

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.020
word giving any table scraps,

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.150
many bags for them.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.140
Make sure that that's perhaps I'd nutritious for your dog.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.450
And he associates these scraps has a revolt for his would be it.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.530
He was quickly realize that violin and backing during dinner won't get him anything but

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.150
quietly waiting until we're done it it will.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.850
Back periods must understand the health consequence of table scripts.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.740
Despite units,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.250
small portion table scraps are a danger to your dog's health,

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.850
but human food doesn't provide your dog that required nutrition.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.550
Those and humans have very different nutritional leads.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.050
Human food ingredients are more likely to cause V.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.150
It came in a dog rather than fulfilling his vitamin and mineral needs.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.930
Furthermore,

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.640
dogs are also not accustomed to eating human food and can have serious health consequences

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.640
,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.620
like gas bag bread,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.740
loose stools.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.350
What an upset stomach after eating human food.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.250
In a nutshell.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.260
Table scraps are more of a danger to your dog's health.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.360
Then they are a reward for this companionship and good behavior.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.030
Instead,

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.470
choose quality new places.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.490
Streets to revolt,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.250
your pet keeping his nutritional needs in mind.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.450
You can use your dogs regular food for treats.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.540
They will still feel the love,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.470
but this time,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.450
along with better nutrition and good head.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.180
No pics are rich in calories.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.830
Therefore,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.750
treats should make up less than 10% of your pet state.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.790
If you're going to offer treats to your dog for his good behavior at the D native because

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.390
that Ebola bill serving accordingly,

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.940
you can also consult your vet about healthy treat options for your dog.
