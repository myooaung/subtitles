others we cry.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.150

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.880
behaviors,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.530
including holding their ears back.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.340
Cloudy,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.770
taking their tail in,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.450
rolling over on their back,

it clearly indicates that he lacks self confidence.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.310
The other type of viney exhibited by dogs is excitement by some jokes.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.390
After meeting new people or seeing their pack parents,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.540
when they come back home,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.450
start whining along with the Glinda antibody.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.640
In such situations,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.790
dogs are in an extremely around state and therefore may not have control over their

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.350
behavior.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.040
Further,

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.070
a dog also wines in response to his body.

goes up and down stairs,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.050
then it is time to see a vet to rule out any underlying medical conditions.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.160
Apart from pain,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.340
there can be other medical reasons to for this filing behavior off a dog,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.950
for instance,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.170
As a dog ages,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.950
he sometimes develops cognitive problems like a scenes.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.600
For example,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.650
in canon cognitive dysfunction,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.460
confusion is a common symptom,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.750
which in turn leads to development of stress in the door.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.320
A doe suffering from such cognitive problem also wines,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.420
and he feels lost.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.840
Put off it attention seeking vining is another type of finding that you don't may exhibit

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.950
to seek your attention.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.740
For instance,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.100
if you leave the room where your dog is sitting,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.680
he will start whining because he wants you to come back to him and give him attention or if

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.050
you're having a telephone conversation with someone he provide to seek your attention.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.780
This finding may also be observed when you don't become zealous when you're spending time

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.350
with another person or object.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.050
If your dog is finding excessively first tried to learn the reason off his vining before

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.050
trying to address it.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.770
There are a few ways by which you can minimize or stop is vital.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.320
You should try to reduce your dogs appeasement,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.150
mining by building his confidence,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.350
beating few basic obedience commands and revolt him every time he obeys you.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.610
Believe it,

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.570
in fact and type of war games,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.250
as these will increase your dogs confidence.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.250
I work physical and verbal punishment.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.260
Intimidating your dog will only decrease his confidence level and may even increase his

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.540
appeasement my knee When you come back home,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.350
keep your greeting short and simple when you see him.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.640
Ah,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.110
words speaking and excited,

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.870
loud owns and keep your movements slow and come back and interact with your dog.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.950
Once he's come and composed.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.070
Beat him some basic obedience commands,

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.520
like Sit down with.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.450
He needs to follow when he greets you or other people.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.550
And when he opens this common praising and giving Mr Retreats,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.450
this exercise can minimize his excitement by me.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.980
If your dog seems fearful,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.400
anxious or otherwise stressed out,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.050
try to find out the source of this problem.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.820
Once identified,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.750
try to desensitize your dog to overcome his fear.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.250
I would unintentional encouragement off your dogs whining behavior.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.250
If your dog is winding to seek your attention,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.150
then ignore him completely and only give him your attention when he's quite.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.490
It is very important to remember that violence should never be given any attention,

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.250
even if it's negative attention.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.700
Instead,

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.070
make it a point to reward your dog,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.460
and he's quite if you speak to your dog while he's whining,

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.450
it simply makes it rewarding for him,

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.580
and therefore he will keep doing it even a negative response.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.450
For instance,

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.150
yelling at him can inadvertently be seen as a revolt by a dog for this behavior.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.690
Besides,

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.740
yelling at your door when he's finally may even increases anxiety,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.350
which in turn can deserving more by.
