00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740
one of the most disgusting things then don't like to do is the rolling their boot.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.100
Others militants like the body off a dead animal or garbage,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.770
etcetera.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.440
While there is no definite answer for this,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.030
but there are many theories about why dogs,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.350
rolling pool and others militants.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.390
The first reason via talking don't isn't this behavior can be to get rid off a particulars

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.760
Men.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.210
Now you may be wondering how controlling in the poop help him.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.750
To get rid of this man doesn't sound quite right.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.510
Let us understand this phenomenon in a little detail.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.410
There are various things which makes me a nice to us humans,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.660
but not to a furry companions.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.810
For instance,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.980
the same he was in a dog shampoo.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.920
You may find it pleasant,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.860
but your dog may dislike it.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.370
So do as a result,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.850
as soon as you beg your dog and you find something,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060
this was more acceptable to him,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.250
like garbage dog faces,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.190
etcetera.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.850
He starts rolling in it.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.150
This helps him don't get your doctor unwanted Smith.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.050
So it is always better to bed your dog with a neutral shampoo with no specific Odo.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.880
Another possible reason via dog might be doing this can be to mask his own Smith.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.670
It's apart off his natural instincts.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.650
The ancestors off your dog didn't get their food in the walls every day like him.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.600
Instead,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.550
they had to hunt to survive but ruling in their price smell or it's available poop.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.220
They used to hide their own scent so that they can approach their prey easily without

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.800
scaring it.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.370
A V in the vault drooling in the poop.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.690
Also smelly mess can be every office ancestors to communicate with the rest of the pack and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.640
informed them about the potential food source.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.400
After sniffing a back mitt that has rolled in something other verse can fallen back,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.130
sent back to its origin,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.960
this might have helped them in hunting.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.890
As with the help of dissent,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.110
it would be much easier to look it on track.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.630
Their pre very tolling behavior can also make a reason for your dog rolling in this poop.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.450
What are those many things?

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.160
This behavior can be assumed to be a similar letter,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.570
urine marking very tries to leave his own sent to let other dogs and animals know that this

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.550
is his area.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.390
It could also be a warning to other dogs that your dog has been deal and has investigated.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.370
This Menudo,

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.770
he said,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.820
can be kind off a warning to other rival packs to avoid that particular area unless they

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.150
want to fight for it.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.050
Additionally,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.380
aboard or under stimulated puppy can also engage in port rolling habits.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.110
Vignon dog has nothing to do the whole day.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.520
He may find it interesting to trolling for militants.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.430
There are various ways through that.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.040
You can discourage your pooch from rolling in smelly things.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.080
You likely won't be able to cope.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.480
Whatever instinct is driving your dog to rule in the poop,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.060
but you can still limited opportunities.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.010
You should teach your dog some basic or begins commands like Leave Command to stop him from

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.650
doing things that you don't want him to do.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.870
Stopping your dog from drooling in poop or others Many things is good for your dog's health

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.870
,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.900
as the poop on the body of dead animals may contain harmful bacteria that may in fact,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.850
your pooch.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.590
It also cut stone on the constant bots,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.320
which is also not good for your dog skin as soon as your foot obeys your command.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.700
Praising and also him as favorite treats.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.600
If your dog has a tendency to roll around in his own faces,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.450
immediately,

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.350
clean up the poop after he has eliminated.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.580
Then you're out walking your dog.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.450
Keep him on a short leash to prevent him from rolling around in other dogs,

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.150
food or smelly things that he may income to.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.230

spring water on him with a water bottle,

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.010
all by making a loud noise.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.870
As soon as he starts rolling,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.980
well,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.630
it starts to associate rolling around in,
