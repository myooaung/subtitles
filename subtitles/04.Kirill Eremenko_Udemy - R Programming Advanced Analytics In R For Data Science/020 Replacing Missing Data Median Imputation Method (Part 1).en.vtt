00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.500
Hello and welcome back to the Von's course on our programming.

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.310
So far we've done quite a lot in our daily preparation I thought it would be nice to market off here

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.330
in our spreadsheet.

4
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.170
So I'm not going to worry about the rows that come underneath that come below.

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.120
But basically we'll just park of these red boxes and that will tell us which columns with Talpa.

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.660
So we've dealt with the industry call as you recall we removed these rows then we've dealt with the

7
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.500
inception call them we decided to just keep it as is because it's not going to impact our analysis.

8
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.240
Then we've also dealt with the state to call them because we were able to predict or derive 100 percent

9
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.400
certainty what the state is based on the city.

10
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.360
So now we just have a few more left.

11
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.650
And today we're going to talk about the employees call.

12
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.570
We're going to learn how to use the median imputation method to proxy a value into this column and we're

13
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.610
going to talk about the growth column.

14
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.980
And basically the same things could happen.

15
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.710
We're going to learn how to use the median imputation method to proxy our value into the growth column

16
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.030
.

17
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.300
Now I'll explain a little bit more detail what we're doing so that we have a plan of attack for today

18
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.840
.

19
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.190
So what you can see here is that we've got 500 companies.

20
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.710
And if I highlight this row then you can see that the average number of employees is 148 in or across

21
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.430
all of these companies.

22
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.220
And what we could do is we could just take that number 148 employees and just pluck it into this cell

23
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.030
over here and that is a very coarse median imputation example or that's a good example of a course mean

24
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.350
amputation right so that's not even a second median we're taking the mean.

25
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.190
So the average for this column and we're just putting in here.

26
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.680
So a bit of a step up from that is to take the or rather then for all of these companies is just to

27
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.240
take the companies that are in the retail sector so that's let's have a look at that.

28
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.590
Let's say I want to create I want to create a filter and then I just want to look at the companies that

29
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.750
are indeed only in the retail sector because this company is in the retail sector.

30
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.610
And then if I just go to my column here now if I highlight all of this then you'll see that the average

31
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.000
is 209.

32
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.040
So obviously there are stores where lots of employees are required in the retail sector so the average

33
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.690
has gone up.

34
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.100
And now if we put in this number here two hundred nine that will be a much closer approximation to the

35
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.490
reality because this company does operate in the retail sector.

36
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.620
Why would we proxy it with an average across all of the different sectors including construction including

37
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.910
financial services I.T. services.

38
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.660
They're not very similar.

39
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.160
They're more the companies that are most similar to this company.

40
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.280
Green facts are the companies that also operate in the retail sector so that is an even close approximation

41
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.520
.

42
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.390
You could even take it a notch up you could say All right we're going to look at only companies that

43
00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.480
are in the same state in the state which has abreviation SCC you could do that or you could even look

44
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.760
at the same city or other things that might impact us.

45
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.200
And this comes down to your industry knowledge so your knowledge of your daughter said Does it add value

46
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.110
to filter your data set by the same state.

47
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.960
Is there more similarities that way or by YOUR of inception or maybe by the revenue figures what will

48
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.940
give you the biggest similarity in terms of employees.

49
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.890
In our case we're going to limit ourselves by filtering to the same industry because that is a kind

50
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.800
of a very sure very certain approach.

51
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.800
So it's not 100 percent certain but it definitely like it.

52
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.850
It even feels like that looking at a company's in the similar industries is a bit of a more fair approach

53
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.670
than just look at companies across all industries.

54
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.740
If you would like.

55
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.600
You're welcome to take it a notch shop and look at companies in the same state or city or use other

56
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.220
variables as well.

57
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.610
Now that's in regards to similarities and the other thing is that here in Excel we were talking about

58
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.070
the mean but in reality we're going to be looking at the median because the median is less affected

59
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.470
by outliers and if you have massive outlay Here in them please call them.

60
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.770
So maybe it's just sorted by descending here.

61
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.420
So you'll see that we have a company that has seven thousand employees and it is indeed in the retail

62
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.120
sector.

63
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.980
As you can imagine that will skew the average a lot.

64
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.020
So it will increase average whereas if you take the median it won't really impact the median that much

65
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.980
because it's only 1 it's only 1 2 values or in total there's only 9 values out of 500 that are over

66
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.520
1000.

67
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.840
So as you can imagine they will impact the average a lot but not the median as much.

68
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.320
So that's why we're going to be working with the median of values.

69
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.220
All right so there it is.

70
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.980
That's our plan of attack for them please call them the growth.

71
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.750
Exactly the same thing.

72
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.760
We're going to be performing exactly the same procedures.

73
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.540
So let's jump straight into it and get started on this analysis.

74
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.130
And actually I wanted to warn you these next couple of tutorials where we're going to be using the immediate

75
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.250
imputation method they're going to be pretty intense.

76
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.160
So prepare yourself for that.

77
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.870
We're going to do quite a bit of coding.

78
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.110
All right let's get started.

79
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.640
So first thing we want to actually find this median right.

80
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.520
So first thing of course far on this will see that these are empty values and we're dealing with employees

81
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.000
so we have two columns here one in retail with two rows one retail one financial services and so first

82
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.360
of all we're going to find what value we need to put in here.

83
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.600
Right.

84
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:41.720
We're going to find out the median value so median for our data frame which is fin in the retail sector

85
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.210
so we want to add a filter right so I'm going to put the comment right away.

86
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:52.310
And here we want well right away we'll just put in the column that we're dealing with employees.

87
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.710
Right.

88
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.550
So this is just all of the whole column for employees around that.

89
00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.970
There it is.

90
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.660
If I run this.

91
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.070
That is the median.

92
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.530
That's because we've got an ace and Annie's mess up immediate So what we definitely need to do here

93
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:14.600
is and a dot r m equals truth so remove and as we run that we can see that the median is 56 in much

94
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.440
less than average.

95
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.830
We can just check the mean for the same data and just to make sure it's the same as what we saw in Excel

96
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.380
as you remember it was 149.

97
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.510
So exactly the same as what we saw in Excel which is good.

98
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.680
Now we're going to get rid of that and with our median what we want to do is we want to take it that

99
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.210
to that next level we want to look at what is in the retail industry so we're going to add a filter

100
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:43.490
here and he's going beefin dollar sign industry equals double equals Don't forget as Stubley calls retail

101
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.280
in quotation marks.

102
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.580
All right.

103
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.680
So that is our median for that industry.

104
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.730
So once again we've got this filter which subsets our daughter doorframes to only the retail industry

105
00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:02.250
rose and then we're looking at the employees column and then we're taking the median of that column

106
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.080
and we're ignoring any of these.

107
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.840
So if we're on that we get to 28.

108
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.510
So as you can see the median for the hold out of said was 56.

109
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.730
The median for the retail sector is actually 28 so it's it is actually the opposite.

110
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:22.200
Very interesting so that we saw that the me the average increased when we looked at just the retail

111
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.520
sector.

112
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:30.140
So if I replace that with the mean average you can see that the average increase from 149 to 209 but

113
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.920
the median decreased.

114
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:38.420
Very interesting observation and might be a bit counterintuitive as opposed to what we discussed before

115
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.650
.

116
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.330
But nevertheless that's the result we want.

117
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.360
We want that proxy number want this number 28.

118
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.430
So what we could do right now we could put it into that and roll that we wanted to put it into right

119
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.440
away like right now we could put it in there.

120
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.710
But a word of caution it's always a good idea.

121
00:07:54.710 --> 00:08:00.620
It's always good idea to save these statistics into separate variables or vectors because before you

122
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.560
override the daughter because once you override the sounds you've now affected the media and you're

123
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.240
if you want to recalculate the media and then you will already be including that new value that you're

124
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.790
putting in there so it's always a good idea to save these values.

125
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.260
And we're going to do exactly that.

126
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:23.420
We're going to put this value into median employee retail so we remember what columnist for and what

127
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.590
filter we applied to the retail sector.

128
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.850
We're on that.

129
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.150
And now we've got our median employee retail here 28.

130
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.150
Beautiful.

131
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.860
So now what we want to do is we want to replace that row.

132
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.240
We want to replace that roll with that value we can.

133
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.400
Once again we can dress the roll by itself using the ID or the wrong name.

134
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.520
But what we're going to do is we're just going to create a filter just assuming that there could have

135
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.980
been multiple rows that we want to deal with.

136
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:56.040
And you know that's good practice for the future so let's go ahead and do that.

137
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.050
We're going to say fin.

138
00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:02.060
And then we want to say is dot and they fin adults sign them please right.

139
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:07.630
So we're looking at the column for employees we're finding everything that's is a missing value in there

140
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:13.520
and then we're subsetting by that then we want to say nothing of course but we want to add additional

141
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.410
filter because we're just run that we'll get the retail and the services industry.

142
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.640
So we want an additional condition here.

143
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:27.470
We want to say and fit and dollar sign whereas my dollar sign here it is industry double equals retail

144
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.270
quotation marks right so far on that.

145
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.750
Then we have that same one line that we do need to replace for green facts.

146
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.200
And now we know we are just going to work with them please call them.

147
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:45.100
We're going to replace that with a median employee retail so far on that.

148
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:52.250
Now we just want to check and we want to pick out that one row that we are we were working with which

149
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.740
is roll number three.

150
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.500
So just on that as you can see employees is 28.

151
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.730
So we have successfully applied the median imputation method.

152
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.900
Congratulations.

153
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.520
It's a big big step in Darling Daughter preparation of course.

154
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:07.850
All right.

155
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:14.070
And now we need to do the same exact thing for this other company which we have here and the financial

156
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:21.270
services sector which has no place so I encourage you to post this video and practice that so do the

157
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.960
same thing check for the mean median.

158
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.860
Where was it.

159
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:30.960
So just basically check for the I mean media and everything and how they change if you include the industry

160
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.930
non-recognition and then just perform this.

161
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:42.110
And now I'm going to do the same thing here so I'm going to basically copy this and let's have a look

162
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:48.020
at the mean for instance and see how the mean changes for financial services.

163
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:54.240
So the mean is 211 while that's for the financial services so basically what I wanted actually to do

164
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.380
is get rid of this filter so don't filter that industry.

165
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:05.310
And just for everything 248 then it becomes 211 so it goes up.

166
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:11.960
And now if I look at the median for the same two what is the median.

167
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.420
It was 56 and then it goes to 80.

168
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.840
So the median also goes up in this case.

169
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.790
Very interesting.

170
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.250
OK.

171
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:26.780
So now what we want to do is we want to just perform the same calculations or same assignments and we're

172
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.710
going to create a variable here will say Fin's serve.

173
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:38.010
Financial services run that and now we have this which should contain our 80 value which is good.

174
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:45.780
And now we just want to assign it so same as here we are trading this filter financial services right

175
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:45.870
.

176
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:51.240
So there it is it's we're checking that it is and they are missing value and the industry is financial

177
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.350
services.

178
00:11:52.350 --> 00:12:00.080
And now we just working with the same row but we're signing the employees column a value which we've

179
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.350
saved over here.

180
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.260
There we go so far on that.

181
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.180
And now we have a look at it check.

182
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.880
So financial data set bro.

183
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.720
Not all of it.

184
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.030
Name 330 comma nothing.

185
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:21.080
So Westminster with Spencer financial financial services and we've successfully applied immediate imputation

186
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.860
method.

187
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.400
Again congratulations.

188
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:30.030
So if I now run this you will see that we only have four more rows to deal with.

189
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.990
We are getting very close to completing our daughter preparation phase.

190
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.710
It's getting very exciting and I hope the immediate computation method made sense.

191
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:46.860
It is a very powerful method for lots of different types of analyses and I encourage you to practice

192
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:52.560
it whenever you have a chance to just so that you get the hang of it and then you see all these ways

193
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:59.120
you can increase your similarity of what you're producing to other records in your data set.

194
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.480
And on that note I look forward See you in the next tutorial.

195
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:03.940
Until then be coding
