00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.230
Hello and welcome back to the advanced course on our programming.

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.370
In today's tutorial we will learn how to add components to a list and how to delete components out of

3
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.030
a list.

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.480
Let's get started.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.320
All right so we've got a list which is lists underscore our old one.

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.760
It's got three components right now it's got machine which is the name of the machine.

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.760
It's got stats which are the statistics around utilization of the machine which we have been asked for

8
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.110
.

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.980
So the minimum maximum mean or average and the maximum and the flag which tells us if the machine was

10
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.540
ever operating under 90 percent utilization in the month.

11
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.370
Now what we want is we want to eventually add a bit more information because we were asked for a bit

12
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.600
more.

13
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.800
Right.

14
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.460
So let's start by adding some dummy information just so we can see how all this works out.

15
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.370
So let's say I want to add just a vector or just a character.

16
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.120
New information how to do that.

17
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.510
Well I would say a list underscore are all one component and before which doesn't exist yet.

18
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.000
Well we don't assign it something so I would say list are all want a component for add new information

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.810
.

20
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.630
Run that and now I look at list on the score of one you can see that we have machine stats low threshold

21
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.670
.

22
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.860
And then the component before which doesn't have a name.

23
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.370
Makes sense we didn't give it a name.

24
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.850
New information.

25
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.640
OK.

26
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.720
That's number one.

27
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.480
That's where the first way how to add information let's say let's look at another way another way to

28
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.130
add a component via the dollar sign.

29
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.920
All right let's have let's have a look at how we can do this.

30
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.970
We're going to add in this vector right.

31
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.690
So actually it's true that we will add this one.

32
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.870
So this time it's something useful something that we have actually been asked for.

33
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.440
Unlike new information.

34
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.170
So let's go ahead and add that first we're going to find those hours so we want to find out the hours

35
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.150
where utilization is unknown.

36
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.650
So let's have a look at our data are all one.

37
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.360
Right so if I look at our A-one you'll see that here we've got most of the time it's known it's known

38
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.610
is known.

39
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.000
And then if we get to the top you'll see that here utilization is unknown in some column.

40
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.840
So how do we figure out those comps well are we going to use that is a function here right which we've

41
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.550
learned a little bit about.

42
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.040
And here we're going to say is an A.

43
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.810
And now we're going to create a filter like that are all a one dollar sign utilization.

44
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.150
So our A1 utilization is this column.

45
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.570
Right.

46
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:56.940
So that's just a column represent it as a vector then is N.A. tells us gives us a true false vector

47
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.240
which tells us so is true which are true because the first couple of breakers are indeed NA's in that

48
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.550
column and then it's false.

49
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.350
And so this is a filter that we're going to apply to our doorframe we're going to say nothing and this

50
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.810
will give us the subset of our doorframe where utilization is indeed an 8.

51
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.410
Now obviously we're off to the hour so we need only the hours all hours.

52
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.170
Rachel Zeshan is unknown.

53
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.330
So here we are going to say pause next time and then we're going to say we want to add this into all

54
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.560
this.

55
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.810
Right.

56
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.140
So that's the result.

57
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.570
Those are the hours where utilization was unknown for this machine.

58
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.920
How do we add this into a list.

59
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.830
Well we want to use the second method.

60
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.540
Why are the dollar sign.

61
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.920
It's very simple.

62
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.180
And as you probably have guessed you just need to type and list are all one.

63
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.590
And here we are going to use dollar sign and we're going to give that component and name right away

64
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.960
so you can say unknown hours.

65
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.670
So far on this and I look at list are all one.

66
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.220
You will see that I've got a new component unknown hours and this component automatically gets added

67
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.560
to the next available spot.

68
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.600
So here we specify that we want the wanted to be added into Number four here.

69
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.690
It was added as the next available so it's added as number five.

70
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.550
By the way have a look in your spare time what happens if you specify a number higher so if you specify

71
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.550
here 7 or 8 or 100 what will happen what will how will it added.

72
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.010
What will happen in between between that number and the last component you had.

73
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.060
It's quite an interesting little exercise for you.

74
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.060
Just see what happens if instead of four here you specify a much higher number anyway so moving back

75
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.070
we've got this list now which is slowly growing right.

76
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.240
It's getting bigger.

77
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.390
We've got machine we've got stat's low threshold and we've got some new information here.

78
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.420
We've got unknown hours.

79
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.740
Well now we realize that this new information is actually completely useless.

80
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.370
How do we get rid of it.

81
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.510
Well let's learn how to remove a component remove a component.

82
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:13.950
It's very simple it's very similar to how we've done this before with other objects so remove using

83
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.680
the null method.

84
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.510
We're going to say illest underscore our old one and then Forssell kind of similar to when you want

85
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.770
to remove the names of a dot a frame or Matrix.

86
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.110
The rows are called the names of the rows of columns of a matrix or some other object.

87
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.150
So basically when you're removing names of objects here we're going to use the same method and works

88
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.150
for removing components of a list.

89
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.980
So we're just going to know that.

90
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.330
No.

91
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.000
Run that.

92
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.690
And if I look at lists and a score of one you will see that it's gone.

93
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.810
Now the very important thing to notice here and I'm just going to actually type in.

94
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.720
Notice what happened is enumeration has shifted.

95
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:06.760
So unlike him a doorframe in a doorframe you could delete some columns in are then numeration.

96
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.310
So the names of the columns which are their indices they don't get shifted unless you tell them to unless

97
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.900
you reset them.

98
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.210
But with a list they do.

99
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:25.650
And that is something important to remember so if I look at list underscore are one before you will

100
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.710
see that it is actually even though we know that out what happened is the unknown hours which used to

101
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.020
be number 5 became not before.

102
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.500
So remember that that is a very important distinction to keep in mind when working with lists.

103
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.190
They react to removing components different to a doorframe.

104
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.280
That's fair enough because illest is not the same as a doorframe it's not it's not a structure type

105
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.930
of facility.

106
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.630
It's more of a just it just lists those elements so it just makes sense that if you remove something

107
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.740
from the middle you're not going to have a gap in there it just gets filled up with the element that

108
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.910
came next.

109
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.980
All right so that was important to remember.

110
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:12.360
What are we going to do now is we going to add another element Tolleson other component.

111
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:19.280
So let's just say add another component and what are we going to add.

112
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.210
Well we're going to add this data frame.

113
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.150
Finally slowly we're getting to our deliverable.

114
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.170
Let's add the data frame for this machine.

115
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.020
So we're going to say list by the way pause this video if you want to give us a go on your own.

116
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.960
We're going to say list dollar sign and we'll give it a name.

117
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.570
Dora is our old one because we've already subsidized our doorframe.

118
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.180
We already have this are all one.

119
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:52.620
From there we have added it in and now if we look at our list which you'll notice is it's massive It's

120
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.460
huge.

121
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.880
So basically what our does is it prints out the list in full so all of the elements.

122
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.350
So you've got Where are we here.

123
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.820
We've got machines that's low threshold.

124
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:05.610
Unknown hours.

125
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.950
And then you've got data and it takes up quite a lot of space here.

126
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:17.470
So what you can do is you can use the functions that we all know quite well.

127
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:24.990
You can say summary of list and the score of one and that will give you a quick summary of what you

128
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.700
have in your list.

129
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:33.660
You've got machine stats and tells you the left so one means that's because it's a vector of one character

130
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:33.900
.

131
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:39.480
Remember that in our Everything is a vector you can have a value just by itself is still a vector and

132
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.670
one just means that that vector has a of one so there's just that one word in there.

133
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.820
Stats has three low threshold as of one unknown.

134
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.080
Ours has a length of seven.

135
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:56.730
And but what's more important is that it's a POSIX CTE and a daughter has the length of four that's

136
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:02.240
just basically the number of columns and it's a data frame that it tells you that over here.

137
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:08.840
And also you can use the function list and the score of one or Esti are for structure list underscore

138
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:14.500
or one gives you a bit of a difference of like a bit of different formation here.

139
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:20.790
So for Dora it gives you that same as G.R. as it would for that same data frame.

140
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.210
All right so that is how we add and remove components from lists.

141
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.550
We're hoping for this to Tauriel.

142
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.880
And I look forward to seeing you on the next one.

143
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.300
Until then I'd be coding
