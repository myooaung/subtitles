00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,570
Hello and welcome back to that month's course on our programming.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:15,390
Today we're going to start dealing with the fact Marable's the revenue and expenses ones and we will

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,640
learn how to convert them into nonfactor variables.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,740
Because as we can see they are just numeric variables they contain information on doorman's so they

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,890
should be stored as such so as numeric Darroze So as we can see here profit is stored like that.

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,180
So that's what we want to do with these variables and also with the growth bearable.

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,700
So we're going to learn how to do that.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,300
And for that we're going to need two functions we're going to need the sub and the G subfunction.

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,320
OK.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,730
So here I'm going to type in sub and G subs So what are these mysterious functions for this call.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,080
The question mark.

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,820
Let's have a look here.

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,030
So let's zoom in over here and what we can see here.

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,380
So Suppe is the function and g such as other function.

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,360
So what they do is they look for a pattern.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,340
They replace it.

17
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:14,910
And then that's X is where to look for that pattern we're not going to worry about the other parts of

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,920
this of these functions.

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,060
And the difference between salbe and A-G sub is that sub replaces just the first instance supper places

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,370
all instances.

21
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:32,670
So let's have a look here and see salbe and some perform a placement of the first and all matches respectively

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,250
pattern matching and replacement.

23
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,830
So let's go ahead and try these functions out.

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,270
So what you want to do.

25
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,600
Well we're going to be actually dealing with the GI function because in our case there's no situation

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,400
where we want to just replace one instance of something.

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,080
We will be replacing the dollar sign will be replacing the Como's all of them and then comma's here

28
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,190
then the word dollars space and the percentage.

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,310
And so in all cases we want to replace all instances of what we find so it is going to be dealing with

30
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,220
sub.

31
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,800
So let's see how we can work with some.

32
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,660
Let's say we want to start with the expenses column for instance.

33
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,820
So what are we going to do here.

34
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:19,420
We're going to say even dollar expenses and we want to replace that with just Bob.

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,670
All right.

36
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,210
Here we can specify the pattern.

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,280
What parent do on fire.

38
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,160
We want to find this parent so space and then dollars.

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,280
So we're spaced out here and we want to replace that with nothing.

40
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:37,080
We want to replace that with an empty empty quotation marks because we want to just basically remove

41
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,710
it and then we're going to say Come on where do we want to find that we want to find that in thin dollar

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,300
expenses.

43
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,830
So once again this is the pattern that we're looking for.

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,850
This is what we're replacing it with.

45
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,240
And this is what we're analyzing where we search for that Paran and replacing.

46
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,380
So if I run this line what that just did is it is replaced all of the expenses there.

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
So let's go ahead and look at that top line.

48
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,620
You'll see that in expenses we no longer have that word dollars nor space dollars.

49
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,450
We don't have that.

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,770
So now we want to replace these commers or replace the commas in the expenses column.

51
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,210
So let's go ahead and do that.

52
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,940
We're going to take just a couple of slide and here I was going to say common.

53
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,150
If I run this and I look at the top you can see that expenses no longer has the commerce and and the

54
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,320
interesting thing here is if I look at SDR fin you will see that expenses is no longer a factor.

55
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,160
It's a character.

56
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,190
So that's an important thing for us.

57
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,830
We're going to use that to our advantage when we're continuing with this verbal.

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,920
But let's just remember that for another it's character not a factor.

59
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,760
And let's deal with the revenue variable.

60
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,440
All right.

61
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,500
So revenue is going to be a little bit different.

62
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,140
What do we want to replace in revenue one replace the dollar sign signs so let's go in.

63
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,380
In dollar revenue we want replace of using Giese.

64
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,850
We're going to replace the dollar sign.

65
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,680
So if I type in just dollar sign and then I say nothing.

66
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:21,810
And then I say fin dollar revenue if I run this and I look at the top what you'll see is a dollar sign

67
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,000
is still there what happened why doesn't it get replaced.

68
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,600
Well that is because a dollar sign is a special character and are as you can see we're using it here

69
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,590
and here and there it has its own implications.

70
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,400
And if you want to find a dollar sign inside of a string.

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,040
So if you want to actually address the dollar sign in its character meaning then you need to create

72
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,260
an escape sequence.

73
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,610
And now without going into too much detail the way to create an escape sequence for a dollar sign is

74
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,020
to put a double backslash before the dollar sign.

75
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,810
Inside the quotation marks.

76
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,350
So if I run this now and I look at Fin you'll see that the dollar sign has disappeared.

77
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,890
Now there are a few sort of symbols that will need a escape sequence before them.

78
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:17,190
And so basically if you run into the way to deal with it the best ways to if you run into something

79
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,570
like an issue like this and you are suspecting that you're dealing with a special character like a dollar

80
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,490
sign is a type of special character.

81
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:30,060
Well then just look up the escape sequence or just google for escape sequence for that specific sign

82
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,570
in are and most likely will be something similar.

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,330
So that is how we replace the dollar sign.

84
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,000
And now we want to replace.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,280
Same thing we want to do for Cummins.

86
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,970
Right.

87
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:49,590
So there's just some coma and then with nothing and we're going to say fin dollar revenue.

88
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,490
So if or not I look at the top.

89
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,260
There we go.

90
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,230
So we've got revenue very nice.

91
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:02,070
So if I look at our Finegan you'll see that both of these variables on our characters rather than factors

92
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,500
.

93
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,060
And what does that mean.

94
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,020
That means that we'll soon be able to very easily turn them into new markets.

95
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,540
All right.

96
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,830
So what are we going to do now.

97
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,480
Now you can actually pause the video and you can do the same thing from growth.

98
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,930
So it'll be a good practice exercise if you get rid of this percentage sign on your own for Growth Other

99
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:29,670
wise if you want to continue and see how it's hungry to do it just keep watching the video and I'm going

100
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,050
to do it.

101
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,110
Actually right now.

102
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,390
So I'm going to go fin dollar grove and I'm going to go Geez sob.

103
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,780
And I'm going to look for percentage sign comma nothing.

104
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,610
And in when I'm going to look for a Infin dollar growth.

105
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,210
Yup.

106
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,460
So for that and I look at the top pros.

107
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,510
So I go head when you will see that growth no longer has upside.

108
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,000
So there we go if corrected are three columns revenue expense and growth.

109
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,780
And now all we need to do is convert them from character into a numeric.

110
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,870
And as you remember this is going to be much easier than converting from a factor into a numeric because

111
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:13,620
basically what we just did remember this part where we had a factor and we had to first converted into

112
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,580
character and then we could only convert into an America right.

113
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,220
So when the factor variable trap well.

114
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,230
Using the Jizo function to replace things.

115
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,490
What we actually already did is we did that transitional step we completed this step instead of using

116
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:36,900
just as character we use g sub which perform some conversions and sub actually did that conversion.

117
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,520
And apart from replacing stuff it what it did is actually converted the factor into a character for

118
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:41,830
us.

119
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,170
So basically this step has already been done and that's why we seen characters here.

120
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,080
All we have to do is now apply that has numeric function.

121
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,870
So in this case it was like it's a bit concealed but we're still doing that same method.

122
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,670
We're still first converting to character.

123
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,590
The factors being converted to character and then is being converted into a numeric.

124
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,880
So now we're going to do that Spenser's right.

125
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,270
So if I on that that should be it.

126
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:14,460
And I'm just going to be a bit lazy and change this to revenue and this to revenue.

127
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,520
This is going to be Grove.

128
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,360
All right so far on this.

129
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,650
Now I can look at Fin so I can see that it's American-American numeric.

130
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,690
It doesn't matter that this is integer.

131
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,520
That's pretty much the same thing it just means that it's more specific that there's no doubles in there

132
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,010
or anything like that.

133
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,750
And here we're going to look at summary for thin.

134
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,080
So if you look at summer 15 you can see that is beautiful.

135
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,500
Now all four of these variables revenue expenses profit and growth are being recognized as actual numeric

136
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,430
variables which is exactly what we wanted.

137
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,760
We can now deal with them as they are.

138
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:58,770
So just to recap we did follow the same process which we discussed here where a factor variable has

139
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,770
to be first converted into character.

140
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,060
And then it can only be converted into numeric to avoid the factor of arable trap.

141
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,610
In our case because we used the subfunction to replace things.

142
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,050
This is already incorporating our conversion into character.

143
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:22,040
And then we are converting the same variable using as numeric function into an actual numeric.

144
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,250
So that's how this works and that's how we avoided the fact variable trap.

145
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,470
In this example and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial.

146
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,910
I know it was a bit of coding this time but definitely worth it.

147
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:38,000
We got an all variables as we want them and I look forward to see you next time.

148
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,440
Until then happy Cona
