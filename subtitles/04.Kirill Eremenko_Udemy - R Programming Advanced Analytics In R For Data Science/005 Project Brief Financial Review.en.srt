00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,030
Hello and welcome to the section on data preparation of the advanced course on our programming.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,780
Super excited to have you on board.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,250
And today we've got an interesting project brief.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,870
It's called the Financial Review.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,470
Let's have a look inside.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,180
You have been hired by the Future 500 magazine.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,220
The stakeholders have supplied a list of 500 companies and would like you to create some draft visualizations

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,520
for the upcoming online publication.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,180
They have requested the following chart a scatterplot classified by industry show revenue expenses and

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,330
profit scatterplot that includes industry trends for the expenses to revenue relationship and baulks

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,790
Plus showing growth by industry.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,790
Note that the data set has numerous discrepancies that need to be addressed before analysis can be performed

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:47,890
.

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:56,310
All right so just short of Future 500 is a made up magazine that takes data on companies and then they

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,690
run some statistics some analysis around it and they publish interesting articles about them.

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,960
So they are after some specific scatterplot and bar charts box plots that they would like to create

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,320
.

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,710
So they've had supplied you a data set and you'll see this dataset contains 500 companies or 500 rows

19
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,620
each one representing a company and some financial information on them.

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,540
Industry information and so on and you'll need to prepare this analysis for them.

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,820
But this the key line here is that bottom line that the data set has numerous discrepancies and that's

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,810
what we're going to be focusing on in this section.

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,280
We're going to learn how to deal with problems in our data how to convert different types of columns

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,860
into other types of columns how to deal with factors we'll talk about the fact a verbal trap.

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,240
We'll talk about cleaning data we'll talk about replacing missing daughter and so on and what methods

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,650
you have available to you there.

27
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,780
So that's our main focus.

28
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,030
And at the end we will indeed create these charts that they're after.

29
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,020
So where do we get this data set.

30
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,220
Well to get the data set we need a browser.

31
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,300
And in our browser we need to go to superdog assigns dot com slash our course advanced with a hyphen

32
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,050
in the middle.

33
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,940
And if you scroll down here you'll see Section 2 data preparation.

34
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,320
So go ahead and download these files.

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,100
The challenge for that we looked at just now the data set is the main data set.

36
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,700
And bear in mind here when you download it ill have a hyphen in the name will be future high and 500

37
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,360
doses in the tutorials.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,840
Mine doesn't have a hyphen so it's up to you if you want to correct that.

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,760
And then a future of half hundred.

40
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,230
It's a marked up Excel file.

41
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,080
You will see in the tutorials I will show you when we will need that file when we're talking about different

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,020
types of missing data.

43
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,730
So go ahead and download those and I will see you in the next tutorial can't wait to get started on

44
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,140
this.

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,970
And until next time happy coding
