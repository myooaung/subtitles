1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,790
We'll come back to the advanced course in our programming.

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:14,190
In the previous tutorial we applied the median imputation method to our employees call and today we're

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,990
going to start by applying the same method to our growth column.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,080
As you can see we still have and and they in the grove call.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,060
So let's go ahead and do that.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,170
This should be super quick because we already know what we are doing very very well.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,750
So I'm just going to actually copy this line into here and now we're going to form a similar operation

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,620
to what we had there.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,760
So we're going to calculate the median for growth and it is in the industry of construction.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,430
So construction we're going to by the way if you feel comfortable then you can just pause this video

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,640
and perform all of this on your own.

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,920
And then we can compare.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,480
So median finance data set industry this is going to be construction and we're not looking at them please

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:02,580
.

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,900
We're looking at growth and remove and as true.

16
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,800
So there we go we've got value.

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,250
Let's look at the value.

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,340
It's 10.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,530
So the actual average growth in that is you actually get very curious what would happen if I remove

20
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,650
this filter what is the average growth across all industries.

21
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,060
Right.

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,700
So very quickly on this it's 15.

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,910
So it's higher.

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:31,460
So the construction industry grew less than the industry is that the overall industries OK and that's

25
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,480
something to keep in mind.

26
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,010
Maybe you could check that later on.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,900
Just to make sure we're on the right track.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,280
All right so now we're going to say we're going to apply this value or we're going to find the value

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,100
we want to replace it once it is and they finish a sign and growth and then we want to say and finish

30
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,670
all the sign industry is indeed in the construction industry our rights common nothing.

31
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,050
So that should bring us that value that we want to replace.

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,680
Yes it is call role number eight.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:07,680
And so now we just take the Slyne and we say ROFE and we assign this value that we have here and now

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,020
we just want to check it was line 8.

35
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,180
So thin is correct.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,540
Nothing.

37
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,200
There we go.

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,490
We can see that the growth has been applied.

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,410
So now if we run this you will see that we only have just a few rows left.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,960
This fall we're agreed we're not going to touch and we have.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,700
So we have three to deal with.

42
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:26,940
All right.

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,560
So this we're going to keep full later because or actually let's go back to the ExCel.

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,580
So we've fixed this up.

45
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,110
Smoke screen.

46
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,730
We fixed this up and there's a couple rows at the bottom.

47
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,490
So we're going to keep this for later because this requires some different method you cannot just computed

48
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:51,600
from the averages over here because it has to be aligned with the revenue and profit so you have to

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,200
calculate this and we'll do it in a separate tutorial and then are we what we can do is we can impute

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,940
the revenue and expenses using the median imputation method.

51
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,240
So basically exactly the same thing as we did with employees and as we did with growth all you have

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,980
to do is calculate the median for the revenue for this industry or actually let's go back here.

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,820
So you'll see that there's one company there's actually two companies in the construction industry that

54
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,400
you need to calculate the rowing for.

55
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,430
So the only way is going to be a bit different is that you're going to be assigning two values at the

56
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,150
same time.

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,610
But basically all of the code is exactly the same so revenue let's calculate revenue then will Kalka

58
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,720
expenses and then I'll show you how to derive profit for these two rows and then expenses for this one

59
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,990
row separately.

60
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,170
So what we're going to do now is we're going to how are we going to structure it is we're going to actually

61
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,840
I'm going to end this tutorial here and that will encourage you to perform this exercise on your own

62
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,030
.

63
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,480
And then in the next tutorial I'll show you the solution and we'll walk through it so you can check

64
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,380
and verify that you know we've got the same code and maybe make any corrections if you need to.

65
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,820
And then we'll proceed onto the remaining parts.

66
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,560
So there we go.

67
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,950
Good luck with that as a mini exercise.

68
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,700
I'm sure it will come in handy.

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,730
And I also encourage you not to copy paste the code but rather to just type it up from scratch.

70
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:23,060
That will give you some additional experience and I'll look for it see you next time.

71
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,420
Until then happy coding

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,540
