00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,590
Hello and welcome back to that one of course in our programming.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,050
Congratulations on completing this section of course on our preparation.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,900
And today we'll quickly recap on what we've learned.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,330
All right.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,690
So let's get right into it.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,950
In this section we learned number one the factor of variable trap.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,460
So we had a quick refresher on factors and we also saw that factors sometimes need to be converted into

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,810
numeric variables sometimes otherwhere and sometimes America variables age converge factors and that's

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:40,710
easy but when factors need to be converted to numerics you have to be careful not to accidentally pick

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,240
up the actual facts or factorisation value.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,540
You need to pick up the value which is stored within the variable itself.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,960
And we learn how to do that.

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:57,360
We learnt that you first need to do an intermediary step for instance convert the factor into a character

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,050
and then convert and numeric.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,500
So that was a very interesting tutorial.

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,560
Next we had how to use a sub and sub functions for cleaning adorer.

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,550
So we had examples of fields where there were DOLLAR SIGNS commas or even words or spaces and we need

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:21,110
to get rid of them for our to successfully be able to recognize those fields as numerics.

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,290
So we learn how to do that with these two functions.

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,410
Next we're talking about methods for dealing with missing data.

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,370
And we covered off a few methods we covered off the role of missing data ignoring the missing effect

22
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:34,480
.

23
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,050
The data is missing and in some median imputation method we talked about factual analysis we talked

24
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,840
about calculating.

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,270
So we covered off quite a few methods and that's I think an important sub topic within data preparation

26
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,630
because inevitably in your career you're most likely going to deal of missing data and it's good to

27
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,410
have some sort of preparation in this sense.

28
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,970
Next we talked about the and so and these are a third logical concept.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,430
And we went into the very fundamentals of it and and they.

30
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,960
So we saw sometimes people just know that it's there but we actually discussed why is the third logical

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,550
constant.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,790
And we had a few examples of why you can compare names to names or to anything else.

33
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:25,350
And hopefully that will lay that great foundation for dealing with in ways going forward in your work

34
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,500
.

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,160
Our next we learn how to calculate missing how to locate missing data.

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:37,500
We use the complete case as function we had a very elegant blueprint for locating a missing data and

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,360
then we also learned the filtering techniques which include though which function.

38
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,430
And that is a function so as to which function to filter doorframes to find records which don't include

39
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:54,900
missing data and then we use the is in a function to filter doorframes to find records that do contain

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,850
missing data in the column that we're after.

41
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,360
Then we talked about the median imputation method and there was quite a few tutorials dedicated to this

42
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,960
method.

43
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:11,160
So we learnt we had a lot of hands on experience I'd say hands on practice with the median imputation

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,860
method.

45
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:19,590
And hopefully now after this section you're very comes off it and not only you know how to replace missing

46
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,520
values with the median across a whole lot of frame.

47
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,730
You also now have a quite you should have a quite a good understanding of when to look for similarities

48
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,390
in a data set.

49
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:36,570
So for instance if you have columns like industry or maybe gender or something that categorical type

50
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:43,410
of where you can group your variables maybe that's something worth considering and splitting your daughter

51
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,570
said into those groups and then searching for the median within each group.

52
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,430
And that way you might be able to get more accurate results.

53
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,410
It's not always the case but sometimes it can help your analysis.

54
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,260
And finally we talked about the fact factual analysis and deriving of values and methods.

55
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:06,840
So once again we talked about how if you can predict something we're 100 percent certainty then it's

56
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,760
not actually missing data if you can predict that 100 percent certainty.

57
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,500
And also deriving values methods with is like a mathematical relationship.

58
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,980
We had a few examples of those when you can calculate a missing value based on other values in the data

59
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,300
frame.

60
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,550
And moreover you should also take that into consideration.

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,280
So you should take into consideration those mathematical relationships when using the median imputation

62
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,570
method because for instance we had example we have three values expenses revenue expenses and profit

63
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:36,710
.

64
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,790
And out of those three we would only use the median imputation for two.

65
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,280
And then for the third one we would have to use the deriving value method because otherwise our dataset

66
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,470
wouldn't add up and says things like that you should also take into consideration.

67
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,220
So there we go that is the section on data preparation.

68
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:57,540
Now we didn't cover off everything about our operation and that's because that is virtually impossible

69
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,750
to grasp.

70
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:04,940
In one course or even probably in a lifespan there's so much to data preparation.

71
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,210
But what my goal was for the section was to cover off all of the main fundamental basics that will give

72
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:18,810
you a taste for data progression and also give you some of those blueprints so that when you walk into

73
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,270
a project where operations required you really have somewhere to start with.

74
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,630
And then anything else you need.

75
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,790
You'll be able to pick up along the way and you know you'll be able to also avoid pitfalls like the

76
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,420
fact Berbel chat because you already know about it.

77
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,110
So hope you enjoyed the section hopefully picked up a lot from here learnt a lot.

78
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,130
And of course had fun along the way and I can't wait to get started on the next one.

79
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,860
And until next time happy coding

80
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,000
.
