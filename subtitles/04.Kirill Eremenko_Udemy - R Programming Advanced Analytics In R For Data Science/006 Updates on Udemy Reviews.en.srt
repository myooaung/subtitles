00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:09,410
You guys walking back to the advice our programming course in this tutorial we're going to go through

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,260
it for a walk through Africa.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,020
If you were part of our program in Ada Zed's the first course in this series and you'll remember our

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,020
walks today we've got another walk.

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:26,570
And once again I wanted to give you a heads up very soon you do me is going to ask you to leave are

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,690
you for this course.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,850
Now I know it can be difficult to judge of quality and value of a course this early on.

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:37,120
However the university system has simply changed and they are asking you to leave review earlier and

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,730
earlier on in the course.

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,510
If you can hear a go I'm following.

11
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,540
I go here.

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,480
So now with that in mind we're not going to ask you to leave a fire sorry for this cause but what I

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,700
would like to ask is that if you're not familiar enough with the contents of the Course just check these

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,390
gals areas.

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,620

Please have a look at all of the amazing things that will cover the different case studies that will

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,600
have inside this course adds to the different topics in our program and that you will learn how you

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,090
will boost your skills and hopefully that will give you the confidence to write the score so far.

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,960
So of course if on the other hand you are unsatisfied about something if you think something is wrong

But if you are satisfied of course if you think everything is going well if you're excited about boosting

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,520
our programming skills and if you feel that this is a faster of course then please do rate it appropriately

33
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,010
so that other people will also know that this is a five star course on our programming and they can

34
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,650
to boost their skills here.

35
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,440
So there you go guys that was a quick little walk through Africa and that was a quick heads up about

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,310
have in this course and how are going to boost your programming skills and all the amazing things that

39
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,860
you will.

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,530
