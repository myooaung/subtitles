00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.890
Hello and welcome back to the advanced course on our programming.

2
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.530
Finally we're slowly getting to the end of our daughter preparation phase.

3
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:21.900
As you can see we've dealt with most of our missing data values in our daughter frame and today which

4
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.200
is going to finish up with these remaining red ones.

5
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.460
So what do we have here.

6
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.160
We've got some.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.480
So for instance in this role we've got a missing value for expenses and because we know revenue and

8
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.290
profit we can calculate expenses from that.

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.130
And also we've got revenue and expenses here which we've proxied with the industry medians and from

10
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.630
those to we can calculate profit because profit equals revenue minus expenses.

11
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.710
And same thing here we've proxied revenue and expenses so we can calculate profit and that's just an

12
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.190
important bits to reiterate that it is your judgment call what to proxy and what to calculate.

13
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.020
So if there's a mathematical relationship then it's better usually it's better to calculate the value

14
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.050
like in this case.

15
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.890
And then if you have three values you will need to decide which ones of them you substitute.

16
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.110
So for instance we chose revenue expenses and we go in to calculate profit but always remember about

17
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.410
those mathematical relationships because if you for instance if we were to proxy here expenses we have

18
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.340
the median the industry median then these three would add up.

19
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.210
And that might lead to some confusion or inconsistency in your analytics.

20
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.540
So let's go ahead and jump into our and finally calculate these missing values.

21
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.240
All right.

22
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.710
So here I've got the formulas written out so revenue minus expenses equals profit and that will allow

23
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.740
us to calculate the profit figures and expenses if you solve for expenses then you'll get expenses equals

24
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.990
revenue minus profit that will allow you to calculate this figure over here.

25
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.460
Let's jump straight into it.

26
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.710
All right first thing we're going to filter our data set for any rows that have NA so missing values

27
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.700
in the profit column.

28
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.130
So in dollar sign profit and common nothing.

29
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.330
So that should bring us these two rows.

30
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.370
That's correct.

31
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.960
And now what we're going to do is we're going to use the power of vectorized operations.

32
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.570
We're going to simply take here we're going to say want to deal with profit and then we're going to

33
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.000
take the same and we're going to say we want in this case revenue minus.

34
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.510
And in this case expenses as simple as that.

35
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.600
Nothing more complex than that because this is going to give us a vector of two values rise and they

36
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.260
and they which we're going to replace.

37
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.860
This is going to be the revenues and this is going to be the associated expenses so once you subtract

38
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.510
the two and then you put them in here you will get exactly what you want.

39
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.440
All right there we go.

40
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.150
And now let's have a look at these records.

41
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.860
So we're going to have to remember the numbers there were 8 and 42.

42
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.400
So Finn see 8 and 42 comma nothing.

43
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.400
So there we go.

44
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.720
As you can see the profit has been populated and now we're just we're just left of that one record that

45
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.660
we need to fix up with the expenses.

46
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.660
So let's go ahead and do the same thing.

47
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.930
We're going to say fin is DOD and they do all this finial assign expenses coma.

48
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.430
Okay so we're just finding that one row.

49
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.150
Good.

50
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.240
Now we want to address the expenses and what are we going to put in there.

51
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.640
We're going to put fin revenue minus fin profit.

52
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.050
Okay.

53
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.230
So that should work for us if we are on this now.

54
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.990
There we go.

55
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.110
Let's have a look at what line was it it was line 15 we can see here line 15.

56
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.310
So let's look at Fin 15 comma nothing as you can see the expenses have been populated.

57
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.190
So if we look at the rows with missing values our incomplete cases you'll see that we only have that

58
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.630
one row which we agreed to keep because it's not going to affect our analysis.

59
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.020
There we go that's how we do dollar preparation.

60
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.860
I hope all that made sense.

61
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.600
And it was quite exciting to get through all this.

62
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.360
I know it was very tedious at points but I'm sure if you for the long you learned a lot of new techniques

63
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.750
and skills and I look forward See you next time.

64
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.140
Until then happy coding

65
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.860
.
