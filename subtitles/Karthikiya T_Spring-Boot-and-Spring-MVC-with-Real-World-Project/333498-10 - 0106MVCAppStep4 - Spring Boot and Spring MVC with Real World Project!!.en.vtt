00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
as part off step number four,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.850
we're going to be introducing the JSP page along with the view result War.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.150
Going back to the architecture were able to acquire the model and the view object from the

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.770
controller to the dispatcher so that now it is the responsibility of the dispatches.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.990
Hold it to identify the right of you and send a model object to it.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.070
And in order for dispatches,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.050
sollitto identify the right view.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.060
It needs to know the location off the view along with the file extension.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.650
And for that it's going to consult the View resolver,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.750
which is also a class that is part offspring frame book.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.580
So let us first introduce the view,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.320
and then we'll introduce the view,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.850
resolve our I'm going to create another folder inside the bourbon of directory.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.110
I'm going to name it as views.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.870
This is where hollow response views would be reciting and do.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.550
Make sure that you create this particular folder inside the turbine off directory because

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.290
whatever that recites inside,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.590
developed by enough cannot be access directly with a your and inside this I'm just going to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.790
copy out existing JSP file and makes a minutes to it.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.600
Of course we want toe named this as Hello world.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.940
Basically whatever Dave you name that.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.650
Just send back from the controller.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.250
It has to be with the same name.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.960
Only then will the dispatcher solve it.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.780
Identify this and I want to replace this with her.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.100
Simple.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.100
It's three tank inside which I'm going to read both the para meters that we had set in the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.790
controller.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.850
Hello And the name?

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.090
Hello.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.380
I would give a space and then name.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.920
Now it's time to introduce that view.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:22.400
Resolve or and we can specify the view result were inside the conflict file like so So this

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.550
is a class file reciting in the spring framework.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.870
All we have to do is to inject a couple of properties like we're doing here.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:41.520
The 1st 1 is the prefix which will tell the part where our response view is reciting and

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.500
another properties the suffix.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.120
In our case,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.140
it's jsp.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.990
Since we're using,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.650
JSP has a view technology.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.480
If it is something else,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.070
you would have a different subjects that's have the file and we're done.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.680
We just need to run our application now.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.200
It's really unlikely that this would work in the very first goal because things that are as

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.980
simple as file names can actually mess up with exhilaration flow and can result in an error

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.980
.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.450
But let's see,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.850
we already seem to have a cross market,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.450
but I don't see any others inside this package.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.570
I'm assuming this is not intended.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.450
Let's refresh the project once before we done it.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:38.550
Let's take a deep breath and go to run us run on silver.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.890
And here he would choose the Apache Tomcat server that you're downloaded.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.210
In my case,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.450
it's washing number nine.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.990
Hit next and hearing it,

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.450
too.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.450
Select the territory,

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.520
the home,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.540
their tree off the Apaches over and then click Finish.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.990
This will deploy the war,

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.660
file into the server and then run it.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:19.550
See what's going on here.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:28.550
There seemed to be no exceptions that center some value when to say some names.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.270
I'm submit query,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.350
and we got the response that does not go back and enter some of the name.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.220
Hello there,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.850
and it worked.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.440
If it worked for you as well,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.020
then that's great.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.010
If it didn't do put me question and I would be happy to respond and let me tell you this.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.380
I'm actually going to make this project available for you to download so that he can import

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.750
this into your workspace and work with it.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.940
But I wouldn't recommend you to do that.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.250
Since this is the first embassy project that you're working on,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.580
I would recommend you to just try to do everything from scratch all on your own.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.750
And guess if you face and issues I'm there to help but do it on your own.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.150
Because this is the first crucial milestone for you to learn spring MBC.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.880
So don't lose this opportunity.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.820
Hope it makes sense.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.950
I will see you soon.
