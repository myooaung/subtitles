00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
let's talk a little bit about the project structure we're trying to follow.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.850
Hollow Core would go inside the SRC directory.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:16.550
The Resources Directory will hold files like the Properties File or Doris Kill Files.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.210
In our case,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.750
we populated some properties inside the application or properties based on our requirements

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.750
.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.450
I'm trying to enable us to database.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.580
And what I'm trying to say here is,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.280
every time we load the application,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.150
we want the tables to be created from scratch.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.150
And here are some JSP specific tags.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.650
The rescue revolved to seen its purpose and by the addition dark properties.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.640
Inside the Java directory,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.050
we have all the Java source code.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.790
The conflict would have the security contract or any conflict file that you wish to have

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.030
Constraint.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.080
We have one in,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.240
um,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.420
constraint that would specify the roads.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.130
And similarly,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.750
we also have a bunch of controllers that go inside the control of folder or the package.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.550
We have set off entities,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.800
repositories,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.330
services while the daters in our case,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.380
we just have only one.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.590
And last but not least,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:41.530
we have the starting point to run our application using spring boot and since Syria's and

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.680
just be not a template.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.050
Injun like time leave.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.230
We do need the buybacks directory inside which you will let go all the GSP pages and things

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.760
that are going to remain common in all these pages you want to give them in the common

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.230
folder.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.050
It's not mandatory but assessable practice.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.150
So we have all those jsp of files in here.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.800
If you have any static resources,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.350
it can make them part of this particular folder.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.760
In my case,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.110
I'm using the bootstrap library for my CSS and JavaScript needs.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.250
So I don't have to put anything in here.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.450
But that's how we're trying to organize our project.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.500
Hope it makes sense.
