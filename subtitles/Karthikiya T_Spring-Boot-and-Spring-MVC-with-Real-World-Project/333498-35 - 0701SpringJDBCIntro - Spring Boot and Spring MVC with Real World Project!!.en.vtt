00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010
Let's talk about Spring Jedi BC But before that,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.640
let us try to understand some of the problems faced by dollar per if they were to use Jerry

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.920
BC without spring.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.250
It is a very simple scenario.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.040
1,000,000.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.940
We're trying to find an insert Quito the database using very busy and then get back some

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.610
results.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.230
Even for such simple scenario,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.120
you have to introduce a lot off other boilerplate code that will support you.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.250
To run this query,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.210
for example,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.660
you have to specify the your That's where the database server would be running along with

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.650
its port number.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.780
And they also need to specify the name of the database using them and password to access

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.680
the database.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.670
And then you have to create that connection object,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.250
using the driver manager,

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.450
passing all those para meters,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.010
and only after doing all that you would ride the cord to fire the inside query.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.860
And once after you do that,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.840
you do have to take care off handling any possible exceptions and then finally have to take

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.460
care off,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.250
closing all the connections,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.950
our resources inside the finally block,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.750
and if you want to introduce transactions,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.300
you have to use the transaction object to begin the transaction and then finally coming the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.950
transaction,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.780
etcetera.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.690
The problem here is,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.250
although you're focused on fighting a query,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.570
you're forced to introduce all the other piece off code that will support you to run this

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.150
query.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.380
Well,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.910
well,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.170
these are the exact problems that spring Jerry busy eliminates Spring introduces so called

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.630
a jerry busy template,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.670
which is essentially a class file that will take care off all the problems that I just

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.150
mentioned and would let you focus only on the things that matter is to fight acquitted to

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.000
the database.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.280
Let's take a look at an example,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.650
and then you'll understand better.
