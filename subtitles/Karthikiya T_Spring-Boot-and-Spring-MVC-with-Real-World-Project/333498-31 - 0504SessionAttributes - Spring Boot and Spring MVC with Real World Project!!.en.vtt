00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
All these model attributes are request scoped and are not accessible from another

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.270
controller.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.860
If you want to be able to access these moral attributes from another controller,

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.080
you have to make them bart off this session scope.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.200
And for that very purpose,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.610
we have the sanitation session attributes and then you would provide the attribute that you

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.330
want to add into the session.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.440
I've already talked about history possessions in one off my previous courses.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.680
If you're not aware,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.550
off sessions go Panda Chris Cope,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.850
then it might be what want to export about it a little bit.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.030
But once you have this added as part off this session scope,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.910
you can no access this morel attribute from another controller using the sanitation session

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.650
attribute.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.840
And in order to demonstrate this,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.540
I've actually created another controller what you're seeing right now but the following

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.150
mapping.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.750
So before I send request to this controller,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.690
I have to make sure that I send request to this control because only then will these model

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.650
attributes be added into this session.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.480
So let's go back and reload this page that would populate the map as well as it would make

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.230
all that to be a part of the session.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.050
And now if I goto shop,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.250
it would show has that object,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.650
which is exactly what provided in here.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.050
I hope it makes sense.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.310
House,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.050
they assume.
