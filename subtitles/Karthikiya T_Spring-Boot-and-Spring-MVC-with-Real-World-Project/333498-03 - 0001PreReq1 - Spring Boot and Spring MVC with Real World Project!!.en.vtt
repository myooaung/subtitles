00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
Okay,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.620
let us take a look at some of the things that you would be needing to work on Spring and

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.550
Missy projects the first off,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.440
which is going to be the Jerry K.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.050
Or Java Development kit.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.680
If you re strip wonder,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.920
where do you want to learn spring framework?

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.990
Then I'm assuming that you already know how to install J decay and run Java programs.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.120
In fact,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.550
I'm pretty sure that you have all that install Jerrick in your computer,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.270
and you must have been running Java programs already.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.630
In case if you don't know how to do that,

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.540
that's fine.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.060
Only have to do is to go to Google and search for download Jerry K.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.860
And most probably,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.650
it's the first thing that you need to click.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.950
But do make sure that it points to oracle dot com.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.780
And once you do that,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.750
just try to download the latest wash in,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.770
and by the time of this recording,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.730
it's Java Standard Edition washing number 12 and because if you have an older version of

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.950
Java installed them,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.650
it's recommended that you download the latest one.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.150
Once you click the download button,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.050
you can choose a file depending on the type off operating system.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.250
Mine has been no.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.550
64 bit wash in,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.050
and so I condone Load one off these files.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.240
The exit file will let you install the jet decay,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.370
and here's a friendly manner.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.840
Or,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.440
alternatively,

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.480
can just download the zip file and sort of exported in a specific directory whichever way

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.250
you follow.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.750
The ultimate result is you will have Djelic getting populated in a particular directory,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.650
whether you do it manually or isn't the installer with any exit file.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.050
But the key thing to note here is if you have dedicate that is prayer to Java washing 11

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.270
then you should be able to see couple of actress Jerrick and J.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.470
R.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.750
E.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.170
But from Jerrick,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.650
a Washington 11 he would only see Jedi K.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.730
They have decided to get it off the Grt directory altogether because all the libraries to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.100
help from the Java programs were also part off Jedi K.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.530
Having another Jr is just to duplicate,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.690
and so they got rid off it.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.160
So since I have already set up the latest portion,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.940
which is Washington,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.560
but well,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.950
I can no get it off these two prominently,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.330
okay?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.450
I'm not able to delete this because I have the Eclipse open.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.610
I'll deal with that letter,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.020
but you can delete all the previous Washington's Another thing that you had to make sure as

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.480
you go toe and Roman variables in case off windows.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:04.750
Just search for it in the window search and then you'd get this system properties prompt.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.510
Click on enrollment.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.230
Very balls.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.590
Make sure that you have this particular variable Java home set.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.770
Well,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.220
this is not required to run the Java programs,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.190
but this perimeter would be used by other applications,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.550
and this might be needing in future.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.890
And it's also recommended that you add the path variable.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.250
Let me show you what I mean.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.880
That points to Java home bin directory.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.280
That's where all the executable Zoff job would be reciting and by doing so from the command

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.470
bro.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.350
So you don't have to actually navigate to this directory in order to use those tools,

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.980
he condemn it.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.150
We run those commands,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.130
and the operating system would be able to detect these tools based on the path variable.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.630
Have older done that,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.670
and then guess if you didn't it's recommended that you do that as well wants to do that in

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.650
order to make sure that things are working,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.250
just go to the command processor and and type in Java sea hyphen wash in.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.830
That should point to the right,

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.460
washing off Java and also try Java hyphen coercion.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.760
So that's Jabba Washington,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.850
which is expected.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.000
Some of my students who installed latest washing off Java complained that they're not able

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.050
to see the washing number when the type in job a hyphen version.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.750
If you feels the same problem,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.330
just type in the following command where Java hit,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.610
enter and you should be seeing only one single part,

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:52.520
and it must point to the right Jessica directory and guess if you're seeing any other part

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.520
,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.050
just try to get it off that file from that location.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.360
Then everything should work fine.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.370
And guess if your face and issues you can put me a question and then I'll be able to

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.050
respond.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.880
You're done with installing Jerry K.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.550
But we have a couple of more tools to install.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.050
Second off,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.910
which is maven Living,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.600
is actually not mandatory,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.400
but it's going to make our life a lot easier if you don't know off maven,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.080
that's fine.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.950
We're going to use it just to manage the dependence is without maven.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.740
We would have to manually search for jar files in the Internet and download them into our

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.300
projects,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.730
which is quite a messy process,

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.980
given the fact that spring is very vast and it requires a lot off libraries.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.000
So it's always recommended that we need to use at two like me.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.860
Even it has a lot of features,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.500
and it is primarily meant for project management.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.700
But for this course,

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.890
we're just going to be using it to manage our dependence is,

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.050
or dependent Jars will definitely be using it.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.930
Incoming videos,

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.100
and then you'll have a better picture on the same and instructions on how to install maven

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.910
will be in my next video.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.680
I'm actually going to show you the Maven installation video from my maven course,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.280
so we'll posit for the time being and will installed in next video.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.350
The third thing that would be needing is a Tomcats over.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.650
We're going to be needing the Tomcats over just for a couple of chapters.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.080
But down the line in future chapters were going to use spring boot and will understand how

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.800
spring boot is going to make a life lot easier with embedded.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.970
So was in databases so that you don't have to explicitly install a separate server or a

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.800
database.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.650
However,

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.330
like I said,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.700
we're going to be using.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.860
Tom gets over for initial couple of chapters are so and in order to install that you can go

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.750
to Google and search for Don't know Tomcat,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.880
most probably so first link that you need to click.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:59.450
But make sure it is pointing to Apache dot ogg and whichever is the latest washing you're

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.870
seeing on the left hand side.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.450
Just click it and download.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.190
Make sure you download one of these court files.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.450
It can never used the installer or the ZIP file.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.330
And like,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.350
as with Java installation,

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.970
you want to install it in a folder.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:18.710
In my case,

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.450
it's in this location,

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:26.340
and we're going to be using all these files from our Eclipse I D.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.250
Pretty soon.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:33.580
And the next thing that we're going to be needing years and I d.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.390
In my case,

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.150
I'm going to be using the eclipse i d.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.300
It is the most popular I d.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.820
It is feature rich.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.210
What not And guess if you're using any other idea.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.970
That's fine,

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.440
But make sure that you know the I D.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.090
Pretty well.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.070
If you don't,

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.950
then I would recommend you to install Eclipse so that you can follow along with me.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.150
And once you install Eclipse,

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.950
do make sure that you can actually create a sample project,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.200
a simple hello world project,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.650
and you're able to run it just to make sure that the Jerry K is pointing to the right

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.070
directory and stuff like that.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:17.550
So you can just simply try creating a project and then tried to run the program.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:30.710
Something off this sort and I'm going to create a new class,

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.050
all the test.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.150
I'm going to include public studied ward mean,

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.850
Let's put this assault statement here.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:48.250
Hello and run the program and it is booking,

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.990
so make sure it's working for you as well,

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.700
and goto Windows preferences.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:05.020
Click on Java or maybe expanded flick on Java compiler and make sure you are chosen the

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.750
latest one.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.560
Also under installed Jr Reese.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:15.770
Make sure you're pointing to the Jessica directory that you've just installed.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.030
That's about it.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.360
You know,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.800
next week we're going to see how to install maven and with that.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.950
We should be done with the the quite set up to start working on Spring Embassy.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.950
I will see you in my next video.
