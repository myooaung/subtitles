00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
organizations always strive to improve the performance off the application.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.180
One of the areas where it can be improved is authentication.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.150
I mean,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.470
you know,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.440
after these the logs into his account,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.850
we have to check for authenticity for each and every subsequent requests.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.040
And that's going to cost a lot of performance because we have to actually fight acquitted

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.000
to the database and check the records if the user has a permission to access a particular

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.950
resource or not.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.770
And in this case,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.990
most of the time we're performing Read operation.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.850
We're not updating any records,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.170
and the way the RTB amiss works,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.770
it's not very efficient for this purpose.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.370
I mean,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.150
if you're performing a lot off read operations than RTB,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.810
Miss may not be the best choice.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.100
The better alternative is to use a director service.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250
Let me explain,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.690
if you don't know about L.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.230
Dap,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.180
here is a quick tutorial on the same,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.570
but definitely we're not going to dive deep because this deserves a little course for

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.250
itself.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.150
But I'll try to give a quick crash course on L Dap.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:22.820
Let's talk about the term that tree service you can think of better service as a location

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.140
where we would start the data in the form off key value pairs when you can think off it as

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.740
at telephone directory.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.020
If we were to store the data off users,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.370
then we would have a key called name that corresponds to the use the name.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.300
Similarly,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.170
we may have an email I d.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.410
That corresponds to the user's email.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.950
I d.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.460
Similarly,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.060
we might have an address that corresponds to the user address,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:57.150
so on and so forth an example off which can be seen in here.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.950
It looks something off this sort.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.410
And L dap is a protocol using which we can actually communicate with the directory service

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.850
so that we can do a variety off things.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.980
An open and lap is a software that will enable the doctor service so that we can connect to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.930
the server and perform,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.410
read,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.670
write operations,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.350
etcetera.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:34.350
The LDF or held up data interchange format is the file type.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.650
Where would store the data?

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.250
Just as you're seeing in here,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.030
an entry is similar to a row in our day.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.790
Bms.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.260
I mean,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.690
all the sections that you're seeing in here is kind of like an entry and each entry can be

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.710
synonymous to a record in rd BMS.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:06.300
So we have entry for Bob with all his details.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:16.550
And all these individual units are called attributes and they would correspond to a column

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.260
in the database.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.090
Well,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.950
sort off.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.780
The deity is a debt information trees,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:35.660
and that kind of explains how the data is stored in the Elapsed server and why it is so

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.770
efficient to perform read operations.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:46.150
This is kind of synonymous to a file system where you would have a folder,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.590
and within the four,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.190
we will have multiple other folders,

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.350
etcetera.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.620
It's sort off like in a tree.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.050
Former and it is this tree format.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.850
You shall make it efficient to first the data to perform read operations.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.120
So that means elop is not the best choice if you're performing lot off right operations,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.470
this is only meant for read operations.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.300
And this is perfect for storing user data because when it comes to use us,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.990
we're really making it.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.650
It's most of the time we would perform read operations,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.310
so that's a quick,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.340
rough introduction on L dap.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.170
If you want to explore more the lot of resources.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.520
But we're not going to discuss any for their own L.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.950
Dap.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.960
That will be beyond the scope of this course.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.550
But let's take a look at an example where we can use the elder up services.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.950
So what I have here is the elder file with all the details.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.750
And obviously,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.300
just as you wouldn't mess with the data in the data best directly,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.850
you don't want to make edits here in this file.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.940
We would usually populate this from our code,

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.030
have corporate,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.690
told us from the official website spring dot i war.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.680
And next,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.850
as you would expect,

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.550
we're going to be needing the dependencies.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.930
In this case,

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.550
I'm going to be using an embedded adapts over.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.670
And he wrote,

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.750
The dependence is for the same.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.750
And once you do that,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.380
have to configure certain attributes inside the application or properties file.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.590
The first off,

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.180
which is the class month to this file.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:45.650
The elder file the 2nd 1 in here is so called a distinguished name.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.650
You can think off it as a directory or generalizing set off entries.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.420
I mean,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.750
if you go back here,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.050
all these entries would fall under one distinguished name.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:08.100
So all these entries would be categorized into one general category or a distinguished name

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.100
.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.160
Hope you're able to connect the dots.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:20.560
And then this is the port number where our l'd observer would be running our embedded

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.550
elapse over.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.950
Next thing is off course,

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.800
we want to all right,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:35.480
the default security behavior and connect to a silver and that will happen inside the

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:42.180
security contract file by all writing this method with this perimeter authentication

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.150
manager builder.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:50.880
And here are several statements which he had to have that would.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.250
I love you to access the elapse over for authentication.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:05.550
It has done that link for Dell Demps over these are all specific to L DAP.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.150
If you have some knowledge on using L dap,

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.050
you're probably familiar with this.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:18.700
So let's go toe browser and try to log in with one of the users available.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.850
Bob and the password is Bob's password.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:24.780
Basically,

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.080
whatever the store in the elapse over Have you called the credentials wrong?

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.140
Hopes.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.850
So that's Bob.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.950
We will be S b S S w o r d.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:45.050
And it seemed to have walked about.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:53.950
So that's about l dap and how you would use it in spring application Hope it makes sense
