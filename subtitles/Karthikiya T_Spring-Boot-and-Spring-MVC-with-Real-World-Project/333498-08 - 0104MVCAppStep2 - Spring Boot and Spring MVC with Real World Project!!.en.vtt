00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
Okay,

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.490
let's move on with step number two,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.450
wherein we'll try to create the JSP page along with the front controller or the dispatcher

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.450
.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.810
So let going back to the architecture how on Jsp Page would be present it to the user on

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.420
the browser.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.030
And in our case,

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.670
we're just going toe.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.250
Have one input field where the user will enter his or her name.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.270
And then we have a submit button,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.650
which,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.310
when clicked,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.710
all those details will be sent in the form of request of the front controller.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.750
But for that way,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.400
to have a mapping inside the backdoor XML file to instruct the Web container that it needs

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.200
to send all the requests toe the front controller and,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.860
luckily,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.810
spring pro Reuters.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.420
The dispatches.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.890
Hold it.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.960
We don't have to create on our own and Springs dispatcher soul.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.100
It well,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.310
just saw the purpose.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.850
So let's see how it's done.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.050
When you create a maven Web application,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.280
it comes with the indexed or JSP page,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.710
so we can make use off this,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.010
and by default it has the hello world takes populated with ash to tank.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.340
But I'm going to replace this with the form and the action is going to be,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.330
I'm going to give a part and down the land we're going to have some kind of mapping to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.550
forward that request to a particular controller logic.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.150
I'm going to provide the product name.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.450
And then I went to say hello.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.290
So down the line will have some kind of mapping,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.220
which says,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.290
Whenever we have a stripper request that has a following world or the string,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.640
we will have a particular controller logic to deal with it and the type off matter that I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.950
want to use to send this request his get method.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.150
And inside this foam,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:06.250
I'm going to have a couple off input fields and the type off this is going to be text.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.990
I'm also going to do a unique identify about the name.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.350
It's just simply going to be name.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.010
We're going to use this to sort off,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.290
read the user,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.250
enter data inside our controller logic,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.040
and finally,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.330
let's also introduced the submit.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:38.500
Nothing type is going to be submit control shift tough to give proper indentation,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.420
and that's it.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.760
On the JSP page.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.900
The next thing that we're going to do is to mention the dispatches all it inside who have

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.790
got XML file so that the continue can create an instance off dispatches All that when

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.110
needed and web dot xml file would be inside the Web band off directory.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:10.150
I want to replace this tag with Standard XML and according Tank So I'm going to say XML

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:21.580
washing is going to be say we're not hold and and according is going to be utf eight.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:31.350
This is a standard xml dag and hopefully the syntax is correct.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.100
Yep No,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.650
it is inside the web app tag I'm going to do declare our soul it.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.820
Okay,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:04:00.590
so that bag I'm going to point to the dispatcher soul it so let class the dispatcher Soviet

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:11.500
would recite in our dot spring framework Do make sure that you don't mess up with the names

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.500
.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:27.010
Has to be exact bat that dot So let Dart Dispatcher So let I'm going to give a unique

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:36.740
identifier for this dispatcher sold it but the tag So that name and you can give any name

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.850
off your choice dispatcher is what I'm going to call it.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:49.100
And then there's one more tact that went to introduce because dispatch facility is one such

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.030
solar that we wanted to initialize right when the containers starts,

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.550
or immediately after we deploy the project onto the container.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:08.580
And for that we have to use the stag load on start up and we're going to give some positive

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.450
value.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.970
So what this is is we wanted to preen ish lies,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:13.810
this particular soul,

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.450
that right when the container starts or when we deploy the product,

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:26.550
the next thing that we want to do is to provide the your mapping hard the Soviet mapping

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.750
hopes.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:37.550
I'm just simply going to copy this name,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:46.550
and we want to specify your pattern.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.340
I'm just simply going to put their slash,

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.610
and that just simply means we just wanted to forward all the requests to the dispatcher

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.880
soul.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.250
It No restrictions are Look under shift F to give proper indentation.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.480
That's it.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.690
Down Step number two.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.770
We will continue with step number three
