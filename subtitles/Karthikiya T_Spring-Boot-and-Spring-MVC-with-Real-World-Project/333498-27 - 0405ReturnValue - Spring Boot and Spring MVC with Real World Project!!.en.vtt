00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
Let's talk about various different written values that convey returned from the controller

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.250
methods again.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.400
All these were actually picked up from the official website spring dot Ivo,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.720
We're going to talk about this annotation.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.440
Basically,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.850
what the sanitation would I love you to do is that you can actually send back the history

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.610
Peabody,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:29.030
the response body and this region type responds entity would I love you to modify the

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.750
entire extra dippy response.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.130
The best way to understand it is with an example.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.560
So let me just quickly copy this and,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.870
uh,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.900
go to our code.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.300
And what I want to do is I want to add some Mr TP response headers,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.200
and then we'll take care off,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.250
creating the entire response around with status as well as the body.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.250
So for this,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.050
I'm going to do as should it be headers.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:18.450
I would just simply say headers New yesterday,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.430
beheaders.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:27.550
And then I'm just simply going to add list off hander's with key value pairs.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:36.670
I would just simply say custom hadn and use some value to it.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:48.180
And then we're going to add this headdress part of the response.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.640
And for that we're going to be needing this object and that's what we're going to write

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.240
down the matter.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.210
OK?

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.360
To set the status off the extra deeply response,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:12.550
I would add the headers and then finally,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.400
I would add some the body as well.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.980
You can type in any text off your choice.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.950
I'm just going to say custom mori text or whatever,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:42.080
and the return value is going to be same response entity off types drink added control,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.590
ship those so that even this classes now right here.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.710
Well,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:00.610
excuse to try before that.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.480
Let me just commend this out.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.730
That's freedom.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.350
Our application that's relaunch your application.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.430
Go to the browser and some Madeira close.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.350
And there you have it.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.380
Here is the response body.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.590
If you'd like to take a look at the headers,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.980
though,

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.650
you have to use one of the browser tools.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:33.090
And in Firefox you can use the stolen potatoes and go to network stab and then submit the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.750
request and you should be able to see all the requestion response headers.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.360
And here's the custom header that were just added,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.690
so this might come in handy at times.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.790
Although it is very rare,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:57.040
let me just quickly undo all those changes similarly can return.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.200
An instance office treated beheaders and,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.950
as the name suggests,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.050
that will let you return back has really beheaders with nobody.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.850
You can also written string and we've already seen an example of the same.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.050
This just means that you're sending back the name of the view.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.550
You can even send the view object itself.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:27.650
We've already seen an example off is in the model object.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.890
Although we don't explicitly send it,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.090
it would be sent implicitly to the view and again,

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.750
we're going to talk about these attributes.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.060
Pretty soon you can also send model and do you object that would just comprise both the

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.070
model data as well as the view name that you want to target,

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.970
why it would mean that you're not sending anything.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:53.660
Instead,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.610
you want to deal the response within your own logic.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.110
And we've already seen an example of the same as well with response.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:11.380
Writer were able to write back some response and all these types in here the four result

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.850
colorable etcetera will come in the picture when we talk about Ascend grown its requests.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:26.490
So you have to hold on to that point and finally can just send any other.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:33.340
It on value would just simply means you're ready returning a string or wide and this

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.990
treated outs have you name?

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.850
So that's about all the supported written types.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.590
You just have a look at this file and just have some understanding on what's going on in

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.650
the written values as well as the arguments.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.680
If any off the sounds confusing,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.430
then definitely down the land,

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.980
we will be covering majority off these annotations and written values.
