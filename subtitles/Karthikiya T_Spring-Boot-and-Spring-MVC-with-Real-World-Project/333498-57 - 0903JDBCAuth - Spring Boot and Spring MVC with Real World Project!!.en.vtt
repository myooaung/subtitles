00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
Okay,

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.330
let's take a look at a similar example,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.820
but without using in memory Data Store instead would be using Jerry BC in order to connect

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.750
to the database and store user data.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.910
And first obvious thing that you need to do is to include the driver has the dependence in

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.650
your palms or XML file and optionally can also include the date of his hope.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.380
Your choice.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.740
Well,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.180
ideally,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.680
this is a default database,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.550
and if include,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.940
springboard started very busy.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.810
Implicitly.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.240
It will also include the extra data store.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.750
But I've added it anyway,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.870
just so that you know that if you're using any other edibles and you have toe actually

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.300
explicitly include that date of his drivers in this manner.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.700
Apart from that,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.790
you also need to enabled us to database from your application properties file with this

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.900
particular property.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.770
And in addition to that,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.080
we also need to create a couple of tables in the database.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.050
One is to store the user data,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.150
and the other is authorities,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.750
meaning their roles.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.100
And depending on the database that you're using,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.310
you need to write queries that would work with that database.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.020
In my case,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.550
I'm using extra database and these queries would work.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.370
And whichever the database that you're using,

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.250
you have to have the following schemer.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.010
You have to have a table that has a couple of columns.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.850
One is user name and the other is password,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.700
and we also need to have one more column enabled that would describe whether this user is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.750
enabled or not.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.890
And you do have to have another table that has the following schema.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.580
Here's the name and authority where we would start the role.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.470
Information,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.840
along with Daddy,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.950
also need to have a foreign key constraint that would map with the user stable.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.050
I also populated the data or SQL file.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.850
We're in a manually sort off inserting couple of entries,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.450
so I'm trying to insert Sunder Data with a password.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.870
And again,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.840
we're not going toe.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.580
Use the password encryption.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.650
We're going to talk about password encryption in coming time for sure.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.180
And then the next instruction.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.890
We're adding data into authority stable,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.450
where we're specifying the role for cinder.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.520
Similarly,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.650
same is the case with Bob,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.790
but with these a role as a user and this time instead of conflict file,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.790
we're no longer using the in memory authentication,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.540
but we're using Jerry busy authentication and manual using very busy.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.510
You need to have data store configured since I'm using spring boot.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.070
The job off confident the data store has been done by the framework itself.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.590
But in because if you're not using spring boot and with a different database,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.830
he should manually configure the data source on your own.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.050
Apart from these were simply writing couple off queries.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.130
The first off,

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.700
which is for authentication in the second,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.250
is for authorization.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.950
Both will take you.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.690
The name has the input,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.000
and then we'll fish the record.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.820
So these queries should map with whatever the scheme of that you have in the skimmer or SQL

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.300
file.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.050
And not to mention that these two files should be with the same name and the boat should go

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.770
inside the Resources folder.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.010
Once you have all that in place,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.850
condone your application and the result would be similar to that off the previous example.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.250
So let me just run it.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:11.920
Let me clear the broads of cachet and try to access the page this time the possibilities as

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.750
DF and it worked.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.790
Everything works,

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.850
sounds previous one.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.350
Nothing different only that now amusing Jetta busy,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.050
not an in memory data store.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.770
And with little bit off tweaks,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.850
you can accomplish the same task using an organ framework like hibernate.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.250
But I'm not going to walk it through an example off using an organ framework,

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.110
because I'm going to demonstrating it as part off our project anyway.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.350
So when we get into learning creation off the entire area war project from scratch,

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.870
we are going to incorporate the security feature and will have authentication authorization

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.870
.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.730
Using an autumn tool.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.290
We're going to have a couple of tables with many to many mapping,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.450
etcetera.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.550
So all those complex scenarios would be demonstrated at that point of time.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.350
I hope it makes sense.
