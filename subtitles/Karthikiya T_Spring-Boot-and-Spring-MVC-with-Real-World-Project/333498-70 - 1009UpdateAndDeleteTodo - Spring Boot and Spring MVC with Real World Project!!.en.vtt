00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.910
Let's also explore update and delete methods.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:10.750
Here is a list of this page and for each and every entry we have bought those buttons.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.650
One is Rob date and the other is for delete.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.850
What's the clicks on update?

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.470
We're sending a request with the following your along with that.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.950
We're also sending the identify air that corresponds to that particular to do.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.120
So it would,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.450
uh,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.150
send a get request for this particular your girl.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.350
And inside here,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:50.940
we're trying to fetch and existing to do from the database with this instruction and then

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.190
trying to populate in the model object and then trying to render the page to do with this

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.650
object.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.350
What this means is,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.950
is a name session got timed out spring security feature.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.450
We want the data to be pre populated,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:24.400
and that we were sending back the same object pitch from the database back to the view said

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.650
would render the fields with that data.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.720
The ones after use the perform,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:37.890
summit it and click on Save It would send a request to the same you are and would end up in

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.250
this method whilst mapping,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.950
just as with adding it to do We do have some error checking here.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.230
If everything is well and good,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.870
we're trying to fetch the user from the context and they were trying to call.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.570
They have great to do matter,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.810
off to the service and internal.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.690
It's going to call the total reponse story save and internally have been.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.850
It will take her off updating this record.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.400
Finally,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.250
we're redirecting toe the list of those paid again.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:26.610
So that will see the updated information like so the delete functionality is pretty

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.540
straightforward.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.050
All we're trying to do is that we received the identifier for that particular to do item

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.050
and sending it as a perimeter.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.540
Ultimately,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.130
we're calling the deal.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.200
It matter off the to do repository,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.450
and we're passing the identifier.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.320
But before that,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.150
we're making sure that the recorder's indeed present disturbed.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.680
What any kind of exceptions?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.670
That's it on update and elect hope it makes sense
