00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
Let's get into understanding the view layer.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.410
There are certain things that will remain common in all the pages.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.240
For example,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.860
ones that use the logs in the user can actually see the header with all the navigation and

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.660
also the footer.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.660
And once after the user clicks on one of the links is the same stuff which will remain

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.260
common again.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.870
The same Hedda,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.890
same navigation and the same footer.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.070
Well,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.900
in such cases,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.910
it may not be wise to have the same court reflecting in each and every page,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.980
instead going to create some kind of a template or a fragment that weaken the SIM port in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.850
all the pages.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.150
So let's take a look at the GSB a file.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.880
Our JSP fragment files.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.810
Here's the one for the footer,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.790
so basically all the stuff that you're seeing in here well written in this manner.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.390
Similarly,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.940
we have a header field to introduce the head bag,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.050
which will also include the bootstrap CSS file.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.580
This will have all the styling aspect for our application and in order to use this,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.850
you have to include that dependence in your moving from the XML file,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.440
and you have to obey the products that the Bootstrap library would be imported into the

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.550
local depository,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.590
and you should be able to see that in the class part as well,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.550
inside your project.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.050
So here it is.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.820
This will have all the bootstrap library,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.040
the styling,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.550
Jake really etcetera.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.780
And here's the part that you to use to access its files.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.980
And since I made,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.250
despite all the jsp file,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.690
all this code would remain common very grind through this fragment initially.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.880
What?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.390
I mean,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.250
if you go to,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.890
for instance,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.390
the list produce jsp Page have included the stag header.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.450
So this essentially Samos,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.150
I copied the score into this file.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.220
Similarly,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.250
we also have another fragment called Navigation.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.520
I mean,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.010
all the navigation that you're seeing in here home to do is etcetera would come from that

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.690
fragment.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.850
And here's the cord for that.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.850
And I believe that you're never off esteem ill.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.940
I also believe that I don't have to walk you through which one of these tags They're pretty

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.950
straightforward.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.250
All the styling classes,

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.480
we're actually part of the bootstrap.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.260
CIA says that we had included hope it makes sense
