00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.690
Okay,

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.170
let's take a look at some of the arguments accepted by the controller methods.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.750
There are quite a few have actually picked them from the official documentation from spring

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.750
dot I will website and here are they?

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.620
I'm going to make this notes available for you to download so you can take a look at it as

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.660
well and feel free to experiment with some of these annotations.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.640
And sure enough,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.550
you don't need to know everything in here.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.650
In fact,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.930
in my entire experience,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.050
off working with spring framework up never,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.860
he used majority off.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.190
These have used only a few to the most,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.070
but I would use these annotations,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.550
which will talk about incoming videos.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.810
But you can have all these arguments.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.260
For example,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.550
you can have Web request as an argument,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.200
and isn't that object you can.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.000
Actually,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.660
you can actually access some request battle meters as well as some session attributes.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.890
We've already seen how we can access request para Meters using annotations,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.750
so that's an ultimate too to accessing using this object.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.190
Similarly,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.750
God,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.510
few other objects to start off to start off,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.750
use them inside your logic.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.450
He can also access the extra dipping method through which the request is coming from.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.940
Let me just quickly demonstrate this going to copy this and I mean just simply display the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.310
math.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.970
Adi's yesterday we met that that was used look under shift.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.350
Oh,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.090
to import the class.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.030
I'm just simply going to display it in here,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.950
just as so let's relaunch our application,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:07.350
go to the browser and test or whatever,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:18.490
and there you have it similarly can use all the other arguments that you're seeing in here

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.490
.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.020
For example,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.040
you can get access to the clients local.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.350
This is useful for internationalisation off your application.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.130
If the request is coming from,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.310
say,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.960
Japan,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.330
then you want to render your website in Japanese language stuff like that and get access to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.350
time zone.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.380
You could even get access to the input stream and thereby can access that it was body.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.750
And we have,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.190
ah,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.900
host off other annotations which will be exploring incoming videos.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.220
But just go through this file and sort of get some understanding on what are various

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.360
arguments accepted inside the controller methods,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.970
and it will be just something off me to talk about all these methods.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.650
It would just waste your time,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.050
so just have a look and get some idea about it,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.740
and you're not restricted to only have these arguments.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.050
You can have your own custom arguments.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.030
And that's what we have done in our previous example,

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.850
were able to get access to that domain object,

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.350
and we could access all the details entered by the user.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.500
So that explains hope it makes sense.
