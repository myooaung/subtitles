00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.335
Let's now installed PyCharm,

00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:07.845
which is one of the most popular IDEs for Python development.

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:12.720
Go to JetBrains website and download the Community Edition.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.480
Once downloaded, click on the installer.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:32.320
You can select the 64-bit launcher shortcuts that will be created on your desktop.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.190
Once finished, the Lord pyjamas.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.370
No need to import setting.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:08.930
Let's create a new project. Directly.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.730
Specify that, but

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.400
let's give the project a Mm.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.780
It takes some time to create a virtual environment.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.445
You'll get an isolated environment to manage your project dependencies.

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:43.920
By default, you'll get a main.out.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.700
We the main method.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.025
Click on this green arrow to run it down.

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:57.725
You can see the sample code output high Python pie chart in the console.

00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:00.960
Let's add another print statement.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.430
Relied a breakpoint.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.710
Simply click here,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.660
and then it would run up to that point.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.535
It printed up to that plane,

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:22.010
and you can click and execute the next line.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.920
So this is how we can debug python programming.
