00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.880
Python is a powerful programming language that can be used in many different ways,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.395
in many different areas.

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:10.980
You can build a wide variety of applications using Python.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.440
Pretty much everything that you've seen the real world.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.245
It could be website or an application,

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:17.715
or be Geta, spark,

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:19.830
AI and machine learning blockchain.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.355
All kinds of applications can be built using Python.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:26.385
Python is a high-level programming language.

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:30.990
That means you do not have to deal with low-level machine specific details.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.895
It's an interpreted language.

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:34.650
It doesn't require completion.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.110
You can write the code and run it in any Python.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.810
And moment, python is dynamically typed.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.445
That also makes it very concise and readable.

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:45.785
Dynamic languages have smaller source footprint.

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:47.795
Because Python is interpreted,

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:51.740
it provides powerful prototyping and light coating opportunity.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.020
You can log into any Python environment,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.105
start coding and you'll see the output.

00:00:56.105 --> 00:01:00.780
You do not need to compiler create jagged like many other programming languages.
