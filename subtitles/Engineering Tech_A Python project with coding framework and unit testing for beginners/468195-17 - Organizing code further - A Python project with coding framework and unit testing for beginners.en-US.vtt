00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:08.490
Earlier we saw how to import ingestion persist modules within the driver program.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.780
Now we'll create a subdirectory and store this ingestion persist file.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.950
And let's see what happens.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.510
We'll call it processor.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.720
Now let's move ingest and perceived or pipe to that directory.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.870
Ihm prompts for refactoring. Let's do that.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.230
Now when we click on driver that we can see the import statement has

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.300
been changed to from processor import, persist or ingest.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.195
Earlier when the files within the same directory,

00:00:56.195 --> 00:01:00.095
we're importing them by just giving the file name without the extension.

00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:02.885
But now that they've been moved with subdirectory,

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:05.840
we have to do from processor import persist.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.050
That is the way to import files from another directory.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.880
Let's run it to see if everything is okay.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.750
Now persistent in just models are not finding the login config file,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.615
and they would also not find the file processor IANA.

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:24.840
Let's move the entire resources directory under the processor folder.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.830
And we'll refactor again.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.570
Now we didn't the driver login.com is getting

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.020
exist with relative directory starting from the root directory.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.390
And if we go to index.php,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.845
there we would see relative directory starting from the processor directory.

00:01:47.845 --> 00:01:50.600
Let's see if it runs fine or not.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.730
We again got the same error.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.600
Now let's hard processor directory here

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.320
also will do the same change we didn't purchase dot py.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.730
Now wherever we have locked veiled reference,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.020
the relative path from the project root directory should be used. We'll run it now.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.020
Logging error has gone away,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.725
but we are seeing an error that data is fixed doesn't exist.

00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:31.940
So let's update the directory name for the INI file also.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.800
So we've changed it in parses dot py.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.410
That is the only place where it is getting referred, will run now.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.580
Now the program, given that the unique key violation happened.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.835
So let's fix that.

00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:54.600
We would have a different key for our course.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.575
So this time it ran find these or we can organize your code further.

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:09.170
You can have all your Python files in the source file under

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.020
one directory so that you can easily package it in,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.250
take it to another environment.
