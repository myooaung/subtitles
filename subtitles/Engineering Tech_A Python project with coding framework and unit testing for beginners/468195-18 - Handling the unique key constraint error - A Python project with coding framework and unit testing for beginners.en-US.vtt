00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.390
Let's now check how to handle

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.950
the unique key constraint error that we are getting every time we run this program,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.940
we are inserting a record to the course catalog table with the course ID,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.250
which is hard-coded in the program.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.815
There are multiple ways to handle it.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:20.190
One of the easy ways is to take the max course ID then

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.150
incremented by one and the new SSID to insert a new record.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.530
Let's see how it can be done.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.080
Before inserting a record,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.480
we can execute the select query to get the max course ID.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.850
And after that, we can do a fetch one,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.115
which would return us one row.

00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:42.260
So in this case, the select query is going to return

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.795
only one row and that would get returned.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:46.805
And that would be in a tuple.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:48.350
And to extract the value,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.905
we can get the first element of the tuple.

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:56.060
Let's store it in a variable called max course ID.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.650
We'll print that value.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.660
And while inserting a record,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.000
instead of hard-coding, will say max course ID plus 1.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.520
Let's run it and see what happens.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.695
It says cannot concatenate integer to string.

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:23.030
So while printing, we need to convert this max course ID,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.460
which is an integer to string.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.800
We'll run it again.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.840
Now it runs fine.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.900
And a new course ID 7 has been inserted.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.725
If we run it again. Another record with course 88 is when inserted.

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:44.510
So this is one way to handle

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.130
the unique key constraint data while inserting records to a database table.
