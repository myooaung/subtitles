00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:05,510
Now it's time to talk about the top shortcuts helping in the design process.
1

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,090
Shortcut #18, Eye-dropper + left kick.
2

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,740
Eyedropper is a powerful tool which can help you to quickly match colors on your slide.
3

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,720
This is how it works.
4

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,980
First, I select the shape I want to assign a new color to.
5

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,020
I click on the Shape Fill command and select an Eyedropper tool.
6

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,650
As you can see, my mouse pointer changes.
7

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,900
As I move my pointer around,
8

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,870
a life preview of the color I'm pointing at appears.
9

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,840
Now, I'm going to click on this color here, and it's immediately applied to the selected shape.
10

11
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,250
Now, let's match the fill color of the shape to a specific color in a picture.
11

12
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:04,420
I again click on the shape fill command, and select an eye dropper tool. Let's click here, for example.
12

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,960
And this is the trick
13

14
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,610
not many people know about.
14

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:16,600
You can match colors from elsewhere on your computer screen just after selecting an object and choosing
15

16
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:22,450
an eye dropper tool, click and hold the left mouse button and drag like this.
16

17
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:30,190
Now you can move outside the PowerPoint window, but the color will still preview and be matched.
17

18
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,220
This time I want to get this dark PowerPoint orange.
18

19
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:41,770
This trick can be extremely helpful if you work on the client presentation, for example, and you
19

20
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,840
need to pick up colors from the website.
20

21
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,610
Now, I'm going to jump to this Skype website.
21

22
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,600
I select the shape, I choose an eyedropper to.
22

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,530
Left click and drag and...
23

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,560
I want to choose this shade of blue. Perfect!
24

25
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,770
Shortcut #19, Alt Shift C.
25

26
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,900
In PowerPoint, you can copy animation from one object to another by using the animation painter.
26

27
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,820
What is important,
27

28
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,710
this tool also applies animation settings uniformly to other objects
28

29
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,540
with just one click. On this slide, I have two animations.
29

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,670
The first one is a spin animation, which turns the five segments circle.
30

31
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,510
Inside it,
31

32
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,520
I have a text with the Fade effect.
32

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,320
What I want to do is applying the very same animations onto the second slide.
33

34
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,820
This is how I can do it quickly with the Alt Shift C shortcut.
34

35
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,660
I select the circle first, press 
35

36
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,120
Alt Shift C,
36

37
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,570
and as you can see, my cursor changes into a little brush.
37

38
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,320
I jump to the second slide, and apply.
38

39
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,630
Now, let's copy the second animation, which is applied onto the textbox.
39

40
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,620
I press Alt Shift C. I jump to the second slide, and apply.
40

41
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,310
I press Shift F5 to see the final effect.
41

42
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,740
Here comes slide number one,
42

43
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,690
and slide number two.
43

44
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,360
Shortcut #20 Alt F10
44

45
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,220
Once you've inserted shapes, text boxes, pictures or other objects, you can open the Selection Pane
45

46
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,750
to keep track of them all.
46

47
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,030
Just press Alt F10.
47

48
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,100
What is important,
48

49
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,390
the objects listed in the Pane are in the visual stacking order.
49

50
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,600
The most recently inserted object is at the top of the list.
50

51
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,410
You can also easily change the look of the list.
51

52
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,480
For example, you can hide objects by clicking on an open eye item.
52

53
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,840
You can make objects visible again.
53

54
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,280
You can change the order by using these buttons here,
54

55
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,390
or change the names by double clicking and typing.
55

56
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,450
For the purpose of this lesson, I created this group of three sites.
56

57
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:59,870
They all have a green row header on the left, map and a text box with some geographical data.
57

58
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,060
Slide number four combines all of them together.
58

59
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:11,150
What makes this last slide different is that I used two types of animations here: the entrance animation,
59

60
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,380
which is 'Fade' and exit animation, which is 'Split'.
60

61
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,730
Let's press Shift F5 to see how it works.
61

62
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,390
OK.
62

63
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,270
So I click,
63

64
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,940
and Europe appears. I click again,
64

65
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,940
it disappears.
65

66
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,190
I click and Asia appears.
66

67
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,350
I click again, it disappears. And the same goes for Africa.
67

68
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,420
OK, and the presentation ends, I press Escape to go back.
68

69
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,220
What if I decide to change the color of my maps?
69

70
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,660
I have good news.
70

71
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,980
We don't need to move the objects and we don't need to ungrouped them.
71

72
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,770
By the way, ungrouping destroys the animations.
72

73
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,640
Actually, the best and the quickest method is pressing Alt F10 to jump to the Selection Pane.
73

74
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,830
Now, I select map number one from the list.
74

75
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,170
Let's change the field color directly from my quick access toolbar.
75

76
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,370
I will change it into green.
76

77
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,380
Now, I do the same thing
77

78
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,490
for the map number two.
78

79
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,610
And map number three.
79

80
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,040
Now, let's press Shift F5
80

81
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,490
to see how it works.
81

82
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,000
Perfect!
82

83
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,410
Everything is fine.
