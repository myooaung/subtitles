00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,270
Now it's time to create a Quote Slide.
1

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,450
This is the effect
2

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,610
we want to achieve.
3

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,600
As a first step, let's copy a picture of a woman from this file.
4

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,720
Once it's done, let's switch to the Acme presentation. Here,
5

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:29,690
I'm going to create a blank slide by clicking over here and choosing the Blank layout.
6

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,410
Now, let's paste the photo by pressing Ctrl V shortcut.
7

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,440
I would like to group two images by pressing Ctrl G.
8

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,510
Now I'm going to make two pictures
9

10
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,520
black and white.
10

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,770
I navigate to the picture format tab, I choose 'Color',
11

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,920
and click on this icon here.
12

13
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,530
As a next step, I'm going to create a square.
13

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,530
I choose a rectangle from the list.
14

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,880
I press Shift and drag like this to make it proportional.
15

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,870
I'm going to change the line width into six points,
16

17
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,690
and change the color into gray.
17

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,560
Now it's time to rotate the square.
18

19
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,170
I'm going to click at the arrow here,
19

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,840
and drag like this.
20

21
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,520
As the next step, I create a text box.
21

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:38,930
I put
22

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,910
the following text inside it:
23

24
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,290
We value our customers'  success
24

25
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,250
as much as our own.
25

26
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,990
This slide is about marketing
26

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,640
of course.
27

28
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:08,730
Now, let's create the second textbox where I will put the name of their quotes author. I type Emily
28

29
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,360
Jones.
29

30
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,570
Head of Customer Support.
30

31
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,670
Now I'm going to change the font sizes into 42,
31

32
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,730
and 34.
32

33
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,390
I also align the text inside the second placeholder left,
33

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,400
and change the font color into gray.
34

35
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,640
Now it's time to create a third placeholder and put the quote sign inside it.
35

36
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,220
OK, I will change the font size into 300 points,
36

37
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,320
and change the font color into yellow.
37

38
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,360
As the next step, I create a white rectangle,
38

39
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,640
remove the gray outline and place it here.
39

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,930
I'm also going to rotate it like this.
40

41
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,020
Now, I bring my quote sign to the front,
41

42
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,350
and place it here on my white rectangle.
42

43
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,800
OK, great.
43

44
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,430
I also send the grouped photos to front,
44

45
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,230
and as the last step, I adjust the position of my slide elements a little bit.
45

46
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:18,830
Perfect!
46

47
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,420
The slide is ready.
