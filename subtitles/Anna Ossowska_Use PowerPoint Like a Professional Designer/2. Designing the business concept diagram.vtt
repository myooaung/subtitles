00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:07.960
In this movie, we will use the Merge Shape command to build a cool concept diagram inside the Acme template.
1

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.590
I'm going to create a new slide.
2

3
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.290
I placed my cursor over here,
3

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.090
and press Ctrl M shortcut. A blank layout appears automatically because that has been my last choice.
4

5
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.380
This time, however, I want to use the Title Only layout.
5

6
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.360
As the first thing, let's create a title.
6

7
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.020
I'm going to type.
7

8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.960
'What makes us different?'
8

9
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.340
This slide is going to be about the corporate values of the Acme Company.
9

10
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.130
Now, let's create the first textbooks by clicking at this icon here and dragging.
10

11
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.410
I'm going to type 'Engineering with passion'.
11

12
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.370
I also want this textbooks to be wider.
12

13
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.200
I navigate to the Shape Format tab and change the width 
13

14
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.450
into 9.5 points.
14

15
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.860
Now, let's format the text.
15

16
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.490
I change the font size into 18 points.
16

17
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.980
And apply bold by pressing Ctrl B shortcut.
17

18
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.110
To make this text even more distinctive, I will create a thick line and put it underneath it.
18

19
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.840
I choose the line from the list, press Shift and drag to make it perfectly straight.
19

20
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.620
I also change the color into yellow,
20

21
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.290
increase in line width,
21

22
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.250
and to change that with into 9.5 points.
22

23
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.580
OK, now I will use the Quick Tools add-in to align the objects.
23

24
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.320
Now it's time to create a description which will be put underneath it.
24

25
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.650
I navigate the Quick Access Toolbar,
25

26
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.610
I chose this command over here
26

27
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.540
and drag. I align and adjust its width manually to already created header box.
27

28
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.220
Next, I'm going to type:
28

29
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.550
'We believe in innovation
29

30
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.910
to help companies solve today's challenges.'
30

31
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.830
OK, let's select everything inside this textbox by pressing
31

32
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.920
Ctrl A shortcut and change that font size into 18 points just to be consistent.
32

33
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.820
Once I have this first headerbox and description ready, I'm going to group them by using the loop
33

34
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.000
selection and pressing Ctrl D shortcut.
34

35
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.830
Now I create copies by pressing Ctrl D two times.
35

36
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.790
I'm going to adjust the position of these elements across this slide.
36

37
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.740
Now, I press Shift to add the third group to my selection and distribute everything horizontally
37

38
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.200
using the native alignment tools.
38

39
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.970
I will also position the second group of shapes on the top of my slide.
39

40
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.520
Next, I select everything
40

41
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.390
once again,
41

42
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.530
and press Ctrl Shift G to ungroup.
42

43
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.290
It is a good moment to change
43

44
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.290
text inside other placeholders.
44

45
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.640
Let's start with this one.
45

46
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.620
Next, I'm going to type:
46

47
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.020
'We work as one team.
47

48
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.790
Both with each other and our clients.'
48

49
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.130
And the next one:
49

50
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:48.080
Next, I'm going to type: 'With average NPS score of over 90%
50

51
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.520
we are considered a key strategic technology partner.'
51

52
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.780
Perfect, ones that textual content is ready,
52

53
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.780
it's time to create a concepts diagram.
53

54
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.680
Let's first draw a triangle.
54

55
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.910
I press Shift key to make it proportional.
55

56
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.860
I also change the fill color into yellow,
56

57
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.780
and get rid of outlines.
57

58
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.260
As the next step,
58

59
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.670
I'm going to cut smaller shape from the bigger shape.
59

60
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.130
This is how I do this.
60

61
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.100
I create a copy of this yellow triangle by pressing Ctrl D shortcut.
61

62
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.300
Once the copied shape is selected, I want to make it a little bit smaller and keep the shapes proportions
62

63
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.350
at the same time.
63

64
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.800
So, I press Shift and Ctrl key, and drag to the inside like this.
64

65
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.280
Perfect!
65

66
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.960
Next, I'm going to change the smaller shape's color into gray just to see what's going on here.
66

67
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.710
And now let's align it center and middle with the bigger yellow triangle using the Quick Tools macro's.
67

68
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.320
Let's also match the smaller object a little bit by using Ctrl
68

69
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.550
and down arrow key.
69

70
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.140
Once two shapes are positioned one into another,
70

71
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.740
it's time to use the 'Subtract' tool.
71

72
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.670
My aim is to cut gray shape from the yellow one.
72

73
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.670
So, I select the bigger shape first,
73

74
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.680
I press Shift key to select the second one,
74

75
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.880
I navigate to my Quick Access Toolbar,
75

76
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.070
Choose Merge Shape tool command and click at 'Subtract'.
76

77
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.600
Perfect, as you can see, the selection order matters here.
77

78
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.060
It is important to select the bigger shape first.
78

79
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:12.170
Now it's time to break the triangle into three, evenly parts with some help of 'Fragment' tool.
79

80
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.400
First, I create a rectangle.
80

81
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.540
I apply the height of 12 centimeters and the width of 1 centimeter.
81

82
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:30.310
Now, let's align it center and middle with the triangle using the Quick Tools add-in.
82

83
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.600
As the next step, I press Ctrl D to create a copy.
83

84
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.850
Now I want to rotate my shape 90 degrees.
84

85
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.890
I can make a good use of Alt and right arrow key.
85

86
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.120
This shortcut rotates with 15 degrees increments,
86

87
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.700
so let's do a small calculation:
87

88
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.750
90 divided by 15 gives us 6,
88

89
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:01.690
it means that I must press right arrow key 6 times to rotate my shape 90 degrees.
89

90
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:03.600
Let's do this!
90

91
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.290
Now, I'm going to align this shape center with my yellow triangle.
91

92
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.020
I am also going to adjust this height a little bit.
92

93
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.410
I just don't want it to cover the peak of this triangle.
93

94
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.620
In a moment, you will see why.
94

95
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.090
OK, now it's time to use the 'Fragment' tool.
95

96
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.820
I select my yellow triangle first, then I press Shift and select two rectangles,
96

97
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.380
I navigate to the Merge Shape Tool command.
97

98
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.220
and choose 'Fragment'.
98

99
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.810
As you can see, this tool breaks all selected objects into several pieces.
99

100
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.210
Now, let's get rid of those which are unnecessary.
100

101
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.740
A loop selection might come in handy here.
101

102
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.410
Perfect!
102

103
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.530
Right now, I have three, independent shapes.
103

104
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.030
Next, I'm going to group all three parts of triangle,
104

105
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.850
and align them center with the headerbox on the top.
105

106
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.180
I also use Ctrl to gently nudge an object.
106

107
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.510
Perfect,
107

108
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.970
this slide is almost ready!
108

109
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.810
Now, we will place three icons within our concepts diagram.
109

110
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.540
To insert an icon, I navigate to the Insert tab and choose Icons.
110

111
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:51.120
Here you can scroll through the vector graphics or jump to the category by clicking a name in
111

112
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.260
the navigation pane.
112

113
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.170
You can also search by putting the tag here.
113

114
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.600
This is what I'm going to do.
114

115
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.250
Let's start with finding a nice icon for effective collaboration.
115

116
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.760
I'm going to type 'collaborate'.
116

117
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.750
And I really like this icon here showing you the group of people.
117

118
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:20.690
Once it's done, I'm going to search for the second icon, which should well correspond with 'engineering
118

119
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.410
with fashion'.
119

120
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:27.510
Actually, I would like to find something which is related to the creativity maybe.
120

121
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.410
Let's type it.
121

122
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.290
OK.
122

123
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.300
I really like this
123

124
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.070
icon here.
124

125
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.950
Please keep in mind that it's good to choose icons which are very similar in terms of style.
125

126
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.690
My first icon showing the group of people has very thin lines.
126

127
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.670
Therefor, choosing this one as the second option might not be the best idea.
127

128
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:57.230
OK, now it's time to find the third icon for 'client centric approach'.
128

129
00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.000
Let's type
129

130
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.230
'client' maybe.
130

131
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:06.720
No, I will try something different, maybe 'central'.
131

132
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:09.740
OK.
132

133
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.770
This one looks good.
133

134
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.400
And as this button informs me, I have three elements selected.
134

135
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.420
Let's place them on the slide.
135

136
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.570
Great!
136

137
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:29.370
Now, I would like to format those icons a little bit. I change the color into the very dark gray.
137

138
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.370
Let's also reduce the size by pressing the Shift key and dragging.
138

139
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.180
Remember, I want to keep the proportions as they are.
139

140
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:47.230
Now it's time to align each icon to the little triangle to which it belongs.
140

141
00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.040
I will start with the 'effective collaboration' icon.
141

142
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.620
The Quick Tools add-in helps me a lot.
142

143
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.340
I do the same for other items.
143

144
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:45.740
As the next step, I'm going to create two lines which will visually separate my three rectangles from
144

145
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.490
one another.
145

146
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.970
I choose a line from the list,
146

147
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.270
I press Shift and drag.
147

148
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.080
Now I change the color into dark gray,
148

149
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.900
and align properly.
149

150
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.670
Now, I copy the line by pressing Ctrl D shortcut,
150

151
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.670
and I rotate it using Alt and right arrow key shortcut.
151

152
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.490
I press the arrow 6 times.
152

153
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.430
Next, let's reduce the height a little bit by pressing Shift and dragging.
153

154
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.600
I'm going to align it center,
154

155
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:42.970
and middle.
