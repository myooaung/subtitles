00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.180
We did a lot of work here, and before we save our progress, I would like to change the template name
1

2
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.510
from 'Office Theme' into something different.
2

3
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.030
If for any reason, you do not see the current Slide Master name, right
3

4
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.010
mouse click on the bottom statue's bar,
4

5
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.280
and check the 'Theme'.
5

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.350
OK, now let's rename the template.
6

7
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.470
I make sure my Parent Slide is selected,
7

8
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.660
and I click at the 'Rename' button.
8

9
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.520
As I have mentioned before, the naming process is very important, especially if you have a lot of
9

10
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.640
templates on your computer or you assume that many people will have access to your template in the future.
10

11
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.870
I always make sure that I give my template, color palettes and fonts the very same name.
11

12
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.660
It's all about being consistent.
12

13
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.430
I strongly advise you to make it a habit because it can save you a lot of time searching for .potx
13

14
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.680
and .thmx files created in the past.
14

15
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.240
This is how I create template names.
15

16
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.570
I usually put the company name in the beginning,
16

17
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.900
in our case, this is a fictional company called Acme.
17

18
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.060
Then I put _, and the last element is the information about my slide size.
18

19
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.070
I use wide-screen here, so I put 16.9.
19

20
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.290
OK, I have my template properly named.
20

21
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.890
This is a moment for creating a folder where I will put all my template files.
21

22
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.900
Let's name it Acme_16.9 as well.
22

23
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.500
To save a file as .potx navigate to the file,
23

24
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.120
and choose a .potx extension from the list.
24

25
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.790
Please keep in mind that files with .potx extension always represent Microsoft PowerPoint template presentations.
25

26
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.370
Perfect,
26

27
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.970
we did a great job!
27

28
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.770
Now it's time to format the Child Layouts.
