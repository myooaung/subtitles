In this movie, I will show you how to use a Zoom feature in PowerPoint 2019.
1

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,990
For the purpose of this lesson, I created this short presentation about the nuclear power plants.
2

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,320
It consists of four slides.
3

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:26,330
The first one provides the audience with the general information regarding the nuclear power plants
4

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:35,790
and its role in the global energy sector. Slide number two, three and four are more specific and give
5

6
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,530
an overview
6

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,650
which countries have the biggest amount of nuclear power plants and are generating the most nuclear
7

8
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,100
power.
8

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,110
And this is the zoom effect
9

10
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,480
I will help you to create from scratch.
10

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,190
Right now, I am on my core slide, which is slide number one.
11

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:00,880
And as you can see, by clicking on the little screenshots here at the bottom, I actually can go from
12

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,660
one place in my presentation to another in any order
13

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,350
I like.
14

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:14,370
In other words, the 'Insert Zoom' tool allows me to skip ahead or revisit places of my slideshow without
15

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,890
interrupting the flow of my presentation.
16

17
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,800
Isn't it great?
17

18
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,330
Now, let me show you how you can build this nice animation from scratch.
18

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,930
The very first thing you need to do whenever you use the 'Insert Zoom' feature is finalizing all the slides
19

20
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,790
you need for your visualization.
20

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,250
Next, you need to choose the slide where you want to have the Zoom effect.
21

22
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,620
In this case, this will be slide number one, the core slide of this presentation.
22

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,190
To create a Zoom effect, I navigate to the Insert tab and under the Link category
23

24
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,990
I select the 'Slide Zoom'.
24

25
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,700
Here I get a pop up that shows all the slides in my presentation.
25

26
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,710
In this case, I'm going to select slide number two, three and four,
26

27
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,870
and click on the Insert button.
27

28
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,470
What I get here are actually links to slide number two, three and four.
28

29
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,450
What is important, if I make any changes on the original version of any of those screenshots,
29

30
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,640
the changes are going to be reflected in here.
30

31
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,780
Let's take a look!
31

32
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,730
I will go to the slide number two and move it up to the bottom of the slide.
32

33
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,490
If I go back to slide number one, you can see that the screenshot updates automatically.
33

34
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,140
Let's press Ctrl Z to undo.
34

35
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:01,170
Next, I'm going to adjust the size of screenshots and distribute them on slide area.
35

36
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,240
OK, now let's jump to the slide show to see how the default Zoom effect looks like. I press
36

37
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,160
Shift and F5 button.
37

38
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:49,290
If I click on the first screenshot, you can see that it zooms in to the second slide.
38

39
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,440
If I click again, I jump to the first slide and so on and so forth.
39

40
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,240
Now my presentation ends.
40

41
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,860
Please keep in mind that you don't need to rely upon the default settings and you can fully control
41

42
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,480
how the Zoom effect works.
42

43
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,440
For example, I'm going to modify the duration of my Zoom effect.
43

44
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,490
It seems to me that it's too fast.
44

45
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,230
The changed that,
45

46
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,040
I select the first screenshot,
46

47
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:24,680
I navigate to the Zoom tab, and change the default duration into two seconds.
47

48
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,980
Please keep in mind that you cannot select all the screenshots and modify that duration at once, each
48

49
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,340
and every item must be modified independently.
49

50
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,210
Another option you should know about is controlling the Zoom background color.
50

51
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,260
In this particular case, I use a dark, gray background for all the slides.
51

52
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,300
This is how my Slide Master is programmed,
52

53
00:04:52,710 --> 00:05:00,480
and it's hard to notice any aesthetic problem here. But, if I make an exception and insert the black
53

54
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,350
rectangle only on my first slide, and then sent it to back,
54

55
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:17,170
you can notice that sometimes it might be vital to make the mini slides' background transparent just
55

56
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,530
to get rid of the fill color difference.
56

57
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:26,750
You can easily do this by navigating to the Zoom tab and selecting 'Zoom Background'.
57

58
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,430
OK.
58

59
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,490
That was purely informational,
59

60
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,520
and in this case, we don't need to use this option.
60

61
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,710
So, I press Ctrl Z to undo and I will remove the black rectangle as well.
61

62
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,260
I also want to show you how to modify the ending of the Zoom Effect.
62

63
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:52,700
In other words, I want my PowerPoint to always go back to my core Zoom slide and never show me the
63

64
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,470
black screen informing the audience that the presentation ends.
64

65
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,330
I can make those changes here under the Zoom options.
65

66
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,360
I select the last mini slide and I activate 'Return to Zoom' option.
66

67
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,480
Now, let's press Shift F5 to check how it works.
67

68
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,830
I click on the first mini slide.
68

69
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,410
As you can see, PowerPoint zooms in, I click again, and it automatically jumps to the second slide,
69

70
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,780
I click again to jump to the third one.
70

71
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,840
And as I click the fourth time, I go back to the main zoom slide.
71

72
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:39,960
As you can see Insert Zoom feature is very easy to use, and it makes slides more dynamic and
72

73
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,520
exciting to the audience.
73

74
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,970
In the next movie, I will show you how to apply Zoom effect onto the bigger parts of your presentation.
74

75
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,670
Don't miss it!
