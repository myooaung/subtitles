00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,480
In this movie, I'm going to format, in my opinion, the most important and useful Child Layout, which
1

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,070
I need in almost all of my templates.
2

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,770
These are: Title Slide layout,  Title Only,
3

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,340
Section Header and Blank Layout.
4

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,350
As the first step, I'm going to change the order of my layouts
5

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,530
a little bit. Title Only is likely to be used more often than the Section Header layout.
6

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,940
And that's the reason why it should be put as the second on the list.
7

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,660
Let's start with formatting
8

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,450
the Title Slide layout. This one is going to look a little bit different from other layouts.
9

10
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,530
I want to remove here some of the elements we have already added to the Parent Slide layout.
10

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,180
I'm talking about these two lines on the top and bottom of my slide.
11

12
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,780
There's simply no use of keeping them here.
12

13
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,670
So I navigate to the Slide Master tab and select this box:
13

14
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,210
'Hide Background Graphics'.
14

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,160
As you can see, everything that is not the placeholder already set on the Parent Slide layout is
15

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,270
going to disappear.
16

17
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,730
Of course, you can easily add it back, like this.
17

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,600
OK, I select this checkbox once again.
18

19
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,410
As a next step, I'm going to insert an image which will correspond with my current yellowish color
19

20
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:38,950
palette.
20

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,550
I navigate to my folder,
21

22
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,840
press Ctrl C to copy,
22

23
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,240
and Ctrl V to paste.
23

24
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,680
As a reminder, all of the files I'm using for the template creation are ready to be downloaded directly
24

25
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,180
from the course website.
25

26
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,450
Once I have this image inserted, I would like to change
26

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,340
its dimension.
27

28
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:15,910
I wanted to cover exactly 3/4 of my slide area. It can be done very quickly, just select a picture,
28

29
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,950
navigate the 'Picture Format' tab,
29

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,950
choose 'Crop',
30

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,200
navigate to the 'Aspect Ratio',  
31

32
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,540
and select 3:4.
32

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,030
As you can see, this method is fast and helps you to be precise when changing picture dimension.
33

34
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,070
Once it's done,
34

35
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,310
let's align the picture to the right by using the native alignment tools added to the Quick Access Toolbar.
35

36
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,720
Now, I'm going to send that picture to back by using this button here.
36

37
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,440
Now it's time to edit the placeholders.
37

38
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,430
I'm going to type 'Click to add title'.
38

39
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,930
And 'Click to add subtitle'.
39

40
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,280
Once it's done, I align text in this placeholder top, left
40

41
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,740
and change font size to 54.
41

42
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,810
As the next step, I select the second placeholder, which will be my subtitle.
42

43
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,790
This time I align text middle and change the font size to 20 points.
43

44
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,600
I also want to change the dimension of two placeholders.
44

45
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,430
I select the first one,
45

46
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,340
next, I navigate to the 'Shape Format' tab to put the exact values and be more precise.
46

47
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:11,280
I want the height of my title to be 5 centimeters and the width 22 centimeters.
47

48
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,530
For the subtitle, on the other hand, I type 1 centimeter,
48

49
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,320
and 19 centimeters.
49

50
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,680
I also want to take care of the text style.
50

51
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,550
I'm going to use uppercase to emphasize the presentation title and make it even more visible.
51

52
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,420
Let's use the first standard method.
52

53
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:46,590
I select the text, navigate to the 'Home' tab and change the text case into uppercase.
53

54
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,850
Now, I'm going to check out if the changes were properly applied.
54

55
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,030
So, I close the Slide Master,
55

56
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,330
I reset the Title Slide, which I have inserted previously,
56

57
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,130
and I type something inside the placeholder.
57

58
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,950
As you can see, it doesn't work.
58

59
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,500
Please keep in mind that if you want to change the sentence case inside your Slide Master's placeholder,
59

60
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,650
always do that in the following way:
60

61
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,720
navigated this Slide Master,
61

62
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,310
select the text inside the placeholder,
62

63
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,490
right mouse click,
63

64
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,470
Choose 'Font'
64

65
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,960
and check 'All Caps' option.
65

66
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,550
We can also change the font style into bold.
66

67
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,620
OK.
67

68
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,180
Let's check it out.
68

69
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,760
I close the Slide Master,
69

70
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,770
and click 'Reset' slide to bring back the changes I've just made.
70

71
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,440
As you can see, it works fine.
71

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,030
Now let's go back to the Slide Master
72

73
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,380
by pressing Shift and Normal View icon.
73

74
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,820
The next thing I am going to do is adding the first design element here on my Title Slide.
74

75
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,320
I'm going to draw a white rectangle and remove the outline.
75

76
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,790
Now, I navigate to the 'Shape Format' tab,
76

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,890
and sent this element backward so that it no longer covers my placeholders.
77

78
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:38,230
I'm also going to change its dimension into 8 centimeters and 24 centimeters.
78

79
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,600
Now I'm going to position it in the middle of my slide using the native alignment tools.
79

80
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,780
Now it's time to position the placeholders.
80

81
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,180
Like this.
81

82
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,320
I'm also going to add the second design element, which is a thin yellow rectangle.
82

83
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,820
I remove an outline,
83

84
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,150
and drag like this to give it the same height as the white rectangle.
84

85
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,850
on the right hand side. As you can see, my guidelines help me a lot.
85

86
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,700
Once I have it, I position it next to the white shape.
86

87
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:55,350
Now, I select everything by using the loop selection and position it on my slide area like this.
87

88
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,580
I also want to have the company's logo over here.
88

89
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,940
I'm going to copy one from my picture folder.
89

90
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,370
I press control C to copy.
90

91
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,580
And Ctrl V to paste.
91

92
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:23,130
Now, I'm going to shrink it a little bit by pressing Ctrl Shift and dragging like this.
92

93
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,380
Once it's done, let's position the image properly.
93

94
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,550
Perfect!
94

95
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:43,320
The last design element I went to place on the slide layout is a small yellow rectangle in the upper
95

96
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,160
right corner.
96

97
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,560
I want it to look like this.
97

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,360
OK.
98

99
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,990
Let's start with creating a square.
99

100
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,820
I choose the rectangle from the Shape list,
100

101
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,440
press Shift to make it proportional,
101

102
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,730
and I drag.
102

103
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,990
Let's change the line color into yellow.
103

104
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,890
and line width into 4.5 points.
104

105
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,760
I also want to get rid of the white fill color.
105

106
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:25,860
Now I want to transform that shape a little bit. What I have in mind is opening 
106

107
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,360
the shape's path.
107

108
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,850
This is how I do it.
108

109
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,010
I make sure the shape is selected.
109

110
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,940
I click over here at the Edit Points command.
110

111
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,200
I place the cursor over the angle
111

112
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,190
I want to open.
112

113
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,550
and as you can see, cursor changes into a four directional arrow.
113

114
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,390
I right click to bring up the contextual menu,
114

115
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,990
and from this menu, I choose the 'Open Path' option.
115

116
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,170
Now, I would like to remove these two lines.
116

117
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,970
To do that, I place the cursor over there first line,
117

118
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,880
right mouse click,
118

119
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,150
and choose
119

120
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,330
'Delete Point'.
120

121
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,110
Now, I repeat the same action for the second line.
121

122
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,740
Try to click precisely on the line you would like to modify.
122

123
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:26,530
If you click on the slide background, for example, the 'Open Path' options will close automatically.
123

124
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,300
OK, once it's done, I position this square in the upper right corner of the slide.
124

125
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,170
And I use Ctrl key and arrows to gently nudge the object.
125

126
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,710
The very last edit I want to make on this layout is cropping the picture a little bit.
126

127
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:57,770
I simply want to place this tunnel on the right hand side, so I zoom out just to see what's going on.
127

128
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,070
I selected the picture,
128

129
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,750
click at the 'Crop' command on my Quick Access Toolbar,
129

130
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,030
Press Shift and drag like this.
130

131
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,550
OK, now I click at the slide background to save the changes.
131

132
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:30,530
Once we finished formatting the Title Slide layout, let's switch to the next one called Title Only.
132

133
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,990
Actually, this one is going to the same
133

134
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:40,220
comparing to the Parent Slide layout. Please keep in mind that Parent Layout should contain the most
134

135
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,500
useful elements you have in your template.
135

136
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,980
That's the reason why I formatted title and footers on my Parent Layout in a specific manner, as well
136

137
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,070
as added little design elements like yellow and grey
137

138
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,610
lines.
138

139
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,470
OK.
139

140
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,340
Now it's time to edit a Section Header layout.
140

141
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,430
As the first thing, I'm going to hide background graphics by checking this box here.
141

142
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,530
Next, let's change the text inside the first placeholder into 'Title'.
142

143
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,150
OK, now I change the font size into 24 points.
143

144
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,220
Next, I align text middle.
144

145
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,840
and press Ctrl B to bold.
145

146
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,660
Now, let's change
146

147
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,500
the dimension.
147

148
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,660
I navigate to the Shape Format tab,
148

149
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,960
and choose 3 centimeters,
149

150
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,830
and 14 centimeters.
150

151
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,720
Now, let's take care of the second placeholder.
151

152
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,500
I change the text into 'Type text here'.
152

153
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,180
OK.
153

154
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,140
As the next step, I change the font size into 20 points.
154

155
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,990
Now, let's change the dimensions.
155

156
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,830
I navigated the Shape Format tab,
156

157
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,400
Choose 5 centimeters.
157

158
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,070
and 14 centimeters.
158

159
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,980
Now it's time to align two placeholders and position them properly on the slide area.
159

160
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,290
As the next step, I'm going to insert a background picture on this layout.
160

161
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,640
I right
161

162
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,750
mouse click and choose Format
162

163
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,420
Background.
163

164
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,390
Inside this window, I select 'Picture or texture fill'.
164

165
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,700
I hover over the picture source,
165

166
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,130
click 'Insert',
166

167
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,630
'From a File',
167

168
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:58,250
I navigate to my folder with images. and I'm going to choose this photograph here.
168

169
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,210
As the last step, I click 'Insert'.
169

170
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,960
Please keep in mind that if you want to use this picture as a background to all slides in your presentation,
170

171
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,460
click the 'Apply to All' button, which can be found here.
171

172
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:16,690
OK.
172

173
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,810
Due to the fact that the picture is quite dark, the black text inside the placeholder is no longer visible.
173

174
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,730
I'm going to change that.
174

175
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,300
I draw a rectangle and get rid of the default grey outline.
175

176
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,050
I also sent it to backward,
176

177
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,540
and type the following dimensions:
177

178
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,130
9.5,
178

179
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,270
and 15.
179

180
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:56,730
Now, I align the white shape middle, and adjust the position of placeholders,
180

181
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,870
like this.
181

182
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,400
As the next step, I'm going to add a placeholder for a Section Number.
182

183
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:17,070
I want it to be position on the left hand side, next to my main content.
183

184
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,600
So I create a rectangle,
184

185
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,510
and I drag like this to adjust the height to already created white rectangle.
185

186
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,820
Again, my smart guides help me a lot.
186

187
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,610
Now, I change the fill color into yellow,
187

188
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,150
and remove the gray outline.
188

189
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,530
I group these two rectangles by pressing Ctrl G shortcut,
189

190
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,290
and position them middle and center.
190

191
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,920
Let's also adjust the position of placeholders,
191

192
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,500
like this.
192

193
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,280
As the next step, I create a placeholder for Section Number.
193

194
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,200
I navigate to the Slide Master tab, click at 'Insert Placeholder' command,
194

195
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,320
and choose 'Text' from the dropdown list.
195

196
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,170
Now, I drag like this,
196

197
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,860
select the dummy text inside by placing the cursor and pressing 
197

198
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,700
Ctrl A shortcut.
198

199
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,370
Now I press the 'Delete' button.
199

200
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:44,750
Let's type #, so that any potential user of this template knows what needs to be put into this
200

201
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,440
rectangle.
201

202
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,940
Next, let's change the font size of this # into 100.
202

203
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,990
Let's align text middle and center, and press
203

204
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,760
Ctrl B to bold.
204

205
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,640
As the last step,
205

206
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,050
let's align it middle and center with the yellow rectangle.
206

207
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,330
This time, I will use the Quick Tools add-in.
207

208
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,690
As the last thing, I'm going to copy the yellow rectangle from the Title slide,
208

209
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,030
and place it here in the upper right corner.
209

210
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,950
The Section Header layout is ready!
210

211
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,970
Now let's switch to the last layout called 'Blank'.
211

212
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:48,500
The only thing that needs to be done here is hiding the background graphics by checking this box here.
212

213
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,240
Perfect!
213

214
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,850
Our Slide Master is ready.
214

215
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:05,140
As you can see, the PowerPoint Slide Master gives you many options for creating layouts, which then
215

216
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,340
can be used multiple times in your presentations and save you tons of time.
216

217
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:18,040
I would highly recommend creating custom layouts for 'Agenda', 'Contact us' or 'Thank you' slides.
217

218
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:26,600
However, please do not go overboard because templates which are too packed with layouts might confuse
218

219
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,230
the user.
219

220
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:35,790
It is also good to know that templates full of images and other decorators might substantially slow
220

221
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,130
your PowerPoint down.
221

222
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:46,730
To sum up, if you have frequently occurring slides, I highly recommend making your own custom layout.
222

223
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,420
if it, of course, does not match one of the existing ones.
