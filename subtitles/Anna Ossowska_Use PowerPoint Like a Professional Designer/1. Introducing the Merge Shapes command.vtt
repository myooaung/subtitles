00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.570
In this movie, I'm going to teach you how to use Merge Shape Tools in PowerPoint.
1

2
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.480
We will use this knowledge later on to build a good looking concept diagram within an Acme template.
2

3
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.230
To start with,
3

4
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.320
sometimes it happens that the shape you want to use isn't actually included in a built-in shape list.
4

5
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.260
Luckily, you can use the Merge Shape Tools to create virtually any shape you want.
5

6
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.380
To activate the Merge Shape Tools,
6

7
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.680
you need to draw at least two shapes.
7

8
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.250
As a next step, select them and navigate to the Shape Format tab.
8

9
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.180
You can find the Merge Shape Tools over here.
9

10
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.540
Alternatively, you can use the Merge Shapes command directly from the Quick Access Toolbar.
10

11
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.450
This second method is, of course, faster.
11

12
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.310
Please keep in mind that if you select only one shape or none, the Merge Shape command will be inactive
12

13
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.840
and grayed out like this.
13

14
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.970
Let's see what's inside the Merge Shape command.
14

15
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.530
Generally, you have five options to choose from that dropdown list.
15

16
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.930
'Union', 'Combine', 'Fragment', 'Intersect' and 'Subtract'.
16

17
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.640
On this slide, you can see objects that I created using these five Merge Shape commands.
17

18
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.430
Now I'm going to show you step by step how to get these visual effects.
18

19
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.340
I will start with demonstrating the 'Union' command.
19

20
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.380
Here I have two circles.
20

21
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.010
I select both of them by pressing the Shift key.
21

22
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.800
Now I navigate through my Quick Access Toolbar and I select 'Union' from the dropdown list.
22

23
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.590
As you can see with just one click, you'll get one shape.
23

24
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.200
Please keep in mind that the combined object will always keep the color of the first selected object.
24

25
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.840
Now I'm going to use the 'Combine' command.
25

26
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.050
As you can see, the two shapes are now combined into one and the overlapping part has become transparent.
26

27
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.400
Let's see how 'Fragment' works.
27

28
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.090
I again select both circles and click on 'Fragment' command.
28

29
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.520
As a result, we get three independent parts.
29

30
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.310
Now it's time to demonstrate how 'Intersect' command works.
30

31
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.080
Let's select two shapes and click 'Intersect'.
31

32
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.490
What remains is an object shaped like an overlapping part.
32

33
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.000
Finally, let's select both shapes and click at the 'Subtract' command.
33

34
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.470
As you can see, it cuts out parts of shapes.
34

35
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.890
Please keep in mind that the selection order matters here.
35

36
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.140
This is what I get
36

37
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.120
if I select gray shape first.
37

38
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.160
And this is what they get if I select the green shape first.
38

39
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.120
What can be concluded out of this is that the 'Subtract' command always cuts out the overlapping
39

40
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.070
portion of the last selected shape.
40

41
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.780
OK, this is how the Merge Shape Tool command works.
