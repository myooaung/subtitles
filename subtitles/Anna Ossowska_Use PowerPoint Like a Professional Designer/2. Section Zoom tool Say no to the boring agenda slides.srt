00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,010
In this movie, I will show you how to apply Zoom effect onto the PowerPoint sections.
1

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,200
Much like you use folders to organize your computer files,
2

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,070
you can use sections to organize your slides into meaningful groups. For the purpose of this lesson,
3

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,330
I modified our previous presentation about the nuclear power plants.
4

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,240
I added three additional slides.
5

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,600
They might be used to provide the audience with more information regarding the nuclear power plants
6

7
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,130
located in USA, France and Russia.
7

8
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:46,090
You can notice that I also removed the previous Zoom effect. To create a section inside PowerPoint
8

9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:46,960
right
9

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,250
mouse click on the area here and choose 'Add Section'.
10

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,780
Alternatively, you can use the shortcut Ctrl <.
11

12
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,150
Let's name the first section.
12

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,940
It's going to be 'USA'.
13

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,430
Now it's time to create the second section.
14

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,240
I'm going to name it
15

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,110
'France'.
16

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,440
And the last one 'Russia'.
17

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,190
In this way, we get the logically organized presentation.
18

19
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,610
Now, I'm going to zoom in on the three sections
19

20
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,800
I've just created.
20

21
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:39,440
Please keep in mind that zooming into sections allows you to move around your presentation in an elegant way.
21

22
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,530
It gives the audience totally different impression than when you simply scroll through the slides.
22

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,410
This is how you can set it up.
23

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,990
Let's move to slide number one,
24

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,200
which, again, is the core slide of this presentation.
25

26
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,010
Navigate to the Insert tab,
26

27
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,480
and under the Links category
27

28
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,120
select the 'Section Zoom'.
28

29
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,000
Here I get a pop up that shows all sections available inside my presentation
29

30
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:20,300
In this case, I'm going to select sections called USA, France and Russia and I click on the Insert
30

31
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,750
button.
31

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,280
What I get here, looks the same as what I had before.
32

33
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:33,450
The difference is that now I don't have one slide behind each zoom level but actually an entire group
33

34
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,230
of slides.
34

35
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,200
Now, I'm going to arrange these elementally a little bit.
35

36
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,380
I'm going to change the size, align, as well as distribute the mini slides horizontally.
36

37
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,930
Next, if I navigate to the Zoom tab and check out the default options,
37

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,660
you can see that the 'Return to Zoom' option is automatically activated.
38

39
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,720
Of course, there is the logic behind it.
39

40
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,650
Thanks to this option, a presenter can discuss each section independently and then quickly return to
40

41
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,310
the core slide without scrolling through the whole presentation.
41

42
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,250
Let's check it out!
42

43
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,980
I press F5 shortcut to run the presentation from the beginning,
43

44
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,800
I click on USA,
44

45
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,770
click again, and as you can see, PowerPoint takes me to the next slide
45

46
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,620
inside the section. Now I click again,
46

47
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,100
and PowerPoint takes me to the core.
47

48
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:56,620
slide,
48

49
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,170
and so on and so forth.
49

50
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:13,050
Another huge advantage of working with sections is that you can easily add as many slides as you want to
50

51
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,140
each section without destroying the already set up Zoom effect.
51

52
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,610
For example, I'm going to create a new slide in section called USA.
52

53
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,570
Let's change the tagline into 'The new slide'.
53

54
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:35,150
Now, I go back to my core slide and turn on the presentation mode.
54

55
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,940
And you can see that my new content is already there.
55

56
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:52,340
That's how Zoom works in PowerPoint 2019. As you can see, this tool is extremely powerful and can
56

57
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,900
help you to bring your presentation to the next level. In the next movie,
57

58
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:05,030
I will teach you how to use Morph, another equally great tool available inside PowerPoint 2019.
