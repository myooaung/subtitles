In this movie, I will show you how to create this fluid and video like slide transition using the new
1

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,490
PowerPoint tool called Morph.
2

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,360
Are you ready?
3

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,980
Let's get it started!
4

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,690
To use the Morph transition effectively, you need to have at least two slides with at least one object
5

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,290
in common.
6

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,920
Actually, the easiest way is to duplicate the slide and then move the object on the second one
7

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,270
to different locations.
8

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,330
Let's do it together.
9

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,660
As the first step, I select the slide and press Ctrl D shortcut two times to create copies.
10

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,650
Then, I put objects on the second slide
11

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,050
to different locations.
12

13
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,260
To make an effect even more spectacular,
13

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,230
I also change the angle of cubes by pressing Alt and arrow keys.
14

15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,340
Now it's time to apply the Morph transition.
15

16
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:21,910
I select three slides by clicking at the first one, pressing Shift key and clicking at the last one.
16

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,330
I navigated to the Transitions tab,
17

18
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,150
and I choose Morph.
18

19
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,550
As you can see, the little stars appeared inside my slide pane.
19

20
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,330
They indicate that animations are applied.
20

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,340
What is important,
21

22
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,000
you can also modify the speed of your Morph animation.
22

23
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,400
If you feel that it is too slow and you want it faster, change the speed from here.
23

24
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,780
You can also navigate to the Effect options. In this case,
24

25
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,210
I'm working with cubes which are objects,
25

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,730
so the default option is just fine.
26

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,670
Now, I'm going to press F5 keyboard shortcut to run the presentation from the beginning.
27

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,440
And here it comes!
28

29
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,830
As you can see, the Morph tool helps you to connect all the slide elements quickly and effortlessly.
