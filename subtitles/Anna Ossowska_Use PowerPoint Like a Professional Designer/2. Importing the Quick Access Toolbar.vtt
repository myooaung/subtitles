One of my missions is to teach you how to become faster using PowerPoint.
1

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.470
Therefore, I would like to share with you the Quick Access Toolbar, which I created specifically
2

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.340
for this course.
3

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.480
It contains the most popular and practical commands.
4

5
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.930
I strongly recommend you to follow all the installation steps in this movie because we will often use
5

6
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.790
this toolbar throughout this course.

7
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.520
As the first step,
7

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.660
please download the file named:

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.870
PowerPoint-Quick-Access-Toolbar.exportedUI
9

10
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.140
Open the PowerPoint
10

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.920
Navigate to the 'File',
11

12
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.410
'Options'...
12

13
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.250
'Quick Access Toolbar', 'Import/Export',
13

14
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.430
'Import customization file',
14

15
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.620
Find the downloaded file.
15

16
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.860
And click 'Open'.
16

17
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.130
Now, click
17

18
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.860
'Yes'
18

19
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.370
And click OK to save the changes.
19

20
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.630
As you can see, the Quick Access Toolbar appears by default on the top of my screen.
20

21
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.960
There is little space here and that's the reason why some commands are no longer visible.
21

22
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.760
Let's change that.
22

23
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.550
Click on this little arrow here to expand, and choose 'Show Below the Ribbon'.
23

24
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.660
Perfect!
24

25
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.110
Now we have quick access to all these features. Knowing how to import and export
25

26
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.080
Quick Access Toolbar is a great asset.
26

27
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.590
It enables you to always have your tools at hand or easily share them with your colleagues.
