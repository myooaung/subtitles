00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.370
When I create the color palettes from scratch, I usually use website tools which make the whole
1

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.470
process fast and easy.
2

3
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.500
In this movie, I will show you my favorite once.

paletton.com
4

5
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.170
What I like about this Web site is that you don't need to be 100% familiar with the color theory
5

6
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.050
to create a good color palette here.
6

7
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.160
You can be sure that the website will always generate color options which are harmonized and go really
7

8
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.970
well together.
8

9
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.340
There's a couple of important things to remember.
9

10
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.770
The right hand side of this screen is generally informational, whereas the left hand side is the place
10

11
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.630
where you are going to do the whole work.
11

12
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.370
You are going to work with this color wheel.
12

13
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.830
As a first step, let's type a base color.
13

14
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.980
The # must be deleted in order to make it work.
14

15
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.570
OK.
15

16
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.160
We have it.
16

17
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.220
Now we can choose from different color schemes.
17

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.570
First one is monochromatic.
18

19
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.640
What you can see over here are the shades of green.
19

20
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.070
If I want to create a more complex palette, I can click on the second icon.
20

21
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.310
This is a palette with three color options that complemented the green.
21

22
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.590
Triad, on the other hand, gives me three color options, which are evenly spaced on the color wheel.
22

23
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.610
Next is tetrad.
23

24
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.410
It uses four colors arranged in two complementary pairs.
24

25
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.570
And there are also free style options.
25

26
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.670
Another interesting thing you can do is navigating to the preview.
26

27
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.780
Click at 'Default with text' command in order to check out which text color would be best for each color
27

28
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.110
chunk.
28

29
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.510
And finally, there is also an option to export your pallets.
29

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.810
mycolor.space
30

31
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.230
Here you can type RGB or HEX values to generate interesting color options.

stylifyme.com
32

33
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.640
This website is especially helpful when you need to create a template on the basis of website.
33

34
00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.150
It allows you to research sites efficiently and helps you to make some design decisions regarding the
34

35
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.230
font type usage, color scheme and photo styles.
35

36
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.730
The only thing you need to do is pasting the link to a website and clicking 'Stylify Me'.
36

37
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.770
You can also download your results and share them with others.
37

38
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.080
This is how you can design your custom color palettes. As you can see,
38

39
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.500
this process might take some time and of course, it requires some planning and research.
39

40
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.270
However, if you make a good use of my advice and you will use the websites discussed this lesson,
40

41
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.920
the whole process will be for sure easier and more effective.
