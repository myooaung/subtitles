00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:07,500
In this movie, I will show you how to use Merge Shape tools to change the look of your photographs.
1

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,440
Together, we will create this slide with an image in the background.
2

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,340
Let's get it started!
3

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,820
Let's assume that you work in the IT company and your boss decided to raise the qualifications of employees
4

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,430
by inviting them into the conference.
5

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,400
You have been given the task to create a slide informing your colleagues about this event.
6

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:41,050
You have received this image from your boss as well as some basic organizational info like the name
7

8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,710
of the conference time, date and location.
8

9
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:52,010
Of course, there are many ways how you can design this slide, but you should always think strategically
9

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,160
to make it look eye-catching and interesting.
10

11
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,830
If I am about to create the slide, which has a very limited amount of text and there is a need to
11

12
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,100
use once the thematical picture, I usually decide to work on the Blank Slide layout.
12

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,910
Let's create one!
13

14
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,700
Generally, it's a good idea to resize the picture in a way it covers the whole slide area.
14

15
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,980
This is how I can do this.
15

16
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,020
I select the picture,
16

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,270
navigate to the Picture Format tab,
17

18
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,890
I choose 'Crop', 'Aspect Ratio', '16.9'.
18

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,190
Once we have the right proportions matching the widescreen format, it's time to align the picture
19

20
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,330
left and top using the native alignment tools.
20

21
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,870
Once it's done, press Shift and drag to adjust the image to the slide area.
21

22
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,660
Now, I send the picture to back.
22

23
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,270
Once it's done, I'm going to take care of the textual content.
23

24
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,940
I select everything using the loop selection and I change the font color into white.
24

25
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,140
Next, I'm going to modify the font size.
25

26
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,610
I will type 50 points for the title,
26

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,730
and 20 points for the rest of the content.
27

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,380
I also bold the title by pressing Ctrl B shortcut.
28

29
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,240
Now I'm going to create a straight line.
29

30
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,640
I choose line from the list, press Shift and drag.
30

31
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,830
Once it's done, I'm going to change the color into white,
31

32
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,740
and make it a little bit thicker.
32

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,370
I also adjust the position using the Ctrl and arrow keys.
33

34
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:32,610
Now it's time to create the group of purely decorative elements. Instead of boring bullet points
34

35
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,800
I want each text box here to have a little white square placed on its left hand side.
35

36
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,270
Let's create the first one!
36

37
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,900
I choose rectangle from the list,
37

38
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,810
I drag and press Shift key to keep proportions.
38

39
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,080
Now, I remove the outline and apply the white fill color.
39

40
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,640
I also want to rotate it 45 degrees by pressing Alt and right arrow key three times.
40

41
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,000
As the next step, I'm going to align the square center with my line.
41

42
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,070
Great!
42

43
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,860
Now, it's time to create three copies of this square.
43

44
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,630
I press Ctrl D,
44

45
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:27,050
and with my newly created shape still selected, I try to manually adjust its position.
45

46
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,960
My smart guides help me do this.
46

47
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,380
Now, with this shape still selected, I create copies by pressing Ctrl D two times.
47

48
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,900
As you can see, PowerPoint copies and moves objects in a specific pattern.
48

49
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,350
No additional alignment is needed here.
49

50
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,990
Now it's time to align squares and text boxes.
50

51
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,330
That Quick Tools add-in will help me to do this.
51

52
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,360
Now it's time to create a new decorative element.
52

53
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,740
I choose the rectangle from my Quick Access Toolbar, and I press Shift and drag.
53

54
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,050
I want it to be quite big.
54

55
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:46,330
Next, I'm going to rotate it 45 degrees by pressing the Alt and right arrow key three times.
55

56
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,820
Now it's time to position it properly
56

57
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,210
by dragging and using arrow keys.
57

58
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,990
Actually, I want it to cover only a part of my slide area, like this.
58

59
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,510
Once it's done, I want to connect this square with the thin line on the left hand side.
59

60
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:17,210
I create a copy of this line by pressing Ctrl D shortcut, and I rotate it 90 degrees by pressing Alt
60

61
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,540
and right arrow key six times.
61

62
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,910
Now, I adjust the position of this line.
62

63
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,770
As the last step, I nudge my square in a way its corner touches the line on the left hand side.
63

64
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,870
As the next step, I'm going to take care of this background image.
64

65
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:05,770
It seems to me that it is drawing unnecessary attention and it doesn't make the text visible enough.
65

66
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,990
There is actually a great PowerPoint feature which can come in handy here.
66

67
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,090
It's called 'Blur'.
67

68
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,010
Before we will use it, let's create a copy of this slide by selecting it and pressing
68

69
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,980
Ctrl D shortcut.
69

70
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,770
Now, select the first slide,
70

71
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,850
click at the picture,
71

72
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,980
navigate to the Picture Format tab and select 'Artistic Effects'.
72

73
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's click at the 'Blur' option.
73

74
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,350
As you can see, the image is blurred.
74

75
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,880
However, it's not as blurry as I would like it to be.
75

76
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,040
Of course, I can easy modify that. Just select the picture once again,
76

77
00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:02,020
I navigate back to the 'Artistic Effects' and in the drop down menu, I select 'Artistic Effects Options'.
77

78
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,840
Here you can see a command called 'Radius'.
78

79
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,410
Let's change the blurriness of this image into 30.
79

80
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,780
Perfect!
80

81
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,170
Now comes the most important part.
81

82
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,900
Let's navigate to the second copied slide.
82

83
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,560
I am going to use the Merge Shape Tools to cut this square from the main image.
83

84
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,230
I select the background picture first,
84

85
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,390
then I press Shift and click at the square.
85

86
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,080
Now, I navigate to the Merge Shape Tools command,
86

87
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,830
and select 'Intersect'.
87

88
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,700
Once it's done, I select this square,
88

89
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,570
copy it
89

90
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,420
by pressing Ctrl C shortcut and I jump to my first slide.
90

91
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,390
I delete this square here, and press control V to paste the new one.
91

92
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,100
The last thing that needs to be done is adding the wide, thin outline.
92

93
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,600
Perfect, this slide is ready!
93

94
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:21,140
This is how you can use Merge Shape Tools combined with the Artistic Effects to create visualizations
94

95
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,110
that can impress your boss and colleagues.
