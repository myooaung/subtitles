00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:09,340
In this movie, I will talk about the magic of three keys: Ctrl, Shift and Alt. What is important,
1

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:15,940
These keys can be used individually or can be combined together to help you work faster and more efficiently.
2

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,300
Let's start with the Alt key.
3

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,530
Use it to activate Ribbon and Quick Access Toolbar's shortcuts.
4

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,610
Let's press and release the Alt key.
5

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,720
As you can see, it activates the little boxes over each command available in the current view.
6

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,180
Press the letters shown in the box over 
7

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,710
the command.
8

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,930
I will choose 'N' to go to the insert tab.
9

10
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,700
Next, I press 'T' to create a table.
10

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:53,360
I pressed Shift, and Down Arrow, as well as Right Arrow key to select the number of rows and columns.
11

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,260
Next, I press Enter.
12

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,980
And here it comes.
13

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,260
The table is ready!
14

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,350
Please note that Alt key works in the similar way in all Microsoft Office applications.
15

16
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,660
Alt + right/left arrow keys. Use it to rotate your objects.
16

17
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,690
To rotate clockwise, select the rectangle, press Alt and right arrow key. To rotate your object counter-clockwise,
17

18
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,690
press Alt and...
18

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,620
That's right,
19

20
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,520
left arrow key!
20

21
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,020
Please keep in mind that this shortcut rotates with 15 degrees increments,
21

22
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:35,360
so if you want to rotate your objects 90 degrees, for example, you must do a small calculation.
22

23
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,750
Ninety divided by fifteen gives us six.
23

24
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,690
It means that you must press right arrow key six times to repeat the shape 90 degrees.
24

25
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,250
Shift + arrows. Use it to increase or decrease the size of your objects.
25

26
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,030
To increase the width of the rectangle, press the Shift and right arrow key.
26

27
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,110
If you press Shift key and the left arrow key this time, you will decrease the width of your shape. To increase
27

28
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,860
the height,
28

29
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,740
press Shift and up arrow key.
29

30
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,390
And to decrease, the Shift and down arrow key.
30

31
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,580
Shift + draw a shape.
31

32
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,680
Use it to get proportional shapes inside PowerPoint.
32

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,270
To create the square,
33

34
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,450
choose a rectangle from the shape list,
34

35
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,770
then press Shift and drag. To create a perfect circle, on the other hand,
35

36
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,600
choose 'oval' from the list, press Shift, and drag like this.
36

37
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,420
Please keep in mind that Shift key might also be used to create perfect straight lines.
37

38
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,890
Let's create one!
38

39
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,650
I choose line from my shape list, press Shift, and drag like this.
39

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,150
Perfect.
40

41
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:58,190
It's also a good moment to talk briefly about the crooked lines inside PowerPoint, and how they can
41

42
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,750
ruin the look of your slide.
42

43
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,720
Here you can see a very simple concept diagram.
43

44
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,600
At first glance, everything seems to look fine.
44

45
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:11,330
But if you take a closer look, these two lines are actually badly crooked.
45

46
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
How can you fix that quickly?
46

47
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,090
Actually, you don't need to create lines from the scratch.
47

48
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,500
Just select the first line, and go to the 'Shape Format' tab.
48

49
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,400
Do you see this value of 0.2 centimeters?
49

50
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,250
This is the proof that line is crooked.
50

51
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,120
Change the value to zero centimeters to make it straight.
51

52
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,180
Do the same for the second line as well.
52

53
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:45,850
Shift + drag: constrain the movement of the selected objects to vertical or horizontal.
53

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,290
Here comes the group of shapes which are perfectly aligned and the spaces between them are equal.
54

55
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:01,010
I would like to precisely move this green shape from the first column to the third without using
55

56
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,690
the alignment tools
56

57
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,320
How can I do that?
57

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,330
I select the shape, press Shift and drag to the right.
58

59
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,670
These red dashed lines are my smart guides, which helped me to precisely position the object.
59

60
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:21,600
If you follow my steps and you don't see these lines on your screen, right click on the slide area,
60

61
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,420
choose 'Grid and Guides', and make sure you have these three boxes check-marked.
61

62
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,970
Control + arrows. Use it to nudge the object.
62

63
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,290
Let's select the circle,
63

64
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,560
press Ctrl key and right arrow key.
64

65
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,770
As you can see, I gently nudge an image
65

66
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,540
in the direction of the arrow key.
66

67
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,210
Now, I press Ctrl again, but this time I add the down arrow key to move the object to the bottom.
67

68
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,100
Ctrl + Shift + drag. Use it to copy and align your object.
68

69
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,620
I can assure you, this is one of the most powerful shortcuts in PowerPoint.
69

70
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,240
Let's see how it works!
70

71
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,740
I want to copy this circle on the top and move it to the bottom.
71

72
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:22,970
So I selected it, press Ctrl + Shift and drag. As you can see by doing this,
72

73
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,420
I copy the object and constrain its movement to vertical.
73

74
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,420
Now I can release the keys for a moment,
74

75
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,280
press Shift and drag again.
75

76
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,200
The smart guides helped me to perfectly positioned the circle.
76

77
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,660
OK, great.
77

78
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,860
Now, let's do the same, this time with the left hand side.
78

79
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,290
I select the circle, press Ctrl Shift and drag to the right.
79

80
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,480
Now I can release the keys,
80

81
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,720
press shift and position like this, perfect!
81

82
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,610
Control + drag the nodes. Use it to increase or decrease the size of your objects and fix the position
82

83
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,430
at the same time.
83

84
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,050
Select this image, click on the node in the coroner and drag to the outside like this to make the circle
84

85
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,560
bigger.
85

86
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,580
Now, let's drag to the inside to make the circle smaller.
86

87
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,510
It's quite similar to Shift + drag keyboard shortcut,
87

88
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,140
the difference is that you don't move central point of the shape.
