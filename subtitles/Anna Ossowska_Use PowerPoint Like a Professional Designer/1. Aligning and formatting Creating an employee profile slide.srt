00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:07,610
In this movie, I will show you how to properly manage photographs inside PowerPoint. Together we will
1

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,950
create an employee profile slide using the Acme_16.9 template.
2

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,950
Let's get it started!
3

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,870
As a first step, double click on the .potx file to open it as normal presentation with the .pptx
4

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,890
extension.
5

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:35,190
By the way, if you want to open the .potx file to format your template, right mouse click and
6

7
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,330
choose 'Open'.
7

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,000
This is very important,
8

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,550
and you should be aware of this difference.
9

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:45,920
OK.
10

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,580
Now I have my presentation opened.
11

12
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,440
Let's create a 'Title Only' slide by placing the cursor here,
12

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,790
and pressing Ctrl M shortcut.
13

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,730
I'm going to add the title.
14

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,550
Let's type
15

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,470
'Management'.
16

17
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,600
OK, now it's time to add the first text box.
17

18
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,790
I navigate to my Quick Access Toolbar,
18

19
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,920
I click on the textbox icon and drag like this.
19

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:29,180
What I want to put inside is the name and surname of the first employee, as well as his job title underneath.
20

21
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,130
Let's type
21

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,360
John Smith.
22

23
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,140
Now, I pressed Shift Enter to enter a soft line break.
23

24
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,620
And I'm going to type CEO.
24

25
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:49,450
OK, once I have the text inside, it's time to format it.
25

26
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,420
I press Ctrl A to select everything,
26

27
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,590
and I'm going to change the font size into 22 points.
27

28
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,820
I also want the first line to be in bold,
28

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,460
and the second one to be regular and gray.
29

30
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,190
Perfect!
30

31
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,780
Now I want to create a yellow, straight, horizontal line.
31

32
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,560
Actually, it will play a role of visual separator between the textbox and photograph, which I am
32

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,750
going to add later on.
33

34
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:25,870
OK.
34

35
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,280
I press Shift and drag.
35

36
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,690
I want it to be short.
36

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,370
Let's change
37

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,570
it's width to 6 points and change the color into yellow.
38

39
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,430
Now I'm going to align it center with my textbooks by using their Quick Tools macro.
39

40
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,740
As a next step, let's group the textbox and the line by using Ctrl G shortcut.
40

41
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,040
I will position it here on the right hand side.
41

42
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,430
Once I have these two elements grouped and properly formatted, it's time to use it as textual
42

43
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,130
placeholder for profiles of another three people.
43

44
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,920
I make sure the group of objects is selected,
44

45
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,190
and I press Ctrl D shortcut.
45

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
I place the copied element here.
46

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,830
and press Ctrl D two times.
47

48
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,910
Perfect!
48

49
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:40,390
Now, I drag the last element and try to align it with the right hand side of my tagline.
49

50
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,100
My smart guides helped me to position everything.
50

51
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,860
Now I make a loop selection.
51

52
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,770
I navigate to the Native Alignment Tools,
52

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,090
and distribute everything horizontally.
53

54
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:04,310
As the last step, I'm going to ungroup all of these elements by pressing Ctrl Shift G shortcut.
54

55
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,060
And it's time to fill other textboxes with text.
55

56
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,860
I will type:
56

57
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,090
Mary Williams,
57

58
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,850
Head of the Project Department.
58

59
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,640
Jack Luke
59

60
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,910
Head of Sales Department.
60

61
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,490
Emily Jones, Head of Customer Support.
61

62
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,230
Now I'm going to teach you how to crop an image into a circle.
62

63
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,190
I will start by copying and pasting the photo of CEO.
63

64
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,710
Now I make sure the image is selected.
64

65
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,380
I navigate to the Picture Format tab.
65

66
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,170
I select the Crop tool.
66

67
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,680
and 'Crop to Shape' command.
67

68
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,350
I will choose 'oval' from the list.
68

69
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:25,190
As you can see, if I tried to crop this photo into the circle, it's cropping down the entire image.
69

70
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,610
It's maintaining the aspect ratio, which was a rectangle by default.
70

71
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,150
If I try to make it a circle manually by just dragging, you can notice that I am actually skewing
71

72
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,910
the image and to make it look distorted.
72

73
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,960
I press Ctrl Z to undo.
73

74
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,190
What I need to do first is to bring this photo into the square.
74

75
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,050
Then I can turn this square into a circle.
75

76
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,420
So let's do this once again.
76

77
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,900
I navigate to the Picture Format tab,
77

78
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,530
I click at 'Crop',
78

79
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,950
'Aspect Ratio',
79

80
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,950
and I choose 1:1 option.
80

81
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:19,720
My photograph is still selected and I press Shift and drag to adjust the central point of this image,
81

82
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,430
which is the face of this man.
82

83
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,370
OK, it looks good.
83

84
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,580
Now I release.
84

85
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:34,290
As you can see, now I have a perfect square, which means that a circle will have a uniform diameter
85

86
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,210
the whole way across.
86

87
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,120
I select the picture once again, navigator to the 'Crop'
87

88
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,140
'Crop to Shape'
88

89
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,130
'oval'
89

90
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,210
Perfect!
90

91
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,900
Now I'm pressing Shifts to change the size of this picture a little bit and maintain the aspect ratio.
91

92
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,970
Remember, we don't want to end up with skewed circles.
92

93
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,820
Now it's time to format other three photographs.
93

94
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,890
Once I have four photographs properly cropped, I can align them and distribute.
94

95
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,420
I choose my textbooks as an element to which I will align the photo of CEO.
95

96
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,780
I press align center button.
96

97
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,430
Now, I'm going to do the same thing with the last image.
97

98
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,650
The next step is distributing photos horizontally and aligning them top.
98

99
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,340
I will also adjust the position of objects a little bit.
99

100
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:29,990
I decided to have all these photographs black and white, so I select a photo of my CEO, I navigate
100

101
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,670
to the Picture Format options.
101

102
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,890
And here inside color saturation, I choose 
102

103
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,060
'Saturation: 0%'.
103

104
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,190
Now I select other images and press F4 shortcut to repeat the last action.
104

105
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,470
The last thing is distributing these yellow lines with textboxes and images.
105

106
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,080
I just noticed that the distance here and here is not equal.
106

107
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,860
So I will use distribute vertical option to fix this.
107

108
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,570
Then I select the other lines and align them
108

109
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,430
with the first selected element.
109

110
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,620
Perfect!
110

111
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,900
The slide is ready.
