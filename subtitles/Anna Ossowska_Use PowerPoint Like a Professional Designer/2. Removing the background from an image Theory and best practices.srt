00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:07,950
In this movie, I'm going to teach you how to remove background from an image in the latest version
1

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,910
of PowerPoint.
2

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,150
Later on, we will use this knowledge to build a cool modern slide with a quotation.
3

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,810
To start with, I would like to show you some examples of how background that has been removed will
4

5
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,470
look like.
5

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,130
In the first example, I have a group of logos in the original version.
6

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,190
This image had a wide background
7

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,750
beneath it, which I successfully removed.
8

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,430
Here you can see a photograph of a building.
9

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:49,080
If I navigate to the picture for my top and reset this image, you can see it actually had the blue
10

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,780
background.
11

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,090
Here you can see a photo taken from an employee profile slide.
12

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,890
If I reset this picture, you can see that it actually has a quite complex background, but I was able
13

14
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,040
to remove it and apply soft edges as well.
14

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,030
There are two methods to remove backgrounds from a picture in PowerPoint.
15

16
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,500
First, by using set a transparent color tool.
16

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:27,630
And second, by using remove background too. Please keep in mind that these tools work on JPEG and PNG
17

18
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,160
files
18

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,790
only.
19

20
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,370
Let's now see how set a transparence color tool works in practice.
20

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:43,870
Generally, this tool works great on images which are very crisp or have a uniform background color
21

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,620
like those here. To remove the white background
22

23
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,930
make sure the picture is selected,
23

24
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,110
navigate to the picture format tab,
24

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,710
choose color and set transparent color, which is on the bottom of the list.
25

26
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,420
Alternatively, you can use the Quick Access Toolbar and click on this icon here.
26

27
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,610
Now my cursor turns into a little pen with a white arrow. As the next step,
27

28
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,460
I click on the area that I want to remove.
28

29
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,640
And as you can see, PowerPoint took that area and turn it transparent.
29

30
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,750
Please keep in mind that although this method is very fast and might come in handy in many situations,
30

31
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,880
it has some limitations.
31

32
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,110
For example, if I switch to the next slide showing the image of a building and try to remove that background,
32

33
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,350
the final effect is not really satisfying.
33

34
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,660
Why, you might ask?
34

35
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,220
Because the photo is not very crisp and has some gradient.
35

36
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,780
In order to remove it, I will use the second tool called 'Remove Background'.
36

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,160
I make sure my picture is selected.
37

38
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,560
I navigate to the picture format tab and I click here on 'Remove Background' command.
38

39
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,170
As you can see, PowerPoint turns my picture magenta.
39

40
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,150
Please keep in mind that the magenta area is image background
40

41
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:25,630
that PowerPoint is guessing that I want to remove. Areas that are in the original color are areas that
41

42
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,250
PowerPoint is going to keep.
42

43
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,970
In this example, PowerPoint made quite a good guess what I want to remove.
43

44
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,380
However, I still need to make a few quick edits.
44

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,520
I'm going to use these two commands.
45

46
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,790
'Mark Areas to Keep' 
46

47
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,950
and 'Mark Areas to Remove' to modify the selected area.
47

48
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,730
First, I'm going to zoom in to see better what's going on.
48

49
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,820
To zoom in
49

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,230
I press Ctrl and scroll with my mouse.
50

51
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,320
Now, I select 'Mark Areas to Keep' command,
51

52
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,650
and as you can see, my cursor turned into a small pen that I can use to draw on this picture.
52

53
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,840
So I'm drawing here, which indicates that I want to keep this area.
53

54
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,910
I'm going to keep drawing in here aswell.
54

55
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,060
And a little bit here.
55

56
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,770
Looks perfect
56

57
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,100
now.
57

58
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,480
Once I have it really, I select 'Keep Changes'.
58

59
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,090
Please keep in mind that if it happens that you want to go back to the original look and to reset
59

60
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:57,850
the changes, you can either navigate to the Picture Format tab, click at remove background command
60

61
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,100
and select 'Discard
61

62
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,210
All Changes'.
62

63
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,750
Or you can go to the Picture Format tab and reset the picture
63

64
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,230
by clicking on this icon here.
64

65
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,530
OK, let's now switch to the next slide.
65

66
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,430
In this example, the situation is more complicated.
66

67
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,100
We have quite a complex background here.
67

68
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,940
But let's go ahead and see what can we do about it.
68

69
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:37,190
I select an image, navigate to the Picture Format tab and click at 'Remove Background'.
69

70
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,040
You can see that PowerPoint again guesses quite well what needs to be removed.
70

71
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,220
However, there are still some problematic areas
71

72
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,650
I want to fix, for example, hair and the upper body.
72

73
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:00,110
First, I select 'Mark Areas to Keep' tool. My cursor turns into a little pen, as you can see,
73

74
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,210
and now I'm going to draw.
74

75
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,480
Like this.
75

76
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,930
I will fix the area here.
76

77
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,140
Ok, as a next step, I want to focus on the woman's head.
77

78
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,890
I'm going to draw here,
78

79
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,280
here,
79

80
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,810
and here.
80

81
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,460
As you can see, it's quite difficult to fix the area around hair.
81

82
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,930
The edges look very sharp and as a result, unnatural.
82

83
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,300
However, I will show you later on how we can quickly fix that. Right now,
83

84
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,320
let's just focus on the main thing.
84

85
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,530
I will zoom in to have a better view
85

86
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,860
by pressing Ctrl and scrolling with my mouse.
86

87
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,060
I'm going to draw here,
87

88
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,140
here
88

89
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:57,910
and here.
89

90
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,910
Looks perfect
90

91
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,260
now.
91

92
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,550
Once I have it ready, I select 'Keep Changes'.
92

93
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,120
OK.
93

94
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,180
Now, I want to focus on this part over here.
94

95
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,250
As I mentioned before, I don't like the sharp edges around the head.
95

96
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,120
I'm going to fix that.
96

97
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,090
I select a picture,
97

98
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,890
press Ctrl D to create a copy.
98

99
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,740
I select the copied picture, navigate to the Picture Format tab,
99

100
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,840
I click at 'Artistic Effects' and choose this option here, which is Blur.
100

101
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,570
Next, I'm going to make this blur effect more intensive.
101

102
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,630
I go back to the Artistic Effects tab and click here at
102

103
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,580
the Artistic Effects Options.
103

104
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,510
The Format Picture tab automatically appears on the right hand side of my screen.
104

105
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,920
I change the radius from 10 to 35.
105

106
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,610
As the next step, I'm going to pick up the size of the first picture by navigating to the Quick Tools tab
106

107
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,530
and choosing 'Size and Position'.
107

108
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,170
Now, I select the second picture and I click at the green button to apply.
108

109
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:52,850
Once I have these two photographs properly positioned as two layers, I sent my blurred picture back
109

110
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,310
by using this tool over here.
110

111
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:02,620
As you can see, these small adjustments to the picture make a huge visual difference.
111

112
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,310
The woman's hair look more natural right now.
112

113
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,680
Before I will use this picture to create a slide with the quotation, I would like to briefly discuss
113

114
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,410
some limitations and drawbacks of the 'Remove Background' tool.
114

115
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,570
Sometimes you might find this tool hard to work with.
115

116
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,710
For example, on this picture, the color of first plan is very similar to the color of the background.
116

117
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,210
I would like to keep this element here.
117

118
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,990
PowerPoint does not see any difference between the two.
118

119
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,980
It might be also hard to remove the background around the strands of hair or fur.
119

120
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:14,200
To sum up, method number one, where I used the 'Set Transparent Color' tool is very quick, but works
120

121
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,270
on a small percentage of images.
121

122
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,050
Therefore, make sure you're familiar with the method
122

123
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,590
number two, which, by the way, also has some limitations.
123

124
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:31,780
If any of these methods work as you wish, you might consider using the Photoshop or other picture editor.
