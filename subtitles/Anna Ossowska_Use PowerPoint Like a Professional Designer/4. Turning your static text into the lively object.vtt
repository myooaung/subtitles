In this movie, I will show you how to create this animated custom typography, using the Merge Shape Tools.
1

2
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.550
As the first step, I'm going to insert a video of clouds running through the sky. I navigate to the
2

3
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.940
Insert tab,
3

4
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.090
I choose 'Video',
4

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.410
'Video on My PC...',
5

6
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.390
now, I select the file and click 'Insert'.
6

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.810
Next, let's press Ctrl Shift and drag to increase the dimension and keep the aspect ratio.
7

8
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.240
Now, make sure the video is selected, navigate to the Playback tab and change the settings.
8

9
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.450
I want this video to 'Loop until Stopped'.
9

10
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.920
Now it's time to create the textbox.
10

11
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.990
I drag and put some text inside.
11

12
00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.730
Let's type:
12

13
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.680
'Custom typography'.
13

14
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.000
I want to change the font type into 'Franklin Gothic Heavy',
14

15
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.390
and apply the upper case.
15

16
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.390
I also increase the font size to 90 points.
16

17
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.440
Next, I'm going to align this textbox center and middle with my video.
17

18
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.440
OK, now let's select the slide and press Ctrl D to create a copy.
18

19
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.840
It will come in handy later on.
19

20
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.890
Now it's time to use the Merge Shape Tools.
20

21
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.170
I navigate to my first slide,
21

22
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.960
select the video, then press Shift and select the textbox.
22

23
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.200
I navigate to the Merge Shape Tool command,
23

24
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.190
and choose 'Intersect'.
24

25
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.650
What remains is an overlapping part, let's press Shift F5 to turn on this slide show and see
25

26
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.670
the final effect.
26

27
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.800
I would like to show you another interesting formatting option.
27

28
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.880
Let's jump to the copied slide.
28

29
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.160
Actually, you can not only animate the whole textbox, but each letter separately.
29

30
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.800
Let's do this!
30

31
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.570
I select the video first,
31

32
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.720
then the text,
32

33
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.880
I navigate the Merge Shape Tools command,
33

34
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.710
and this time I click at 'Fragment'.
34

35
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.060
Great!
35

36
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.430
Now I press Shift F5 to turn on slideshow and see the final effect.
36

37
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.290
I click on the first letter, and as you can see, the video goes on, whereas the other letters are static.
37

38
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.830
Let's press escape to abort.
38

39
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.100
Another great advantage of 'Fragment' tool is that you have control over every single letter and you
39

40
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.950
can adjust it the way you need for your presentation.
40

41
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.650
To sum up, the Merge Shape Tools can be used in many creative ways.
41

42
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.090
I highly recommend you to utilize them in your daily work in order to impress your audience even more.
