00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.040
In this movie, I will show you my top 20 keyboard shortcuts for PowerPoint. Knowing them well will not
1

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.460
only make you faster inside PowerPoint, it will also ease the decision making and will help you to eliminate
2

3
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.970
mental stress, especially if your deadlines are very short.
3

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.920
So instead of playing hide and seek in the command ribbon and trying to recall where was each command button,
4

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.480
just hit the keys without even thinking much about it, and get the task done quickly. To help you memorize
5

6
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.290
the shortcuts,
6

7
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.010
I divided them into three categories: shortcuts which come in handy when doing the basic formatting,
7

8
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.580
shortcuts for managing presentations, as well as shortcuts helping in the design process.
8

9
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.730
Let's start with the top shortcuts for the basic formatting.
9

10
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.440
Shortcut #1 and 2: Ctrl G and Ctrl Shift G
10

11
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.150
To group selected objects on the slide,
11

12
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.740
press Ctrl G.
12

13
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.660
To ungroup objects, including group objects, Smart Art Graphics or Enhanced Metafiles, select them
13

14
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.040
and press
14

15
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.430
Ctrl Shift G
15

16
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.620
Please keep in mind that if you have organized slide layout like here, it's actually very easy for
16

17
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.220
someone to accidentally move those shapes and text boxes.
17

18
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.930
Of course, you can prevent that.
18

19
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.390
Just select the objects you want to be part of the same column and heat Ctrl G.
19

20
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.210
It's also a great opportunity to talk briefly about PowerPoint Icon Gallery.
20

21
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.310
Actually, many of the icons inside that gallery are now fully ungroupable objects.
21

22
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.630
Let's check it out.
22

23
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.700
I go to the 'Insert' tab, choose 'Icons',
23

24
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.700
and let's search by using the tag
24

25
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.680
I'm going to type 'house', for example.
25

26
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.870
OK, now I select this icon here,
26

27
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.000
and click 'Insert'.
27

28
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.800
Now I select the object,
28

29
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.120
make it bigger by pressing Ctrl and dragging the nodes in the coroner.
29

30
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.470
Now, let's assume I would like to change the color of the roof.
30

31
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.140
Of course, it cannot be done easily because the icon is grouped.
31

32
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.890
Please keep in mind that PowerPoint icons or any other vector graphics are of the Windows 
32

33
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.950
Enhanced MetaFile format (EMF)
33

34
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.580
If you want to ungroup EMF inside PowerPoint, you must press Ctrl Shift G
34

35
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.700
twice.
35

36
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.610
Remember, twice. Let's do this. I select the object, I press Ctrl Shift G once. Now, I select
36

37
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.210
'Yes',
37

38
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.390
and hit Ctrl Shift G the second time.
38

39
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.610
Now I end up with a couple of shapes and I can modify their look individually.
39

40
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.940
Shortcut #3:
40

41
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.670
Ctrl D
41

42
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.460
Ctrl D enables you to duplicate an object.
42

43
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.160
But now I will show you a magic trick which will totally change the way you design slides.
43

44
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.290
I select this rectangle here and press Ctrl D to duplicate it.
44

45
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.930
Next, I change its position without unselecting the copied shape, it's very important.
45

46
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.320
Now I press Ctrl D again.
46

47
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.340
As you can see, PowerPoint remembers the pattern and moves each new object the same distance,
47

48
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.840
and in the same direction as my last manual move.
48

49
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.640
Let's now jump to the next slide.
49

50
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.310
I would like to show you how you can use Ctrl D to build the slide
50

51
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.790
layout very quickly.
51

52
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.510
This is the typical business slide
52

53
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.160
with three header boxes and the row header on the left.
53

54
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.070
If I want to create a copy of this part here,
54

55
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.630
I need to select it,
55

56
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.410
press Ctrl G to group, Ctrl D to create a copy,
56

57
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.670
adjust the position of this group like this.
57

58
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.980
Again, my smart guides help me a lot.
58

59
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.410
And as the last step, I press Ctrl D three times.
59

60
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.520
Shortcut #4 and 5
60

61
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.790
Ctrl Shift C and Ctrl Shift V
61

62
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.370
These two shortcuts work as a format painter.
62

63
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.300
If you already know that Ctrl C copies and Ctrl V pastes, all you need to do is adding the
63

64
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.370
Shift key to memorize these shortcuts.
64

65
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.980
Let's see how they work in practice.
65

66
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.530
Select the first call out, press Ctrl Shift C.
66

67
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.570
Now, I select the second object and hit Ctrl Shift V.
67

68
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.270
The formatting of the first call out is now applied into the second one.
68

69
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.030
You might of course wonder
69

70
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.350
why this shortcut is better than the normal Format Painter available inside the 'Home' tab.
70

71
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.410
Actually, once you pick up the style, the formatting is in your memory cache all the time.
71

72
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.250
It means that you can do other things inside PowerPoint, like creating new slides or typing text,
72

73
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.090
and anytime you select a shape and press Ctrl Shift V again, you still apply the initially picked up style.
73

74
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.910
It's very convenient and it helps you to make your presentation consistent in terms of style.
74

75
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.370
Shortcut #6 and 7
75

76
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.220
Ctrl Shift <
76

77
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.780
Ctrl Shift >
77

78
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.270
What you will be constantly doing as you build your PowerPoint presentation, is changing the font sizes.
78

79
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.510
Instead of going to the dropdown list and choosing the number, you can save a bunch of time by pressing
79

80
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.220
Ctrl Shift < or
80

81
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.730
>
81

82
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.340
Let's see how it works in practice.
82

83
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.190
Here I have an organizational chart.
83

84
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.130
I would like to quickly increase the font size.
84

85
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.620
So I select the objects,
85

86
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.970
and press Ctrl Shift 
86

87
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.870
>
87

88
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.090
Now, let's move on to the table below. Here, on the other hand,
88

89
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.000
the size is too big. To change that,
89

90
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.550
I place the cursor inside the table,
90

91
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.860
press Ctrl A to select the text, and hit Ctrl Shift <.
91

92
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.190
Please keep in mind that you can use these two shortcuts in Microsoft Word as well.
92

93
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.050
Shortcut #8: Ctrl 1
93

94
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.580
Microsoft Office charts have a number of moving parts like total, series name, legends, chart titles, etc.
94

95
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:57.310
Formatting those elements by working with the right click menu like this, might be very
95

96
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.270
time consuming.
96

97
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.980
The fastest way is selecting the item you want to format and pressing Ctrl 1 shortcut. 
97

98
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.180
As you can see, the dialog box appears automatically on the right hand side of my screen,
98

99
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.780
and I am free to format whatever I want.
99

100
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:22.190
Also, keep in mind that you can use this dropdown list on the top of the menu in order to jump to the
100

101
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.490
various elements of your chart without having to select them with your mouse.
101

102
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.850
Generally, I really like this control one shortcut and I use it in other Microsoft Office applications
102

103
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.500
like Word and Excel.
103

104
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.080
Shortcut #9: F2
104

105
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:49.020
If you have an object that contains text, pressing F2 enables you to cycle between selecting the text
105

106
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.650
and selecting the object itself for moving or formatting.
106

107
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:59.190
To demonstrate how helpful the shortcut might be, I prepared an organizational chart.
107

108
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.820
This is a simple visualization of the company's structure.
108

109
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.840
Let's assume,
109

110
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:10.000
I would like to modify the text inside each rectangle by adding the name of the person occupying
110

111
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:10.770
each position.
111

112
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:17.420
If I click on the CEO, I really struggle to activate a cursor inside the shape.
112

113
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:24.110
What I can do instead is selecting the shape and pressing F2 shortcut, which automatically selects
113

114
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.680
the text.
114

115
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.570
Now, I press right arrow key to jump to the end of the line,
115

116
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:34.330
press Shift Enter to insert a soft line break, and I type the CEO name.
116

117
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.610
Great.
117

118
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:47.120
Let's do the same with the marketing manager. I select the shape, press F2, right arrow key, Shift Enter
118

119
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.890
and type the name.
119

120
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.680
Shortcut #10: F4
120

121
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.270
When you need to repeat your last action in PowerPoint, no matter what it is,
121

122
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.760
hit F4 keyboard shortcut.
122

123
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.480
Here I have two slides sharing the same layout.
123

124
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.350
You can see four photographs related to architecture,
124

125
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.300
and technology.
125

126
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.580
What I don't like is the fact that the image colors do not match my template style.
126

127
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.590
Therefore, I decided to make all of these photographs black and white.
127

128
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.230
So I select the first photo, picture format tab activates automatically
128

129
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.990
as you can see. I go to the 'Color',
129

130
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:41.490
and I choose the first option available on the list, which is Saturation 0%.
130

131
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.840
It makes my photograph black and white.
131

132
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:53.100
This action is now in my memory cash, and I can apply it onto any image inside my presentation.
132

133
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.600
Let's do this!
133

134
00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.260
I select the second photo, hit F4, the third one, hit F4 again,
134

135
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.620
and the last one.
135

136
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:09.230
OK, now I can jump to the second slide and press F4 for each image.
136

137
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.400
Personally, this is one of my favorite shortcuts in PowerPoint.
137

138
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.480
I strongly encourage you to use it in your daily work as well.
