The standard color palette in PowerPoint is limited to 10 colors and each one of them has five shades.
1

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,860
But what if I need to have more colors?
2

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:18,770
What if I work with data a lot, for example, and I need to format tables and charts showing the
3

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,000
financial performance of the company. In such situations,
4

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,070
color scales containing green, orange and red shades might be highly desirable.
5

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,150
In this chapter, I will show you how to extend number of color options in your palette and to make
6

7
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,340
them automatically appear every time you or your colleagues open the presentation.
7

8
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,940
What is important, by using the methods discussed in this chapter, you will be able to add not 5,
8

9
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,960
not 10, but actually unlimited number of colors.
9

10
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:01,820
Let's first discuss the function of XML code in PowerPoint and what tools are needed to manage this
10

11
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,900
code properly.
11

12
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,910
Thanks to XML, we can get to the inside of our .pptx and .potx files, and change things that
12

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,500
are not editable directly in PowerPoint.
13

14
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:25,450
XML is a format used to store data and can contain not only text but also binary information or media
14

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,970
like images, audio or video.
15

16
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:37,540
Generally speaking, .pptx or. potx files use a combination of XML and .zip to compress its content.
16

17
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,770
It means that you can easily unzip your PowerPoint files.
17

18
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:53,700
In this lesson, I will use one of my favorite programs called 7-zip to unpack our Acme .potx file.
18

19
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,130
Apart from 7-zip,
19

20
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,650
I will use the text editor called Visual Studio Code with XML extension.
20

21
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,310
Both programs are free and you can find all the necessary links listed here.
21

22
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,770
After completing the installation, let's open the VS Code.
22

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,410
I'm going to install the extension, which later on will help me to format text in XML.
23

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,160
I click on this rectangular icon here,
24

25
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,030
and I type XML tools.
25

26
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,080
This is the extension I'm looking for.
26

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,820
Let's click 'Install'.
27

28
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,330
It will take a few seconds.
28

29
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,210
If it's done, let's close the program to save the changes and update properly.
29

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,030
OK, now let's create a copy of the .potx file.
30

31
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,540
Now it's time to unzip it.
31

32
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,130
This is very important.
32

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,890
Select the file, right mouse click,
33

34
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,120
choose 7-zip,
34

35
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,110
'Extract to...' + actual name of the template.
35

36
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:29,140
As you can see, the folder appeared. Please keep in mind that removing any files or folders from unzipped
36

37
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,390
.potx file can irreversibly break the template down.
37

38
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,910
So, be very careful and always create a backup version before you decide to modify anything.
38

39
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:44,850
OK.
39

40
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,620
Now let's see what can be found inside the folder and how the typical structure of .potx file looks
40

41
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:52,920
like.
41

42
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,050
Just for the sake of demonstration, I open the ppt folder.
42

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,360
Next, I navigate to the media.
43

44
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,940
And here you can find all the images originally used in the template.
44

45
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:15,250
As you can see, this is a great way to get an access to all presentation graphics with just one click.
45

46
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,280
OK, let's go back.
46

47
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,390
As you can see inside the unzipped template folder
47

48
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:29,170
we also have coded versions of notes, layouts, slide master and slides.
48

49
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,590
This is how it looks like.
49

50
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,490
Let's go back.
50

51
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,260
The folder I am particularly interested in is called 'theme'.
51

52
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,470
Let's open it.
52

53
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,410
There are three files inside.
53

54
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,470
The theme 1 controls the look of the Slide Master's color palette.
54

55
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,380
I'm going to modify this file in order to add new custom colors to my Acme template.
55

56
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,560
Let's create a backup version first.
56

57
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,300
I select this file,
57

58
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,640
press Ctrl C to copy.
58

59
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:21,060
I go back to the folder where I store all Acme template files and I press Ctrl V to paste.
59

60
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:29,670
Once it's done, let's jump to the second movie where I will demonstrate step by step how to quickly
60

61
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,550
program custom color palette interior template.
