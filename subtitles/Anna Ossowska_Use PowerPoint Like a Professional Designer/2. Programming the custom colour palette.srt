1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,660
This is the palette I want to add to the template's .potx file.
1

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:14,780
I assume that potential user of Acme template might use these colors in charts and tables showing financial
2

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,340
performance of the company.
3

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,270
As you can see, we have five colors in overall.
4

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,660
Red represents negative values.
5

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,020
Orange represents medium and green
6

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,370
positive values.
7

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,380
I put all these colors into PowerPoint table. In a moment,
8

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,920
you'll see why.
9

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:43,450
Now I select everything that is inside it by placing cursor like this, and pressing
10

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,230
Ctrl A shortcut.
11

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,470
Next, I press Ctrl C to copy.
12

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:57,370
As a next step, let's open the Excel file called XML Code Generator.
13

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:06,150
I'm going to use this file to get RGB values of five copied colors and convert them to HEX.
14

15
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,820
Also, Excel will automatically generate the XML Code for me.
15

16
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,130
As a reminder, PowerPoint uses RGB color scale by default.
16

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,850
XML, on the other hand, uses the HEX scale.
17

18
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,750
HEX color is expressed as a six-digit combination of numbers and letters.
18

19
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,110
It is a shorthand for its RGB values with a little conversion gymnastics in between.
19

20
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:46,500
I select this cell, navigate to the 'Paste Special' options and choose 'Keep Source Formatting'.
20

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,730
As you can see, my macro did the conversion in just one second.
21

22
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:03,770
Now, let's change the color names into 'Negative 1', 'Negative 2', 'Medium', 'Positive 1' and
22

23
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,030
'Positive 2'.
23

24
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,300
Actually, you can put any names you like.
24

25
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,110
However, please keep in mind that this cell cannot be empty.
25

26
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,470
Otherwise, the macro will not work properly.
26

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,160
OK, I have all the names properly inserted and the conversion into HEX is ready.
27

28
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,960
The next step is extremely important.
28

29
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,800
Doing it well is actually the key to success.
29

30
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,980
I'm going to switch to the second tab,
30

31
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,830
and copy this code here.
31

32
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,380
OK,
32

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,000
but we are working in Excel right? What we have here is a formula.
33

34
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:53,280
Actually, it cannot be copied and pasted directly into VS Code because we will get errors.
34

35
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,110
Instead, copy the code,
35

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,390
select this cell here,
36

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,650
navigate to the 'Paste Special' options,
37

38
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,500
and paste everything as values.
38

39
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,530
OK, as a last step, let's copy everything
39

40
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,170
once again.
40

41
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,620
Now, be careful, navigate to the 'Theme 1' file we copied in the previous movie.
41

42
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,520
Right mouse click and choose
42

43
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,050
'Open with Code'.
43

44
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,210
We have a 'Theme 1' file opened in a VS Code.
44

45
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,700
Now press Alt Shift F
45

46
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,940
to format the document and get a better view.
46

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,110
As the next step, I'm going to click at these right arrows to shorten the code and focus on the main structure.
47

48
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,600
This step is very important.
48

49
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,440
I'm going to paste the code generated by Excel.
49

50
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,360
I place my cursor after this tag here.
50

51
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,250
Now I press Ctrl V to paste.
51

52
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,850
Perfect, our code is here!
52

53
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,650
I'm going to save the changes.
53

54
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,280
Now I can close the Visual Studio.
54

55
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,350
It is time to go back to my template folder.
55

56
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,850
This is the theme file
56

57
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,050
I've just modified.
57

58
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,540
I'm going to build it into my Acme .potx file by using 7-zip.
58

59
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,200
I right mouse click on the .potx file,
59

60
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,580
I choose 7-zip,
60

61
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,080
'Open archive',
61

62
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,220
I navigate to the 'ppt'
62

63
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,780
and choose 'theme'.
63

64
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,770
Now I drag and drop the modified file into the zipped file.
64

65
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,850
Do I really want to do this?
65

66
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,110
Yes.
66

67
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,730
OK.
67

68
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,500
We did it!
68

69
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,300
Let's test it out.
69

70
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,160
I'm going to close the 7-zip window and open my .potx file.
70

71
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,930
Now I click at a random placeholder and check out the font color options.
71

72
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,260
Perfect!
72

73
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,950
All the colors are now here in the correct order, just as I put them in the XML code.
