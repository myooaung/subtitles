To sum up this lesson, when you first start learning the keyboard shortcuts, you might not feel any
1

2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.030
faster. Actually,
2

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.750
you might feel slower.
3

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.200
That's because it's something totally new for your brain,
4

5
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.240
and therefore, it might be uncomfortable.
5

6
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.230
I really know this feeling.
6

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.880
But trust me, the fastest people in PowerPoint use shortcuts and that can be you.
7

8
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.880
So don't give up and practice.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.480
The best method of memorizing, which I can recommend, is using the sticky notes, you can just write
9

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.930
down a number of shortcuts and place it to your computer screen.
10

11
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.230
You can also use the sticky notes application for Windows. And, of course, put your shortcuts to use
11

12
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.200
every time you work on any presentation.
