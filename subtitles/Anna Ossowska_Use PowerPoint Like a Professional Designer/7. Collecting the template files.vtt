00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.550
In this movie, I will discuss how to manage your template files before you decide to share them with
1

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.330
other people.
2

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.720
I am sure this will help you to avoid any potential problems and confusion.
3

4
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.980
Step number one, Save as Template.
4

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.740
If you follow my steps, but you have not yet saved your Acme .potx file, navigate to the File,
5

6
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.190
'Save As' options,
6

7
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.730
and choose the .potx directly from the list.
7

8
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.480
As I have mentioned before, it is also a good practice to store all your template files in the folder
8

9
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.300
having the same name as a .potx file.
9

10
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.970
Step number two, 'Save as Theme'.
10

11
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.480
To save a template theme, open the .potx file,
11

12
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.440
navigate to the File tab,
12

13
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.710
'Save As',
13

14
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.110
and choose 'Office Theme (.thmx)'.
14

15
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.650
Make sure you save it in the same folder as your .potx file.
15

16
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.810
Step number three: include font installation files.
16

17
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.890
There are some very popular and easily accessible fonts like Arial or Verdana, but it might happen
17

18
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.880
that your template uses fonts which are not normally available inside Microsoft Office applications.
18

19
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.900
This is very important.
19

20
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.920
If you prepare a PowerPoint presentation on the basis of such a template and you open it on another
20

21
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.160
computer or send it out to someone else who does not have these fonts installed, your slides will
21

22
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.280
look differently.
22

23
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.660
In other words, PowerPoint will find a font substitute.
23

24
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.160
Here comes an example.
24

25
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.690
This is a slide I prepared on another computer where I have two 'Abadi' fonts installed.
25

26
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.520
If I open it on this computer without prior Abadi font installation, PowerPoint will use the font substitute,
26

27
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.840
which is Calibri and will not inform me about this fact.
27

28
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.860
If I click on a random text placeholder and check the font list, you can see that these fonts
28

29
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.480
are not displayed correctly.
29

30
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.440
They both have the same look although, as their name informs me,
30

31
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.640
one is Regular,
31

32
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.430
and the second one is ExtraLight.
32

33
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.820
This is the proof that, yes, Abadi fonts are indeed assigned to my template, but they need to be
33

34
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.990
downloaded and properly installed to be seen.
34

35
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.530
To avoid such problems in the future,
35

36
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.540
make sure that you put all the so-called 'exotic' fonts inside your template folder so that anyone can install
36

37
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.150
them at any time.
37

38
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.150
For example,
38

39
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.690
this is the template I used to prepare the slide you have just seen.
39

40
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.220
Inside it, I have properly named .potx and .thmx file.
40

41
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.140
And you can also see a 'Fonts' folder.
41

42
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.900
If I go inside, I have all Abadi fonts' installation files available.
42

43
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.280
To install the fonts,
43

44
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.440
I make sure that PowerPoint is closed, I right mouse click on the font file,
44

45
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.150
and choose 'Install'.
45

46
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.170
I repeat the same procedure for the second file.
46

47
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.240
Now, I open the slide I showed you before,
47

48
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.890
and as you can see, fonts are here and everything is displayed correctly.
48

49
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.090
Step number four, create example slides.
49

50
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.040
It is a good practice to include example slide presentation inside your template folder.
50

51
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.460
This will give the future users of your template some direction regarding style and design.
51

52
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.810
At minimum, create samples for Title Slide layout and Title Only layout.
52

53
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.200
Try to include an example of chart, table,
53

54
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.240
call out, as well as default line, shape and text box.
54

55
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.520
Here comes the examples slide file I created for Acme template.
55

56
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:01.590
To sum up,
56

57
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.610
follow all the steps discussed in this movie, and I can assure you that you will avoid many potential
57

58
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:15.000
problems with your templates and your presentation creating process will be very fast and smooth.
