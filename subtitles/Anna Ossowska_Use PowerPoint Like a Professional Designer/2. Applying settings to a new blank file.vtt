00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:07.600
In this movie, I'm going to show you how to build a professional PowerPoint template from scratch.
1

2
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.250
Also, chances are that .potx files you store on your computer are very difficult to work with or
2

3
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.910
are broken.
3

4
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.280
These module about templates will for sure help you to fix it.
4

5
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.560
I want to be 100 percent honest with you.
5

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.950
One of the first things I learned as a business graphic designer was that a properly built template can
6

7
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.210
really save you hundreds of hours building and editing your slides.
7

8
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.990
In addition, you should know that you can easily share the .potx template files with other people,
8

9
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.050
which is especially convenient if you work on a big and time-consuming projects.
9

10
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.560
OK, are you ready to build the template?
10

11
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.750
Let's get it started!
11

12
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.230
The very first thing I'm going to do is creating a new blank presentation.
12

13
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:16.670
Next, I'm going to define the page size. To do so, I jump to the 'Design' tab and choose 'Slide Size'.
13

14
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.530
You have two options available in your dropdown:
14

15
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.640

16
4:3
15

17
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.740
and 16:9.
16

18
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.050
Which slide size is better,
17

19
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.950
you might ask.
18

20
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.910
I have good news in 90 percent of instances,
19

21
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.280
I choose wide-screen.
20

22
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.670
Why?
21

23
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.470
It works best on new screens with a wide aspect ratio,
22

24
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.900
like new projectors, TVs, LCDs and online platforms like youtube
23

25
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.880
for example.
24

26
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.500

27
4:3, on the other hand, is a good choice
25

28
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.730
if you have older screens with low resolutions , old projectors or if you use online presentation sharing
26

29
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.340
platforms like SlideShare, for example.
27

30
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:15.550
However, if for any reason you want to set a different size for your slides than the two aforementioned,
28

31
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.670
just click add the 'Custom Slide Size' command.
29

32
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.250
The window will open,
30

33
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.070
and here you can type in your dimensions.
31

34
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.010
Or you can choose more options from a dropdown list.
32

35
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.220
OK, now I'm going to change the theme colors.
33

36
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.640
If you follow my steps, please open an Acme_colors.pptx file inside which you can find the colors
34

37
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.410
with printed RGB values.
35

38
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.620
We are going to embed them into our template. By the way, Acme is the name of a fictional company
36

39
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.800
for which we are going to create a PowerPoint template.
37

40
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.170
As a next step, please arrange your screen in a way you see the printed RGB values and the blank PowerPoint
38

41
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.100
presentation.
39

42
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.480
Once it's done, navigate to the 'Design' tab, click on the little arrow here,
40

43
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.000
and choose 'Customize Colors' command.
41

44
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.250
Inside this window, you can see 12 colors which are currently used by PowerPoint.
42

45
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.540
The first four options include two white and two dark colors.
43

46
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.640
The relationship between light and dark theme colors is crucial because it ensures that your text
44

47
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.000
is visible regardless of the slide background you will choose.
45

48
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.590
Now, let's change the first four color options.
46

49
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.830
Let's start with the 'Dark 1'.
47

50
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.340
I put the RGB value, which is (0, 0, 0).
48

51
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.390
Now, let's edit 'Light 1'. The RGB value is 255 for each channel.
49

52
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.690
Now, I change color of 'Dark 2'.
50

53
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.940
And 'Light 2'.
51

54
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.190
OK, great.
52

55
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:46.290
Now, let's discuss the other six colors, which are named as 'Accent 1, 2, 3', etc.
53

56
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.150
What you should know, they populate various galleries within PowerPoint.
54

57
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.880
They appear in shape styles,
55

58
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.040
table styles,
56

59
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.020
SmartArt graphics galleries and many others.
57

60
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:18.420
What is important, charts automatically populate with accent colors in order from 'Accent 1' to 6.
58

61
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.530
As a next step, let's put six Accent RGB values into our blank files,
59

62
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.820
plus two RGB values, which will control the look of hyperlinks.
60

63
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.920
OK.
61

64
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.750
This is the final effect.
62

65
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.130
As a last step, let's change the name of color palette into Acme.
63

66
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.540
_
64

67
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.960
16.9
65

68
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.430
And now click 'Save'. Perfect!
66

69
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.310
Now the colors are ready to be used.
67

70
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.900
If you want to learn how I've made my decision about these color options and how to design a beautiful
68

71
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.660
color palette inside PowerPoint, jump to this video available in Module 3.
69

72
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.330
Now, let's discuss the fonts and how to set them properly for your template.
70

73
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.640
As a first step, please navigate to the 'Design' tab.
71

74
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.710
Choose 'Fonts',
72

75
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.950
and 'Customize Fonts'.
73

76
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.480
Choose 'Trebuchet MS' for headings,
74

77
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.370
and  'Trebuchet MS'
75

78
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.170
for body font. Great!
76

79
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.760
Now it's time to rename the fontset.
77

80
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.280
I will type Acme
78

81
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.050
_
79

82
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.520
16.9, the very same option I used four color palettes.
80

83
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:07.740
Again, Acme is the name of the fictional company, and 16.9 indicates that my template
81

84
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.600
is wide-screen.
82

85
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:15.690
Generally, I would like to encourage you to make it a habit and to name your template elements in the
83

86
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.650
consistent way.
84

87
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.070
It will help you to manage your template files and quickly find the appropriate custom settings
85

88
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.330
if something goes wrong.
86

89
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.050
OK, here it comes.
87

90
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.430
Now, if I create a random shape and put some text inside, you can see that the font has changed
88

91
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.450
into 'Trebuchet'.
89

92
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.960
And there was no need to make this changes manually.
90

93
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.410
This is the real power of 'Design' tab.
91

94
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.030
As a last step, I'm going to apply Theme Effects and Background Styles.
92

95
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:58.850
Again, navigate to the 'Design' tab, click on this little arrow here to expand.
93

96
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.370
Now, make sure you have this first option selected.
94

97
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.690
Now, let's go to the 'Background Styles',
95

98
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.600
and make sure the white color is selected.
96

99
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:17.810
As you can see in this particular case PowerPoint by default assigned the right Effect and Background
97

100
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.470
Styles.
98

101
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.040
To sum up this lesson, you have just made
99

102
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.800
the first step in creating a professional PowerPoint template.
100

103
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:39.560
Now you know how to properly define your page size and which base sizes are most recommended.
101

104
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:49.040
You also know how to apply theme colors, theme fonts, as well as theme effects and background styles.
