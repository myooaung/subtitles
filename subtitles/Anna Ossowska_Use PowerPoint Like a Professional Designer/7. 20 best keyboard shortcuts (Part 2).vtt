00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.800
Now it's time to talk about the top shortcuts for managing presentations.
1

2
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.660
Shortcut #11: Ctrl M
2

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.290
As you work on your presentation, you are constantly adding new slides.
3

4
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.390
Normally, you can do this by going to the 'Home' tab, clicking
4

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.790
the 'New Slide' command, and choosing the right layout,
5

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.910
which, of course, takes time.
6

7
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.580
Instead, just hit Ctrl M,
7

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.930
and the new slide will appear based on that last used layout. In my case, this is the 'Title Only'.
8

9
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.680
Shortcut #12, Shift + Normal View icon. The standard way of going to the Slide Master
9

10
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.850
is going to the 'View'  tab, and clicking the 'Slide Master' icon.
10

11
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.880
Of course, there is much more convenient way to do this.
11

12
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.700
Just press Shift and click on the 'Normal View' icon, which you can find here at the bottom part of your
12

13
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.180
screen.
13

14
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.760
Notice that I was taken to the 'Title Only' layout first, because this is the layout I'm currently
14

15
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.090
on.
15

16
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.020
If I press Shift and 'Normal View' icon once again, PowerPoint takes me to the Parent layout which controls
16

17
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.730
the look of the whole presentation.
17

18
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.950
You can get more information how to program your Slide Master
18

19
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.590
in part two of this course. And to go back to your normal view,
19

20
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.790
just click on the 'Close Master View' command.
20

21
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.240
Shortcut #13 and 14.
21

22
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.270
F5 and Shift F5
22

23
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.040
To start slideshow from the current slide, press Shift F5 shortcut.
23

24
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.990
I strongly advise you to use this shortcut often in the process of building your presentation.
24

25
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.490
Why?
25

26
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.210
It simply allows you to see what your audience will see,
26

27
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.720
and even more importantly, helps you to catch any potential mistakes like wrong alignment or bad
27

28
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.310
picture quality, which will go unseen using the normal slide view.
28

29
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.560
F5 alone,
29

30
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.360
on the other hand, runs the presentation from the very beginning.
30

31
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.050
So, whenever you start presenting, press F5.
31

32
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.390
Shortcut #15 and 16
32

33
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.270
Ctrl A
33

34
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.940
Ctrl H
34

35
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.940
Is this pesky white arrow bother you when you are presenting?
35

36
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.350
If you find that indeed it might distract your audience, you can easily hide it.
36

37
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.040
Generally, the pointer automatically disappears after three seconds of inactivity, and it reappears
37

38
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.150
when you move the mouse.
38

39
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.040
But you can force it to disappear whenever you like by simply pressing Ctrl H.
39

40
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.870
However, this isn't a toggle operation. Pressing 
40

41
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.140
Ctrl H again doesn't make the pointer reappear.
41

42
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.360
To display the pointer again, press 
42

43
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.810
Ctrl A.
43

44
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.700
To memorize these shortcuts.
44

45
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.920
Just think of H for 'Hide',
45

46
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.080
and A four 'Arrow'.
46

47
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.210
Shortcut #17
47

48
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.010
Ctrl Shift H
48

49
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.830
The Notes Pane is a place where you put additional information that doesn't appear on slides during
49

50
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:34.610
presenting.
50

51
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.430
You can open it by pressing Ctrl Shift H.
51

52
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.090
Use the same keyboard shortcut to close it.
52

53
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.680
What is important,
53

54
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.110
you can easily change the look of your Notes Pane.
54

55
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.650
For example, you can manipulate the height of your window to any level you want by simply dragging.
55

56
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.650
Please keep in mind that inside the Notes Pane
56

57
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.360
you can also display bold, italic or underlines.
57

58
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.000
You can also use numbered or bulleted list.
58

59
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.250
You can zoom in and zoom out like this by scrolling with your mouse.
59

60
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.060
Another good reason you might start to use Ctrl Shift H shortcut is that any text you put to your
60

61
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.670
Notes Pane would appear inside the presenter mode. To open the presenter mode,
61

62
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.220
press Alt Shift F5.
62

63
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:44.350
This is what audience will see, and this is the part which is seen by you only. The notes can be easily
63

64
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.650
revised and can help you in delivering the content.
