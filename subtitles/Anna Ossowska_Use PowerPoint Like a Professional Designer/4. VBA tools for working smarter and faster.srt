00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,590
The Quick Tools add-in is divided into three groups.
1

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,050
'Shapes and Pictures', 'Align precisely',
2

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,630
and 'RGB Picker'.
3

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's start with discussing the first group: 'Shapes and Pictures'.
4

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,670
All these tools will help you to change the size of your objects very quickly.
5

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,660
The red button picks up the attribute and places it in the memory cache, whereas the green button applies
6

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,440
the attribute.
7

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,120
Let's jump to this slide to see these tools in action.
8

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,530
I will pick up attributes of red rectangles, and apply them onto green shapes.
9

10
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,730
Let's select the first rectangle named 'Size and Position'.
10

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,450
I go to the Quick Tools add-in, and then click at the red button to pick up its size and position.
11

12
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,310
Next, I select the second rectangle,
12

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,490
and this time, I click at the green button.
13

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,040
As you can see, my macro automatically changes
14

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,480
dimension and position of the second shape.
15

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,410
Now, I'm going to show you how 'Width and Position' works.
16

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,100
I select the first rectangle,
17

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,530
click at the red button to pick up attributes.
18

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,690
Next, I select the second rectangle and click at the green button.
19

20
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:29,850
As you can see, my macro automatically changes the width and position of the second shape. The height
20

21
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,020
stays unchanged.
21

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,440
Now, let's test out 'Height and Position'.
22

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,750
I pick up attributes and apply them on the second shape.
23

24
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,270
This time, height and position changes. The width stays unchanged.
24

25
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,810
Now, let's test out
25

26
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,470
'Size'
26

27
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,470
I pick up, and apply.
27

28
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,530
As you can see, the dimension of the second shape changes, but the object stays on the same position.
28

29
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,330
Next, I'm going to test out 'Width'.
29

30
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,520
I pick it up, and apply.
30

31
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,130
Now it's time to test out 
31

32
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:12,730
'Height'.
32

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,160
I pick up, and apply.
33

34
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,610
Perfect!
34

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,350
I can assure you, this is a real time saver.
35

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:30,230
These macros work on virtually all object types inside PowerPoint: shapes, text boxes, images,
36

37
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,790
charts and tables.
37

38
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,720
Another advantage which makes them so helpful is that once you pick up the style, the formatting is
38

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,370
in your memory cash all the time.
39

40
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:46,610
It means that you can do other things inside PowerPoint, like typing text or creating new slides, and
40

41
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,860
anytime you select an object and press the green button, you still apply
41

42
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,140
the initially picked up attributes.
42

43
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,400
Now, let's get familiar with the second group of macros: 'Align precisely'.
43

44
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:09,210
These tools work quite similar to the 'native' align PowerPoint tools. You can use them to align objects
44

45
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,810
left, right, top, bottom, middle and center.
45

46
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,710
What makes them different is that the first selected object is the point of reference for the second,
46

47
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,080
no matter position and size.
47

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,210
The purpose of this group of slides is to visualize this difference.
48

49
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,770
I select the first object, press Shift to select the second one,
49

50
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,770
I go to the alignment tools added to their Quick Access Toolbar and click 'Align Center'.
50

51
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,940
As you can see, the alignment is not precise.
51

52
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,400
Power Point moves two shapes.
52

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:53,620
Why? The reason is that the central point of the grey shape is too far away from the central point of the
53

54
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,220
green one.
54

55
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,550
Now, let's see how my 'Align Center' macro will perform the same task.
55

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,500
I select the first shape.
56

57
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,910
Remember, the first selected shape is the point of reference for the others.
57

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,690
Then, I press Shift to select the second one, and choose 'Align Center'.
58

59
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,070
As you can see, shapes are now perfectly aligned!
59

60
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,600
Now, let's switch to the next slide.
60

61
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,210
This time, I will align shapes top.
61

62
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,760
Let's start with the 'native' alignment tools.
62

63
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,450
I select two shapes and choose 'Align Top' command.
63

64
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,690
Now, let's use the Quick Tools.
64

65
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,860
Select two shapes.
65

66
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,240
I go to my add-in, and choose 'Align Top'. Perfect!
66

67
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,630
Now, let's get familiar with the last macro: RGB Picker.
67

68
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,940
The function of this tool is very simple:
68

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,230
it reads and prints out
69

70
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,260
RGB values of selected shapes.
70

71
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:03,430
What you need to know for now is that PowerPoint by default uses RGB color model.
71

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,930
If this sounds strange,
72

73
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,880
don't worry! I will explain
73

74
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,140
this concept in more detail later on, when I will teach you how to program color palettes inside PowerPoint.
74

75
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,320
Now, let's see how RGB Picker works in practice.
75

76
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,180
Here you can see a number of rectangles.
76

77
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,820
Each one has a different color. To get the RGB values in just a few seconds,
77

78
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,220
select the rectangles by using a loop selection and click at the RGB Picker command.
78

79
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,230
As you can see, all the values are now here!
79

80
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,210
Let's make a test and check out
80

81
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:46,420
if they are correct indeed. I select, the first color, go to shape fill options, choose 'More field
81

82
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,180
colors',
82

83
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,380
and let's compare the values.
83

84
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,590
Perfect!
84

85
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,090
Everything is fine.
85

86
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:01,940
To sum up, all these VBA tools help me in my daily work, and it is a pleasure that I can share them
86

87
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,390
with you.
87

88
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,260
Also, it will be great to hear what you think about them.
88

89
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,720
Please feel free to leave me a comment.
89

90
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,080
I also prepared a number of exercises which will help you to get familiar with these macros.
90

91
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,330
I can assure you that all of these tools will be used many times throughout this course.
91

92
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:27,200
This will help you to retain the information and of course, will serve as the additional form of exercise.
