00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:08,390
In this movie, I will show you how to create and quickly animate the timeline slide using the Morph
1

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,860
tool.
2

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,870
This is the animation we are going to build from scratch.
3

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,240
Are you ready?
4

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,950
Let's get it started.
5

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,190
As the first step, I'm going to insert the photographs on my slide.
6

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,150
I make a loop selection inside my folder, press Ctrl C to copy,
7

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,000
and Ctrl V to paste.
8

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,330
I select all photographs by using the loop selection, and decrease the size
9

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,380
by pressing Shift Ctrl and dragging to the inside.
10

11
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,600
Once it's done, let's position all the pictures next to each other.
11

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,240
We don't need to be very meticulous here.
12

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,660
I just try to get some space.
13

14
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:09,850
Next, I want to create circles out of these images. As you probably remember from the previous lesson
14

15
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,440
about managing photographs inside PowerPoint,
15

16
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,450
I must crop each image down to 1:1 aspect ratio.
16

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,790
Unfortunately, we cannot format all the pictures at once.
17

18
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,010
Each item must be modified independently.
18

19
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:32,500
By doing this, I get the perfect squares, which means that my circles will have a uniform diameter
19

20
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,040
the whole way across.
20

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,830
Next, I select my pictures once again,
21

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,040
navigate to 'Crop to Shape' options,
22

23
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,100
and choose oval.
23

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,580
Next, I want to make sure my pictures have the uniform width and height, so I navigate to the Picture
24

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,460
Format tab and check out dimensions.
25

26
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,470
OK.
26

27
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,290
Everything is fine.
27

28
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,090
Now, I change the position of my first and last picture,
28

29
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,600
select everything,
29

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,290
click at the 'Align Top' macro,
30

31
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,500
and distribute objects horizontally using the native alignment tools.
31

32
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,860
Next, I group everything by using the Ctrl G shortcut, and I use the native alignment tools
32

33
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,590
once again.
33

34
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,410
This time, I align images center to the slide area.
34

35
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,230
Once it's done, I can ungroup my objects by pressing Ctrl Shift
35

36
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,150
G shortcut.
36

37
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,060
Now it's time to visually connect images.
37

38
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,000
So, I create a line,
38

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,930
and drag like this.
39

40
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,610
If you do this precisely, you should see the small green nodes on the both line ends.
40

41
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:37,990
Great!
41

42
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,640
Now it's time to type years.
42

43
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,450
I create the first text box.
43

44
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,400
I type 1980.
44

45
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,210
I make the font bigger.
45

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,320
20 points is just fine.
46

47
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,560
They also change the font into light gray,
47

48
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,950
I copy the text box four times using the Ctrl D shortcut.
48

49
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,830
And now it's time to center the first and the last
49

50
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,560
textbox with the images.
50

51
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,040
As I have my two text boxes properly positioned,
51

52
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,220
I select and distribute everything horizontally.
52

53
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,850
I also align objects top using the Quick Tools.
53

54
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:53,530
I am also going to create placeholders which will serve as descriptions. To save time press Ctrl
54

55
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,000
Shift and drag.
55

56
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,500
My smart guides helped me to position shapes vertically.
56

57
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,760
Now, let's reduce the font a little bit to 16 points.
57

58
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,880
And let's type the dummy text inside.
58

59
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,150
Text 1, text 2 and so on and so forth.
59

60
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,590
Great!
60

61
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,320
Now it's time to type years.
61

62
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,420
OK.
62

63
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:47,520
This slide will play the role of a scaffolding so to say. Throughout this movie, I'm going to copy
63

64
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,170
this slide multiple times.
64

65
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,210
Let's create the first copy
65

66
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,340
by pressing Ctrl D shortcut.
66

67
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,330
I will start with modifying the font style of my year.
67

68
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,480
I am going to change it into orange,
68

69
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,440
and bold it by pressing Ctrl B shortcut.
69

70
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,540
The rest of text boxes on the top should stay as they are.
70

71
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,180
I also modify the color of description.
71

72
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,670
I change into white.
72

73
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,940
The next step is removing all the descriptions except for the first one.
73

74
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:31,940
As the last thing, I increase the size of the first circle by pressing Ctrl Shift and dragging to
74

75
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,750
the outside.
75

76
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,840
By doing this, I fix the center of this image, this is very important.
76

77
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,200
Now it's time to create the second copy.
77

78
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:50,580
I select my first slide, press Ctrl D and move the copied slide to the end of the list.
78

79
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,960
Now, I'm going to apply the same formatting changes as before, but I will concentrate on the second
79

80
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,740
group of objects represented by 1988.
80

81
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,260
So, I modify the font style,
81

82
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,970
and remove the unnecessary text boxes.
82

83
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:25,330
I jump to my previous slide, select the biggest photo, navigate to the Quick Tools add-in and pick up the size.
83

84
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,820
Next, I go back to my last slide and apply the size
84

85
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,530
by pressing the green button.
85

86
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,020
As the last step, I align this image middle with the other circles,
86

87
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,140
and distribute three images horizontally.
87

88
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,020
I also make sure my lines are properly connected.
88

89
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,590
I see these little green nodes on both sides, which means that everything is well adjusted.
89

90
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,960
Next, I create the third copy.
90

91
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,030
And move the slide to the end of the list.
91

92
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,200
Now, I concentrate on the third group of objects represented by 2001.
92

93
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,920
I modify the font style,
93

94
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,760
and remove the unnecessary textboxes.
94

95
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,920
Now it's time to make my third image bigger.
95

96
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:36,420
Please keep in mind that I still have the size of the biggest circle in the memory cache, so I can easily
96

97
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,240
apply it onto other objects whenever I like.
97

98
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,820
This is very convenient!
98

99
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,140
Now, I will create additional two copies of my first slide and repeat all the actions I've just showed
99

100
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,360
you.
100

101
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,310
OK.
101

102
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,580
I finished the formatting.
102

103
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,680
If you follow my steps, please make sure that your slides look in this way.
103

104
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,660
I use F5 keyboard shortcut to run the presentation from the beginning,
104

105
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,720
this is slide number one, my scaffolding,
105

106
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,860
slide number two,
106

107
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,420
slide number three, four, five...
107

108
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,550
and six. As you can see, all the shapes are perfectly aligned,
108

109
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,510
and if I go from one slide into another, the objects do not jump.
109

110
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:49,500
OK, before I apply the Morph animation, I would like to change one thing.
110

111
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,600
I want to make the smaller photos black and white.
111

112
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,510
This is the quickest method I know.
112

113
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,200
I select the small picture on the second slide,
113

114
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,380
I navigate to the Picture Format tab,
114

115
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:12,370
click at 'Color' and select the first option inside the pop-up window, which is 'Saturation 0%'.
115

116
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:19,810
Now I select each small image separately and press F4 key to repeat the last action.
116

117
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,890
I do the same thing for the rest of slides.
117

118
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,640
Once it's done, I can remove the first slide.
118

119
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,440
I no longer need it.
119

120
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,700
Now it's time to apply the Morph transition!
120

121
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,430
I select the top slide, press Shift and click at the last one.
121

122
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,910
I navigate to the Transitions tab and I choose 'Morph'.
122

123
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,930
I will also reduce the duration
123

124
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:56,510
a little bit.
124

125
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,440
Now, let's see how it works!
125

126
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,530
I press F5 keyboard shortcut,
126

127
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,260
and here it comes!
127

128
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:16,030
As you can see, the Morph tool animates and moves your objects in just one click.
128

129
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,430
Achieving the same visual effect using the standard animations inside the Animation pane,
129

130
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,730
would take hours.
130

131
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:30,160
This is the main reason why so many people, including me, love this new, PowerPoint feature.
