Always update your Quick Access Toolbar by including the commands that you use most often.

2
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.050
Basically, the toolbar acts like your favorites.
2

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.480
And it saves you time in a way that you don't have to switch between different ribbon tabs to find the
3

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.250
button you need most.

5
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.540
Here, on the top of the screen, you can see the default PowerPoint

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.650
Quick Access Toolbar.

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.120
To add something to this bar, right mouse click
7

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.020
and select 'Add to quick access to bar'.
8

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.430
The new command automatically appears at the end of the ribbon.

10
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.820
To remove it, right mouse click and choose 'Remove from the Quick Access Toolbar'.
10

11
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.380
You can also add buttons, which are not available right away.
11

12
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.210
Just click at this little arrow, and select 'More commands'.
12

13
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.540
Here, you can control virtually everything.
13

14
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.340
You can search for 'popular commands', commands not available in the ribbon and 'all commands' as well.
14

15
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.460
Let's select...
15

16
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.100
Add a chart, for example, and push it to the top of the list.
16

17
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.640
What helps you to organize the list is inserting separators. To add one, just click on the separator button, 'Add',
17

18
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.520
And push it up using the arrow buttons.
18

19
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.820
Another option is to choose whether you want your Quick Access Toolbar to be default for all documents,
19

20
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.500
or add specific features only for one particular document.
20

21
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.880
For example, if it happens that you need to format a presentation containing huge amount of photographs,
21

22
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.490
you can add picture features only to the Quick Access Toolbar available inside this file,
22

23
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.550
and they will show up every time you open it.
23

24
00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.780
That's the basic overview of how to organize your working environment, using that Quick Access Toolbar
