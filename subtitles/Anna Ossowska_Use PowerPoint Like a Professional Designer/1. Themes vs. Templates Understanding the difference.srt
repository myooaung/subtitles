In talking to my clients, I have discovered a lot of confusion surrounding PowerPoint themes and templates.
1

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:15,530
That's completely understandable because themes and templates are quite similar and contain many of the
2

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,550
same elements.
3

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:25,150
In this movie, you will learn: the differences between themes and templates, which elements make up
4

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,640
a theme,
5

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,120
and which elements make up the template.
6

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,930
The theme file having the .thmx extension is Office-wide, which means that PowerPoint, Word and
7

8
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,450
Excel can share a set of common colors, fonts, effects and backgrounds styles.
8

9
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:54,120
Generally, themes are a great tool when you need to create a document or report by using these three
9

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,950
Microsoft Office applications.
10

11
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:04,830
In other words, if you apply, office themes to your PowerPoint, Word and Excel, files are harmonized and
11

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,540
look like they really go together.
12

13
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,500
Here comes the example of three documents.
13

14
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,340
Each one is using the same the .thmx file.
14

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:30,840
A theme, on the other hand, consists of four main parts: colors, fonts, effects and
15

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,440
background styles.
16

17
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,820
Please keep in mind that all of these elements might be embedded in a template as well.
17

18
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,850
To find out which theme is used by default inside PowerPoint, navigate to the Design tab,
18

19
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,570
click the little arrow to expand.
19

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,810
And here comes the color palette window,
20

21
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,180
fonts, effects and background styles.
21

22
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,570
The template .potx is a starter file made for PowerPoint.
22

23
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:19,630
In other words, a template is the scaffolding of your document, a pre-formatted file that saves you
23

24
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,710
time and helps you to create consistent looking documents.
24

25
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:34,810
A typical PowerPoint template consists of a Slide 
Master. To navigate to your PowerPoint Slide Master,
25

26
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:42,700
simply go the 'View' tab and select the Slide Master command in your ribbon or use the shortcut.
26

27
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,200
Do you remember that?
27

28
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,310
It's Shift + Normal View icon.
28

29
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,400
OK, we are here.
29

30
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,840
If you look on the left side of the window, you can see a list of layouts. The top one is a Slide
30

31
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,780
Master, which I like to call a 'parent layout'.
31

32
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,200
This one controls the look of the smaller ones called child layouts.
32

33
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,580
Let's make a test and put the small rectangle in the upper right corner of the parent slide.
33

34
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,670
As you can see, the shape appeared on some other child layouts as well.
34

35
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,680
Why, you might ask?
35

36
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,540
When edit a parent layout, all layouts that are based on it will contain those edits as well.
36

37
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:45,480
Also, please keep in mind that inside the typical template, you will find the placeholders for tag lines
37

38
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,890
footers, page numbers, content and even images.
38

39
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,650
I know that the concept of theme and template might be quite complex. To help you understand that
39

40
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,130
even better,
40

41
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,860
and summarize what had been said in this movie,
41

42
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,710
I created a slide with a diagram.
42

43
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,570
It shows elements which make up the typical PowerPoint file.
43

44
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:20,890
Let's start with discussing the template. The typical template consists of Slide Master.
44

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,280
Inside it, you can find parent and child layouts.
45

46
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,960
Layouts might contain placeholders for taglines footers, etc.
46

47
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,470
In general, a template is your scaffolding.
47

48
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,320
The starting point for building a good presentation.
48

49
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:54,690
Inside a template, on the other hand, we have a theme which consists of colors, fonts, effects and
49

50
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,590
background styles.
50

51
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,350
All of these elements define the style and look of your presentation.
51

52
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:11,430
And all of that's taken together, plus content you put on your slides, makes a PowerPoint file.
52

53
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,450
In the next movie, I will show you how to properly format your Slide Master.
