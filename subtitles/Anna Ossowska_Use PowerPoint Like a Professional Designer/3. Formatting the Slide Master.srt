1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,040
To navigate to your PowerPoint Slide Master press Shift and click on the 'Normal View' icon.
1

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:16,750
As a reminder, if you look on the left side of the window, you can see the list of layouts. The top
2

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,790
one is the Slide Master, which I like to call a 'Parent Layout'.
3

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,640
This one controls the look of the smaller ones, called 'Child Layouts'.
4

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:37,690
When you edit the Parent Layout all layouts that are based on that one, will contain those edits
5

6
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,170
as well.
6

7
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,890
From the point of view of template design, Parent Layout is a place where you want to make the most important
7

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,400
edits that you want to see reflected on the majority of slides.
8

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,400
For example, edits regarding the presentation title, footers or company logo.
9

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,640
The Child Layout, on the other hand, is a place where you want to apply to individual formatting and
10

11
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,020
ignore the overall look of the Parent Layout.
11

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,310
For example, your so-called 'Thank you' slide, which is likely to be put at the very end of every presentation,
12

13
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,460
might look quite different from the majority of slides.
13

14
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,810
That's the reason why it should have its own Child Layout.
14

15
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,180
Let's also discuss a very important topic:
15

16
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,790
deleting the Child Layouts.
16

17
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,660
Although you can remove all of them and build everything from scratch,
17

18
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,460
I don't recommend it.
18

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,660
The reason is simple.
19

20
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,220
If you delete all Child Layouts, you're likely to encounter many formatting errors down the road.
20

21
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:50,990
What I encourage you to do is to apply changes onto the existing layouts, modifying them to your needs
21

22
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,790
and deleting only those layouts here are sure you're never going to use.
22

23
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,680
I've made my decision that I want to delete Child Layout
23

24
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,680
number two, four, five,
24

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,820
as well as the last four layouts from the list.
25

26
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,680
OK, let's now concentrate on formatting the Parent Slide, since this is the most important
26

27
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,770
one which controls the look of Child Layout's.
27

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,150
The very first thing I'm going to do is adding and arranging guidelines on my Parent Layout.
28

29
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,990
The role of guidelines is to help you with aligning and positioning objects, as well as achieving the
29

30
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,040
slide to slide
30

31
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,970
consistency.
31

32
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,670
If you follow my steps and you don't see these default two guides across the center and middle of your
32

33
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,810
slide, navigate to the View tab and make sure the Ruler and Guides box is check-marked.
33

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,860
As a next step, I select my vertical grid line and drag it to the left.
34

35
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,520
Due to the fact that the Ruler is added, I can see the numerical values when dragging and I can be
35

36
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,450
100% precise.
36

37
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,290
15.90 value seems to be just fine.
37

38
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:32,430
OK, what this guide tells me is that I shouldn't put anything beyond it because it might get cut off
38

39
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,140
and simply look unaesthetically.
39

40
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,440
Now, let's do the same thing for the right hand side.
40

41
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,340
This step, however, is very important.
41

42
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,220
I hover my mouse over a guide.
42

43
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,820
I press Ctrl key and drag to make a copy.
43

44
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,040
I'm going to go to the same distance, which is 15.90.
44

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,060
Remember to release your click first and then release Ctrl key.
45

46
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,030
OK.
46

47
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,350
Let's do the same thing for horizontal lines.
47

48
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,620
850 seems to be fine.
48

49
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,280
Now I press Ctrl and drag to create a copy,
49

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,640
and put my guide here at 8.50 value.
50

51
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,330
As you can see, my footers happened to be not precisely aligned with that bottom guideline, but I
51

52
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,550
will fix that later on.
52

53
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,410
As a next step, I will add two additional horizontal lines which will determine the position of my
53

54
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,010
slide title and bullet point placeholder.
54

55
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,110
I again press Ctrl and drag to make a copy.
55

56
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,670
I think that 5.40 is fine.
56

57
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,670
Now let's create another copy.
57

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,900
And this time
58

59
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,390
I will place it here
59

60
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,290
at 4.40.
60

61
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,320
Great!
61

62
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,810
Now it's time to format the content placeholders on the Parent Layout.
62

63
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,700
Let's start with formatting
63

64
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,040
the Title placeholder.
64

65
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,770
I select it and changed the font size to 36.
65

66
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:34,650
I think that the default 44 might be too big for this particular widescreen presentation format.
66

67
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,150
OK.
67

68
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,430
As a next step, I drag it a little bit and try to align it to the already created guidelines.
68

69
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:53,550
I'm also going to align text top using the vertical top alignment added previously to my Quick Access
69

70
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,060
Toolbar.
70

71
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,620
As a next step, I create a soft line break by pressing Shift + Enter,
71

72
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,750
and I type more letters.
72

73
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,820
Why am I doing this?
73

74
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,230
I want to check out how someone might end up putting two lines of text.
74

75
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,830
Now, I'm pretty sure it looks perfect,
75

76
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,800
and my text properly fits the placeholder.
76

77
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:21,640
OK.
77

78
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,320
Now it's time to edit the text inside the tag line.
78

79
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,940
I'm going to change that into:
79

80
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,710
'Click to add slide title'.
80

81
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:43,080
Now, let's adjust the inner margins of this placeholder. I'm going to select my text by pressing
81

82
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,500
Ctrl A,
82

83
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,620
Right mouse click, navigate to the 'Format Shape' command,
83

84
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,890
I choose Text Options,
84

85
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,200
and click on this icon on the right hand side.
85

86
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,770
And I set 0.1 cm for left, right,
86

87
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,780
top and bottom.
87

88
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,150
As a next step, I'm going to create a line and position it below my tag line.
88

89
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,970
The reason I do this is that I want to visually separate my tag line from the rest of the content.
89

90
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,730
So, I choose a line from the list, press Shift and drag to make it 
90

91
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,520
perfectly straight.
91

92
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,100
Now, I'm going to change the formatting by applying the yellow highlight color.
92

93
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,130
I also wants to make the line thicker.
93

94
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,620
As the last step, I position the line bottom using one of my alignment macros.
94

95
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,970
The next thing I'm going to do is editing the placeholder with bullet points.
95

96
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,290
I'm going to change the inside margins.
96

97
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:14,360
I want to be consistent and apply the same values as I already have in my tagline. To do so,
97

98
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,720
I navigate to the Format Shape,
98

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,380
I choose Text Options, click on this icon on the right hand side, and I set 0.1 cm
99

100
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,050
four left, right, top and bottom.
100

101
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,050
OK.
101

102
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,100
I close the window.
102

103
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:40,720
As a next step, I drag it a bit and try to align it to the already created guidelines.
103

104
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:52,340
Now I'm going to make the font size of each line smaller, but I don't want to do this manually
104

105
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,970
line by line.
105

106
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:01,160
Instead, I select the text by pressing Ctrl A and press Ctrl Shift <.
106

107
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,370
As you can see, it is a real timesaver.
107

108
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,860
Once I have my two main placeholders set up, I'm going to edit the footers.
108

109
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,550
I select them all, change the font size into 10 points.
109

110
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,180
I also want to change the font color into grey.
110

111
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,400
Decrease the height a little bit,
111

112
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,560
and edit the inside margins.
112

113
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,450
Let's again set zero 0.1 cm
113

114
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,130
for left, right,
114

115
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,030
top and bottom.
115

116
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,020
Now, let's change the positioning of each placeholder.
116

117
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,600
Let's start with the page number.
117

118
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,490
I want to make it fit to the guide
118

119
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,840
I've created previously, like this.
119

120
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm also going to decrease the width of this placeholder and align text right.
120

121
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,190
Now, I want to test it out.
121

122
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:27,400
I want to be sure that if I were to type, let's say, three digit number like 150,
122

123
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,640
I have a plenty of room for that.
123

124
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:38,600
OK, as you can see we still have a lot of space and the text does not jump to the next line.
124

125
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,160
I press Ctrl Z to undo.
125

126
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,320
Now, let's format the date.
126

127
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,150
placeholder.
127

128
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:59,490
I'm going to position it in the bottom left corner of my slide by simply dragging. My smart guides helped
128

129
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,920
me to position an object.
129

130
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,380
Now, let's change the date format.
130

131
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,720
I have my textbox already selected, so I go to the Insert tab,
131

132
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,310
I click at 'Header & Footer',
132

133
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,250
select 'Date and time',
133

134
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,820
and I change the format to this one.
134

135
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,920
I click 'Apply to All' to save the changes.
135

136
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,710
Now, I'm going to adjust the Footer's position.
136

137
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,900
I'm also going to change the text into:
137

138
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,280
'Confidential:
138

139
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,170
'Do not duplicate or distribute'
139

140
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,250
'without written permission from Acme Company.'
140

141
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,850
As soon as I have my further, date and page number appropriately formatted, I insert a straight line.
141

142
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,740
I center it,
142

143
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,620
And place it above my placeholders with some help of 'Align top' macro.
143

144
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:40,880
I do this because I want to visually separate these three placeholders from the main content.
144

145
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,460
I will also reduce the height a little bit.
145

146
00:12:52,980 --> 00:13:00,510
Let's also change the color of the line into light gray and change the line width into this one.
146

147
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:12,250
Now it's time to decide if I really need to have footers on all my layouts.
147

148
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,500
In my case, the best solution is to leave them on Parent Layout.
148

149
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,270
and Title Only layout.
149

150
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,150
What about unwanted footers on other layouts?
150

151
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,370
Should I delete them entirely?
151

152
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,300
I will give you two extremely important tips.
152

153
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,750
Do not remove unwanted elements from Child Layouts by just selecting them and pressing the delete button.
153

154
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,570
There is always a possibility that someone might want to have these elements back.
154

155
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,580
Secondly, do not try to cover unwanted elements with white rectangles.
155

156
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:05,950
The best solution is to navigate to the Slide Master, and uncheck this box named 'Footers'.
156

157
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:14,820
As you can see, the date, disclaimer and page number automatically disappeared from this layout.
157

158
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:23,870
If it happens that someone needs to use them again, he or she can check the box at any time and footers
158

159
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,630
will automatically show up here in the right format.
159

160
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,280
Let's uncheck the box on the Child Layout number one, two and four.
160

161
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,390
Once it's done, let's check out
161

162
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,010
if all change is applied on the
162

163
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,180
Parent Layout work on Child Layouts as well.
163

164
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:58,490
I close the Slide Master for a moment and create more slides by pressing Ctrl M.
164

165
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,160
Now I choose the
165

166
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,790
right layouts.
166

167
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,140
I need four in overall.
167

168
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:20,240
Now, I press Ctrl A to select all of them and press 'Reset' to apply the most recent changes from
168

169
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,350
the Slide Master.
169

170
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:33,940
As you can see, the tag line is nicely formatted, but I don't see any footers on my Title Only layout.
170

171
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:41,950
Actually, it is a very common problem and many people face it when creating a PowerPoint template.
171

172
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,600
This is how we can fix it.
172

173
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,730
Let's go back to this Slide Master
173

174
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,670
by pressing Shift and 'Normal View' icon.
174

175
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,540
As a next step, I'm going to select the date on my Parent Layout,
175

176
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,050
navigate to the Insert tab,
176

177
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,600
choose 'Header and Footer'.
177

178
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,410
Now, make sure that 'Date and time' box is checked,
178

179
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,000
and click 'Apply to All'.
179

180
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,340
Now let's do the same, this time for the disclaimer.
180

181
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,160
So I selected, navigate to the Insert tab,
181

182
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,570
choose 'Header and Footer',
182

183
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,700
and I make sure that the 'Footer' box is checked.
183

184
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,140
Now I click 'Apply to All'.
184

185
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:46,550
As a last step I select the page number. I go to the Insert tab again, choose 'Header and Footer' and
185

186
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,760
make sure that the 'Slide number' box is checked.
186

187
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,160
Now I click 'Apply to All'.
187

188
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,430
Now, let's check out if that worked.
188

189
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,580
I'm going to close the Slide Master, select by pressing Ctrl A,
189

190
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,370
and now I press 'Reset'.
190

191
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,880
As you can see, it works really well!
191

192
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,460
The next thing I'm going to do is changing the default style for Shapes.
192

193
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,930
Let's create the rectangle.
193

194
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:31,210
I will apply white fill color and light gray outline.
194

195
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,060
Let's also reduce the width a little bit.
195

196
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,600
I will also change the internal margins into 0.1 cm.
196

197
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,330
OK, once it's done, I make sure my object is selected,
197

198
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,360
I right mouse click,
198

199
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,930
and choose 'Set up as Default Shape'.
199

200
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,300
Now, every time someone draws a shape, it will automatically get white background, a nice grey
200

201
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:08,520
outline and internal margins set to 0.1 cm for left,
201

202
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,320
right,
202

203
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,100
top and bottom.
203

204
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,750
We can do the same thing,
204

205
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,130
this time for lines.
205

206
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,070
Let's draw one.
206

207
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,960
Now, right 
207

208
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,590
mouse click,
208

209
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,350
and choose 'Set as Default Line'. Perfect!
