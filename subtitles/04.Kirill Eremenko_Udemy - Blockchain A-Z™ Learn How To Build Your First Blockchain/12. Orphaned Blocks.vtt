00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.340
Hello welcome back so of course I'm boxing today we're going to be talking about orphant Glock's.

2
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.990
It's going to be more of a show and tell tutorial will use the blotching don't call more blocks and

3
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.480
or info information for examples and we'll learn from there.

4
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:33.070
So let's go to blog dot com and then go to stat's here and here at the bottom you'll see a option called

5
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.660
orphaned blocks.

6
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.110
So go ahead and click on that.

7
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.460
And this will show us some recent orphan blocks and that will help us understand what's going on.

8
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.410
So what can we see here.

9
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.180
Well the first thing is how do we read this diagram.

10
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.090
This diagram is basically our block chain but vertically going from you know like this is the most recent

11
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.390
block and then going down or actually not the most recent book was reading a book somewhere here.

12
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.950
And then the blockade just keeps going like down.

13
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.300
And so there's this dot dot dot means like they skipped a lot of blocks in here because they were not

14
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.450
interesting for this specific analysis.

15
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.850
They're the words in your orphan book so you can only see the orphan blocks here.

16
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.800
But essentially this is our whole block chain except for the parts that dot dot dot so you can see here

17
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.120
4 9 7 3 7 3 4 9 7 8 so they skipped from here to here.

18
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.480
They skipped about 500 blocks.

19
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.280
Everything was normal and then an orphaned transaction happened.

20
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.660
So they showed us how they dealt of what happened there and not how they dealt with just what happened

21
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.910
to it.

22
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.420
And then again so you can see 4 9 7 8 7 0 4 9 7 7 1.

23
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.870
These are consecutive than dot dot dot then these are always consecutive than dot dot dot and so on.

24
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.210
So that's how to read this chart and keeps going on.

25
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.130
So you can like scroll to the bottom and then you can go to the next page and it will show you more

26
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.180
if you like.

27
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.330
So let's have a look at an orphaned transaction what is going on here.

28
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.050
Well let's look at the most recent one that we have in this example.

29
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.520
Over here we had block 5 0 3 9 4 8.

30
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.630
Everything you know like was going OK fine in our book chain books were being added one after the other.

31
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.330
So before that was 9 4 7 before that was 9 4 6 9 4 5 and so on and 9 4 8 was added by BTC dot com that

32
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.360
mining pool found this blog.

33
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.730
This is how many transactions as ins are inside that block.

34
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.860
That's that's a time when they added it.

35
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.860
OK.

36
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.110
And so then what happened.

37
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:39.220
Well after that as you can see 18 minutes passed so a bit more than 10 10 is on average or sometimes

38
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.040
more or less because it's a statistical thing to find the hash anyway.

39
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.820
So you can see here 18 minutes past so 23 28 on the 12th of January.

40
00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:01.280
What happened is at 23 28 0 0 7 G-B minors found the next block.

41
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.570
But at the same time at 23 28 33 which is how many seconds is that.

42
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.980
That gives us like 26 to six seconds later slush pool.

43
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.940
Remember that glove that mining pool in Czech Republic they also found a block and at the same time

44
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.780
so they both claimed it to be block 5 0 3 9 4 9.

45
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.320
And they said you know this had this main transaction.

46
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.680
This had me in the central section already shows you that they're not identical blocks simply by seeing

47
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.760
that they have different number of transactions in.

48
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.090
And we discussed this in the course of what happens when this situation occurs.

49
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:49.150
Well what happens is at that point in time two versions of the chain will exist so G-B miners with this

50
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.900
block will continue trying to grow that chain and slush pool of this block wall to continue trying to

51
00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:02.680
grow that chain so that the nodes in the network which are close to slush pool will have a car will

52
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.240
have been relayed this block nodes that are close to G-B miners will have been relayed this this block.

53
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.060
And so we have two competing networks of two competing chains at the same time.

54
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.940
And what happens from there is that ok then whoever builds on the next block.

55
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.290
They then like eventually remember the golden rule the longest chain wins.

56
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.230
So whoever builds the next block first they will take over the chain unless they build on the next block

57
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.300
at the same time again and then it will be whim bills and X-book.

58
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:40.680
So basically whoever has more has power in wherever in whichever chain out of the two competing chains

59
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.170
has the highest rate will win eventually.

60
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.480
And remember that's our solution back going back to the larger one when we talked about why the Byzantine

61
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.690
general problem and then we talked about the consensus broken log chain.

62
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.700
This way by structure because as progun this way we get a consensus.

63
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.050
As long as we have 51 percent of the high Schrade on one of the all the other side.

64
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.140
And that's exactly what happens.

65
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.550
And as you can see here the red X means that this block eventually lost that this block combined by

66
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.650
slide pool ended up to be in the losing chain.

67
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.240
So what happens then.

68
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.360
That's the interesting part right.

69
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.520
So this blog is staes and then it keeps growing.

70
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.340
Lisa's dot dot dot keeps growing into the chain chain continues evolving.

71
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.950
This one stops what happens.

72
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.490
Well all of these transactions that were in the block they get released back into the temples.

73
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.990
They go back into the meme pools of whatever nodes accepted this block.

74
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.700
Eventually this ball of this chain wins and then so these these guys have to release the transaction

75
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.100
back.

76
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.570
Maybe some of these transactions were amidst these transactions that were listed here.

77
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.950
Very likely because minor select transactions by the highest fees so the highest fees transactions would

78
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.670
have been here and here so they would have been released out of here and back into the meme pools all

79
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.140
of the notes that accepted this block.

80
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:12.100
And then right away this block would be would be so all the and all of the nodes in this chain would

81
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.360
switch to this blog and then right away the transactions that were here and were actually here and also

82
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.370
they would go back into the main pool and then they would go right out of the temple.

83
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.770
They would exit the temple because they're in that in that block that actually turned out to be good.

84
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.260
But some transactions some transactions will be released back into the temple and they will stay in

85
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.020
the temple because they were not in this block as well.

86
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:40.630
And so what that means is that it's always important to wait at least for a couple of confirmations

87
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:49.920
before D before considering your transaction to be successful and confirmation we mean several blocks

88
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.090
on top of the current blog.

89
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:58.230
So if you if your action ended up in one of these blogs if you have if you don't wait for several blocks

90
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:05.010
to be built upon it then what will happen is you might let's say if you received money from somebody

91
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.260
to sell your bicycle they send you money and you give them the bicycle and then it turns out that your

92
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.790
block was not valid.

93
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.040
So because because this happened and so Yoshua that transaction gets released back into the pool and

94
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.320
they get their money back and they keep the bicycle because now you can't get hold of them or something

95
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.150
like that so if that happens that that's the cold the double spend problem and we'll talk more about

96
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.410
that in the coming tutorial on the 51 percent attack.

97
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.860
But for now that's what's important.

98
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.780
Not so usually the rule of thumb is to wait for six confirmations.

99
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:46.650
So wait for six confirmations before you consider your transaction to be successful because otherwise

100
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.800
it might end up a double spend problem.

101
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.630
And so here is what happened here.

102
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:57.030
So we also had a what's it called an orphan block.

103
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.270
This is called The Orphan block.

104
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.230
Let's have a look.

105
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:06.910
More so quite a few orphan walks all over the place.

106
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:14.940
So I was looking for an example look at the times so you can see that this one was a minute later.

107
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.500
So this one was mine earlier this one was mine later.

108
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.630
But if you look here this one was my own letter.

109
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.140
So this one is actually mine first.

110
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.600
First 26 minutes 37.

111
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.650
This one was mine twenty 26 minutes forty five fifty four seconds.

112
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.320
So it really doesn't matter who my dad first in terms of time was right.

113
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.910
What matters is who has the longest chain.

114
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:45.560
In the end which block results in the longest chain in the end that's what matters at the end of the

115
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.820
day.

116
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.330
Yeah.

117
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:47.900
So there we go.

118
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.000
That's how orphant blocks work.

119
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.200
So the main takeaway from today is this can happen.

120
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.000
It's normal.

121
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.210
It's part of the experience part of the block chain set up and it happens usually because there's a

122
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:09.590
time lag because when this bloke was mind it took more than you know took more than 26 seconds for this

123
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.180
information to get from Gibeah miners all the way to slushed pool.

124
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.150
Makes sense right.

125
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:19.700
I don't know where GP miners are but slush pools in Europe there isn't that many there aren't that many

126
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:27.200
mining pools in Europe so wherever G-B might Where is the miners in regards to miners.

127
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.590
Know doesn't tell us doesn't tell us what your mind says

128
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.350
G-B miners

129
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.590
doesn't say where everyone is.

130
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:54.820
OK well we can definitely find out somehow where you'd be Myers's and it will tell us like we might

131
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.720
give us a hint why the why it took some time to get from here to here.

132
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.340
Yeah and so that's why this is going to happen or from books and happen.

133
00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:10.360
And the rule of thumb is wait for at least six confirmations So for example cryptocurrency exchanges

134
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.970
they will have a threshold.

135
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:18.520
They will you know they will not confirm they will not send you your money if you exchange like Bitcoins

136
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:26.580
for ethers or that an all like Bitcoin cache or something like that is you say as you do that exchange

137
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.110
they won't send you your money right away.

138
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.400
And that's the reason why because they are waiting to make sure that even after the transaction has

139
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.920
one conversation is still wait until a certain number of confession which might be like five or six

140
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:45.940
confirmations for based on their regulations or based on their terms and conditions they will waste

141
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.590
couple of conversations because they're afraid they want to minimize the risk of double spending they

142
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:56.200
want to minimize the risk that this transaction that they just did with you it will end up in one of

143
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.210
these orphan blocks.

144
00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.020
And you know yes there's like two three four confirmations but at the same time there's a parallel chain

145
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.500
excuse me and then that's when those transactions will be reversed back to the airport and they've already

146
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:13.420
given you the other cryptocurrency that you were after and they can take it back from you unless you

147
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.760
of course you know they contact you and they say you probably give it back to them but they're not sure

148
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.210
about that.

149
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.860
So they don't they don't want that risk.

150
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.320
So that's what often blocks are.

151
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.390
Check out this this Web site.

152
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.100
Have a look and see see what kind of examples you can find here.

153
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.930
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

154
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.530
Until then.
