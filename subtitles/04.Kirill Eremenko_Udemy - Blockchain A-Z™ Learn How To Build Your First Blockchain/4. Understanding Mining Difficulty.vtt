00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.740
A lot.

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.750
Welcome back to the course on blog Shane.

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.090
And today we're going to be understanding mining difficulty.

4
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.720
Now we did talk about mining difficulty when we talked about the mining target in Munjal one.

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.760
Today we're going to develop a much deeper understanding of mining difficulty.

6
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.270
All right so let's have a look.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.820
Today we're going to answer the following two questions.

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.980
The big one is what is the current target and how does that feel.

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.510
And I'm a big believer in intuition in understanding things on an intuitive level and that's what we

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.050
going to aim to develop a feeling for the current target.

11
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.020
How does it feel if if you were a miner if you were a miner mining Bitcoin or any other currency for

12
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.240
that matter how would it feel to have that difficulty imposed upon you.

13
00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:00.010
What would that imply because that understanding in my view is beyond that basic foundational understanding

14
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.700
is when you understand things like logically and how they work.

15
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.680
But that feeling for things will give you that better.

16
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.440
Where is that intuition that can help you come up with ideas and see see these things from a different

17
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.320
perspective.

18
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.350
And number two is how is mining difficulty calculated.

19
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.250
We're going to introduce the term So we've been using mining target and mining difficulty interchangeably

20
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.990
up until now but they're actually separate terms and we're going to introduce fighting difficulty and

21
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.710
see how the two are related.

22
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.370
All right so Question 1 What is the current target and how does that feel.

23
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:44.440
Well we spoke about target in this tutorial in Module 1 and as you recall we agreed to use a leading

24
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.150
zeros to talk about the target.

25
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.060
And what I wanted to point out here is that this chart this diagram is extremely disproportionate.

26
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.000
And how do we how can we see that.

27
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.880
Well right now it looks like by setting a target of four leading zeros you know we are reducing this

28
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.330
pool size the valid pool size to about a quarter.

29
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.300
So this looks like a quarter of the total.

30
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.590
Right.

31
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.760
However if you in a hexadecimal number if you request even one leading zero just one leading zero at

32
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.100
the start you're going to effectively reduce the pool size by 16 times.

33
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.120
If you do two leading zeros Elby 61 it will be one sixteenth of 160.

34
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.080
If you do three leading zeros in this purple part this valid part will be one sixteenth of 116 116 so

35
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.080
tiny.

36
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.190
And would it be evil even visible on this chart on this diagram if we tried to plot 40.

37
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.810
And how do we get our heads around that.

38
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.640
Well the best way the way I think about it is let's look at a decimal system number and a decimal system.

39
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.660
Yeah.

40
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.540
That's compared to numbers one where you have five digits and one we have five digits.

41
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.290
But the first one has to be a leading zero.

42
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.990
So effectively you have four digits.

43
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.000
So in the first case you have options from zero to ninety nine thousand one hundred ninety nine 100000

44
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.120
options and in the second case zero to nine thousand eight hundred ninety nine it's only 10000 jobs.

45
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:20.800
So by requesting one leading zero we're effectively reducing the pool size by 10 in a hexadecimal number

46
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.920
because every digit can have 16 values.

47
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.950
We have three leading zero is reducing the pool size by 16.

48
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.840
So that's already helping us build better get a better feel for what's going on.

49
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.530
So in reality even one leading zero is going to significantly reduce our options because right now it

50
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.220
looks like if we pick any random number in your random non-SS then we will have like a 25 percent chance

51
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.090
of getting a golden hash.

52
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.640
But in reality it's much much less.

53
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.110
OK so let's develop that even further.

54
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.150
So this is the current target.

55
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.880
We'll talk about where to get it in just now and a bit later.

56
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.050
But this is our current target.

57
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.360
Again we're just going to focus on the leading zeros the rest is is like not going to make much of a

58
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.230
difference compared to leading zeros leading zeros 18 leading zeros at the time of recording this video.

59
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.300
So let's do some estimations.

60
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.660
What can we get from 80 leading zeros.

61
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.510
You know we already saw what 40 things are feels like what has 18 zeros.

62
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.440
There some estimates estimations we're going to calculate the probability probability of getting a golden

63
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.870
Montse or randomly picking a nonce and build that will be golden locks.

64
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.730
Well how do we calculate the problem.

65
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:44.350
First of all let's see how many total how many numbers with 64 characters how many hexadecimal possible

66
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.690
combinations are.

67
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.400
The answer is 16 to 64 which is approximately 10 to the power of Sony so.

68
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.370
So we're going to underline that refresh.

69
00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:01.190
And then second question is how many possible combinations are there how many possible hexadecimal combinations.

70
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.280
I mean we have 18 leading zeros.

71
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.190
Wow.

72
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.280
The answer is 16 to the power of 64 minus 18.

73
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:15.770
Because on this digit you can have 16 options 16 options 16 options 16 options and so on the 16 options

74
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.650
and a total of 16 times 16 times 6 and then 16 64 times 64 minus 18 times because we can't touch these

75
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.730
we of replace these these have to be zeros.

76
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:32.820
64 minus 18 that's approximately 2 to a power of two times ten to about 55.

77
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.150
We get that either.

78
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.490
So as you can see that's our big pool that's our total pool and that's how restricted pool that's our

79
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.950
pool where the golden Launce's are you can see it's quite a lot of numbers tend to about 55 that's a

80
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:53.210
lot of numbers but in comparison to this one it really fades into part of the vibe is almost nothing

81
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.980
compared to tens of heart was in seven.

82
00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.510
So the probability that a randomly picked hash is valid or that are generated by a randomly pick lawn's

83
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.880
is going to be a valid or a gold and not gold and bonds is going to come from a.

84
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.680
What's going to get valid cash basically.

85
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.630
So the possibility of that is two to a two time Cenziper huge fight that number divided by that number

86
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.140
is.

87
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.140
That's what we were after.

88
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.190
That's the feeling.

89
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.360
So just look at that number.

90
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:31.000
That's the percentage probability of getting a a that the nonsense you pick is going to be golden locks.

91
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.260
That's like a random pick.

92
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.760
How does that number make you feel.

93
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.970
That's that's probably like I don't hold water.

94
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:48.380
But that's probably much less than winning less chances than winning a lottery.

95
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.110
How insane is that.

96
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.620
That's so that's what my hair is doing.

97
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.770
So no surprise that there's like those machines are working and working and working because the probability

98
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:06.350
that any given loans is going to be is going to generate a valid hash and therefore that machine or

99
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.750
that minors are going to be allowed to create the blog.

100
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.000
So low is tiny.

101
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.360
That's the problem and that's what the current difficulty as you can imagine.

102
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.770
If the difficulty is adjusted then this is the difficulties increase the number of users increased.

103
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:27.680
Then what happens this number stays the same but this number goes down because 18 becomes like is out

104
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.120
at like 30.

105
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.800
And that means this will be lower.

106
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.630
This will be lower.

107
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.470
This will be all over.

108
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.030
This will be all over again.

109
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.630
So there we go.

110
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.180
That's how that's a feeling.

111
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:44.630
Like Hopefully this illustrates that it's not it's all like a 1 1 1 in 4 chance of getting or not it's

112
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.180
a tiny tiny tiny chance.

113
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.950
That's what this whole cryptographic puzzle is about.

114
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.440
And now we're moving on to question 2.

115
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:57.410
It's a good segue into question 2 How is mining difficult to calculate and how is it adjusted.

116
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.970
So let's have a look.

117
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.930
Mining difficult the right difficulty.

118
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.660
The definition is the current target divided by the max target where the max target is.

119
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:13.340
Well we know the current target that's our current target and the max target is this and we'll get to

120
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.210
that in a second.

121
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.510
So first I wanted to make a comment.

122
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:24.860
How often is difficulty adjusting difficulty is just that every 2016 blocks those thousand 16 has nothing

123
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:30.440
to do with the year is because it's two weeks every block should be ideally should be block should be

124
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.050
released every 10 minutes.

125
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:38.120
So if you calculate that how long it takes in 2016 glossaries it's exactly two weeks or how many blokes

126
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.760
get recent weeks 2061.

127
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.820
So that's that's health and they're difficult to get some just that every two weeks.

128
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:51.320
And know don't you think that we still don't know here on the slide is the back story where did this

129
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.450
come from what is this target or about.

130
00:08:53.690 --> 00:09:01.810
Well this next target is the target that was in place at the very inception of Bitcoin.

131
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.850
They started out with this target.

132
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.350
And so why did why did they start out with this target.

133
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:17.480
Well you know this is not the maximum hash maximum you know hexadecimal number maximum hexadecimal number

134
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.270
would be like f f f f f f f f f f all the way.

135
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.680
So they are like in a decimal system or be 9 9 9 9 f is the highest digit in hexadecimal so it would

136
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.850
be all F's.

137
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.140
Why didn't they start of that.

138
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:36.820
Well the answer is that the the one we're thinking about is that all F's is at the very top.

139
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.130
It's like at the very top.

140
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:45.290
So if they started out with the math with the target at the time being at the very top then every single

141
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:50.760
time a miner would pick a nons it would be a golden dots every single time they would like.

142
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.980
They would just mind blocks very quickly of every iteration they would mind a block.

143
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.660
And therefore they would mine out all the Bitcoins too quickly even before the first two weeks passed

144
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.740
just that difficult.

145
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.710
So they intentionally started with a difficulty that was that really had a lot of leadings it was really

146
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.170
had how many eight leading zeros at this time.

147
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.180
Now we've already moved to 18 so this is the max difficulty at the time.

148
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.110
This is at the very start.

149
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.480
This is the current difficulty.

150
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.150
And again this is extremely disproportionate.

151
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:25.450
So we know that this line should be a tiny little block there and this should be even a tiny small little

152
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.690
block over there.

153
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.650
But just for illustration sake that's that's what we're seeing.

154
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:38.030
And so how to understand difficulty on an intuitive level difficulty because it's the current target

155
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.440
divided by the back story.

156
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:39.650
Right.

157
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.170
So it's basically this line.

158
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.780
How high is this line divided by how high is that.

159
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:55.070
Is that line what is telling us is how much harder is it now to mine Bitcoin compared to what it was

160
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.320
at the very start.

161
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.740
So how much harder has it gotten to mind.

162
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:05.720
And that's exactly one difficulty says so compared to at the very start of mining Bitcoin.

163
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:11.510
How much longer does it take to mine Bitcoin now not longer because we know it takes 10 minutes how

164
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:16.090
much how much will power does it require How much how much.

165
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:21.800
How much less how different is the probability the ability to recalculate before what is what is the

166
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.030
relationship between them.

167
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.230
How much harder.

168
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.120
In essence how much harder is it to mind a bit.

169
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.950
And yeah.

170
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.210
And so there we go what we're going to look at now is some some charts to bring like bring all of this.

171
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.250
All right.

172
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:47.190
So his blog Shane dot com and we're going to go to we're going to go to oh yeah so we can go to data

173
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:54.040
we can just pick a random block and you can see from the hash so we can't get the current target.

174
00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:00.260
Well at least the number of zeros you can get from here like that is going to be 18 zeros.

175
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:05.630
And because that's that's it's hash and you know sometimes you might get one of 19 zeros or 20 zeros

176
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.140
just by accident that gets that.

177
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:14.950
So best way to do is like look at a couple we got a couple of blocks and you'll see that they all have.

178
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:19.480
You know they all have the same location.

179
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.500
They all have the same number of leading zeros.

180
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.230
18.

181
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:23.470
OK.

182
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.050
That's number one and the other thing is what it won't do.

183
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:33.360
Oh I wanted to look at the charts so what I wanted to show you is

184
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.780
difficult to or has difficulty mining information difficult to go.

185
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:47.230
So if you look at difficulty you'll see this stepped chart was it stepped because the difficulty gets

186
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:53.820
adjusted every single two weeks and by the way also an important thing to note is that difficulties

187
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.240
is not adjusted by any central authority.

188
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:02.610
There is no like like bankers anything or block chain dot com that says Now the difficulty is going

189
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:03.640
to be this or that.

190
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.860
The difficulty is going to be that not at all.

191
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:13.440
We know that this is a decentralized system and we know that there's no central authority and that therefore

192
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.780
it gets adjusted by the nodes themselves.

193
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:22.080
So if you install the Bitcoin software your computer will be adjusting a difficulty on its own because

194
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.700
that algorithm is coded into the Bitcoin protocol.

195
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.640
And yeah.

196
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:34.930
And so they just Voelz sync up in the sense that they know when you know the two weeks started.

197
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.870
And when the two weeks ends and so on and like every two weeks you're on.

198
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.520
No it is going to look at.

199
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:49.100
OK so how long did it take for the past for past 2016 blogs to be mined and it knows that it takes about

200
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.710
10 minutes.

201
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:55.030
It should take exactly 10 minutes to my blog so should be 20000 or 160 minutes.

202
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.710
If it's more or less than that number then the difficulty gets adjusted.

203
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.570
That's how difficulty gets adjusted every note adjusted and therefore because the algorithm the same

204
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.190
they all get the same difficulty as you can see right now.

205
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:14.630
The difficulty is three trillion three trillion is the difficulty.

206
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:24.480
And that means it's three trillions three trillion trillion times harder to find a golden non-SS than

207
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.290
it was at the start of Bitcoin.

208
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.500
And what I liked about this chart is that right now I think it's like it's like a year and you can go

209
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.240
to oldtime and you'll see how it changed.

210
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.300
Voila.

211
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:45.100
So at the start guess what the difficulty was one that was won at the start because nobody was minding

212
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.660
Bitcoin and there was no need to change the difficult for a long time nobody really cared.

213
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:55.750
And then people started mining it more and more and more so as the mining power increases as more players

214
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.820
join they start mining faster.

215
00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.840
That's the reason difficult change in mining the Bitcoins faster and faster and faster.

216
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:08.050
So they're they're the power or the aggregate power and then it is getting higher and higher or higher.

217
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:15.100
And so the algorithm has to adjust in order to keep that consistency of releasing and Bitcoin every

218
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.840
or releasing a block every 10 minutes in order to keep that consistent.

219
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.400
The difficulty has to be adjusted and the difficulty adjust is adjusted as we saw through the number

220
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.780
of leading zeros.

221
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:33.990
So as you can see it's it's a complex it's a complex system overall like philosophically.

222
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:40.940
But what I like about it is it's it's beautiful in its elegance it's beautiful in its simplicity that

223
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.610
all they are doing is changing the required number of leading zeroes every two weeks.

224
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.720
And that is keep it under control.

225
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:59.980
This whole swarm of minors and industrial level mining like organizations and mining pools as we'll

226
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:07.870
see that is all under control by simple algorithm and then you compare that to banking right to the

227
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.050
normal fiat currency currency.

228
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.340
What do we have there.

229
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:21.400
We have a central authority that is struggling to keep their economy under control by using macroeconomic

230
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:31.660
factors such as What is it called or policy such as interest rates rise like we're going to increase

231
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.810
the interest rate or decreased interest rate like the Reserve Bank of Australia increases or decreases

232
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.050
the interest rate every quarter as far as I know.

233
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:46.420
And you know and and you know I think they're doing a right job but like still it's it's so much calculation

234
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.290
so much work.

235
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:53.830
So of their countries are not doing not doing a good job and they have a clear incredibly high inflation

236
00:16:54.130 --> 00:17:04.560
or you know their currencies are going like they are becoming non usable and they have crises and so

237
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:04.990
on.

238
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:11.920
But at the same time here we have something so simple compared to those systems and yet it works it

239
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:18.400
works like magic and is able to keep under control the proof that it works is that it's able to keep

240
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:25.810
under control so many different players that have you know been coming up with different ways of mining.

241
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:31.450
They used C-p use in GP use and A-6 We'll talk about this and still the system works system was just

242
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.270
prodding along.

243
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:42.640
So very cool and put that into perspective how how a loan how a decentralized system can actually perform

244
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.470
as good or even better than a centralized one.

245
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.020
All right.

246
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:46.860
So there we go.

247
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:52.510
Hopefully now you know everything about mining difficulty and on that note I look forward to seeing

248
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.410
you back here next hour.

249
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.470
Until then enjoy blood chains.
