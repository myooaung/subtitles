00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,760
Hi everyone and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,510
For those of you who are not familiar with the stellar cryptocurrency we're going to be taking a look

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,280
at how stellar got started.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:16,100
Some information related to how it works and the benefits of steller and the organization behind it.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:22,980
So let's take a look at these stellar cryptocurrency stellar was released in 2014 as a de-centralized

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,730
payment network and protocol with its currency steller can also be referred to as Lumines or Emsellem

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,180
you will more than likely see it referred to as Lumines.

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,620
In 2014 the first Brazilian Bitcoin exchange Mercato Bitcoin announced it would be using the steller

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,780
network sometimes with steller.

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,290
You can get a little confusing so let's make this clear that in this area of the cryptocurrency steller

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:56,910
is the network made up of a distributed block chain ledger and database wherein refer to the coins as

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,210
Lumines or SLM since steller was released by the nonprofit stellar dark.

13
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,900
It seems to have that extra and added level of transparency so it's a nice benefit.

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,060
Stoller's goal is to expand access to the low cost financial services to fight poverty and maximise

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:24,150
individual potential and we can see from the steller or web site that they have made the following permanently

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,160
and publicly available.

17
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,040
This is related to transparency.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,310
These include the details and mechanism of the various Looman distribution programs.

19
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,030
The aggregate number of individuals who have participated in the direct sign of program and number of

20
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,450
Lumines distributed details and progress of the partnerships program and steller Bill challenge details

21
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,600
and progress of the Bitcoin program and total Lumines held by the foundation.

22
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,630
This is just a awesome transparency list when we're working with crypto currencies.

23
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,550
You know does de-centralized applications.

24
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,040
The more information that we have either as developers or investors or just someone looking to get into

25
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,880
crypto currencies this information can be very useful if you're trying to predict or build models that

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,860
look at investments of these currencies.

27
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,400
Just think about the uses of this information and publicly available details related to Lumines.

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,460
So what are the key main points.

29
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,740
Of course we have to start and state that it's open source and as we have mentioned that steller is

30
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,270
hosted the stellar core.

31
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,330
It's hosted on get help and we can actually pull it up here and we can see the stellar core information

32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,480
and documentation on get hub.

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,570
So if you get the chance scroll through take a look at the stellar core and the information related

34
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:45,510
to it is very useful if you want to understand more of the technical aspects and side of steller at

35
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:53,120
least the backbone of this steller network but jumping back in with its currency Lumines they have a

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,990
very low fee and the network actually has transactions that rival rebel since we mentioned Ripl.

37
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:06,350
We can see some similarities such as the fast transaction speed and they both aim to handle cross platform

38
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,630
transactions and micro-transactions and an interesting fact and why we probably see these similarities

39
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,880
is that steller was originally based on ripples protocol and more.

40
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:23,070
But with steller it's more open source and more decentralized and we can also see that the government

41
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,820
over the creation of Lumines is determined by a fixed protocol level rules.

42
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,930
The number of Lumines created agenesis was 100 billion and every year there is a 1 percent inflation

43
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:41,370
rate Neumann's cannot be generated arbitrarily by anyone and we can also see that since it is so open

44
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,160
source and de-centralized someone could actually theoretically push a proposal but it's very unlikely

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,430
to succeed or very unlikely that the validators on the network are unlikely to accept and ratify it.

46
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,860
So the chance of more of them is being created is very minimal.

47
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:05,720
If you want to explore that further you can visit the link here and we get take a quick look on how

48
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,120
it works this is put together by the stellar dot org.

49
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,450
And if you get the chance you can scroll through this further.

50
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,600
Let's take a quick look at it.

51
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,770
Does it provide some useful information for how stellar works.

52
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,890
So we can see this information.

53
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,890
It's very practical.

54
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,770
We could see that sending the transactions.

55
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,330
Remember it's aiming to handle those micro-transactions.

56
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,940
It's also targeting those financial services and sectors.

57
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,700
We can scroll through and see that is similar to other crypto currencies and centralized applications

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,220
and block chain algorithms that it's made up of a network of servers containing our data.

59
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,750
The steller network decentralise and spread throughout many locations that power the distributed Ledger

60
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,180
recording every transaction in the system and any entity can run our server.

61
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,600
Remember this is very open source.

62
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,310
And if you scroll through it just has some other remaining useful information related to the ledgers

63
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,550
and transferring money issuing credit.

64
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,540
Acting like a virtual wallet.

65
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,590
And we can see steller since it's distributed exchange the Lumines you can actually send euro credits

66
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,750
to your friend using your U.S. dollar credit balance.

67
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:28,130
This is that area similar to ripple where it's facilitating the ease of currency changes.

68
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,860
I think that's something to pay attention to in the near future.

69
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,200
All right.

70
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:39,990
To wrap it up Lumines ateliers currents are in competition with other currencies such as Ripl for becoming

71
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,200
partners with banks and other financial institutions due to this.

72
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,940
It makes loon's a necessary cryptocurrency to keep an eye on for the near future.

73
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,830
And we could see that the prominence of it and that financial institutions are taking on Lumines and

74
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,640
utilizing this network within their services.

75
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:06,330
Because recently IBM announced that they were launching a block chain banking across multiple countries

76
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,580
with Stoler.

77
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,340
So keep that in mind if you're looking to get into crypto currencies if you're looking to invest or

78
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,270
are looking to build or contribute to the network trying to work with steller that the financial sector

79
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,460
is definitely one of the main targets again similar to ripple ripple and steller with their currencies

80
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,450
are very prominent within these financial institutions because it still States the ease of use of transfer

81
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,450
and currencies of these transactions along with this beat.

82
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,040
All right I hope that you're more familiar with stellar as always if you have any questions please feel

83
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,040
free to share them in the Q&amp;A.

84
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,710
Keep this cryptocurrency on your radar for the next few years.

85
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,080
Let's see how it's performing how it's moving and what changes are made if any changes are made to the

86
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,740
network.

87
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:57,430
Always visit the cellar dot or the nonprofit Web site that released the stellar network and enjoy cryptocurrency.
