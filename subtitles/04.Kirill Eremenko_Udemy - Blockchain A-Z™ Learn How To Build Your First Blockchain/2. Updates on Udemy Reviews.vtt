3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.940
It's early so far.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.070
I'm in this for you.

5
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.310
I wanted to take you on a quick.

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.520
So this is what life looks like here this is a small village it's early morning in Africa.

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.470
And one of the things that block chain promises is that through its transparency through the immutable

8
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:35.360
Ledger technology it will bring prosperity to third world countries such as this one because of the.

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.250
You know because it's going to corruption's going to go it's just running around here.

10
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.930
Yeah because America is going to be hard is going to be easier to move funds across borders help people

11
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.370
start projects and things like that.

12
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.240
And so by taking this course you're contributing and going towards that space.

13
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.650
And that's that's very exciting.

14
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.300
And while we're on this walk also wanted to give you a quick heads up.

15
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.900
You me very soon is going to ask you to leave review for this course.

16
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.700
Now I know it can be difficult to judge the quality and value of a course this early on.

17
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.600
However the enemy review system has simply changed and they're asking you to leave a review earlier

18
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.910
and earlier on in the course.

19
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.550
Now having said that we're not going to ask you to leave a five story discourse.

20
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.750
However what we would like to ask is that if you're not familiar enough of the Course to read it if

21
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.810
I say of course then please scroll through the tutorials and have a look at the topics that we cover

22
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.980
you'll see that we cover our blog Shane.

23
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.860
Bitcoin is theory I'm smart contracts and lots and lots of different exciting topics I from the intuition

24
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.780
side of things and practical side of things.

25
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.940
And hopefully once you see all of this that will give you the confidence to rate this course a course.

26
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.730
On the other hand if you feel that something's wrong with the course if you're unsatisfied unhappy about

32
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.520
