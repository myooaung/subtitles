X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.390
know that we have a war.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.840
Feel we can deploy it on toe Any Johnny Web server.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.010
Since we already have downloaded Apache Tomcat,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.150
we can try deploying our war file on our tongue.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.560
Get.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.850
Just make sure that from Eclipse Tomcat has been stopped.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.720
It's also close a clip,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.930
so we don't need toe.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.250
What A about this anymore.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.520
Let's hear this command prompt.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.730
Right now,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.170
I'm in my jacks,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.500
Artist resources,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.900
But inside that I haven't Apache Tomcat.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.750
Nine folders Syrian to that.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.070
There is a really directory.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.810
Now,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.070
if you look at this,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.770
I have many fights.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.840
One of the file here is God.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.270
Shut down dot Back and shut down a such that is toe shut down the server,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.370
one for windows and one for UNIX platforms.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.850
There is a start up got back and start up the message.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.550
Now,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.380
on Windows,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.430
you can just double click,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.750
start of dark back,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.610
and that will start the Apache Tomcat server.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.180
So on,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.660
Mac,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750
I had to run this command from the command front,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.700
but before that,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.010
I have to do a couple of things.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.400
As you can see on Mac,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.750
I have here some permission issues.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.310
There is a really great permission for the user on for others and group members.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.580
I only have read permission since I want to execute,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.120
I have to first change the permission toe X permission for that.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.410
I see hedge more U Plus X and then a dive here,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.430
start of dot message and that actually changes the permission.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.610
So if I have a look at that now,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.690
you can see this particular file has expert mission for execution.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.640
Next I can type.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.450
You're So do that is for administrative privilege.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.220
And then I have to take your dot,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.790
slash,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.130
startup door and such,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.840
And then it says here cannot find out cattle in order.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.570
Kasich,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.540
if you scroll up,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.850
you can see Catalina about messages also there.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.830
But since it is also not having an explanation,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.850
it gave another.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.150
So do the same thing.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.790
But I think ch more u plus X and then it's a fear Catalina are such And now if I under

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.320
command pseudo don't slash started the message,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.670
it should actually start.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.730
The Tomcats are well and artists.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.130
So to verify,

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.390
I can open a browser.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.640
Andi,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.830
they look almost aged off exit and you will see that I'm getting the Apache Duncan 9.0

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.850
point 14 year now.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.200
The reason why I'm getting this particular page is because if I goto Apache Tomcat 9.0

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.990
point 14 there is a folder called Babs and these are the application that are currently

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.530
deployed on Tomcat Rule.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.110
Happens to be the default,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.450
and this application is producing output page here.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.360
So if I go and look for for example,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.960
Manager,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:08.180
it is asking for use an impasse were and that's because it is coming from the manager

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.570
similar,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.650
like and looked for examples by typing here examples.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.150
And I get this solar example jsp example etcetera,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.520
which is coming from here in order for me to reply our war.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.150
Fine I'll have to do is to copy this particular fight and based in tow the Libs folder.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.160
And as soon as they do that,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.070
you will see that the jacks are restraining dot what will be exploded into a folder,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.540
which means our deployment will be successful.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.510
This is called heart deployment,

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.620
so I can just drag this and drop on here.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.790
But I can do a copy and paste when they do that,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.450
and if I wait for a minute,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.340
you can see now that Jax RS training is also another deployed projects.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.300
So I can now go back to the Broza and look for Jack's artist dash training.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.010
And we have that home pitch.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.130
That's the index strategy human that's coming up.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.100
And I can also type here slash areas slash hello,

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.150
And that comes with the hello message.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.790
It was,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.900
If I also want,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.250
I can say a ps slash contacts slash one,

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.000
and that's gonna come back with the contact details off the particular idea that I gave.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.850
So this is how you will be able to deploy a war file on any tongue catch.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.160
In this case,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.270
the tanker has been installed on the local mission itself.
