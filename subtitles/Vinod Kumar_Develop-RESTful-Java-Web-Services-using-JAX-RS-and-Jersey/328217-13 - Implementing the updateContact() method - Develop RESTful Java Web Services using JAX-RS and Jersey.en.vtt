00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
in this video.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.660
I want to show you how to implement the update Contact function first,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.740
let's lead an SQL command.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.370
So string SQL decodes toe off date Frontex.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.620
There are seven columns,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.460
six of which we want update based on the primary key.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.290
So with a set Navy ports to question more gender it goes to a question mark he made It was

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:30.070
to question Mark phone people still Kashima City on country equals toe question mark,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.800
but where I d equals toe caution.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:45.570
Now this is the SQL Update statement and let's use the try Victory Sources Law and then

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.040
give off any exception.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.030
Let's throw them from here.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.640
So throw new dull exception off years now that we have this tribe resources block ready.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.650
That's add a connection on a prepared statement here.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.390
So connection on equals toe GPU feel.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.550
Don't get connection on your statement.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.380
Sgmd equals to conduct the best treatment of this year.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.950
Now the positions off these question marks or perimeters are same as the previous one

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.990
because they're the same columns that use,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.190
which means I can copy this and paste over here for the 1st 6 perimeters.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:36.660
The 7th 1 is the I d and I can see your esteem did or set into off seven on as a contract

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.750
or get 80.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.980
Now that all the seven para?

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.450
Because already we can say S t emptied our execute update because it is a demon.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.420
The return value off This is an integer representing how many rows have been affected.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.180
So they didn't own equals two.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.990
Now,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.140
the reason I'm doing this is because what if I have given an idea which is an invalidating

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.140
?

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.660
Obviously there will not be any errors but the number of rows updated zero,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.000
So I can tell the use of the same.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.810
So if count equals toe zero that I can say through new dog exception Oh,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:29.970
a message saying that no records updated in Bali on and probably against alien contact or

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.100
get so if everything is OK.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.850
Which means if the county's one there is no problem.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.130
I have to return the actual contact that you have supplied,

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.220
and I'm gonna return contact itself.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.080
So this is how you implement the update contact function off the deal interface
