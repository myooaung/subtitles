00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.790
in this video.

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
Let's see how to handle exceptions in appropriate way.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.740
For example,

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.200
if you go back toe postman and send a diligent quest toe non existing idee,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.910
we got a letter saying Internal server error.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.200
And if you carefully observe the stack trice,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.420
you can say that no records deleted,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.670
invalidated supplied.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.990
1001 Instead of getting an exception,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.480
structures that looks something like this.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.540
We would like to have it in the form off.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.860
Jason are whatever their desired,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.530
mind A to do.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.790
So we have to map our dear exception in tow.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.840
Something else.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.350
Let's go back to our Eclipse stopped the Third World for a few minutes.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.050
It's going to you the new package here card providers.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:01:01.550
So I'm gonna create a new plus go D will exception mapper and change this package to

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.550
forwarders.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.740
Now.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.100
I just tended package to providers because it is not a resource and it doesn't have its

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.950
place here.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.240
So let's go kick on finish and then we will are here.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.090
Encourage forward that Jesse can automatically scan all the providers on,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.100
then cleared objects off them and then use them whenever it is required.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.850
But only one thing is,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.170
we have to mention this package name in backdoor XML,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.360
where we have specified that these are the packages that have to be scan.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.480
I have to give a space delimited packages are.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.020
I can even plus endure and give it in the next lane.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.870
Save it.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.440
And now I go back toe my doll exception mapper.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.230
An exception.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:55.120
My upper class must implement an interface called exceptions mapper and the get a five year

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.260
would be the exception.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.810
So obviously we have to implement the missing functions that they are unimplemented methods

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.810
.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.920
Now this function is going to be used automatically to gender the response whenever there

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.610
is a dollar exception being thrown.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.160
So if you observe all off our handler functions here throughout our exceptions and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.410
occasionally when there is an actual exception being thrown such as in this case,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.060
that exception object will be converted into a response object here.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.090
So the logic for converting dollar exception into response is supposed to be given by us.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.820
I can now say here,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.640
for example,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.840
let's say we create a map off string comma string.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.590
Let's call it,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:48.750
ask people to do Hashmat and we will have a key core message and value off.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.750
The exception message,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.890
with the exception which was strong,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.590
is received as perimeter over here.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.820
So Jesse is gonna pass to that with the exception door,

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.050
Get message and that's gonna give the actual message.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.740
And now we have a map.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.900
Your began on traditional TV ups,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.510
for example.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.240
I can say Harold Output,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.140
I can say,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.230
then weakens.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:19.440
A new date got full stream on the new date would be from new till so that would be the pain

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.060
off the other message.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.710
And then instead of returning,

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.950
none here with response start,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.550
we can say status and we give other core.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.050
You can choose to give whatever the airport we want.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.480
I will give 500 this time and we'll take your entity.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.570
That entity is the map object for.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.260
And then we said our build to build the response.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.200
So now we're actually having a custom.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.160
Jason Onda within custom error number off.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.050
Fire under here.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.560
So they saved this.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.420
Let's go restart.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.950
Don't get Go back to a postman.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.010
Andi,

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.050
send the same thing once again.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.960
You should see this time we will be getting a custom Jason object having an adult message

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.620
so against you that it is cold out in order to deal with the exception.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.010
No records dilated,

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.700
invalidated,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.900
suffered 1001.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.560
And when was this error?

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.950
So this is the time stamp off the other message,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.630
The error court is still 500 off course.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.080
We can choose to change that whenever we want.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.420
Now,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.600
this is applicable for all kinds of requests.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.350
For example,

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.770
if I'm sending a whole street west where I heard this data Andi,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.280
tick on,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.060
send the first time it is.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.070
I did successfully,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.750
no problem.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.230
But email and phone numbers are unique columns.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.660
So if I send it again,

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.670
it's gonna come back with another exception.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.890
You can see that the exception here is a message to the string.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.360
And this is the indolent.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.760
A message.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.330
Of course,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.890
this message was generated by Hitch to,

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.780
and that is a Lenten message here.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.990
But we were able to get a custom Jason object instead off a stack trace being printed to

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.560
the user
