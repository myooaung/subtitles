00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
in rest ful batteries.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.850
This the http put method represents modification to a resource.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.520
So you work with such an example.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.220
Let's take a new function and we'll save public response off gate contact,

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.230
which receives,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:25.040
and I leave often Vigil cry on a new contract from the request payroll throws,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.000
dollar encryption,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.250
and we have to set the contact.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.410
I need to the perimeter that we have a seat.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.230
And this is to ensure that respect or whatever the idea supplier as part of the contact

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.770
payload,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.300
we would like toa modify the data for this particular ivy.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.340
That is the reason.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.000
So once we got this,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.560
now we have toe update so we can figure on that equal.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.160
Stood here,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.070
water off big contact.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.720
So we get the updated contact in case of any era,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.350
it will throw an exception here.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.060
Now,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.930
once the contract is really we can now return,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.050
it s fun.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.650
Start okay.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.680
Off contact our food.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.470
And,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.130
of course,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.590
like the previous ones,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.210
we also have to specify that this is supposed to work with put mentor.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.360
It produces Jason and also consumes Jason.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.930
One last thing that we have to do is tow add a part saying that whatever the I D that is

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.710
suffered as part perimeter is passed on to test,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.420
just like the way we have done in the get.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630
So we copy this and paste over here.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:42.220
Now it is done that restart our Tomcat server and let's go back toe postman.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.170
This is the post request less changes to put on,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.100
say he's one of those on one.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:02:00.340
Let's change the email from this toe something like this and probably the city from bangle

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.150
er toe kangaroo.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.850
Send it.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.070
And if everything is okay,

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.140
you can see that it's been updated with a new email and the city name being changed as well

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.140
.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.720
Goto my It's to client and connect and see here.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.070
Select star from contacts with really close to 1001 you'll see that it's a modified email

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.780
and modified city here
