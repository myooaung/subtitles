00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.350
the next ER is for us to create a new Maimon project to do so.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.910
You goto file New and Maimon Project Once again,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.350
all these many options will change if you're in a different perspective.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.160
For example,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.390
if I could do Jolla perspective,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.000
Andi,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.250
If I say file new,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.600
you will see that there is a job,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.340
a project,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.940
and there are a few other options.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.220
But no May 1 project Andi to quickly switch between perspective,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.970
we can also select these patents.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.990
Since I already selected Java,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.350
he rarely so that is this straight over here.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.450
I can click on this button and the perspective will change.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.800
Now I have here file new May 1 budget.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.700
Another option is I can click on this button and say me one project.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.380
I can also see here,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.750
right click and say new.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.870
And then I will have to select your other Maimon project So I go toe new May 1 project in

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.790
the first Sister.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:07.110
We click on this clear a simple project to skip any archetypes selection Next Mabel

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.000
products are organized in terms of folders.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.190
On the folders are again grew Pinto group idee an artifact ready group marriage and the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.810
leader present.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.870
Your organization and artifact irritated the greater percent.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.720
Your project on group I d being the company name.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.000
Usually it will be the that said in reverse.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.850
So I can like corner we not for my website.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.220
We don't not cool artifact early.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.610
I can take your jacks,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.990
Oreste Dash training.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.010
I can do the washing,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.520
Toby.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.850
Whatever that it says.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.680
Currently packaging.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.430
I had to choose one.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.150
Since we're going to work with Web applications,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.940
the rest of the field here are optional.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.840
You can click the finish portmanteau,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.680
come out of this style of box as you can see that your project currently shows and better

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.540
and you can find out what are the others in the markers section here?

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.630
And it is that May 1 Java ee configuration problem.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.610
If I expand,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.810
it will show that factor XML is missing.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.500
So as far as Java is concerned,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.870
but dot xml is mandatory flight since May 1 has not added that fight we have toe manually.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.930
Now,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.490
one of the other reason why this ever miss it is coming is because currently the Java

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.020
washing off this is pointing toe wonder five.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.630
So If you go toe right,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.290
click and then goto building parts configurable parts.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.870
You will see that it has chosen Java and C one dot fight.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.780
I have to select Java s E eight so I can choose that from here.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:58.650
Finish I said a plein and then also come toe compiler just to verify if it has taken effect

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.650
.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.900
One more section here is project for six and the project first.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.960
It says Java is one that fight.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.850
As you can see here we have an option to change the same.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:17.420
I attend this torn about eight I said a flying And now if I say applying close the job

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.120
Abortion has been taken get off,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.940
but not example is still missing.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.350
The next thing that you can do is tow.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.560
Add the better xml to do so.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.820
Right?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.780
Click the project Joey Tools and you have an option called generate deployment descriptor

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:41.300
stuff on this act of Abdel example under SRC may that rabbi in a folder so you can see that

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.380
there is about dot xml.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:51.060
Now we will be adding an entry here so that our Jax RS application works properly just to

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.920
check if this application is properly configured.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:02.310
We can add another HTML five year new HD Emma and I call this S Index start.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.420
It's Yemen and that goes into the box border.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.790
The meaning is the form says a bit,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.520
and I can change that.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.890
I do here saying Jack's Orestes Devil I It's one.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:24.370
This is a home page for Jack's hottest demo application.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.160
Save it,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.930
and now you can right click the project and say,

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.330
Run as But I'm uncertain.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.750
And this opened the dialogue box to choose different servers.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.740
Since I have only one server,

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.750
I can always use this or or when running this project so I could get on this and say next

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.290
and it says,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.580
Do you have any other projects?

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.200
Would elector after Dunkirk are they want before anything from dunk it?

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.140
You don't have to do anything here.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.210
Kick the finish button.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:09.490
So as you can see that local host Adrian zero slash jacks are straining.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.950
That's our my name.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.350
No,

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.730
on the home page has come up,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.350
which means our project is probably set up
