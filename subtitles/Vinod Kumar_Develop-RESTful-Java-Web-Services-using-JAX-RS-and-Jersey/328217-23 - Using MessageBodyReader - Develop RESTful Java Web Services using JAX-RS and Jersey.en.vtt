00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
So we're able toe get the CSP airport whenever we want,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.940
but we are not ableto add a new record it using CSP primarily because we don't have a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.140
mechanism to convert the CS Mediate our impair contact object to check the same.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.760
Let's go back to our court.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.330
It is the post infancy here it consumes text slash CSS we And then,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.030
of course,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.700
it also should produce a Texas last year.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.450
Sweet generally,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.210
but not necessarily.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.330
This will fail because,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.850
as I said earlier that there is no mechanism to convert a CS with later into a contact

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.530
object.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.150
Just like how we wrote a contact to see us me Marshal er we can write the reverse of the

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.610
theme.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.450
So I go to the providers package,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:01:01.330
create a new class cord CSP toe contact on Marshall Implements message body leader off a

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.650
corner contact.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.850
We finish this and then,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.330
of course,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.250
you are the unimplemented matters and the sender to metals,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.040
one which says,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.240
Can I read the data from this particular type on the 2nd 1 is the one which actually reads

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.520
the data from the bloodstream and then converts that in tow,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.960
a contact object it tolls Are they awaited and consumes as fixed?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.650
Just last year,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.030
sweet.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.370
It's import everything.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.300
And the 1st 1 is simple that we receive a data type and be should say whether this object

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.640
should be used for this particular tape or not.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.010
So well,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.850
take your time,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.500
nor is sustainable from contact our plus That means if Jesse is planning to use this for

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.570
hundreds or plus,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.400
it is okay,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.410
but for other types,

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.250
it is not okay.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.070
Now,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.340
here we can see that we this even input stream as the last other additional leaders.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.960
So from the pushed him,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.520
we will be able to read the enter data,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.950
which would be a one comma separated line.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.450
And then we have been worked out in your contract object.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.120
So,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.970
for example,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.960
in postman,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:21.400
if I'm sending a post request to the same thing by saying constant well sticks just last

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.570
year,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.450
me and in the body raw,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.410
I would be typing here like,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.100
for example,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.660
number for no i d.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.900
Then probably some need that the shop while David Sham Qizhi at gmail dot com.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.100
Some are number,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.410
and then we have your bangle on India Now notice that this is the line that we're sending.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.350
We can read this from this particular input stream in machine has functions to read,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.550
one bite at a time.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.690
If I want to read the entire line,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.410
I can use something going for 1/3 reader.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.180
This is how we create that.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.750
We said before Leader in equals,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.380
toe new book reader And the argument would be input stream that either.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.940
And there I am gonna stop like this indeed,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.640
the street.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.200
So now we have an object that knows how to read and in their line so I can see your

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.440
strength and see a sweet he could still in the tree line.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.230
Now that we have the underline,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.550
I can say see a sweet or split using comma as a separator that's called asking other parts

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.550
.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.190
It was still.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.720
Now all I have to do is tow.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.380
Take each one off these pieces like this one can add it to an I d.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.660
This would be set name said Gender said Female set for sex city and set country.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.810
So let's do the same thing.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.590
We're gonna say you're contact,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.470
see full steam in contact.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.070
It's a cedar,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.370
said I d off odds off zero Where are zero is a string?

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.370
So when I was a new integer off arcs pop zero,

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.620
it is possible that we supply none here instead of an actual number,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.350
this will throw an exception.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:19.640
So we're gonna surround this with a catch and not I really do anything because if there is

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.660
a none or something else applied,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.630
we're gonna believe there s no the default value off idea.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.070
The rest of them are giving other on strings so I can say seed or set me toe ourself one

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.250
and so on.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:42.700
And now that we have the contract object converted from the line,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.990
we will have the same thing.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.110
So we have done this.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.300
Now it's going to be start server.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:56.880
Let's go toe postmen and try to send this data again.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.770
We're tryingto clear the new resource with this data into the date of its Let's go and try

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.260
adding,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.160
So let's click send and you can see now that it has been added as 1006 this to verify we

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.270
can always go back door.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:19.340
It's to counsel connect over DB and I can say select start from contracts where l equals to

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.580
1006.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.370
Kick the run button and you should see the data from the CSP transport into the database.
