00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
in this video.

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.040
I want to show you hope a plane can send a Jason data on.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.570
We can consume the same and then added your occur to the database.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.370
Let's go and add a new function in our contacts resource on,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.710
say your public.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.400
I still want to give us once and say Add new contact as the function.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.930
Receive contact objects so Jesse is going to give your contact object.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.440
Here.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.650
The user will make a request to the slash ap a slash context,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.200
but this time user is going to use post as the http matter that's important the same by

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.780
prison command shift all our control detectable.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.010
We also say that the user will get a Jason our ports or copy this producers.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.990
And then we also have to say one more thing.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.210
That the user,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.050
while doing a post request,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.690
has sent the reader in the application slash Jason format so we can tell you're up there.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.830
It consumes,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.280
and then we had the same application slash Jason as the my In fact,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.860
we have to import the same.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.140
That's more than moments.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.690
Click on this import on Juve's The Jesse No scans the request body and assumes that

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.320
whatever this given is a Jason on attempts to convert their Inter contact object using the

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.450
Jackson idea.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.350
And if it is successful,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.200
it's going to give you the contact object.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.750
All I have to do here is to say,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.890
dear,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.500
we're not on contact and the contact object.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.760
Now this throws a dove exception.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.440
Let's throw it away from the function.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.860
Also,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.100
the return value off dysfunction is a new contract object with the primary key value past,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.050
So I can via isn't the same thing to the contact.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.370
Now I have the response object to be sent.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.190
So they your written response start,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.920
okay?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.910
And then I say conduct is the new object.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.610
And then I said,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.140
Well,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.660
now,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.240
over Post request handler function is ready.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.310
That can take a decent data on return.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.980
Another Jason object.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.220
So let's save this restored.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.840
Our Tomcats are well and just the same thing in Postman.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:27.390
So this time it's going to be a request for post and there is no slash one here and miss

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.010
sending.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.660
We also want to say that we're not only accepting Jason,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.580
we also want to send Jason data that that is done by adding a header called content type by

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.400
Lee would be applications like Jason,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.820
You can do the same thing by going toe body raw and then select your Jason.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.180
As you can see that in the header section it has added content application Jason

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.950
automatically.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.580
But the value that I want to send here is Jason,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.370
with key value pairs in double courts.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.580
Since the name is you know,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.230
you may we know that that we have not cool.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:13.110
Now notice that I have not specified the idea here.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.830
So if everything is OK,

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.090
when I click on the scent,

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.650
we're sending a post request with a payload off Jason jerseys Gonna convert this inter

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.220
contact object and give a dollar opposed to request handler which will then pass it on to

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.050
the deal.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.340
Our function and that is supposed to add the data.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.280
Let's go check it out.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.020
Back in the scent on.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.360
You can see that we now have a new I d off 1001.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.700
Now,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.930
if you want to verify whether it is created or not,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.740
you can goto the DB client hits to counsel Connect.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.760
Why are the panic button here?

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.010
And then you can type your select star from contacts with Ivy close to 1001.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.300
Click the run button,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.590
and you should see the data has been added successfully to the database table.
