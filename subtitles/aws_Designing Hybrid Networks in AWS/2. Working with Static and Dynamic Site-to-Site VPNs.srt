[Autogenerated] in this section,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,470
Wagons was working with static and dynamic site to site

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,920
B P N's when working site site v.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,830
P N's.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,340
We got two choices when it comes to ruin.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,610
First of all, we can configure static ruin with stack ruin.

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,220
It's up to you Truck day and maintain the route tables.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,560
These would include the route tables for your subjects

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,120
and your route tables on premise.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,540
Our second option is dynamic ruin.

11
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,820
With dynamic ruin.

12
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,740
We install a ruin protocol on our devices.

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,410
The routing protocol then stops routing information that is

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,920
used to automatics of day I root tables.

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,400
When working,

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,030
revered West manage service is the only supported routing

17
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,130
protocol is BTP the border Gateway protocol Stike Ruin is

18
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,750
relatively easy to implement, but it doesn't scale well.

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,150
Imagine trying to manage hundreds over thousands of rulers

20
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,340
and having to keep them updated manually.

21
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,930
It doesn't sit well in small scenarios when you might have

22
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,520
just a handful of rulers and you don't own the overhead of

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,670
managing a protocol like bdp B G P.

24
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,720
House In on premise device toe advertise I P prefixes

25
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,640
to the virtual private gateway.

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,800
The virtual gateway advertises your v P C s i p ranges to your on

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,840
premise device the virtual private gateways and I digress.

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,950
Use B g p of a TCP part 179 So we have to make sure that's

29
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,240
available for our firewalls on the BTP process.

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,940
The age of Westerns supports all of the common bdp parameters

31
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,940
that you might need to manipulate ruin.

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,240
This model serves a brief introduction to be GP.

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,600
We've got entire BTP module coming up later on in the calls.

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,640
When working with dynamic ruining your VPN, we can able route propagation.

35
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,180
Brute propagation allows your virtual gateways to chads routes

36
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,430
they've learned with the VPC route tables.

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,540
This 100 routes limit is a hard limit and cannot be changed.

38
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,290
So if you think you're gonna exceed that limit, consider using roots.

39
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,940
Civilization.

40
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,240
Roots immunization allows you to advertise a range of roots as a single entry.

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,080
One other thing to consider when you create offsite

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,140
side VPN on you configure PGP.

43
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,830
At that point,

44
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,930
you can adjust the BG piece default configuration to suit your requirements.

45
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,250
But once your sight sight connections up on your virtual private gateways

46
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,710
configured the B g P configuration cannot be altered.

47
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,490
To make a change,

48
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,830
you have to delete the site site connection and then reconfigure a new one.

49
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,580
We've already said that Unaided West managed VPN

50
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,650
brings up two tunnels from on premise, we can connect to both those tunnels on.

51
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,530
We can bring both tunnels up.

52
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,930
That means we can use those tunnels in an active, active fashion.

53
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,400
Sending a receiving traffic through ball from we also have the option of

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,660
an active standby configuration at his standby should be considered if

55
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,010
we run into asymmetric routine problems.

56
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,280
Asymmetric ruin involved.

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,260
Traffic being sent from solves the destination in one direction on the

58
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,840
return traffic being delivered by a different path.

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,340
This can cause connective issues using active standby just as one puff your

60
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,720
traffic with a standby path taken over in the event of failure.

61
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,500
Virtual private gateways and head West Support network

62
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,120
address Translation traverse A LL.

63
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:17,000
That means if we want to establish a site site connection behind that service, we can
