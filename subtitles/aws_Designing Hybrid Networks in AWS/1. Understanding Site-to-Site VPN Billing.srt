[Autogenerated] Hi there.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,910
Ah, welcome this module and are designing hybrid age West networks,

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,540
cause my name's Mike Brown.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,730
I miss Montreuil wagons cause billing when working in Aid West Hybrid

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,540
network out to turn violent in this module we're going to discuss site

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,940
site VP in billing 80 West Direct Connect building.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,060
I'm going to take a look a cough summary so we'll start

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,640
with understanding site site building.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,680
There's a couple of pricing points to beware off when work with sight

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,250
sight v p N's Firstly your charge for each hour,

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,040
your VPN connection is up each punch lower your VPN connection.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,000
You are charged for a full hour as well as being charged for VPN connection.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,440
Ours.

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,480
You also incur standard 80 West data transfer charges Parliament Lee,

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,230
it's gonna stopping chance your VPN terminated all of our price

16
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,460
examples that follow A based on a standard site site VPN Some regions

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,740
allow you to critics elevate sites ivy peons.

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,790
If you've done that,

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:09,940
you be charged the global accelerators Onda data transfer out premium fee.

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,630
So if you're creating next celebrate site site VPN make sure

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,750
you take these extra two charges into account when think

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,200
about standard VPN connection.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,990
Ours.

24
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,090
Most regions have consistent pricing as an example.

25
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,140
Here we got us, too.

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,390
That charge is about five cents per connection.

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,940
Our another example is the address of regions that

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,940
charge around 6/2 cents per connection.

29
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,580
Our when pulling your VPN connections,

30
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,250
make sure you look up the pricing for your particular region.

31
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,840
So if we had a VPN connection in us, too,

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,090
there was a woman upset the time for for two days.

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,390
How much would we be charged?

34
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,040
That VPN connection.

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,050
If you do the maths around that it should work out about $36

36
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,520
for those 30 days as well as the Holocaust,

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,340
the veep in connection.

38
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,550
Then we've got to take into account data transfer.

39
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,800
As you can see here, data transfer in is free.

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,130
It's their transfer out that we got to take into account for all regions.

41
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,840
The first gig, a buy out per month, is free.

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,240
He's had feelings, proof that that were charged for.

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,960
So from the first gigabyte for the next 9.999 terabytes per month,

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,840
you'll be charged about nine cents per gigabyte for data transfer out.

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,840
So during the mass around data transfer out the EU west to region.

46
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,380
If he transferred out 50 gigabytes per week for three

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,740
weeks and then 20 bites out in week.

48
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,840
Far how much would that cost you?

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,600
Well, if we do the mass around that, it should work out $15.

50
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,740
21.

51
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,920
We add that to our VPN connection our costs and that would give us

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,140
the total cost for a VPN connection for that month.

53
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,700
Earlier on this course, we discussed Ed West Client V.

54
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,140
P N's Client VPN Connection pricing is a little bit different from sight sight.

55
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,550
VPN connection pricing for a dress client cheapens your

56
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,150
charge to fee for each submit association.

57
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,380
Thesame associations are building a dollar power basis.

58
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,570
You're also charged for active client and there's a dollar power

59
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,400
charge for each active client that's connected again,

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,120
using us to his example.

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,650
Your challenge about 10 cents per hour for each end point association on your

62
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,740
charge about five cents an hour for each active VP and client.

63
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,220
Like other challenges around VP,

64
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,350
ends each part of our council complete our so when

65
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,780
considering client VPN connections in us too.

66
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,740
If we have an average 20 active connections for eight hours a day,

67
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,900
and we have false subject connections.

68
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,220
How much would that cost?

69
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,950
Well, for our day, that should.

70
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,000
Runners to $11. 20.
