00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.000
[Autogenerated] in this demonstration,

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.730
we're gonna discover some of the components used by a due

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.850
west manage repeats throughout this demonstration where

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.910
you'll be working with the U.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.010
S.

6
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.740
Consul and follow along this demonstration and we do encourage it.

7
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.840
Follow along.

8
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.640
You'll need your own age US account.

9
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.230
I'm in my address account specifically the easy to dashboard and I've gone

10
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.240
easy to virtual machine deployed called Global Server one.

11
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.400
Taken no off the private I p address of this virtual machine

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.300
10 01 97 Let's switch the VPC dashboard.

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.670
I'm in the VPC dashboard and I can see that what to v p.

14
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.840
C.

15
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.380
Is deployed One is the default Vpc on the second is global V P C.

16
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.240
One.

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.100
This is the VPC that our server is deployed toe.

18
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.540
If I scroll down a bit,

19
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.210
we can see the virtual private network section The first film let's

20
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.490
look at here is the virtual private gateways.

21
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.330
If I slept that we can see that I've got a single virtual private gateway

22
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.190
deployed and this gateway is attached to our global vpc one v P.

23
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.190
C.

24
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.300
A.

25
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.480
V.

26
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.200
P C could only have one virtual private gateway attached to any one time our VP

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.940
sees uses gateways to route traffic towards VPN connection.

28
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.940
Now our VPC needs to know about the customer premise device,

29
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.940
the device that sits at head office except in the VPN traffic.

30
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.760
So we got section here called customer gateways.

31
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.840
If I select that hey, we can sell call customer Gateway called Global Hedge Cube.

32
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.780
Amongst other things,

33
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.670
this customer Gateway identifies the public I p address off

34
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.910
our own promise device to connect the customer gateway on

35
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.740
the virtual private gateway.

36
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.230
Well, you sight sight veep in collections on here.

37
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.320
I got a single site site connection connecting the virtual

38
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.240
private gateway to the customer Gateway.

39
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.740
If I click on the tunnel, details top.

40
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.110
We can see two tunnels.

41
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.540
No one internal too Colonel would ease up on Tunnel two is down,

42
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.740
But both tunnels have public I p addresses that I can use to send traffic too.

43
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.640
And I am sending traffic right now.

44
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.640
In fact, I'm sending a series of pings.

45
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.320
If I jumped to a virtual machine that I've got configured in

46
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.410
a different environment here we can see machine that's

47
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.820
deployed on premise and its opinion.

48
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.040
The private I p address off the e C two machine me so earlier.

49
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.590
It's this traffic that's bringing the tunnel.

50
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.700
Look, if we go back to the Midwest dashboard,

51
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.140
let's make a change through here if we find the root table that VPC is using,

52
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.740
and here it is.

53
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.340
If I select edit roots,

54
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.250
we can see this route that sending all traffic that starts

55
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.940
17 to 16 to our virtual private gateway.

56
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.840
Let's delete that route and see what happens.

57
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.240
Now that he's gone, let's go back to our own promise server,

58
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.130
and here we can see request timed out.

59
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.540
The pings are no longer working these three components, then customer gateways.

60
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.710
But your private gateways on site site, deep in connections together,

61
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.180
make up an ADA West manage Repeat remembers.

62
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.550
Well, we development ruin the route table in order for our V P C.

63
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.860
To use.

64
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.000
These VPN components will be talked about these components and a lot more detail in later modules
