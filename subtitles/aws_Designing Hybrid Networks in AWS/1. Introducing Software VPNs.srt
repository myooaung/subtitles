00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,290
[Autogenerated] Hi there.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,200
Welcome to this model in our designing hybrid networks in aid of West costs.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,870
My name is Mike Ground are in this Montreuil.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,630
We're gonna look at design the hybrid network architecture using software V p.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,340
N's.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,610
In this model, we're gonna introduce software VPN.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,190
Well, then discuss software VPN.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,640
High availability on wagon demonstrates from a software VPN option.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,690
So let's start off by introducing software V.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,820
P N's a couple of questions.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,540
First, do use V pens on your network today.

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,110
If so,

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,780
what hardware and software to use Undead West software

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,940
VPN allowed you to retain control.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,660
You will have control of both ends of the

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,840
connection and not just the on premises.

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,210
Remember,

18
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,800
with a manage BP en you can't perform any configuration on the

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,140
virtual gateway device was just being deployed.

20
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,940
We're a software VPN.

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,740
You have control not only of the VPN software but also the operating stone,

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,490
so you can continue to configure and reconfigure the VPN as

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,540
needed software VPN to allow you to retain skills.

24
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,190
Think about the question of the previous side.

25
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,070
If you answered yes,

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,610
those questions that it's probable your staff of already trained

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,090
in particular technology be able to retain and use those skills in

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,840
our cloud move might be a benefit.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,240
Also, if you've answered yes the previous questions,

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,120
you may have already purchased licenses for on premises equipment they

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,450
are using right now to manage your V p N's software.

32
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,610
V P N's introduced.

33
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,840
Bring your light and scenarios and bring your own license could save you money.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,000
There's a couple of options when going down the software v.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,230
P en route, you could deploy an e t.

36
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,440
Two instance use in an air mind from the marketplace.

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,590
These might be limits based AM eyes like open VPN or it could

38
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,590
be an am I from a manufacturer like Cisco.

39
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,080
The alternative is to deploy E C.

40
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,540
Two instances using your customized AM eyes.

41
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,680
This gives you the more flexibility to use whatever VPN

42
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,040
configuration that meets your needs.

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,100
When using software V.

44
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,990
P N's,

45
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,620
you respond for the patching management and maintenance off the C

46
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,840
two instances that terminating your VP ends.

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,290
You're also responsible for the high availability of the software VPN service.

48
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,010
In this example,

49
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:24,640
we have head office with a deployed Rua that's running VPN software.

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,490
We don't have our V p c with two subjects deployed to digress into some,

51
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,950
that one we're gonna deploy software.

52
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,890
VPN Instance, This is a highly specialized,

53
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,040
easy to machine, the view of customized all you perch for the marketplace.

54
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,040
We make sure this instance is publicly accessible,

55
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,510
and then we create a VPN connection between it on our own primitive eyes.

56
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,340
Now, you could just leave it at that.

57
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,040
But here we have single point of failure.

58
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,830
We have a single point of failure because you've only got one rule at head

59
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,050
office on a single point of failure in AWS because we've got a single easy

60
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,770
to device managing the VP on that side here we've deployed a second

61
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,250
instance is subject to subject one and subject to and different

62
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,000
availability zones on our route run premise creates a sites like the P in

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,670
connection with each device.

64
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,940
Now, if the villa but his own goes down or one of our instances fails,

65
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,940
we saw off site site capabilities.

66
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,740
Of course we'd have to address the single point of failure head office as well,

67
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,340
by possibly adding the second rule of there

68
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,450
comparing software and aid Westman v.

69
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:27,560
P.

70
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,540
Henson if using software VPN, you're responsible for the high availability,

71
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,640
maintenance and scalability off the VPN.

72
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
If you use an address, manage VPN.

73
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,990
They all fall into a dresses responsibly with a dress.

74
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,840
Manage VP ends.

75
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,350
We use cloudwatch to monitor those re peons with software v.

76
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,110
P N's.

77
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,330
We can deploy a custom honoring solution or configure

78
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,580
our 82 instances on the VPN software.

79
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:52,740
Two.

80
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,730
Apart into Cloud Walk With Software VP ends you

81
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,440
control Bull Friends of VPN Connection,

82
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,930
offering a wider range of choices around the types of

83
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,270
software used and hardware used to create.

84
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,540
The VP ends with in a dress manage VPN.

85
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,240
You control the on premise End of the connection.

86
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,370
You might be limited in the number of devices that supported by the

87
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,730
ageless band VPN on premise and your definite limit just using I P

88
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,330
sec as a security protocol across that VPN software VPN support

89
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,430
bring you on license and they allow us to leverage the existing

90
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,240
skill set of our employees.

91
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,720
Finally, the might be compliance reasons why we use the software VPN Bye.

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,550
Implement a software VPN we will be approved.

93
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,480
Orders were full control of the entire site site v.

94
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:36,720
P M.

95
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,710
Process.

96
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,020
When making your choice as to whether to use a software VPN own a dress,

97
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,540
manage VPN.

98
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,940
The best practice advice is to use the address man free

99
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,000
pen first on only move away from this. If the address manage VPN doesn't meet your requirements.
