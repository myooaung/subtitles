00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,040
[Autogenerated] in this section where then discuss route 53 traffic policies.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,020
Little Mannix has a particular requirement they'd like I help with They

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,990
got website hosted on the sea to machines that their customers access by

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,870
going through an application little balance.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,260
They also have a static website hosted in S E book it that

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,340
contains basic information about good Mannix.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,850
We've been asked to provide a solution that directs all

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,540
customer traffic to the corporate website.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,290
But if the carpet website is unavailable for any reason,

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,550
then customers should be directed to the static Web

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,740
site content hosted in S three.

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,040
Take a minute to think about Globe Mannix requirements.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,050
What a do a solution.

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,240
Would you recommend to meet those requirements?

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,340
One possible solution would include using roof of three traffic policies.

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,540
Room 53 connects a global traffic manager.

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,610
So if you got service,

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,940
is that distributed globally Paps with copies of your

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,640
carpet website in North America and Europe,

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,400
you can use Route 53 to direct people to most appropriate copy of your website.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,140
To do this,

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,360
we can create a traffic policy on associate that traffic

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,420
policy We want more policy records, a policy record is a name toe i p.

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,040
Just mapping it might be in a record of a quite a record.

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,490
In fact,

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,260
it could be any of the standard records that roof to three supports traffic

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,680
policies have assessed to resolve that name to a specific I.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,840
P address.

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,140
All set of I P addresses.

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,620
Traffic policy can work of a variety of empires, even horse unaided.

31
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,940
Dress on premise.

32
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,470
All the third pie trying policies can altering corporate health

33
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,730
checks so that we only resolve names too healthy.

34
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,740
I p addresses.

35
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,370
When we create a traffic policy,

36
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,990
we've got a range of ruin methods that we can choose from.

37
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,740
We've got fail over rooting, for example, we fail of ruin.

38
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,580
We send all the quest to a specific M point as long as it's healthy.

39
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,240
And if that end point isn't healthy, we fail over to a backup en pointe.

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,010
We've got Wade ruling.

41
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,920
We've waited ruin.

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,390
We consent half a quest in one direction, on half in the other.

43
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,030
We've got the location ruin policies with J location.

44
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,940
It'll take into account where the name is Lucy.

45
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,260
Request is coming from and use that location to send

46
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,900
you in a particular direction.

47
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,140
That way, if we got copies of our content in Europe and enough America,

48
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,290
we can send every in Europe to European and points.

49
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,690
I have enough America, Enough American points.

50
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,540
We've got multi value answer with multi value answer.

51
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,080
We could return a range of I P addresses in response

52
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
to a name is Lee Shin request.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,220
The client that made the request,

54
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,270
then will choose which of those I P addresses used to connect to our service.

55
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,240
We have late into base ruin.

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,940
We've laid in Sabates ruin.

57
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,500
We will direct requests the best performance and point at that moment in time.

58
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,570
And finally we have the approximate ruin.

59
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,680
Do you approximately ruin uses the location of the endpoint and not

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,280
determine which couple of your service requesters should be.

61
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,090
Rue Ito.

62
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,990
When configuring ruin policies, we can configure,

63
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,710
basically ruin policies on the records themselves so we can go to the

64
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,840
hosted zoning Route 53 select a record and locate the routine method

65
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,040
section by default the ruin method or beset too simple.

66
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
But we can change that.

67
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,640
Tow anything methods mentioned on the previous side.

68
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,580
If you only want one level of Decision American and

69
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,590
have a small number of them points,

70
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,690
then configure the routine policy on the record itself Makes sense.

71
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,840
Traffic policies then allows to map out multiple levels of decision making.

72
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,610
Perhaps you want people to be guided to a particular geography and

73
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,900
then inside that job for you have multiple copies of your service

74
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,760
and then you want to use fail of ruin.

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,340
Any time you want to combine multiple different types of ruin,

76
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,940
you have to do that by creating traffic policy.

77
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,250
We can create traffic policies,

78
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,500
use individual editor access through 43 so giving what we now know about root in

79
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,610
policies on Globe Mannix requirements which were in policy.

80
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,140
Would you recommend for Globe Mannix?

81
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,450
One possible answer would be to use fail of a

82
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,110
1,000,000 policies with health checks.

83
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,480
Using fail of a ruin, customers can be guided to the corporate website host.

84
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,740
Uneasy too, sat behind applicator love answer.

85
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,690
Using health checks,

86
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,150
we can detect when that service is not available and then direct people to

87
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,840
the S three hosted Web site because we only want one level of decision

88
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,780
making and I've only got two possible M points,

89
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,100
then we could settle this policy on the records themselves.

90
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,940
Alternatively, by creating traffic policy,

91
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,510
it might make it easier for us to make adjustments later onto scale tomorrow,

92
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:46,000
end points without into create new results, records and edit the ones that already exist.
