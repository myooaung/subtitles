00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.300
[Autogenerated] in this demonstration,

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.390
we're gonna deploying a software VPN solution.

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.750
Welcome to working with the Head West console and

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.290
follow along this demonstration.

5
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.140
You'll need your own AWS account.

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.200
I'm in the address console specifically in the sea to

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.190
dashboard in the London region.

8
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.060
I've already deployed the VPC with two public subjects the

9
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.290
angle and deploy my software VPN device enter.

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.310
So if I click instances on,

11
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.140
then launch instance from here I select the US marketplace.

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.010
And if I do a search for VPN, we find 100 sent a free products,

13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.540
the offer VPN capabilities.

14
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.070
If I scroll down this this a little bit here,

15
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.580
for example,

16
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.050
you can see Cisco devices some off a license included another's offer.

17
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.410
Bring your own license.

18
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.180
If you have a look for this list you might find Am I versions off the

19
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.860
VPN software or hardware that you use on premise?

20
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.830
These were allowed to leverage existing licenses on skill sense.

21
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.440
If I scroll back up, I'm gonna select the open VPN access server.

22
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.880
Like most marketplace devices, when you select them,

23
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.800
it'll give you a break down a pricing.

24
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.840
These prices are for the bring you a license option.

25
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.340
I'm happy.

26
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.920
These are, say, continue on.

27
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.340
The rest of wizard is a standard am I wizard.

28
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.470
So we choose a family and type the number of instant

29
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.510
someone to deploy the network and subject.

30
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.170
I've also selected unable to be assigned a public I p address because

31
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.360
this device is being deployed to a public sub net the public i p

32
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.840
address for 11 to catch this device remotely.

33
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.750
Another design shows would be to deploy these devices to private sub nets

34
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.480
and place them behind a Internet facing low balance.

35
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.540
I'm half of these choices.

36
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.360
So I say next at storage, I don't need an additional storage or say next at tax,

37
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.490
I'm gonna add one tag with a key of name on a value of global VPN service.

38
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.430
With the tax in place, I click next Configure Secure agrees by default,

39
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.950
a new security group will be created with all the correct rules

40
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.340
that will give access to this VPN server.

41
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.300
I'm happy of these.

42
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.330
So I say review and launch Have a review of your Sainz If you're happy,

43
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.830
click launch now where deployed and e.

44
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.990
T.

45
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.350
Touring since at the end of the day.

46
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.020
So we need a key pair to be able to remotely access

47
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.490
that instance in this example,

48
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.710
the open VPN access server and deploying runs on a

49
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.790
limit up Winston swell me to keep air.

50
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.910
You know it's the SS agents.

51
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.170
That machine later on, I already have a keeper,

52
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.140
so I just took the box to acknowledge that I have access to the Keeper.

53
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.940
If you don't have a key pack, create one here and download it.

54
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.340
Finally, we say launch instance.

55
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.740
It's gonna take a few minutes to deploy this instance,

56
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.140
so I'll pause the video there and come back once it successfully deployed.

57
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.740
I'm back in the Midwest console, and as you can see,

58
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.090
our VPN service now running for your deployments,

59
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.740
consider high available E.

60
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.740
I got Single Surveyor.

61
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.200
If this ever fails, all the available it is own, it's deployed to goes down.

62
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.580
I'll lose access to my VPN.

63
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.540
Service is probably better than to deploy to VPN service

64
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.400
being two different availability zones.

65
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.140
And you said Lord, balance that a low bones traffic towards them.

66
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.640
For this server, I can see it's public I p address Alex Prive I P address.

67
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.140
I'm gonna take a copy of its public I p address.

68
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.100
Because this is a living machine.

69
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.740
We're gonna need some sort of S h collective it in.

70
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.070
Artist remotely connect to it.

71
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.740
I've got a product called put installed.

72
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.330
Hey, you could say I've got put you up on the right and put a key generator.

73
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.640
Put a jen open left.

74
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.830
Remember the access key created earlier when you were

75
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.840
deploying your virtual machine?

76
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.810
Put a jen can be used to convert that key into a farmer that could be

77
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.930
used by putting so that we can sshh into your device.

78
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.770
So use input.

79
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.140
We would use the conversion option on in Porky.

80
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.150
You import your private key and two's generate Then save the

81
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.880
key locally before coming to put it on typing the public i p

82
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.430
address or the virtual machine.

83
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.620
We're trying to connect her.

84
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.640
Then we expand as S H click off eyebrows.

85
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.880
We then slit the private key that put it.

86
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.740
Jen is generated from us.

87
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.630
We've all that in place.

88
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.980
We click open without being asked for Logan name for open VP and books.

89
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.690
The default name Face am I is open VPN s and together with the

90
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.430
private key should love me in at this point,

91
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.590
your configuration will depend on the type of device you

92
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.700
deployed the first time you kept open VPN,

93
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.680
for example.

94
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.860
It want you for a series of choices to guide you

95
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.740
through the initial configuration.

96
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.140
In this model, we introduce software VPN.

97
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.820
We discussed the benefits of software V, P N's and compared software.

98
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.140
VP ends to 80 west manage VPN.

99
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.230
We also demonstrate deploy in a software VPN device.

100
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.590
In our next module, we'll be taking a look at 80 West direct connect.

101
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.780
Don't forget if you got any questions at this point,

102
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.350
please leave them in discussion section of this costs.

103
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.610
And also remember, we do have some learning checks.

104
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.540
They can check your progress along the way,

105
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:27.000
so please join me the next month, you'll I will continue along our AWS hybrid networking journey.
