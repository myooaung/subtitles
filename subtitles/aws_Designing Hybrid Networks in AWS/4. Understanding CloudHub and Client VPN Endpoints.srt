[Autogenerated] Finally, in this model we've discussed,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,290
age was cloud Hope and client VPN endpoints have a little

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,780
think about your network right now.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,480
How many locations does your company half do?

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,440
These locations need to route to each other.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,600
If so, how is that ruin?

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,310
Achieve?

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,250
Do you sight sight?

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,940
VPN Also, Do you have staff that worked from home?

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,330
How do they connect?

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,100
Do they use remote access weekends to connect to your corporate network?

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,630
Ed West has features that can help with connectivity between your location

13
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,310
and that consist your staff connecting to your corporate network while

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,650
they're on the road a while they're at home were introduced in then cloud

15
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,440
hope on client VPN endpoints cloud him,

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,610
Connect your science using a hub and spoke design within a depressed virtual.

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,280
Get acting is the Hope client VPN endpoints our managed remote access

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,040
repeating service that allow your start to secure the connect your VP sees on

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,940
potentially through those VP sees back from premise.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,490
Here's an example of cloud.

21
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:10,410
We have three sites headquarters brunch, one on brunch, too.

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,180
Each of those sites has created a site site connection with a

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,430
virtual private get where hosted in and breasts.

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,830
Now this virtual private gateway is attached to a V p.

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,840
C.

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,400
But the cloud hope that's not a requirement.

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,540
The virtual private gatewaycan be detached for this configuration toe work.

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,240
We'll create multiple customer gateways on multiple sites like VPN connections.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,550
Because this virtual private gateway is attached to the VPC.

30
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,560
Not only will our branches and headquarters be able

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,910
to communicate with each other,

32
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,360
there will also be a route to the VP sees as well

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
in out of the cloud up to work,

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,510
our site site VPN must be dynamic PPL's So here we can

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,910
see the each of our own premise.

36
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,150
VPN points has been assigned a unique autonomous system number.

37
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,770
Autonomous system numbers on the rest of the B G P

38
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,640
configuration will be discussed in detail in the B G P module

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,700
client VPN points a manage client base VPN.

40
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,060
They allow you to secure the actor Sadie, Wes and Gunn.

41
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,680
Promise results is each client V.

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:08,810
P.

43
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,700
An End point has a route terrible access to AWS and on premises

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,840
controlled by manipulating roots In this route table,

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,570
our staff will need a VPN client installed on their laptops and then

46
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,340
they can use T C P R U D P to connect Ryland Point.

47
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,240
Allowing remarks his clients to connect your VP sees is not new.

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,340
Prior to client v p M points,

49
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,980
we would use the customized easy to instance to allow these remote

50
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,840
access VPN When we configure a client VPN point,

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,660
we can use active director of an occasion to authenticate the

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,920
users our mutual authentication using digital certificate client

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,440
v p M Points Support Split tunnel.

54
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,140
This means that traffic that's destined for RV PCR on premise.

55
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,340
We'll go for the marks VPN.

56
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,680
Internet bound traffic will just traveled for that normal Internet collection.

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,210
Examples of access include provide access to a V P.

58
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,140
C.

59
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,640
Providing access from premise.

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,540
Andi buys a combination of root tables, security groups and knuckles.

61
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,000
We can configure restricted access to specific results. Is
