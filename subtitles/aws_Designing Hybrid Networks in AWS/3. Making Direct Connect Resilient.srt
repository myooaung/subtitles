00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,770
[Autogenerated] one of things you want.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,440
Consider when work with direct, connect his resiliency.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,900
If you are to a signal direct connect part on that part fails,

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,710
then your connection will fail,

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,940
and it may not be the part on the individual device that fails.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,340
It may be the device itself.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,420
It may be a problem with the direct connect location Evil way if we

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,650
can want to avoid single point of failure now,

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,650
one of the ways we can do that is to use a site site VPN vinyl.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,570
Turn a path through traffic if the direct connect connection fails.

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,190
This is a relatively inexpensive way to provide resilience if your connection.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,850
But we have to remember the reasons why we're using

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,840
direct connect in the first place.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,070
We want that dedicated, private, predictable connection.

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,240
If we fail over to a site site link, all of that goes away.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,060
But the site site connection is relatively inexpensive and easy,

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,110
or so Aws has four resiliency models for direct connect Oh,

18
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,890
my discos and each one of those in the coming slides.

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,260
Of course, there's nothing stopping you,

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,000
combining one of the direct Connect resilience of methods with a site

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,540
site collection back up as a path of last results.

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,610
In this example, we can see headquarters on.

23
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,340
We can see how direct current location unaided West six After left inside.

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,700
In this example, we start off with one cross connect connection.

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,160
Our equipment is connected to one part in the direct

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,090
connect racks to provide resilience.

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,710
If this link, we can request a second cross, connect a second part.

28
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,890
Now, if there's a single failure in the direct connect rack,

29
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,440
are in the individual direct connect components.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,140
The effects one of our parts, it shouldn't affect the second.

31
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,340
We'd increase his resiliency by having multiple on premise

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,810
devices on multiple deployed devices.

33
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,410
In the direct Connect location we call this model classic or deaf test.

34
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,540
The classic model is the original model.

35
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,940
We purchase a single part to begin with and add additional parts for resiliency.

36
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,740
Also accusing congregation to increased bandwidth.

37
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,020
Deaf Test is one of the newer deployment types and

38
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,200
establishes to cross connects right from the start.

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,040
As long as we adverse lnc on our side of the connection,

40
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,980
then the single point of failure here becomes a direct connect location itself.

41
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,010
This model is called the high resiliency model No is here.

42
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,740
We're using two different direct connect locations

43
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,640
with this high resiliency option.

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,770
We have a single cross connect connection,

45
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:30,200
each direct connect location, and now we're protected from location failure.

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,490
If one of the direct connect location fails, traffic can flow through the ever.

47
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,680
This final model is called Maximum Resiliency.

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,390
Again, we use multiple direct connect locations,

49
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,240
and we start off with a single cross connect connection each.

50
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,140
But for maximum resiliency,

51
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,470
these will be supplemented by a second cross

52
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,540
connect connection in each facility.

53
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,240
Now it protected against location failure.

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,810
Onda localize part failure as well to configure resiliency.

55
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,900
When Audrey and Direct Connect Connection,

56
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,680
we can use the resilience, a tool kit.

57
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,640
This is a wizard that we can access through the Direct Connect console.

58
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,140
A little guy just threw the choices that we need to make

59
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,240
bay to the far resiliency options.

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,130
Again, there's nothing stopping us on a V P M.

61
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,680
Backup for these results of efforts.

62
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,870
If AWS learns about one of our networks from a direct

63
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:31,000
connect connection under VPN connection, it always prefers the direct connect path
