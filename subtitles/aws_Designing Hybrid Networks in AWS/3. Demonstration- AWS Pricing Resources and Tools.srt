1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,740
[Autogenerated] in this demonstration.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,840
Well, take a look at some surprising results and tools available to us in AWS.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,850
Throughout this demonstration,

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:16,940
we're gonna work in with B A U s Consul on the Aid West Documentation.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,040
If you want to follow along this demonstration,

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,890
you will need an address account on a Web browser.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,850
I'm back in the U S.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,740
Consul this time in the building and cost management dashboard.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,670
This is a great tool for keeping track of how much

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,740
you're spending inside a duress.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:30,950
Here.

12
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,540
We can see cost a new sitter parts we consent budgets.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,740
And if I would click bill details,

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,080
we'd see a breakdown of our expenditure so far this month.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,690
I never told us.

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,320
Kidnappers manage costs is trusted.

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,190
Advisor Trusted Advisor makes recommendations based on best practice.

18
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,090
One of the domains supported by trusted advisor is cost optimization.

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,040
If I select cost optimization,

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,540
you can see that all the recommendations are great out.

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,740
That's because I'm not the correct support level.

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,540
You must be the business, our enterprise support level.

23
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,340
In order for the cost optimization demand to be turned on when it is turned on,

24
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,240
it'll make suggestions on how you can save money in your account by

25
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,780
taking your results is against best practice guidelines,

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,070
both Building management interested.

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,830
Advisor.

28
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,640
A great Once you started deploying resources to AWS.

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,530
But what about when you're the design phase?

30
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,670
I am trying to figure out how much you are designed.

31
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,240
What costs Once deployed?

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,140
Well, we could start off with the simple Mumford calculator.

33
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,710
The simple move.

34
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,560
A calculator allows you to input details regarding the service

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,320
choices you're about to make in a deep breath and then give you an

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,840
estimate of how much till social cost.

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,500
For example, if I scroll down to V.

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:36,660
P.

39
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,780
C on select Amazon BPC, I can then choose a region.

40
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,280
For example, you west, too, and into a US too angular.

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,820
Deploy a site site VPN.

42
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,200
So I fill in the veep in connection section here.

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,040
I've selected that I'll have five deep in connections, 100% immunization.

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,270
You can see it's given me an estimated monthly bill.

45
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,800
If I scroll down a little bit, let's add some debt out in this case,

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,750
five terabytes if a scroll back up and this time we'll

47
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,170
click on estimate your monthly bill and he gives a

48
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,040
breakdown about Bill for that month.

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,610
So the VPN connections on the Data 600 fight $2.55 per month so we

50
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,670
can use the simple of calculator Jonah Tsang fares to keep a track

51
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,950
of our estimated spend a new a tool.

52
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,640
Available to us is the AWS pricing calcula.

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,570
The address pricing calculator works a bit like the simple monthly calculator.

54
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,620
We select Queer Estimate and then we select the service is

55
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,800
that we want to deploy into a digress, for example,

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,740
VPN.

57
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,400
When we search VPN, the VP service appears.

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,780
I don't we could say configure and now it works a bit

59
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,520
like the simple man for calculator.

60
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,110
We have VPN selected,

61
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,360
we can choose a region and then we can provide

62
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,900
details about pours VPN connections.

63
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,570
And it will tell us an estimated monthly bill So that

64
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,940
same five VPN connection selected.

65
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,140
It tells that monthly estimated bill will be under Net $2.

66
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,770
50.

67
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,240
This new pricing calculator it's a replacement for the simple Mumford

68
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,790
calcula and should the calculator you use going forward,

69
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,840
the final two alone show you is the total cost of ownership calculator,

70
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,050
the total cost of ownership calcula It's not as relevant for

71
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,730
your hybrid networking designs this tool.

72
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,640
I'll just to find your workloads, as they have been in on premise now.

73
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,450
So what physical service do you have?

74
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,540
What virtual service do you have?

75
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,140
What story do you have on the report that the TCO calculate it generates?

76
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,360
We'll give you your estimate, Spend on premise now and then.

77
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,530
Compare that to the estimate.

78
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,670
Spend if you deploy the same resources into a de Bresse.

79
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,510
The final thing wanna point out in this demonstration is the

80
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,900
Aid West documentation specifically here we're on the air Due

81
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,740
West Direct Connect pricing page.

82
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,840
It's fruit pricing pages like this that you'll find the

83
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,830
latest pricing for your region during your design and

84
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,530
planning of your integration with AWS.

85
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,380
I encourage you to seek out the letters price information.

86
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,340
We've covered a lot over the last two hours.

87
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,870
We started off by introducing hybrid architectures.

88
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,640
I'm discussing what I bring network architecture is,

89
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,600
and we gave, you know, view of some of the key components.

90
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,310
We went on to introduce site site V.

91
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,810
P n's Direct Connect on dradis ghost transit.

92
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,340
VP sees transit VP sees is still out there, and it's still popular.

93
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,160
But new design should take advantage of transit.

94
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,530
Gateway's first and only fall back to use in transit.

95
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,340
VP sees it turns it gateways don't meet your requirement.

96
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,710
We went on to discuss some of the supporting service.

97
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,000
Is the weather deploy when working with hybrid network architectures?

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,170
These included Hybrid Name A Solution Group 53

99
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,580
Traffic Policies on Transit Gateway.

100
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,790
We also briefly discussed Resource Access Manager on how we can use RAM to

101
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,740
share resources between Amazon Web service accounts.

102
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,530
We then went on to look at a dress man's V,

103
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,310
P N's and Software VP ends in detail,

104
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,640
and we discussed how software VPN they're still popular for bring you a

105
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,400
licensed AL years and you want to take advantage of existence.

106
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,680
Skill sets on premise.

107
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,940
We did say that manage three pens are highly available by design,

108
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,140
and if you deploy software V P N's,

109
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,920
you'll have to decide what level of high availability you want to deploy.

110
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,740
A manic.

111
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,420
We also discussed client VPN points on.

112
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,510
We discussed how we could use cloud hope to route

113
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,240
traffic between our different branches.

114
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,130
We then went on to discuss Aid West direct connect on how we

115
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,990
provide high availability for Ed US Direct Connect.

116
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,630
We finished off this cost with conversations around B g, p.

117
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,500
And we discuss what B.

118
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,630
G P is on.

119
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,940
How we could use B G p with direct connect and site site VI pets

120
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,340
in this final module with discuss pricing.

121
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,010
Specifically cites I v P M pricing, Direct Connect pricing.

122
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,930
And we've had a look at some of the pricing tools and

123
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,340
documentation that you can use Junior design of hybrid

124
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,960
network in architecture In this module, we just go sight sight billing aid US.

125
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,600
Direct Connect Billing on.

126
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,340
We gave you a quick cost summary.

127
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,680
Thank you.

128
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,740
Spending the last two hours.

129
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,530
I hope it's cause of giving you the information you need to

130
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,840
start your hybrid network in journey.

131
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,200
For those of you thinking about the Age of West advanced networking exam,

132
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,530
make sure you've you've given courses in the pool side here.

133
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,440
Divorce, advanced networking track.

134
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,920
Finally feel free to leave any comments or questions you might

135
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
have in the discussion sector of this costs.

136
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,700
Have a look at the learning checks to test your knowledge

137
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,500
on If you'd like to please leave a star.

138
