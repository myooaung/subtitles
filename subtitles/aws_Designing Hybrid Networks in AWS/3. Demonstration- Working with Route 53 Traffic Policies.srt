1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,040
[Autogenerated] in this demonstration.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,100
Where could be working with Route 53 traffic

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,760
policies throughout this demonstration?

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Where could be working with the Midwest Council on

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,440
DHF All along this demonstration, you'll need your own AWS account.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,150
I'm signed into the 80 West console specifically the Route 53

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:26,050
dashboard inside here hunger and select traffic policies to

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,040
create a new conflict policy.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,740
We click create conflict policy.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,200
We then provide a name on optional description for our policy with

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,800
the policy name and version description filled in.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,840
Well, then click Next.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,950
We're now given access to the traffic policy campus through here,

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,170
we can offer our traffic policy or we can impart on existing

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,640
traffic policy and make changes to that.

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,940
We're gonna offer a new policy.

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,140
Firstly, we have to pick a start point.

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,340
The start point represents the type of record this policy will work with.

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,040
If we click on the Dennis type drop down,

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,440
we can select from this list of records.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,040
I want this polished Woke up a records, so I leave the area code selected.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,880
Then we click connector.

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,640
If we scroll down a little bit,

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,740
we can see the list of options for the first step in a traffic policy.

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,300
Little Mannix.

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,910
Traffic policy needs to be a failure of a policy.

27
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,940
So we select fail over rule.

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,740
Our failure of a rule is gonna have to end points.

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,020
The primary endpoint is, well,

30
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,040
one all traffic to go unless that primary point isn't healthy.

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,140
In which case traffic should go to the second round point.

32
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,640
If I select connector next to primary,

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,840
scroll down a little bit and choose new endpoint,

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,540
this end point then represents the destination about traffic.

35
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,040
If we start the drop down next to type,

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,550
we can see all the different kind of endpoints.

37
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,900
Globe Mannix website sits behind an application.

38
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,040
Love answer.

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,140
If I select LB application, Little bouncer,

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,670
we can see the value is already being filled in.

41
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,580
And that's because globe Mannix only house,

42
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,540
one application little bouncer deployed.

43
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,370
I'm happy with traffic going to that in point as long as it's healthy.

44
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,840
So we have to configure health checks.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,950
If I could come to drop down next to health checks.

46
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,640
I already have a globe Mannix health check configured,

47
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,710
which I can select,

48
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,860
so our traffic policy will use the value of the self check to

49
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,840
determine where this end point is healthy are no,

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,470
it's healthier.

51
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,890
The end point will be used.

52
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,540
If not, traffic will be sent to the second round point.

53
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,700
So if I scroll down a little bit and again,

54
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,820
click connector, scroll down Dittmar and choose new endpoint again.

55
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,860
If I quit the drop down next to Value Globe,

56
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,840
Mannix has configured and Esther you book it with some site

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,270
content that their customers should be directed to in the

58
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,130
event that their main website fails.

59
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,740
So if I choose S3 website in point,

60
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,290
I make sure I choose the glove money's book it that

61
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,540
contains a static Web site content.

62
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,840
This traffic policy meets Globe Mannix requirements.

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,740
So if I now say, create traffic policy,

64
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,900
it won't take a minute to create traffic policy.

65
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,640
Now we must make sure the correct hosted zone is listed in the host's own box.

66
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,770
He can see I'm gonna be working with the glove man

67
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,340
Exhausted zone The final piece.

68
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,640
This puzzle then, is to enable a policy record.

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,040
So the pulse of echo box I type for this example Www and what we're asking

70
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,750
Route 53 to do is to create this record in the Globe.

71
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,610
Manic stop comes on.

72
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,370
And then whenever Route 53 gets a new resolution,

73
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,240
request this record to assess that request through the traffic policy.

74
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
No, it's the price at the end here.

75
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,910
This policy record is gonna cost me $50 per month.

76
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,450
You'll be charged an additional $50 per month for every record

77
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,390
you won't assessed through your traffic policy.

78
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,550
I'm half of a single record scroll down, I select.

79
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,540
Create policy record.

80
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:53,240
Once the traffic policies create, I can create new versions of trying policy.

81
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,570
Andi.

82
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,590
I can add additional policy records to be evaluated through the policy globe.

83
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,380
Mannix needs were quite basic, which is one level of decision making.

84
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,830
Using that failure of a rule, all traffic should go.

85
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,640
Fellow balancer, This is not healthy.

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,300
Then it should go to the stock website hosted a street,

87
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,440
but traffic policies come in more complex.

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,340
This is an example of our complex traffic in policy

89
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,540
with three levels of decision making.

90
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,080
First of all,

91
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:26,240
we have a fail of rule on that feel of rule has a primary on second round point.

92
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,040
If the primary path is chosen next we have awaited rule

93
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,970
that sends a percentage of requests in two different

94
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,270
directions from the way it rule.

95
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,490
We have a location rule that sends European traffic in

96
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,760
one direction on the rest of world.

97
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,840
You never.

98
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,670
As you can see from this example,

99
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,940
these Route 53 traffic policies commit very nuanced decisions about

100
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,740
which I p address to resolve your name requester.

101
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,780
One final thing to show you.

102
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,440
Here.

103
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,700
This is Theglobe Mannix Health check.

104
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:02,000
And this is checking the health of this end point. And it's his health check that was used in our failure of a routine policy.
