1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,360
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,930
So there are a couple more things that we need to do to finish this.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,480
I know that we were almost finished but I think we should add some more functionality to our application

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,450
before we continue.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,210
All right.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,920
So what are the functionalities that we want to add.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,080
Well very simple if we have a user name that is the same as the person that's typing it in the form

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,490
we don't want to register that person we don't want to register two people with the same username or

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,730
we don't want a race or two people with the same email address.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,260
So let's go to our application.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:40,710
I'm going to open another window here real quick if I can get to it in the register here.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,090
Let's go to it.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,430
Re-instill that BHB does have that available there.

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,830
All right.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,500
All right.

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:57,660
So we want to actually give them an error if this exists or if this of the e-mail address is.

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,930
So let's go and make two functions that will help us with that.

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,830
All right so let's create the first function here.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,640
Email exist and we can make it better late later.

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,690
But right now I think this is the best option you can come up with something better probably in the

21
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,050
future once you see me doing it.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,040
All right.

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:26,280
So the first thing is that we get to say well we're going to get our Querrey going here we're going

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,060
to say select ID from

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:42,810
users where e-mail equals what their e-mail coming in right here.

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,960
What we need some single calls here email right now.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,230
I'll show you how to do something real quick.

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,740
It's going to be.

29
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,830
It's going to be fun.

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:02,580
So let's use our Querrey function that we create in a DVD BHB Let's send it square.

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,570
And we save this square with whatever comes back in this resort.

32
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,070
All right.

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:13,770
So now we can say if row count and you know with is comment this is coming from this is another function

34
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,150
that we created right here in the BHB to count how many rows are coming back.

35
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:26,330
So ero count we got to passing the risotto equals one that means we got something from the database.

36
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,300
And what do we do if we got something we return true.

37
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,630
If not

38
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,230
we return

39
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,470
false.

40
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,030
Pretty cool stuff right.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,890
Very easy to implement.

42
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,080
And you know what we can implement almost ascending for username.

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,180
So we copy and paste that one and we'll just change the name here user name change the variable here

44
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,240
to a user name.

45
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:08,650
And change is here to use a name and change this to username.

46
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,230
Super simple right can really can be simpler than that.

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:24,880
So now we can use is right below here when we are checking for email first we check the email just

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,990
so we say if email exist and we pass in the mail.

49
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,560
All right.

50
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,080
Well

51
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,730
we can display an error right here the errors

52
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,810
sorry that email already exist is register

53
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,890
right.

54
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:06,520
And for the user name copy the same thing here and we create something for the user name.

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,150
Real quick

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,130
if user name I just

57
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:21,400
repassing the user name right here and then we say Sorry that user name

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,600
is already taken.

59
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,030
Right.

60
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,740
Let's check it out real quick.

61
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,370
All right.

62
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,570
So we know that in the end it's you my admin.

63
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,450
We already have an e-mail called Etling according fact with the dot com or whatever e-mail you are using.

64
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,970
I got to use the name of Rico.

65
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,140
Let's check it out real quick to see if this works right.

66
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:57,290
So let's go to the register that BHP refresh this and I'm going to use one D.S. username.

67
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:06,230
We go an email address Edwyn and quoting faculty that come that way you e-mail that exists.

68
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,240
I want those two arrows.

69
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,520
1 2 and 3 1 2 and 3.

70
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,340
So we got to make this fail and this failed that the register.

71
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,110
So that user name is already taken.

72
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,950
Sorry that e-mail is registered your e-mail cannot be more than 20 characters.

73
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,770
I think this is wrong.

74
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,080
Let's check it out.

75
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,290
The email one.

76
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,770
All right we messed up on the e-mail

77
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,670
SDR lenth

78
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,710
is.

79
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,460
I don't think we can measure that e-mail right there.

80
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,480
That was a very small e-mail let me see.

81
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,690
Should that it is longer than 20 character because it's there.

82
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,860
So emails are different.

83
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,100
We don't want to mess around with e-mail.

84
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,760
Let's just do a minimum for the e-mail.

85
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,780
All right.

86
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,570
Like this.

87
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,450
But you do minimal.

88
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,460
But anyway

89
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,010
you're going to have to probably set a max for him.

90
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,500
E-mail a lot longer than 20 characters.

91
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,890
Maybe something like 50 characters for e-mail.

92
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:14,710
But anyway as you can see we were able to display was available and was not available.

93
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,160
Rico last we're one two and 3 1 2 and three.

94
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,930
I'm going to use another

95
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,000
e-mail address just to display one error register.

96
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,170
Sorry that user name is already taken.

97
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,330
You see that beautiful.

98
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,130
Anyway hope you see how this is going.

99
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,720
I think we're done with this functionality for now for validating.

100
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:41,250
And now what we need to work on is on the register user function that registers the users and inputs

101
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,300
all these data in the database right in the Users table.

102
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,650
Thank you so much for watching.

103
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,900
Hope you are enjoying this very much like I am joined to teaching to you and I hope you I wish you the

104
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,500
best in life.

105
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,370
Just make sure that you always always practice practice practice and learn learn learn.

106
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,890
See you in the next lecture.
