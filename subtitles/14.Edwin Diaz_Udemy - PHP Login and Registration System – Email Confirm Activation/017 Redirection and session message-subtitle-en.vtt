00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.150

All right.



2

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.790

Welcome back my students.



3

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.920

So in the last lecture we were able to register a user and even do a lot of the volume which will help



4

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.700

us in the future.



5

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.230

I'm pretty sure it will help a lot of you.



6

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.780

But anyway now that we are registering the user it will be fun to display a really nice message and



7

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.490

maybe redirect the user to the index page or something like that.



8

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.910

Right.



9

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.840

But at the same time it will be fun to send the user some type of e-mail with a link that they could



10

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.090

click on.



11

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.320

And that way they can activate their account.



12

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.590

Right.



13

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.200

Because right now this user is not active as you can see right now is zero.



14

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.130

If they become if we put a one here we can indicate that they are active and that we can test against



15

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.800

that later.



16

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.200

All right.



17

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.980

Now what I want to do is fix this register and then redirect to the home page or something like that.



18

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.070

So let's go and do that real quick.



19

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:04.910

So if this function is true right what I want to do is I want to set a special some type of message.



20

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.560

Let's do it right here.



21

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.710

So this function is true.



22

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.740

We're going to set a message.



23

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.890

We're going to use our custom functions that we created.



24

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.900

And we're just going to put a paragraph in here and we can do that.



25

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.440

And let's set a class A Bushra class saying something like B.G. success which is a green color a green



26

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.290

background B.G. means background.



27

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.450

And then we can say Ted center goes to center that element that's right this is where predefined classes



28

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.380

and bootstrapped.



29

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.970

And we can say something like please please check your spam folder.



30

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.240

Email spam for other Please take your email.



31

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.430

Check your e-mail



32

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.390

for spam folder for an activation link.



33

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.400

All right activation no activation activation and then semicolon.



34

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.980

All right.



35

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.710

So once we send a message we can redirect then we can use our custom function as well to redirect to



36

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.530

our indexed BHB array beautiful.



37

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.610

We don't need this here and after we do that to show this in the that BHB we need to go to the end it's



38

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.670

that BHB and use function here somewhere.



39

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.420

All right.



40

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.320

So right here in Germany in the Jumbotron.



41

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.020

I'm going to put a BHB taxing year and get an echo display message.



42

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.070

Actually I don't think I have to echo anything.



43

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.300

I just got a poor display message going to check that in a minute right now.



44

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.290

Let's go to functions that BHB all the way to the top.



45

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.190

Yeah we don't have to put anything.



46

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.180

All right.



47

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.730

So let's registar another user let's have some more fun with our registration form.



48

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.980

Let's refresh and let's register another user.



49

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.170

What we're going to call these user Joe.



50

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.330

That's easy right.



51

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.400

Joe Joe Doe.



52

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.970

And then is user names going to be Joe's.



53

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:25.960

Joe one e-mail Joe at gmail dot com password 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 and 4 register.



54

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.850

Please check your email or spouse for the activation link.



55

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.710

Isn't that beautiful right.



56

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.080

That's beautiful if we refresh here.



57

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.950

That message is gone.



58

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.520

All right.



59

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.270

Of course you might want to display your new home page somewhere else.



60

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.880

All right.



61

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.410

This is just the way I'm doing it here.



62

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.110

You can display this message somewhere else right here above.



63

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.340

All right.



64

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.780

I just wanted to show you how this can be done right.



65

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.630

But anyway.



66

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.350

Beautiful right.



67

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.560

All right let's go to register functionality here functions at BHB.



68

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.450

All right.



69

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.840

So let's go all the way down what are we missing here.



70

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.750

Raised on the user input in that and now we got to send a user the e-mail.



71

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.830

So in the next lecture we're going to build a functionality where we send the user email and the link



72

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.170

with the parameters that they need to click.



73

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.670

So that way the king Darktown can be activate he's going to be pretty fun.



74

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.400

Thank you so much.



75

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.440

And I see you in the next lecture.



76

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.830

Let's have some fun guys.
