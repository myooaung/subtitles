1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,030
Welcome back my students so in the last lecture we starting started to set up this configuration here

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,320
for BHB mater and this lecture we're going to go to a male trap.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,000
I hope you register already.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,880
And I got a free account you can see here.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,000
Nothing much.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,610
And I'm going to grab my username

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,890
and I'm going to place it right here.

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:38,940
Let's go back and get the password.

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,070
Simple as that.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,470
OK.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,710
There's not much else that we need here.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,850
Let's see.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,590
So we got the hose.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,680
We got this.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,300
I always like to have this lake somewhere down here.

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,240
I like to have my meaning formation on top.

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,610
So we got the hoes who got to use a name.

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,810
The port

19
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,050
true to your list that's fine.

20
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:20,300
We got the subject the body.

21
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,130
You know what.

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,920
You know what I like to actually set.

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,410
Where is that e-mail coming from.

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,720
That's something.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,430
So bring porn right.

26
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,680
So I think they do have a set.

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,140
From there we go.

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,480
Now I'm going to say it's from courting faculty OK.

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,090
And I even put my name here I think as the second parameter that works very good for not mistake it

30
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,750
should be good.

31
00:01:51,750 --> 00:02:00,420
I haven't used it in a while since I got this set up with templates and all that stuff and I use a lot

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,320
of frameworks but that's because I know what I'm doing Guys if you are new to BHB I don't recommend

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,210
using a framework right away OK.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,670
Working at an address here and at

35
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,190
that could be whatever address is coming through.

36
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,120
Basically that is the recipient.

37
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,080
And so I have this tool here.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,290
What else.

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,460
As you can see the method to my the they are actually highlighted in green.

40
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:40,510
OK.

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,340
And the properties are just white.

42
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:55,510
So I got the subject I got the body I got some body is for non HD mail clients if you want it if you

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,550
want that you can have it that's fine.

44
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:05,300
So now this looks like our Mac function is ready to send a e-mail.

45
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,160
OK so now everywhere we have this we can send an e-mail right.

46
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:18,200
Well let's try this is actually create some type of test file you know are Logan somewhere.

47
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,740
So let's see if let's see

48
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,080
that BHP let's open these

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,030
and let's include our functions right.

50
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,680
So require

51
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:53,360
to remember where it is is and where it was and functions and then functions are BHB.

52
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,510
OK.

53
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,410
And what else we need we need the

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,140
we need to require super porn.

55
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:17,390
The vendor shows me autoload I would go to order low class

56
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,870
and now we can go ahead and send the email

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:37,330
and let's see the parameters that he has email subject in message.

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,010
So in reality we don't need to put this now because we are sending as you can see we've got all these

59
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,900
static tests here and and so on and so on.

60
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,700
And

61
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,640
I know I'm going to send everything

62
00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:00,320
static for now because we're I'm going to be doing later on is going to be setting up a classes directory

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,270
with a class sign that we're going to be required because that's where we're going to be putting our

64
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,070
configuration.

65
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,520
We don't want to put configurations in the function files.

66
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,110
Ok so later on we're going to do that.

67
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:21,160
But for now which is going to do Tess G.M. whatever Right now we're just going to test things out and

68
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,940
see if they work.

69
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,890
OK.

70
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,140
So as a matter of fact I'm going to leave this to you.

71
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,720
Go ahead and try to make this work.

72
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,760
I want you to run through some issues maybe hopefully not but if you run through some issues try to

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,140
figure that out by yourself and I'll see you in the next election to see if we can get this to work.
