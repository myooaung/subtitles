1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,040
All right.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,180
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,560
Am I the student.

4
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:12,360
So now in the last lecture we wrote all this code here and we are detecting if we find a roll with this

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,140
same e-mail and when the validation that we're getting from there you are.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,070
Pretty cool stuff.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,450
And we find one we chose a queen a success message book.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,570
We can do that unless we first date the user right.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:34,020
So let's make a Querrey real quick here and Elisha's create a query real quick to update the user to

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,340
unlock the active state.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,910
Right.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:44,660
So we're going to say of the users and we're going to set active column active equal to 1.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,430
And we're also going to grab the validation call the call on we're going to send it to zero because

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,530
we don't need it anymore.

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,150
They're users active and we're going to need a body they can call later.

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,200
When we are doing something else right when we are validating you know maybe a forgotten password or

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,270
something like that.

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:13,830
So now we're going to do that zero where email is equal to email and we're going to concatenate here

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,980
because we are going to be scaping this and you could write a scale function even when you do your Querrey

20
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,990
and your helper functions if you want to do that.

21
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,330
So that way every data you put in here is already scaped even before you put it.

22
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,020
I like to do like this because I like to show you how he's done as well.

23
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,120
But if you want to go ahead and do it escape it before it comes to this area here you can so that what

24
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,860
you how to do what I'm doing concatenating here all the time.

25
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,910
All right.

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:44,140
So now this is a female so we need some single quotes around it.

27
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,270
And that's about it.

28
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,010
That's all we're going to do here.

29
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,680
Nobody can actually.

30
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:02,820
They use a segue active where everybody they called actually said users active and then they go to zero

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:10,180
away e-mail equals they e-mail and we can make this a little stronger as well and we can say and the

32
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:21,530
validation code equals the variable and it's concatenated as well.

33
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:29,530
To escape it and we're going to say validation code.

34
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,610
And this is this right here.

35
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,580
All right.

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,420
So beautiful.

37
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:46,150
It should be very strong right now and I'm going to grab this and paste it right here and we can say

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,720
you know what we saw too.

39
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:57,680
So that way we can distinguish these two and rescue two and two.

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,470
All right.

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,700
All right perfect.

42
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,940
Now we can decode the message right.

43
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:11,960
But I said that we were going to have probably said this in some type of session before right.

44
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,290
So let's do that let's just said this thing.

45
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,210
A session has a message like this.

46
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,730
And we don't need to pass these paragraphs.

47
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,290
They write

48
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,550
do we.

49
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,660
Let's look at the message

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,720
display message it's just echoing in the masses like that so we might need that

51
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,100
paragraph.

52
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,810
That's OK.

53
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,770
All right.

54
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:57,600
But then after they sending the message we want to redirect the user to logon log in BHP.

55
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:04,450
And what we want to do is that on logging that BHP we want to use the other function that displays a

56
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,950
session.

57
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,230
So let's go to log in and right here.

58
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,070
All right.

59
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,920
Remember I have a container with a class of row that's just a rows is going to separate.

60
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,890
This row this container or this element from this row right here.

61
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,570
This class is in Bootstrap separate content array which is separate into a different area.

62
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:38,030
And this will make it 50 percent on all the media Querrey.

63
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,460
All right.

64
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:45,220
Anyway let's use and I have a really good course on Bushrod by the way is a very short course it we

65
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,630
show you the basics here.

66
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:55,810
We're going to use a function that displays session if it's set.

67
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,030
All right so now let's try this.

68
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,310
We go all these parameters here as a matter of fact.

69
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,540
I already have it here but I got attached to as well.

70
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,240
All right.

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:18,070
I'm going to copy it and this is this guy right here one and we got his validation code.

72
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,030
He's active he's active right now he's at zero.

73
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,710
All right.

74
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:31,300
So if we go here and we type that in Enter we have an error on expected down 371.

75
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,030
Let me check on this real quick.

76
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,310
Three seventy one.

77
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,520
We have one expected.

78
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:48,750
Oh we forgot the semicolon So we're here with the not 371 set message your cause being activated Please

79
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,950
log in and oh we forgot this parentheses.

80
00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:03,190
Let's check to see and BHB my admin if this account was activated or ready refresh and is as being activated

81
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,130
so I didn't go through.

82
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,640
Let's do it again.

83
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,330
All right.

84
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:15,690
Enter your account has been activated Please login and he takes us to the log in that BHB page.

85
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,160
All right let's go here let's refresh and look at it.

86
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,930
If you're if you see right now you see the difference the validation code is zero.

87
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,490
And they act active stay active.

88
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,120
Call them is set to 1.

89
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,600
All right.

90
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,240
Beautiful

91
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,400
beautiful All right.

92
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,960
So we were able to change that on the user and we're doing pretty good.

93
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:51,750
So in the next lecture we're going to continue building on this and we're good.

94
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,530
Oh by the way if it doesn't find a resoled.

95
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,130
All right.

96
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,440
That means that something went wrong here.

97
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,000
That means you couldn't find the user so we can set another message here saying something like

98
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,430
we're going to set this to danger and we're going to say your account

99
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,340
sorry

100
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:25,990
your account

101
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,700
cannot cannot be activated.

102
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,300
All right.

103
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:45,370
And we can take this person to Mavie to log in that BHB that's OK.

104
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,310
If for some reason the e-mail address.

105
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,200
So let's try to do it now again because the e-mail exists already so it would try to do the activity

106
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,440
to see if I have it on.

107
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,070
Here is the story.

108
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,780
Your account going to be active cannot now be activated.

109
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,420
All right.

110
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,720
Perfect.

111
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,140
All right.

112
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:16,200
So he's working good and you can modify it and make it better on your own terms.

113
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,900
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
