00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,810
Hi welcome back many students so I'm super excited because now is the time to find out if things are

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,000
working with that email now.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:13,940
Remember that the mail function in BHB is not very very good.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,210
It's not 100 percent.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:21,040
So some email providers might put this in any email coming from the mail function into the spam folder

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,950
because a lot of hackers use it to spam people like spammers.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,780
So anyway now we can test the functionality.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,290
Remember me if you want to do that you're welcome to do that.

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,210
I'm pretty sure it worked 100 percent but you never know.

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:38,480
Right.

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:44,710
So let's let's just test this out real quick and low again.

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:50,740
All right well Ted we are there let's shut everything down.

13
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,760
All right.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,750
I think I don't have to log in to Go Daddy again.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,970
That's a pain.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,770
That's OK.

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,960
You can wait for me right.

18
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,280
All right.

19
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:10,550
So let's do this and let them call college Logan and you can see takes us to admen because we are still

20
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,860
logged in so that that's working.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,750
Now what we need to also verify that is working is the Forgot Password.

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:25,150
So let's do something here we won here let's say won and you know what we've got to do.

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:36,050
We've got to register my the actual like really the right address because if we register the wrong address

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,970
they get our application is going to send e-mail to that address and if it doesn't exist we can really

25
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,530
click on the link right.

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,470
So let's go let's register.

27
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:52,100
I'm going to raise them myself and then I put my writing e-mail information and then I work Whoops I

28
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,770
typed in the wrong stuff here.

29
00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:00,680
I got another application there so I'm logging app registered IP HP.

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,050
All right.

31
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:08,600
So I'm going to put my silver in there and I'm going to call myself.

32
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,450
Just anyone that's going to be my user name email address is going to be

33
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,460
support at coring faculty.

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,600
That's my Web site for courses.

35
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,900
Faculty dot com.

36
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,500
All right.

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,040
And I'm going to put some password that you don't know.

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,700
All right so you're welcome to put whatever password you want.

39
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,510
I'm just going to put a very short password here.

40
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,580
All right.

41
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,350
And then I registered.

42
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:49,760
And he says please check your email and I'm going to do that right now so wait a minute.

43
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,400
And then I see if it went to my e-mail address so I can show it to you.

44
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:53,860
OK.

45
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,840
And it looks like I got it.

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,580
I've got a whole bunch of other e-mails that I want to show you.

47
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,720
All right.

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,670
So anyway I'm going to show you why not.

49
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,370
I got a whole bunch of stuff here coming from postal service e-bay and Buddha or whatever.

50
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:26,480
So you can see that it came from Rico 20:30 awry active account of this subject.

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,890
And now we've got this link right here.

52
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,970
Pretty exciting right.

53
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,460
We can modify these and make it better.

54
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,080
But I already got this very like if I minimizer you can see it better now.

55
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,640
All right.

56
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,800
So we fight.

57
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:44,270
Now this is the wrong place of course because he says local So we need to modify that and make it to

58
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,780
go to our website.

59
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,000
All right but I'm going to take this link here.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,270
I'm going to write Colligan going to copy that address and I'm going to modify that address.

61
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,340
All right.

62
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,930
So I'm going to go to my text file here.

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,480
We'll correct that in a minute.

64
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,730
But we know he's working.

65
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:11,530
So I'm going to say I'm going to put my website address in that link right here and like that.

66
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,460
So he's going to be ups.

67
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:26,510
All right Edwin called College dot com for Slash blowing app and he's going to be activated.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,710
There we go.

69
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,100
And that's going to be that late.

70
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,260
Let's see if that works out.

71
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,820
All right.

72
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,860
And we can activate like the pasted in here.

73
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,230
Enter your account has been activated.

74
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,800
Oh how beautiful that is working really good.

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,950
Ryan so happy guys I'm so happy.

76
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,780
Beautiful.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,070
So now here we got a little game right.

78
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:57,510
So let me see if I remember the e-mail that support and my password and remember me please look again.

79
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,410
We are logged in.

80
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,840
So it's working beautifully.

81
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,770
All right.

82
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,570
Perfect.

83
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,570
So now that it's working really good.

84
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,280
All right.

85
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,730
So now let's say I forgot my password right.

86
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,860
As a matter of fact we got a live this like this on the next leg you were going to check on.

87
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,720
Actually the Forgotten Password why I'm right.

88
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,860
Because we've been doing really good right now and I don't want to really make this like 20 minutes

89
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,970
and then something is wrong and then I will have to go in the next lecture and do it right.

90
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,090
So we did good and this lecture is working.

91
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,660
The only thing that I recommend is for you to go back and change this link on your on the application

92
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,690
and make sure that it is localhost here says your Web site.

93
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,410
All right.

94
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,820
So go back to that function to activate user and change that.

95
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,250
All right.

96
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,790
For their age race or user I believe that's where we put it.

97
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,380
But anyway go change that.

98
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,640
Any way you see locals to your Web site if you're doing this on the Web site.

99
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,920
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

100
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,850
Take care.
