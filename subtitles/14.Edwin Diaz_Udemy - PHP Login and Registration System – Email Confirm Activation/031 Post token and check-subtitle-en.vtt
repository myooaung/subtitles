00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.360

All right welcome back my student.



2

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.360

So in this lecture here we're going to be starting with this functionality right.



3

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.460

Well we one here is basically we want the user to come from Logan and they forgot in their past we're



4

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.420

one then to type in their email.



5

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.860

We got to go into our system and we're going to check for that email address.



6

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.490

And then depending if we find the e-mail address we're going to send the user a link so they can reset



7

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.540

their password.



8

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.110

All right.



9

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.120

So we're going to be a pretty cool functionality I want you to get really excited right because you're



10

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.590

going to be learning some really cool stuff in this new section here.



11

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.810

But anyway let's start right away.



12

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.340

Right.



13

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.110

And let's do it.



14

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.050

So let's go to the recovery that BHB and this is what we're going to be putting our



15

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.520

our function.



16

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.160

All right.



17

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.860

So we're not going to do validation here because we only have one field maybe a little bit about the



18

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.610

nation not too much.



19

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.990

All right.



20

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.120

So let's go to functions that BHB



21

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.120

And as crazy Put it will come in here real quick



22

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.730

a recover password



23

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.540

password.



24

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.180

Let's write it down.



25

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.970

Recover password



26

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.700

or you can name something else.



27

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.150

Those have to be recovered.



28

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.270

Right now they're now recovery and password but we're just going to name ideas for now.



29

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.100

You can name it whatever you want something that sounds good for you.



30

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.140

All right important thing is to learn how to do this.



31

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.310

So the first thing is that we are going to be using is making sure that reform works right and we do



32

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:07.550

that all the time and we say request method is equal to what topos right.



33

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.590

And we're going to be using a really cool helper functions that I told you that we were going to be



34

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.530

using.



35

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.060

All right.



36

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.570

But anyway before we do that let's make sure that we're getting something out.



37

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.630

It works right.



38

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.480

Let's go and put this there to our recovery that BHB.



39

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.410

Let's just take all this out of here.



40

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.000

We don't need this stuff here for now.



41

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.680

All right.



42

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.110

So where are you going to be putting this stuff.



43

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.650

Let's just do it right here.



44

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.220

Right.



45

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.460

Save it here and let's check it out.



46

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.890

It works.



47

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.460

All right so we know he works now.



48

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.200

So why is the helper function that I was telling you about.



49

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:01.190

Well let's go and find out and go all the way to the top and talking generator.



50

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.060

Remember that beautiful.



51

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.460

So let me show you what a token generator can do.



52

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.840

Let's go back to recover that BHB and right here we have a fee.



53

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.940

Aid and input that is type hidden so nobody can see this.



54

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.040

All right now we got to be actually using this function right here.



55

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.050

We're going to aquittal like this.



56

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.740

Actually let me see if it already has actually doesn't have that.



57

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.190

So we have to work it out.



58

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.260

So Eckl talking generator was that going to do.



59

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.690

Well let's see let's see eating action.



60

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:46.020

Let's refresh Let's write Let's check page source and right now you can see the value here has a whole



61

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.070

bunch of strings.



62

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.450

And this is already encrypted.



63

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:56.240

When the five unique ID random and if we refresh again look at these numbers are right 0 3 and F.D.



64

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.680

at the end refresh.



65

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.210

You can see that each change again every time I refresh it gives me a different number.



66

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.260

So that's why we won.



67

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.840

Right.



68

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.140

Because we are going to be checking on this forum to see this is the same.



69

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.680

All right.



70

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.330

That is on this form at the moment when they submit that.



71

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.560

So that way no software can go in trying to do this later from another place.



72

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.130

All right.



73

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.270

So more information from another bat software or something like that.



74

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.210

So anyway so that's our talking generator there.



75

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.640

So let's actually test for that real quick before we go to the next lecture.



76

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.580

So we remember that we are setting a session as a matter of fact with that function right.



77

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.750

So let's check in.



78

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.690

So a session is set talking.



79

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.120

All right.



80

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.860

Pam this make this a little stronger post.



81

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.110

Remember we are also



82

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:06.230

sending a post talking but if the post talking is equal to session talking then we can do something



83

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.500

and that's crazy secure isn't it.



84

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.300

Right.



85

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.090

That would be just crazy.



86

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.810

Let's just refresh.



87

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.180

On functions 575.



88

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.390

What did I do here.



89

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.890

If it said session talking.



90

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:35.140

Oh you know what I forgot my this here and this you have only one here.



91

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.320

We should have this here.



92

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.420

Let's use right let's put some comments here functions and getting too excited too fast.



93

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.430

All right pulls up requests.



94

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.310

All right.



95

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.070

Let's put that in the middle there.



96

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:04.230

All right let's check in right now let's go back to refresh Now if we said it works.



97

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.010

All right.



98

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.740

So now or evaluations are working for that specific form that is crazy secure guys.



99

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.580

All right.



100

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.580

And tell everybody that Edwin Diaz show you how to do this is pretty awesome right.



101

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.300

So in the next lecture we're going to continue working on this when I pull out that e-mail from there



102

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.980

and we're going to verify to make sure that that e-mail is the same one for that specific user.



103

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.840

And if it is then we're going to you know validate this stuff.



104

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.650

So perfect you're doing really good if you're following me here.



105

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.000

Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
