1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,160
All right welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:11,220
So let's actually try to get some data from the last one Shneidman that we created which was a password

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,230
reset function.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,010
Right.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,990
But first we need to come from this here.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,580
All right.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,230
So we need to have those parameters.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,480
They are in place for this to work.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,680
So we need to go back to our.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,400
Now this one here or a string.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:37,180
Hopefully this deal works and is now expiring Fielitz That's why we need to do it again.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:45,720
And third OK still works and I'm going to grab this little guy right here copier right here and continue.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,160
All right Roland validation code.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,030
See there.

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,620
Oh that's beautiful.

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,460
Let's go back here and refresh.

17
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,340
And now this.

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,150
You have the right validation code.

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,600
Next we continue reset page.

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,630
We should put some type of message here right.

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,280
All right.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,630
So now what we need to do is make sure that we are echoing something here we find these values right.

23
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:20,540
So now remember that we are also setting some time five minutes here for our time access.

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:27,090
So we need to also check on that when we do our pass will reset function right here.

25
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,730
But right now we just want to see that it works.

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,790
So let's go past where we sat.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,950
Let's go to the reset page and right here.

28
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,790
We go and paste that in there and let's check it out.

29
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,180
Well my mouse here and enter and he says he works.

30
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,990
All right now when I get into something that I get when I mean we cover these placeholder there.

31
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,820
So what I'm going to do and I copy this

32
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,080
when I get this whole thing here

33
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,910
let me see if I get something a little better than that.

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,200
All right here

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,920
take that off.

36
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,610
Take this off and paste that in there.

37
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,160
Well I think this looks a little better.

38
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:30,900
There we go.

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,410
It works is misspelled but it's getting there.

40
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,130
And it's also check for the time axis.

41
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,770
And I think we already have one here.

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,240
Let's just use this one.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,430
So that would be the first check right.

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,930
All right.

45
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,140
So we still good here.

46
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:03,810
Alice

47
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:18,630
we got and I said a message and we're going to tell that user to something like.

48
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,750
Sorry

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,400
and I see we got some type of

50
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:33,490
message somewhere here that we go right here

51
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:42,840
get that and we're going to say danger here.

52
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,750
See how easy it is get.

53
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,200
I we're going to say something like.

54
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,110
Sorry.

55
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,130
Please sorry your time

56
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,030
has expired or something like that.

57
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,620
And we're going to take him back

58
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,420
to recover.

59
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:21,120
Or to call that ph be taken back to recover then well later on we'll will see if we can take him back

60
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:29,880
to call that BHB so they can submit their their their information again but recovered that BHP should

61
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,230
be good for now.

62
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,680
Right so we take him back to we covered that with that they have to do that over again.

63
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,720
We have to get the whole cold again and try again.

64
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,870
All right.

65
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,500
And make sure that we have that display message there.

66
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,570
That's good.

67
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,650
All right.

68
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:53,610
So once we find out this is good we also need to check for body nation code.

69
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,670
All right.

70
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:05,480
So if we check here I think one of these functions is doing that code so we can get that see that that's

71
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,810
a lot of check right there.

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,460
So

73
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,240
if you are talking ampoules talking are the same.

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,270
Then we check all this.

75
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,820
That's another bone is right there

76
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,730
all right we're going to make sure that we have our or curly brackets.

77
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,070
Good that they all match.

78
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,270
OK.

79
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,100
So this one matches that statement.

80
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:49,030
This one matches that.

81
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,460
This is for that cookie it's creation.

82
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,850
So I'm going to take these or else out of here.

83
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,240
And let's check it real quick if that time at CES.

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:14,260
We got one two and three and four with a function so we're good with them right here.

85
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,890
But this one here needs to be with the L statement right there.

86
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,320
Beautiful.

87
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,560
So now we go back we should be telling us to go back.

88
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,390
You see that.

89
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,810
So your time has expired.

90
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,300
All right.

91
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,960
Perfect.

92
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,910
Make sure yours is good as well.

93
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:43,940
All right so now that we have all this information then we can start allowing them to reset their password.

94
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,930
We're going to start working on that on the next lecture.

95
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,860
Beautiful.

96
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,210
So organize your call to make sure that you have the right curly brackets here on the right place and

97
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,390
we're good.

98
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,770
All right.

99
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,640
Perfect.

100
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,490
You're doing very good if you're following me if you're not following me.

101
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,380
You're going to get lost and explaining.

102
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,020
And now hold them by the hand too much in this last lectures because what you already are up for a professional

103
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,490
and BHB.

104
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,240
See you in the next lecture.

105
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,170
Very good.
