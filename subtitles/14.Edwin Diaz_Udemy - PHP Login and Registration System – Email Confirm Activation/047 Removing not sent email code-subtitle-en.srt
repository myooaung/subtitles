1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,950
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,860
So there is something that I would like to change here and the application so I'm going to go to where

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,780
we can find an already old data.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,170
All my code here.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:20,070
So I got all those links that are being sent in the email I got to replace with the local host.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,750
I got to replace with my web site that I'm using.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,990
All right so what I want to change is this.

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,040
If not send e-mail.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,050
I want to change that.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,180
And I just want it because I know he's working to use me.

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,440
And I just want to change that.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:36,960
All right.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,620
I wanted to show that in the local hall.

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,720
But right now I don't want to show you here.

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,770
All right so we change stay here and we make sure that we change it in the live server.

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:52,700
For those of you that have this in the life server or I so remove that.

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,600
And this is the good one.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,900
Here are some things to make sure and save it.

19
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,220
All right.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,620
Beautiful.

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,810
Make sure that you put your comments here right guys.

22
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,510
So this is the function that BHB the server.

23
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,240
By the way right there is where all our function is anyway.

24
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,720
Thank you so much for watching.

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,440
And that's all I wanted to change and this one here and you know the more we change things the better

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,520
we make or our application.

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,790
So if you have any suggestions you're welcome to let me know.

28
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,520
Take care.

29
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,710
See you in the next lecture.

30
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,350
How fun.
