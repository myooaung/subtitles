00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.330

All right welcome back my students.



2

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.980

So when the last lecture I was going to explain to you and I just wanted to do it in a separate lecture



3

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.590

I wanted to explain that when you close the browser.



4

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.280

All right.



5

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.180

And you are logged in.



6

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.640

Let's say for example we just come here we log in.



7

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.050

Now we have the session right in place and we close everything.



8

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.160

Are you going to close all my browser windows.



9

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.410

I'm going to close internet there.



10

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.660

If I open this again right and I try going to localhost something here.



11

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.300

You can see that



12

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.420

I mean that to be we're not logged in it were redirected back to index that BHB.



13

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.860

All right.



14

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.990

And the reason is is because we are saving or logging information in a session and accessing is only



15

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.270

available for a session of time.



16

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.790

Right.



17

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.470

Only for until the browser is active once you close your windows in your browser you will lose that



18

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.720

session because the session is managed in the service Saj right.



19

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.690

Any has a cookie as an identifier.



20

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.130

I'm going to show you that cookie later on.



21

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.780

But it's called session id and that's the cookie that's identifier for that session in the server.



22

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.050

So once you close your windows that session is gone.



23

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.770

All right.



24

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.530

So while we need to do is we need to set up a system where our browsers can remember us even if we close



25

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.310

our windows are our application can remember us no matter what.



26

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.580

So we can do that by setting cookie expiration dates.



27

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.700

All right so setting cookies is a little bit different than sessions because cookies is managed in the



28

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.850

browser.



29

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.130

Right.



30

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.080

So the browser is going to remember that cookie all the time the session is is killed.



31

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.720

Once you click you close your browser window.



32

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.500

So that's it.



33

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.210

All right.



34

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.660

But cookies we can let it be there for a year or two years as many years as we want.



35

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.360

I'm going to show you how to do that.



36

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.150

All right.



37

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.130

So we're going to do it by when we click on this little button right here.



38

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.170

We're going to say OK we're going to send that request.



39

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.870

We're going to send that variable.



40

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.580

I was going to call.



41

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.740

It's going to be called Remember Me and we're going to catch it in logon.



42

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.710

And you know when we said it we're going to set a cookie.



43

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.130

But when we don't when we don't send it like this we're not going to set that cookie.



44

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.370

All right so we need to you know create a functionality.



45

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.280

So let's go ahead and do that.



46

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.980

Let me show you how to do it.



47

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:50.130

Let's go to our functions of BHP and all the way down here where we have our login information low and



48

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.640

function right here.



49

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.200

All right.



50

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.300

So we can do this



51

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.530

once we find that we have somebody like that and we passed the password then we can set that right.



52

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.550

All right.



53

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.380

So all right let me show you first of all we need to pass a parameter.



54

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.930

Remember from the function.



55

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.230

So we need to go to our logon that BHB and let me show you right now.



56

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.840

We have a remember checkbox.



57

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.870

All right that's a checkbox.



58

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.720

And he's taking this.



59

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.290

Remember variable to the postal pro-global right.



60

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.070

So we need to catch that.



61

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.030

So let's catch it.



62

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.210

All right.



63

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.350

You know validation as well.



64

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:57.070

So we need to say remember now if we are trying to use this remember here without actually checking



65

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.960

for it first.



66

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.550

All right.



67

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:08.780

So when we try to log in if we try to logon like this and we are pulling the value here is going to



68

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.700

give us like an identify in that remember.



69

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.920

And that's a problem.



70

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.800

So what we need to do is we need to put the reset function there to check it.



71

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.020

Right.



72

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:29.340

So we can do something like this clean we can clean everything and then we can just say set.



73

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.070

All right.



74

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.030

And we will check for the post.



75

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.420

But remember.



76

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.310

All right.



77

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.070

So we can do that.



78

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.320

And now we can take this to our blogging right here.



79

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.180

There.



80

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.970

All right.



81

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.780

And now here we can do some work right.



82

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.480

All right.



83

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.530

So now that we find out who's the right you this is the right user we're able to verify that pass was



84

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.670

correct.



85

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.550

We can do a couple of more things here.



86

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:22.250

If that remember is equal to on and that's what is going to equal to if it's checked and if it's not



87

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.640

checked it's going to be equal to off.



88

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.090

All right that's the way set up.



89

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.930

So if it's equal to on or checked right then we're going to set a cookie.



90

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.720

So we're going to use the function set cookie I'm going to show you how this works.



91

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.250

We put the name of the cookie first and we can name the mail if we want to weaken him or whatever we



92

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.720

want.



93

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.410

Then we put the value and we can put whatever value we want but I'm just going to put the value is going



94

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.900

to be email right.



95

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.950

And the third parameter is going to be the time.



96

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.670

Right.



97

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.600

So this is how it works.



98

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.760

And we're going to be using the time function is going to give me all the time from 1970 I believe to



99

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.640

now in milliseconds.



100

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.800

That's how it works.



101

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.640

But if you add something to it I'm going to add 60.



102

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:18.670

This means now that this cookie will expire in 60 seconds which means one minute.



103

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.540

All right.



104

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.470

So once we have this in place right now we have this now we have to go to our logging functionality



105

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.760

and also Aubade that they are because if we don't update that in our logging functionality we have a



106

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.610

problem right.



107

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.240

Well we're not going to be able to stay logged into the system.



108

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.960

I'll show you right now.



109

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.590

Let's go to a log in functionality and right here where we need to do is we need to check if it's set



110

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:55.470

the session email if he set or it's set that cookie.



111

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.420

And this is you check that cookie.



112

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.950

I really like this cookie.



113

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.960

And then we write the name of the cookie which is e-mail.



114

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.560

All right.



115

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:12.250

So now you're checking for either or right for any of those for a session or cookie.



116

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.890

And we're going to we're going to set that cookie anyway right.



117

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.650

It's going to be returned true.



118

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.930

But remember when that cookie expire this condition is not going to be valid.



119

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.550

So it's only going to be checking for session right when inspirer is going to find this one and it's



120

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.750

going to return true for session only.



121

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.500

So when we close the browser is going to redirect.



122

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:39.470

If if they could get buyers because it could get buyers no longer exists is on set.



123

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.580

Right.



124

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760

So that's perfect.



125

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:49.040

So in the next lecture I'll show you how how to check for the cookies for the sessions and how to know



126

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.170

when to when they expire or knife.



127

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.640

If it was said or not.



128

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.050

Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and we will continue this on the next one.



129

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.050

Hope you're having a lot of fun and learning a lot of cool stuff.



130

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.160

Take care.
