1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,530
Welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,970
So this is working really good for us for now.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,960
Now we need to go to our core that Ph.D. page and make some validation there.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,350
We're got to work on the arrows here later on you know displaying some things.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:20,430
Now if we are able to actually send an email to the user we want to be able to display something here

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,470
like check your email or anything like that.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,190
Right.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,210
Right now we try to do this one game all we get.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,270
Actually it's a great speired.

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,630
That's why he's doing that to us.

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,790
So let's go here real quick.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,780
And as you can see

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,240
if he's already inspired a cookie cookie

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,580
is getting a redirect.

15
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,330
So he cannot detect it talking or he had a session talking.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,570
All right.

17
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:01,770
So let's go to that we cover page recover HP.

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,920
There we go.

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,930
Anyway let's do this one.

20
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,200
That e-mail come

21
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,430
right e-mail cannot be sent.

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,910
This is the only thing that we are getting here.

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,760
All right.

24
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:21,310
Now when this is sent we want to redirect the user somewhere else right.

25
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:27,130
And maybe instead of having the user here we can just redirect them to him that says something and say

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,060
you know what.

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,480
Go check your e-mail for an activation.

28
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,490
We don't want to keep the user here.

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:40,870
So I'm just wanted you to see that we can do this detective the e-mail was sent or not but really we

30
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,430
want to reiterate these are somewhere else.

31
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,300
Right.

32
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,380
So

33
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:56,430
let's do that let's if they e-mail was not it was not sent.

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,940
We're is not going to do anything but

35
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,370
we're going to redirect anyway.

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,370
All right.

37
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,830
So we can use this if not send e-mail

38
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,770
back and I'll show you right now.

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,830
That helps

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,640
right.

41
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,040
All right.

42
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,610
Let's do it.

43
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,280
Let's do a smarter right time like this.

44
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,610
And you see that same thing shorter code.

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,270
Right.

46
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,790
So not saying email we do this but in reality this is going to work anyway.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,990
So what we want to do is redirect the user.

48
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,080
So let's redirect that right here.

49
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,290
We're going to send a message first.

50
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,990
We have a function to do that.

51
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,010
And

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,750
let's put some paragraphs here.

53
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:19,220
All right let's give it a class of maybe B.G. said Sas

54
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,070
and say please check your email.

55
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:35,200
Your your spam folder or spam folder for an activation

56
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,000
password reset.

57
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,960
You see that's what we're doing right here right.

58
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,670
Cold.

59
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,320
All right.

60
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,720
And then we're going to redirect the user to.

61
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,200
And that's something like that.

62
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,090
All right.

63
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,870
All right.

64
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:15,030
So please check your e-mail.

65
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:26,090
E-mail or spam folder or password reset code and shoot me.

66
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:33,340
I think we already had this thing in that BHB we displayed the message there so let's check it out quick.

67
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,630
That works.

68
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,580
G-mail the

69
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,230
please check your email was about for the four we said cold.

70
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,260
All right that works.

71
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,170
Let's just put it's on top of

72
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,060
that center.

73
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,090
Just make that call a little bit more straight of course we refresh that's not going to work.

74
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,740
But anyway we know it works.

75
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,870
We're sending a message we're redirecting the user.

76
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,740
Beautiful.

77
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,330
All right.

78
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:08,720
So now that we got that done let's go and work on the function that is going to detect all this real

79
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,390
quick.

80
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,410
All right.

81
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,580
All right.

82
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,460
All right here

83
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:22,690
called validation.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,560
So this page here is called validation function.

85
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,790
We got to think about what it's going to do.

86
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,090
All right.

87
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,220
What is the best approach.

88
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:44,840
First we need to check to see if we are able to access if the cookies set basically the tab is called

89
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,820
Cookie.

90
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:52,280
So that's the first thing that when we need to check here because if it's not said We don't want that

91
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,040
person to be here.

92
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,090
So Tim as we said then we do whatever we have to do.

93
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,590
If not we will wrecked

94
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:14,990
and we redirect to where the recovery is so they can do it again will recover that BHP Well we set up

95
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,760
some type of message here and we say that message right.

96
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,690
And let's just get something from here let's just grab this guy right here so we don't have to write

97
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,050
that again.

98
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,270
All right.

99
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,980
And we can just say

100
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:52,590
sorry your buddy nation cookie was expired.

101
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,780
And we might want to do something else.

102
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,890
I want to go into the database and give him a different validation cold or something like that.

103
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,380
I.

104
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,710
Well that's fine.

105
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,950
Let's do it like this.

106
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:17,280
So if the cookie is set then we also want to check to see if we're getting anything from the server

107
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,440
like any get requests right.

108
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,920
So would a server get the request method calls to get

109
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,570
my.

110
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,680
And then here we can check to see if it's said

111
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,810
We're doing a lot of the nation.

112
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,980
But this is very good.

113
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,550
All right.

114
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,710
Don't get scared the more the better.

115
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,610
And he said code.

116
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,690
Remember we're getting those parameters as well.

117
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,800
And we want to do something with this person.

118
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,690
All right.

119
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,400
So in the next election we continue with this but we've got to test it and make sure that everything

120
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,340
is valid.

121
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,490
And if he's now that of course we're going to redirect the user somewhere and tell him.

122
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,380
But right now we're doing good.

123
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,310
We are doing very good if you're following me.

124
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:18,970
Very good.

125
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,820
Pause the video if you have to when I'm doing it too fast and make sure that you understand every step

126
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,630
that we're doing here.

127
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,320
I'm doing a little faster now because by now you should know this.

128
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:29,930
All right.

129
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,370
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
