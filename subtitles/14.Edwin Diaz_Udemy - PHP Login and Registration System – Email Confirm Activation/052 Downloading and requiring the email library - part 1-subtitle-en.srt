1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,700
Welcome back my students.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,070
So let's go ahead and start this right away.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:13,420
So what I'm going to do is go to the beach and see a simple on how this is done right.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,740
So we're going to first require the class to instantiate and we're going to use of properties and methods

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,110
whatever he has here.

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,230
Really call it very simple.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:30,250
We're going to be doing this using composer of course we create a composer Jason way place that value

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,960
in there and run the program.

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,990
If you don't have composer remember that you can go ahead and learn how to install it including faculty

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,680
that come if you look for the free courses there.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,240
OK.

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,320
So we can use this command the composer in our command in our terminal.

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,220
OK.

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:57,370
If you go to terminal in your project you can see you have to go to your Where are your projects located

15
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,150
in my cases locating application mamber actually docs and them the name of my folder.

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,780
This way you're going to be running your composer commands.

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,480
Now remember that when you run composer if you install it if your own composer you're supposed to tapping

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,170
composer.

19
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,970
And if you get one of these retro that's your thing.

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,680
It's installed globally.

21
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,000
If it's not installed globally you're going to have to type composite out ph A R.

22
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,050
OK.

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,200
And but anyway go ahead and learn and install compose it should be very very straightforward.

24
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:41,030
OK then we also want to be using this fake e-mail fake as A.P. testing server OK.

25
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,300
And so go ahead and sign up for that is free.

26
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,880
By the way and I'll show you in a bit other the configurations that we have to set a set up there.

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,740
Basically the way we're going to be setting it up is that we're going to be really sending e-mails but

28
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,930
to a different server not to our e-mail provider but we can of course just replace configurations and

29
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,850
that's it for those of you that have windows.

30
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,410
Make sure that if you want it you want a really nice terminal.

31
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:16,130
Very similar to what I'm doing which is Linux based download get.

32
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,560
And then you're going to have an icon on your desktop and you can just double click it there and open

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,110
your command prompt.

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,840
I'm using web storm.

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,210
I mean BHP storm and I have my terminal down here.

36
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,560
Just a little bit more comfortable but this is basically the same thing as having the terminal open

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,160
in the terminal from a different place.

38
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,830
OK.

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,590
Dissenting is just wraps around that.

40
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,900
So anyway.

41
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,310
So how can we stop this.

42
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:49,700
Well first of all we need composer and going to be using a command called require.

43
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,930
So we type in the name of the program composer require.

44
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:04,860
And then BHB mailer for us last BHB mailer so the author and the package and the name.

45
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,760
So once I do that I was going to download it automatically you're going to see that that command is

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,150
going to create a composite adjacent file.

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,630
We don't have to create it manually.

48
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:21,680
We could if we wanted to and then write the Jason data in this well you the penances will be located

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,810
like this and then you have another one and another one that separated by coma.

50
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,050
Right.

51
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,860
So it creates a lock files.

52
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,650
Well this is for version documentation here.

53
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:42,980
And if we go here you can see that it create another full vendor in this way or your packages will be

54
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,460
downloaded to when you use composer.

55
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,170
So composer of course you got that one BHB mailer that's the one we got now.

56
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,050
So if you want to use this package you have to go.

57
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:04,670
Usually you have to go to this folder to this folder and then you have to require this to load a case

58
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,690
file and once you require that that's going to be allow you to use that program sewing functions we

59
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,530
would go ahead and require that if you wanted to use it OK.

60
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:16,980
Right.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,790
What I want to do right now is I want to require using composer because if we use a composer We require

62
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,710
a file that composer has here is code overload.

63
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,630
We can actually define that.

64
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,390
Every time we're going to use any of these classes in the vendor directory.

65
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,130
OK we don't have to require this or are is going to require all those classes automatically for us.

66
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,130
OK.

67
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,970
So let's go and use that.

68
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,440
Autoload from composer instead are using requiring every class manually.

69
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,040
So this is actually require

70
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,610
and that dot because I noise in the vendor

71
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:21,390
Odo Oda that BHP.

72
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,270
So this is in functions.

73
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,380
Actually my ideas is telling me that it's actually there.

74
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,520
Let's go back here.

75
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,220
Let's go to line 1.

76
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,220
In my case I want 44.

77
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:48,080
And let's go and go to our home page and look at the simple they got there just simple stuff they got

78
00:05:51,150 --> 00:06:01,790
and of course make sure that you instantiate the object class with BHP Meilleur like this can do that

79
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,520
if you're not passing parameters.

80
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,890
And you can leave this here but I'm going to delete it.

81
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,280
It's very clear to us to know what it's doing right.

82
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,360
Well you can leave it there.

83
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,370
It's up to you.

84
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,890
And what else do we need Well we need to check

85
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,580
these lines here

86
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:44,520
and base that in there real quick.

87
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:56,600
So here you were typing your hostname and in my case in our case this is going to be as him as MCP dot

88
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:05,020
male track because that is a program that we are going to be using the server our testing server and

89
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:13,140
the port is going to be 25 25 and then we need a user name.

90
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,700
And when he or password.

91
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:25,900
OK so we're going to leave it like that shouldn't be a problem with this.

92
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,270
So what I want to do instead of echoing here I'm going to return

93
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,980
true if this works

94
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,420
and of course

95
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,420
falls

96
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,770
well we can just return to arrow if we wanted to.

97
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,750
But I King I'm going to comment that out.

98
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,650
So you have it

99
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,040
and I'm just going I have no matches.

100
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,990
Message sent.

101
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,140
We're going to return false later.

102
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,280
But that's fine.

103
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,270
OK.

104
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,990
We just want to get this working real quick.

105
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:25,820
Let's see I got to is missing a return statement so anyway that's my ID telling me that it is.

106
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,870
Let's just you know what

107
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,390
it's doing like this for now.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,820
So let's go to a male trap on the next lecture and get our Sebti our username and password.

109
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,280
OK.

110
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,520
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
