1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,090
All right welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,280
So we got all these verifications here right.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,390
Why don't we just check it out before we write any more code.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,430
Let's see if this is working right.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:19,050
Let's go to our cold BHB and make sure that you got your function that you're calling your function

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,560
right here right.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,380
So let's make sure that we are putting this there and calling it is go back to functions and you know

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,550
what I want to learn and do I really I think we're making we overkill in this a little bit because we

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,230
would check if we get requests and then we are checking to see if some specific request is set.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,100
Let's just take this off here.

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,050
That way we got less cold here.

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:53,920
And if email and code get requests I said we'd do something we can also do this if they're not set.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,030
All right.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,140
And we can also do.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,720
Let me see we can also do an else f here and check to see if they're empty right.

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,970
So else if I get requests is empty and I mean with just a little bit you know I like to do this like

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,850
this is personal reference I think it would be good for you to also do this.

18
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,200
All right.

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,230
If it's empty or cold it is empty then we do certain things right.

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,790
Right now we're doing that we go.

21
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:44,260
All right so if we're not getting anything set we're going to redirect to that baby or something like

22
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,100
that.

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,000
All right.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,450
I'll do this right here as well.

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
Else I mean something is good right.

26
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,140
I mean it's good.

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,050
We can do something here we could check to see if the port is set.

28
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,050
All right so I'm post

29
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,280
code is set.

30
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,260
If it's said then we are going to be doing some really cool stuff here.

31
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,790
All right.

32
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,320
So don't get confused by all this if statement.

33
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,300
Just make sure that you have that correct.

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,370
All right.

35
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,390
We just want to make sure that all this is good this is copulated validations there that we need to

36
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,980
verify.

37
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:37,100
But anyway let's just say getting post from form here.

38
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:44,290
Now if we go back our attempt at this code is going to be expired so we're going to probably go here.

39
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:44,800
All right.

40
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,500
So let's go to our call that BHP is opening up a little bit.

41
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,850
And let's go this is a reset page.

42
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,630
I don't know why we are there but I go to court BHB and we got some errors here and 670 to expect inspector

43
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,710
curly bracket 670 to doing

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,390
that because we're missing one of these and.

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,960
All right let's do it now.

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,040
There we go sorry your validation cookie was ex-spy of course one and probably say something else.

47
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,220
Now any nation cookie maybe validation code or something like that but we'll fix that later if we have

48
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,850
to or change it right.

49
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:38,900
Anyway let's just get something for one female dot com Antar and.

50
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,420
All right.

51
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,410
Perfect.

52
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,090
So now let's go to our call that CHP and now we were able to access it.

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,040
All right.

54
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:57,120
So if we type something here continue it says getting posts from the form from form and this post code

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:06,060
that P.H. this code right here is coming from the form from the input right here in code that BHB.

56
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,320
All right.

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,560
All right.

58
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,130
Perfect.

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,530
So if we're getting that we can clean that up a little bit.

60
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,250
Right.

61
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,440
We can also clean this up a little bit as well here if we're going to use it later.

62
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,990
But all right so let's.

63
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,900
Of course we've got to clean this up a little bit.

64
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,520
That would be nice.

65
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,670
We can use a function.

66
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:38,040
Clean it up a little bit just in case we've got some crazy characters there and just call this validation

67
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:46,650
code on validation code like this.

68
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,320
All right that's perfect.

69
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:48,750
All right.

70
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,280
So now what are we going to do.

71
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,720
Well we got to make some queries happen here.

72
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:05,190
All right so let's say first of all we need to find out this code existe and compare it to what we have

73
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,750
in our database table.

74
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:17,780
So let's say select ID from users where validation code

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,650
because there's validation calls coming in.

76
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,410
But we are going to scape it just in case.

77
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,470
One edition called there we go.

78
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,620
We can make a little bit more secure and we can get

79
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,010
the get request right here as well.

80
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,480
All right.

81
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,520
So we can clean this up a little bit.

82
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:51,980
And

83
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,460
I guess next hour will work for us.

84
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,300
We get e-mails as well.

85
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,460
All right.

86
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,410
So where validation code equals

87
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:23,790
and email because they e-mail skate of course.

88
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,150
All right let's see if we get some type of resort with this.

89
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,600
All right with cleaning it up and we are also scaping.

90
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,370
So what do we do with a lot of work here.

91
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,750
Hopefully this will work for us.

92
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,880
If not we'll fetch you don't worry.

93
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,680
So let's so let's do it here let's send it in

94
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,190
and let's also confirmed

95
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,150
beautiful.

96
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:03,480
You can probably put this confirmed inside the Querrey function and that way you don't have to be confirming

97
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,390
all the time.

98
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:13,080
So you can go to your D-B that BHB right here but the equerry actually we are confirming.

99
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,370
I don't even know why we keep doing this.

100
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,430
So we are confirming we don't even have to confirm it guys.

101
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,640
All right.

102
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,100
So we just do overkilling that real reality.

103
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,780
So whenever you have a confirmed take it off.

104
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,320
We don't need it anymore.

105
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,920
You probably were asking me asking yourself why is he confirmed every time he's doing inquiry.

106
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,810
But anyway I'm going to take that off from the rest later.

107
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,420
But right now we're good.

108
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:39,970
All right.

109
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:49,180
So anyway once we have this is being confirming everything is being sent and all we have to do is check

110
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,560
to see if we have it.

111
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,750
So if Roe count

112
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:06,370
is equal to one that we're good to go we found something right.

113
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:20,760
And then we can redirect the user to our we said page by page B page else we can display some bad validations

114
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,680
so we can go validation errors and we can say something like

115
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,680
Sorry wrong validation code.

116
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,350
So onto later.

117
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,060
All right.

118
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,350
So I'm going to leave it the way it is right now on the next lecture will test this and see where we

119
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,170
at.

120
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,320
And to see if it works.

121
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:50,740
Right.

122
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,780
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

123
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,990
I'm so glad you are here my course.

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,930
And if you have any questions you can ask me all the time anytime and I'll be try to answer your question

125
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,190
as soon as possible.

126
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,960
See you in the next lecture.

127
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,410
Take care.
