1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,360
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,010
So it's time for us to you know to not feature a couple of bugs but to improve our application a little

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,610
bit.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,670
Now in the Forgot Password page right here in the we cover that BHB we're not doing anything with this.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,730
Cancel button here right.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,160
It's not taking us to somewhere else.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,170
It's actually refreshing that page and we don't want to do that.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:31,830
So we've got to fix that functionality and see that we don't want that to happen.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,720
All right.

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,890
We want to go somewhere and we are also going to.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,350
Let me go back to it.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:46,220
We also won this logo that BHB to be able to to not be here unless we are logged in.

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,040
All right.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,720
So let's fix that right now.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,030
When you have a problem like this and you try to refresh back you're trying to go back and forth and

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,630
you have that confirmed refresh confirm reload page error that we got on the last one I show you right

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,550
now.

18
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,490
We're right here confirm resubmission that's the browser.

19
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:11,850
All right this is a functionality of some browsers especially chrome that will try to confirm with you

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,930
if you want to resubmit the form.

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,310
Right.

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,620
If they find out that this is not something that you they're just trying to verify if you really want

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,170
to resubmit the form.

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,680
So this is a function of the browser for that not to happen what you want to do is you want to refresh

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,120
the same page.

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,500
You want to do a redirect to the same page.

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,710
So that way you don't get the error.

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,280
But anyway let's go in and get this functionality going.

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,270
So that is in recovery that BHB.

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,370
Let's go

31
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:49,230
now recovered and recover underscore password that's where the function ID is so if we get a post requests

32
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,610
we got to do inside just post requests.

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,920
So I think we can do it right here.

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:09,540
So if it's said and I believe that Paul Superguy overvalue is canso meant counsel on this course of

35
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:09,820
May.

36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,200
Let's go and look at it real quick but I'm almost sure that that's what it is.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,900
So let's go to recover that BHP and cancel the summit.

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,980
All right we've got to change it to underscore I like underscores why this only IDs and classes I leave

39
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,210
with a hyphen.

40
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,380
All right.

41
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,800
So let's make sure that we audit correctly and paste that in there.

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:47,330
So if they click on that let's just take them back to index that BHP.

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,710
All right.

44
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,680
Or actually logging up BHP that's where they came from.

45
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,500
If they click on this log and up BHB Let's see let's see this thing actually refresh.

46
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,740
Click on it and now takes us back to Logan at BHB.

47
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,240
So that's one thing.

48
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,000
Now the next thing that we need to do is log out.

49
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,060
All right.

50
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,240
That's really easy to fix.

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,280
I mean not fit but to add functionality it's got to naff now right here.

52
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:25,800
Now if we are only going to show this if and our logo functionality is present if we are logged in.

53
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,760
So let's do this.

54
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,670
Right.

55
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,670
And as a matter of fact let's use this shorthand syntax and can show you if you don't know about it

56
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,860
I'd like to show my students new stuff you probably already know that.

57
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,410
But from my All the courses right.

58
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:51,600
And then and it is like this.

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,500
And now we can put the HMO right in the middle.

60
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,390
It's a shorthand syntax for IF statements we can use this for loops as well.

61
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,630
So if we are logged in

62
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,970
then we can show this.

63
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,850
So let's go back here and less refresh.

64
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,200
You can see that it's not there.

65
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,590
So let's log in.

66
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,150
And I believe the new password was my name Edwin Logan.

67
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,980
And now you can see the URL is showing right now and we can log out now.

68
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,910
It's now showing.

69
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,230
All right.

70
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,730
Very easy to add.

71
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,470
Very easy.

72
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,010
All right.

73
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,890
What else do we need.

74
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,630
If we had something else let's go to register to see if that's good there.

75
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,080
All right.

76
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,940
We don't have these contacts.

77
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:48,490
We want to be able to go to our home page admen if we are logged in.

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,890
That's another thing.

79
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,720
All right.

80
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,160
So let's show also admin here.

81
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,970
All right.

82
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,590
Add me that BHP.

83
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,090
Let's go and show it up here.

84
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,820
All right.

85
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:21,380
We're not loading and winter now we're showing admin.

86
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,790
So we go to Home Page and these links are now working so let's fix that real quick.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,760
Let's go to him on this one.

88
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,190
XP and

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,070
so we click on it and you see adman's still exist.

90
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,940
And the project name you go to this one as well.

91
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,360
We don't have this contact's pages there.

92
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,920
All right.

93
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,330
Beautiful.

94
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,950
All right we still logged in.

95
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,440
I know that we don't want to see the log in that BHB we are logged in right somebody logged in here

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:15,850
and we don't want to see this page if we are logged in right so we can also check on that real quick.

97
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,740
So let's go to Logan up HP and we can do something up here.

98
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,580
So we're going to say

99
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:35,620
hey we are logged in.

100
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:44,290
We don't want to go here we want to go to redirect to admen up here.

101
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,730
All right.

102
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,410
So enter.

103
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,630
And now you can see that we are redirector so we can visit our page even if we wanted to.

104
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,420
All right.

105
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,810
Ogowe it takes us back to home.

106
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,490
And this is where we can logon.

107
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,240
All right.

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,130
Remember me.

109
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,420
That will keep keep us logged in for a day I believe that was the last time we said it.

110
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:12,320
And I think we're done with the functionality I can the next thing for us to do will be to upload this

111
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,810
to the live server and then test to there.

112
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,340
OK.

113
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,620
So and the live server we're going to see this really in good action.

114
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,880
Thank you so much for watching this lecture.

115
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:28,910
And if you were if you are really happy with this course please don't forget to give me a review and

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,240
send me a message and Sundt and tell me that he really helped you out.

117
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,620
That really brings me up a motivated me to keep going and making more courses for you guys.

118
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,320
Thank you so much.

119
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,860
And I'll see you in the next lectures.
