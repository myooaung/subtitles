00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.840

Welcome back I'm a student so I hopefully hopefully you got this to work.



2

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.140

If not to remember that this function might have not worked because it's expecting parameters and as



3

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:20.850

you can see this require a primer email so it's expecting parameters and going to put here on this function



4

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.260

so the full parameters OK.



5

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.600

Just so he doesn't give me that error when I go to use it.



6

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.380

And then I'm putting off all of them



7

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.380

and it's



8

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.730

so this is just so just in case nothing is there.



9

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.220

We don't get an error now.



10

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.060

And now when we go back to test it shouldn't be there.



11

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.980

So that's good.



12

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.760

Our ideas actually helping us.



13

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.910

This idea is helping me.



14

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.140

Before I had the time.



15

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:05.120

So let's go to this file and the next this vendor felt optional so follow the rectory so this is not



16

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.940

working and not working.



17

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.940

Let's go back here and



18

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.920

we are in the right directory here.



19

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.430

But this same e-mail probably it's not so.



20

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.540

I mean the autoload here let's go and put that in there.



21

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.210

This is where my I.D. I think is messing with me.



22

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.290

And as you can see he's doing something he says message has been sent.



23

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.340

So my the OK was not telling me that true and that for us



24

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.380

debugging.



25

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.470

But anyway so here is the e-mail.



26

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.000

As you can see we've got the e-mail.



27

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.180

This is the age the e-mail message in the body.



28

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.920

And in bold.



29

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.490

That's what he's saying here.



30

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.180

But anyway so you can see we got the e-mail and we got it.



31

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.110

We got the waste coming from here.



32

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.000

As you can see we also have the subject we're getting a lot of things here.



33

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.520

Pretty cool stuff right.



34

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.080

Oh and by the way you see that from where my name and then the e-mail.



35

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.390

So get this to work.



36

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.010

Make sure he's working on your project successfully by creating a test file and then once we get it



37

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.720

it's essentially working.



38

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.520

We can start cleaning this up a little bit in the functions file.



39

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:39.220

So let's go ahead go to our send e-mail and make sure that we replace the statics value with real values



40

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.220

coming from a class.



41

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.470

Ok this is what we got to do now.



42

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.470

And I'm going to start replacing the subject with variable OK.



43

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:05.110

Subject that is coming in is functionally this here and we want to replace this with an e-mail variable.



44

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.800

What else we got the message which is M-S G.



45

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.220

This will be this year and this guy here



46

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.240

you know just like this for now.



47

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.660

What else.



48

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.270

That's about it.



49

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.290

We are not using headers.



50

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.590

We could use headers or we can use this variable for something else.



51

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.120

Let's say you want to pass something else to this function.



52

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.700

You can pass it through here.



53

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.870

OK.



54

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.660

So what I want to do now is create a configuration class so let's do that real quick in this lecture.



55

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.850

First I want to create a directory and call these classes.



56

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:11.210

And inside this directory I want to create a configuration class so uppercase the first letter is very



57

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.630

common when you're doing object oriented.



58

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.620

And here is what I'm going to create this configuration class.



59

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.050

Now I recommend naming your class the same as a file.



60

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.650

So



61

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:34.360

come right here let's create a class since I'm going to have any H.T. email below.



62

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.220

I don't have to close my BHB tags.



63

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.590

Get some developers.



64

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.520

Close it.



65

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.590

That's very common but it's also common and not to close it.



66

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:53.410

So now there is a class A very different definition or a constant definition that you probably have



67

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.410

not seen yet which is Konst.



68

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.300

OK this is basically the same thing as defined but define with is function fine.



69

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.150

You can use it to define constants but you can pass more options.



70

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.170

They are still working on creating more options for that constant declaration.



71

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.370

But anyway so SMPTE P hosed.



72

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:32.140

And then here we are going to be putting the host in our case is SMPTE the mail trap that's what it



73

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.260

is.



74

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:42.060

Then we have another cost and is going to be A.P. poort.



75

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.060

And I was going to be 25 25.



76

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:53.810

Now we have another one that going to be you know what I'm just going to copy these guys out there where



77

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.400

and then this



78

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.630

should be the user



79

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.400

why still password here.



80

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:26.100

So let's go ahead and put this up here because I don't like the way they were there.



81

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.990

Let's go back to functions and let's just let's get those values for the user name



82

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.410

here.



83

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:47.870

This is a string so blazed that let's get the password



84

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.200

great.



85

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.640

Keywords can be used as name BHB.



86

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.710

Let's go and get the.



87

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.880

What else do we need.



88

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.430

OK.



89

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.180

Let's.



90

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.570

What else do we need.



91

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:29.620

So we got this and sent the peapod.



92

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.800

And for some reason I'm getting a arrowing here



93

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.110

oh of course.



94

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:41.740

She's



95

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.100

kind of playing around a lot with a lot of objects.



96

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:57.500

So I'm so used to defining keys and values that kind of forgetting not forgetting but sometimes I place



97

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.200

Como's they went in as opposed to.



98

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.520

So anyway.



99

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.600

So we got this going here.



100

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:13.160

Let's see if we can replace this now with our values from that file.



101

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:20.240

Do we have a little here we do have autoload So we are actually we need to actually include this class



102

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.370

in that configure in composite Jason.



103

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:37.410

So let's actually go to our composer Jason and we are going to create a map so that when we do this



104

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:45.830

is we come here real quick and then we create this



105

00:08:51.120 --> 00:09:02.110

now this class map is going we are going to be mapping where we want composer to include the classes.



106

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:08.830

You know what plays we won him or the program to look for or OK for these classes.



107

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:20.000

And of course he's saying that aspected always a semi-colon.



108

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.400

We got it here somewhere.



109

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:38.580

Oh you know what this is actually takes an array now that I remember for not mistaken yet was an array



110

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.460

and then we come here and then we came to that directory.



111

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.410

OK.



112

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.570

So we're good to go here there's nothing else that we need.



113

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.840

Let's go back to functions.



114

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.350

That's good years.



115

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.430

Good.



116

00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:01.000

So let's create bringing those values here.



117

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:08.810

So let's come here and a couple of ways of doing it.



118

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:15.510

I like to use is I like to use my comfy class name.



119

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:25.410

Statically we are going to bring those values like this and k now we're going to do the same thing for



120

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.110

the password



121

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.150

and the setting for the port



122

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.580

and dissenting for the host.



123

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.690

This is supposed to be user name



124

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.010

and go back to configuration.



125

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.200

That's fine.



126

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:59.010

So now let's go back to our testing file and see if we can send another e-mail.



127

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.940

So I'm going to come back here.



128

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.560

And



129

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:16.570

actually when will we need to actually send some type of values to our test files.



130

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.090

Copy that.



131

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:23.150

So the first thing is the email I'm going to say Edwin at gmail going to change it up a little bit.



132

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:30.260

I'm going to put that next parameter testing of data.



133

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.080

Than the other one.



134

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.480

So message some message.



135

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.170

OK let's see if that works.



136

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.540

We wrote a lot of code here so hopefully it works.



137

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:48.380

Let's go back here and yes and class conflict now found.



138

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:57.030

Oh one thing that we need to do here is we need to kind of refresh our composer by saying composer dump



139

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:07.160

autoload we're going to pass off of two mice and let's go back here and try again as you can see Massett



140

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.890

send updated.



141

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.040

And we got our new values.



142

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.460

OK hopefully you got through this one OK.



143

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.130

I wanted to make another lecture.



144

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:21.660

I wanted to include everything in this lecture so that way you guys can move on with your project.



145

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.020

So you're welcome to rewind the video.



146

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.090

You're welcome to ask questions we can help you in anything we know we can.



147

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.720

We will help you if we are able to.



148

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.750

So ask in practice I'll see you in the next lecture.



149

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.170

Thank you.
