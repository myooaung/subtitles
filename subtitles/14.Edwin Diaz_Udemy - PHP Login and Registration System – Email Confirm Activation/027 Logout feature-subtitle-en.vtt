00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.670

Welcome back my students.



2

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.550

So now in the last lecture we build this really cool functionality where we are able to log then right.



3

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.850

We set the session and we take the session with this function and we put this function basically in



4

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.530

a statement right and we say locked in place you know show this or if not redirect back.



5

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.290

Now we need to build a function where we can log out.



6

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.790

All right.



7

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.920

And that's going to be our breeze arise going to be super easy.



8

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:33.590

So let's go and to our logo template right here and there is nothing there so we're just going to write



9

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.460

some ph be right here.



10

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.240

We don't even need to close the BHB time because we're not going to be writing NEHTA mouth.



11

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.690

All right.



12

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.020

That's the only reason why we would close this.



13

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.560

So we just let the server know and you're going to write BHB and that's it.



14

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.320

All right.



15

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.970

First of all we want it and you can include if you want to because we can write.



16

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.190

We need a session here.



17

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.740

So when these sessions start.



18

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:09.060

But if you go ahead and include I think if we include more in it already has that and he already has



19

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.920

functions as well.



20

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.910

So it's up to you if you want to do that.



21

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.730

All right.



22

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.130

So let's go to logo again.



23

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.820

And I'm going to include it that way.



24

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.410

I don't have to be putting a lot of stuff here.



25

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.930

So nogal I just have to go to functions and that would be in it.



26

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.750

Ph be.



27

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.310

All right.



28

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:53.970

So now that's included in oh I've got to do is session destroy and redirect because now I have access



29

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:04.470

to our functions redirects to that or logging BHB.



30

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.020

All right.



31

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.220

Now we got to check on navigation because our navigation has a logo and we've got to make sure that



32

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.790

he goes to look at our BHB does.



33

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.520

All right.



34

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.780

So now we log out.



35

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.990

It takes us back to logging that BHP.



36

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.540

All right so now let's try the AXS admin admin that we enter and he takes us back to home.



37

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.570

You see that.



38

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.580

So everything is working less logging now.



39

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.690

We are doing very good.



40

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.310

Aren't you happy.



41

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.800

We're getting a lot of stuff done a really cool functionalities.



42

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.910

One two and three logged in.



43

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.110

Beautiful.



44

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.740

All right.



45

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.160

And logout.



46

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.540

Aha.



47

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.140

This is working really cool really fast and you should be you know very proud of yourself by now.



48

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.730

All right.



49

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.050

So anyone the next lecture I think we're going to be targeting some more really cool functionalities



50

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.670

with REMEMBER ME functions right here right.



51

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.780

Because I want to show you how to do that right now a fight I'll show you the next lecture but right



52

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.910

now we close our browsers and we try and we are logged in everything we bet will be erased.



53

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.060

I'll show you our in our explain some more in the night and the next lecture right.



54

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.410

All right.



55

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.900

Thank you so much for watching.



56

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.160

And I see you in the next lecture.



57

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.620

Take care.
