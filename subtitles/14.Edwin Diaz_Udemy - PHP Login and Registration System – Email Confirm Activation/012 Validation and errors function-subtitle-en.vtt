00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.080

All right welcome back my student.



2

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.880

So we are missing an input.



3

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.430

Well we're missing a couple inputs here a couple of validation and this is pretty quick.



4

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.840

But if you want you can check for the e-mail cise.



5

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.070

All right we're going to check for the e-mail not to be over CERN Maxy or for I think 20 characterful



6

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.040

Our e-mail is right here.



7

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.900

Good.



8

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.680

All right.



9

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.690

But that's OK.



10

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.400

We're not going to take for minimum e-mails could be very small.



11

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.060

Well that's fine for maximum character for females.



12

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.940

Let's just make sure that we have this e-mail variable right here.



13

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.630

And and your e-mail cannot be more than seven characters right.



14

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.150

Your email cannot be more than 20 characters.



15

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.190

That's fine.



16

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.080

Anyway then we have a password important confirmed password input.



17

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:06.180

Well we can do here is that we can say if password is not equal to a confirmed password then we are



18

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.300

going to save an error there.



19

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.260

We're going to input the error output the error your passwords.



20

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.950

Fields do not match write do not match.



21

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.360

All right.



22

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.270

Wonderful.



23

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.190

All right.



24

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.820

Now what else.



25

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.270

That's it.



26

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.480

And then we're done with that right now.



27

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.870

One thing that I was wanted to do.



28

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.900

Well now you know that I always like to do my application would be to you know we factor some of the



29

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.420

code right we have in refactoring means for those of you that don't know as making a complex code easier



30

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.380

to implement and with shorter code with less code.



31

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.780

So now we have this message delimiter here right.



32

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.020

And we are going to be using this a lot when we are evaluating forms.



33

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.340

So why not put this in a function just in case we you know just to make a cold shoulder and to make



34

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.260

things work a lot better when it's just going to take that on from there.



35

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.560

And then air this play here and just kind of put a little comment here real quick.



36

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.740

So I don't forget where it is.



37

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:38.230

Let's create a function that will display that error message say displaying form error you don't want



38

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.840

display validation error



39

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.940

validation no call evaluation errors like this.



40

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.410

All right.



41

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.040

All right.



42

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.560

And we're going to paste that code in there.



43

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.330

All right.



44

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.390

And we're going to take one parameter that's going to be the error.



45

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.740

So we're going to say error.



46

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.890

Let's just call the message.



47

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.570

All right.



48

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.970

Yeah that's fine.



49

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.140

What is going to be a narrow error message here.



50

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.340

So let's make it a little bit more



51

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.250

descriptive right.



52

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.770

Whoops.



53

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.870

Right here.



54

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.020

And we're just going to return actually.



55

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.500

And then we can quit like this and like that.



56

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.450

How about that.



57

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.660

And then we also want to put it right here as well.



58

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.590

Right let's see how this works.



59

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.250

So let's go to right here this feel right here instead of and all the code that we were doing before



60

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.180

we just use this function we use aquittal validation errors like this.



61

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.780

It doesn't look a lot cleaner does right.



62

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.080

So let's go here and see if it still works.



63

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.210

Let's just do something.



64

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.760

And I refreshed by the way I saved my document all the time.



65

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:18.940

I just do a command save on my keyboard so make sure you do the same right password password register



66

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.540

what's



67

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.120

not contain the symbol



68

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.120

part followed by.



69

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.070

All right let's just do something like this.



70

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.370

Register missing argument about oh we forgot they are human right here.



71

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.740

There we go.



72

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.560

All right.



73

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.120

All right.



74

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.840

So Ed I'm going to do a lot of stuff here and this one.



75

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.850

And does that register.



76

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.290

And now you can see that we get the same thing again but we have a lot less code.



77

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.410

All right right here.



78

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.570

And we can use this throughout our application.



79

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.650

We don't have to be writing the same thing over and over again like this right here.



80

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.520

We don't have to be writing this over and over again.



81

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.550

It saves a lot of space and it just makes your code a lot cleaner.



82

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.180

All right.



83

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.120

So anyway thank you so much for watching.



84

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.880

On the next lecture are going to continue with this and we are functionality for application or logging



85

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.360

application.



86

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.140

We're going to make this a lot better every second that we are on working on this.



87

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.070

Thank you so much and I'll see you on the net.



88

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.760

Lecture.
