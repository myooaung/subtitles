00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:00.690

OK.



2

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.730

Welcome back maistre.



3

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.190

So what is the next step that we need to do.



4

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.090

Well first of all we need to go any place.



5

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.520

We don't have to replace a lot of things but we have to do just a little bit of changes.



6

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.120

OK.



7

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:26.980

So let's go to our register let's look for register function registered user and see what's going on



8

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.470

here.



9

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.560

We opened this up a little bit be so you can see that we are sending a message with we're registered



10

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.730

the user right here and we're using this send e-mail function that's OK.



11

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.930

I mean you know we're still getting those parameters.



12

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.700

OK.



13

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.230

But as you can see here I don't I don't have a link.



14

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.100

We're not going to get a link if we use it here.



15

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.390

So let me show you what we're getting when we are using this function.



16

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.070

So let's go to our application to see if this works.



17

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.140

This will be working somewhere.



18

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.650

I mean so how right.



19

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.770

Let's come back here let's log in.



20

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:23.370

I mean let's come here and let's say I forgot my password and faculty come same password taking a little



21

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.580

bit.



22

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.180

I means it's working.



23

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.970

Is resending our password ready.



24

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.010

And as you can see we don't have a link here so we need to create a link.



25

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:39.880

What's happening is that our mail is being sent without NEHTA mail case being sent as text.



26

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.550

But not only that we don't have a link here either.



27

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.560

OK.



28

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.390

So we create a link.



29

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.950

Let's go ahead and create a link to a quick and ref



30

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.130

Let's come back here and we're just going to close out here.



31

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:17.160

And let's go to the end of this and see where else we need to put that.



32

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.790

Go ahead and just scape here.



33

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.270

And all of the code



34

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.510

is put one here and scape it and then close it like this.



35

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.890

Simple.



36

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.100

And was as close we can go ahead and say a link here or something like that



37

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:01.020

this mortgage solution that I got sometimes can be a little daunting at first.



38

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.580

So I'm let's move this cold a little bit.



39

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.760

Let's break it down.



40

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:09.560

OK.



41

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.030

This is the link here.



42

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.270

OK.



43

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.820

And I'm going to close it right here OK.



44

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.420

So that's that's for that.



45

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.470

What else do we need.



46

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.240

Well the headers we can use if you wanted to but we're not going to



47

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.940

let's just close this all that way.



48

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.600

We got a little bit more space.



49

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.640

Let's go to the next one that we are going to be by activating user we have nothing to do here.



50

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:57.660

So let's look for function and mail and here in the valley on the recovery pass what we need to also



51

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.780

change this one.



52

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.750

OK.



53

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.270

So I'm going to copy my message



54

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.160

colder here as you can see and doing basically the same thing here OK.



55

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.380

Scaping it and we went to the code page and basically which just includes on the e-mail.



56

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.510

OK.



57

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.940

What else do we need.



58

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.390

We need to go to the next one let's go and see.



59

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.410

And I'm looking in my browser my I.D. what I'm doing is a control f.



60

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.220

OK guys so that you know let's go to the next one where we use this function.



61

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.040

So we use in every set as well and you see the set



62

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.350

so we cover a password



63

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.080

validating code.



64

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.210

There's another thing that I wanted to also change here.



65

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:24.760

Let's go back to Bassal reset now in this Spasso reset we're supposed to not only put evaluation code



66

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.170

to zero where we are supposed to actually make this



67

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.500

active.



68

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.510

OK.



69

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:44.300

So we need to come back here and put in a coma and say active to 1.



70

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.600

OK.



71

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.470

And this is in PP-ASEL Reset Code.



72

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.270

OK.



73

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.940

So go ahead and make sure you do that because if you don't do that your code is not you will now be



74

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.380

activating your user.



75

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.470

OK.



76

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.500

So let's go and check this out real quick.



77

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.190

I'm going to go to man



78

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.780

I'm going to go to Logan and my screen super huge.



79

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.540

There we go.



80

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.560

So I got to user now has a code OK.



81

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:33.030

We got a validation code that was sent to us but it was sent like this so we need another validation



82

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.260

code.



83

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.550

Let's go back.



84

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:43.020

Forgot Password and let's do it again courting faculty dot com



85

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.640

and we go let's see if we got the right link this time.



86

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.420

And as you can see the code looks good.



87

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.770

If I click on it it takes me there.



88

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:56.510

OK.



89

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:07.250

And now I can go ahead and paste that code here and continue it telling me the validation code is wrong.



90

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:08.630

So what's going on here.



91

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.600

And we need to actually debug this real quick here.



92

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.050

Let's see what happens with our active guy here.



93

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.670

We're going to refresh and we can see that that person is active.



94

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.050

The validation code was now delete it so what does that mean.



95

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:32.040

Let's go back to our function and this about Bussel reset.



96

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:41.700

And he says of the users scape password and it's just make this a little bit radiation called zero active



97

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.760

user 1



98

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.110

It's called back and sorry wrong validation code.



99

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.200

So it's not getting the validation go for some reason



100

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.680

because I did not get the validation code completely.



101

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.550

And we go now one two three and four.



102

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:17.980

One two three and reset your password has been reset.



103

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:23.720

Now if find typing my e-mail address.



104

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.860

Come on one two three four and I'm logged in.



105

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.240

So it's working OK.



106

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.030

So let's review what we did real quick.



107

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.200

OK.



108

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.870

So that way you guys are in the same page.



109

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.290

Great.



110

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.360

So I'm going to command F here.



111

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.490

Send e-mail.



112

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.230

Remember to have your configuration set up correctly.



113

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.510

Let's go here.



114

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.390

To the next one.



115

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.070

And make sure that you have your message very well with the write your mail.



116

00:08:59.410 --> 00:08:59.900

OK.



117

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:07.060

And guys by the way I'm going to include this code in the course so make sure that you download it if



118

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.040

you want.



119

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.890

So what you don't have to write all these down and the reason why put curly brackets guys and I tell



120

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:19.060

you that many times just because I want to differentiate the variables phone ttes you see if I put



121

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.180

it like this it's very confusing for me.



122

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.350

So I can do that with double quotes of course.



123

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:32.020

But anyway so that staff this is the recover password function OK.



124

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:41.480

Let's go to the next function was recoverer password and



125

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:53.230

register the register user 1 register.



126

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.670

Or are you a user.



127

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.580

So we got really the user registration is validating here



128

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.510

that's going to look for that function.



129

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:12.920

OK.



130

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.790

So this is where we are validating the use.



131

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:24.000

I mean rationed the user and we replace this link here with the right link and that's good.



132

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.130

So we're doing good.



133

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:33.060

So this is recoverer password register user in the next lecture we're going to also face a couple of



134

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.970

things that I need to fix in this application.



135

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.770

I'll see you in the next lecture.



136

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:39.180

Thank you.
