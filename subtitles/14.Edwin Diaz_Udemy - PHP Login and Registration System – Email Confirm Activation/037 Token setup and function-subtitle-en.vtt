00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.740

All right so by this point we already know our validation system is working.



2

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.920

We are checking to see if the cookies expire or not.



3

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.800

We know that is value the code is working its function out in the code that BHB page.



4

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.390

All right.



5

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.310

So now we can go ahead and set that cookie to maybe 15 minutes right now.



6

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.400

I think I had it for 15 minutes before and I changed it to 60 because I wanted to have it expires soon.



7

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.890

But anyway if you don't have it in 60 seconds in this recovered password make sure that you have it



8

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.170

for 900 seconds.



9

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:42.230

That's going to give us some time some years some more time to do our thing right now.



10

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.310

Let's go here.



11

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.200

And I think we have to do it again because



12

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.800

it's going to say cookies expire.



13

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.660

So we're going to have to guess.



14

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.050

Meanwhile they should call you a real quick.



15

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.770

All right that's fine.



16

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.310

All right.



17

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.570

Please check your email response for the for we said.



18

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.140

That's fine.



19

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.160

Anyway.



20

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.810

All right.



21

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.270

So now that we are able to validate all this data right.



22

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.470

We can send a user to the that we can redirect the user



23

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.470

to our Reset page right here we need to also verify that these user came from they really are wrecked



24

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.090

from the cold APHC page in their reset page right.



25

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.890

So we need to set some parameters.



26

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.830

So we're going to keep sending some parameters we're going to send the e-mail.



27

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.910

All right.



28

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.080

And we can concatenate that if we wanted to.



29

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.490

All we can do is the easy way.



30

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.010

We already have this e-mail here.



31

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.890

Clean up.



32

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.890

We might need to scape if we want to put it here but we can skip it in the other side.



33

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.900

We're going to use it right.



34

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.190

So we're going to send the e-mail here like this and we can send the validation code as well.



35

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.450

So validation code.



36

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.740

All right.



37

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.920

There is another thing that we can do here to make this a little bit more secure.



38

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.720

All right.



39

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.310

And because this is going to be the reset page where we are going to reset the password.



40

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.080

Let me show you.



41

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.170

And we were they are ready but we said Page we need to make sure that whoever comes in and tries to



42

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.600

reset a password.



43

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.260

Not only are we going to catch the parameters here but we want to make sure that this form is being



44

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.200

that this data has been submitted from this page alone.



45

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.940

All right and for that we have a talking generator right.



46

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.100

We have this functionality that we can hide in the input.



47

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.530

So let's go to that reset up HP and do that



48

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.480

remembering all your pages even if you're not needing it.



49

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.980

Make sure that you put your display message right where you think you're going to display some sessions.



50

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.680

Make sure that you always have this function there if not you won't see messages.



51

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.870

All right.



52

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.420

So I'm always going to put in there even if I don't have it because in the future I might decide to



53

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.160

put something there to see something right.



54

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.520

So anyway.



55

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.420

Reset this is going to be this.



56

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.590

And we have we don't have no hidden input here.



57

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.090

All right.



58

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:29.330

So I believe we have a hearing input on recover right here and we're just going to copy this here.



59

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.820

All right.



60

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.110

So he's hitting.



61

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.000

And let's go to reset and it's Heidi there as well.



62

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.320

Let me just take this off.



63

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.270

So right below here before they and tag of the form I'm going to paste that in there.



64

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.400

I am going to name it talking as well something I am going to have this token generator there.



65

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:04.940

So now if I go to reset and I refresh and I look at the page source which you have this here there's



66

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.760

value when we can refresh have a different value.



67

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.560

All right.



68

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:11.420

All right.



69

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.170

Beautiful beautiful beautiful red herring.



70

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.380

All right so we sent in the e-mail.



71

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:32.560

All right we sent in the cold validation code and then we have that token generator that we can that



72

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.410

cookie.



73

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.640

All right.



74

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.850

So let's actually



75

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.450

let's go and let's go to a function real quick here.



76

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.010

And I think we have that cookie right here.



77

00:04:50.080 --> 00:05:02.030

Ray and we can also set some inspiration there on that page or expiration date.



78

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.390

All right.



79

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.910

So I'm just thinking to see where we can put this.



80

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.450

Let's actually do it right here before we redirect.



81

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.890

Right.



82

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.730

And we're going to set a time as it's called.



83

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.960

Again we're going to set it to 50 minutes for the Reset page.



84

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.880

I know that you have last time there.



85

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.430

All right.



86

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.420

And they should have at least five minutes.



87

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.430

So there will be 300 seconds.



88

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.000

All right.



89

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.970

Probably less than that but I will leave for five minutes because we need some time right.



90

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.900

All right.



91

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.810

So the validation code.



92

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.440

All right.



93

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:51.270

So now all we got to do is create a new function to reset the password and catch that data there and



94

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.970

see if it works OK.



95

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.560

So



96

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.690

it's going to be called Password preset



97

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.800

function.



98

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.350

Right.



99

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.710

That's what we said



100

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.390

and we're going to say if he said



101

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.370

email



102

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.920

right.



103

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:39.460

And and if he said code and we're missing this guy right here



104

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.280

then we can say words something like that.



105

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.310

We're going to put it so we're going to set it up.



106

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:01.170

Are we're going to test it on the next lecture OK right here.



107

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.960

All right.



108

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.130

So if we have any errors make sure that you watch every lecture until to the end.



109

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.690

Don't skip anything because you never know when you're going to miss something.



110

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:10.090

Right.



111

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.790

So anyway thank you so much for watching.



112

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.390

On the next lecture we're meant marry make sure that this works and gets through so that where we can



113

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.600

process all that information.



114

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.970

All right.



115

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.300

Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
