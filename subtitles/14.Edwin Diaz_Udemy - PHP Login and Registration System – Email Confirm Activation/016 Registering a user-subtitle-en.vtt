00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.340

All right we'll come back with the students on the last lecture you saw me correcting the semi-colon



2

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.270

here and I also wanted to correct this curly bracket here but I cut the BT off before you even saw that.



3

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.040

So make sure that you've got your curly brackets there in your semi-colons in the correct place.



4

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.900

Right.



5

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.570

But anyway if we don't we'll just make sure that we do right.



6

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.810

But let's just correct that here and we'll have another curly brackets for the function up here.



7

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.040

All right.



8

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.180

All right so let's not forget that but anyway we'll see the error and debug it if something happens.



9

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.690

So I think we're good for this play this here.



10

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.010

Let's do the next square.



11

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.280

Actually is the same Querrey but we got it append to it because it was cool on top.



12

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.870

All right.



13

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.940

So now we've got to get the values here.



14

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.210

And I put a little space right here as you can see if you don't put a little space in mine not work.



15

00:00:51.330 --> 00:01:00.130

So values with with the parentheses there put single quotes around it because they are string mostly.



16

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.830

And just going to do some placeholder for now right here like that.



17

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.290

All right.



18

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:11.270

So we got the first name we have the last name.



19

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.500

And these are separated by coma.



20

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.490

By the way as you can see right here we go and e-mail.



21

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.060

Whoops.



22

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.010

What is the next one.



23

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:37.280

It's password and validation code and value for their actif And



24

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.760

right now is 0 right.



25

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.470

Actually this column here should be active not zero.



26

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.490

All right.



27

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.130

So correct that this is where the validation default value would be and semicolon.



28

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.920

So make sure that you get your single quotes around each and your coma.



29

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.440

All right for separating each value.



30

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:15.690

Once this is done then we can confirm this Querrey and Lucius well send the query first as well then



31

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.440

we'll confirm it.



32

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.110

And if everything goes good we should see no errors.



33

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.740

All right.



34

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:32.640

So we can send 0 here for values like this were no quilt around the right.



35

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.470

Or I think we're good to go right now and wish you actually had some type of message here.



36

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.210

Right.



37

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.700

Let's go out some type of message.



38

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.010

Let's use Eckl user use or re-used or something like that.



39

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.800

All right.



40

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.140

All right let's check it out let's see if he goes through Let's refresh Let's get another user he is



41

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.350

going to call his guy gaiwan and Martinez.



42

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.830

That's a Spanish name by the way.



43

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.300

For those of you that don't know that I'm going to.



44

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.940

And that's because I he has a really short user name.



45

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.910

That's why I'm using him.



46

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.740

By the way not just because I'm Spanish guys.



47

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.360

All right.



48

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.560

I don't discriminate.



49

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.130

All right.



50

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:31.920

And this is not a dollar sign he has to be that symbol 1 2 and 3 1 2 and 3 and he's not going to work.



51

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.080

All right guys come on.



52

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.640

You should've stopped me when this was going to happen.



53

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.870

Right.



54

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.180

The reason is because we don't have the function right the function we don't have it anywhere here.



55

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.690

All right.



56

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:52.270

So we got to register that BHP we have divided a user only We're not calling this function.



57

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.470

This one registered user.



58

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.220

So what I'm going to do is.



59

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.730

And instead of calling it on that page what I want to do is call it and I'm going to use array here



60

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.580

like this.



61

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.740

And I already see it up.



62

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.220

I already see a problem here but let's just go back here.



63

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.160

If there is an empty display this but if else that means we have no errors we'll just call this function



64

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.820

a write like this.



65

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.310

So we get no errors we'll call this function but we can do something better than that we can say if



66

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:45.840

I write and then we can display something your users use or register or let's do it up here and let's



67

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.350

take of everything that has to do with messages here.



68

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.090

All right and then we can say return true.



69

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.560

All right.



70

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.440

So there we returning false here.



71

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.940

But if everything goes good we return true.



72

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.130

And we're using it right here after these statement saying The calls are empty.



73

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.720

That means we're good to go right here else.



74

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.260

It then IMT with explaining errors by calling this function.



75

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.070

All right.



76

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.620

So if we don't have no errors then we call this function here and we replay user registers.



77

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.300

Now the problem here.



78

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.890

All right we are actually all right we got this call and let's see if it works and then we'll debug



79

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.440

it.



80

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.860

I'd like to do things fast like this where we can see this thing action register undefined variable



81

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:42.150

username exist and function must be a string function name on to 89.



82

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.940

Same error two eighty nine.



83

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.040

All right.



84

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.360

So this must be a string and we are getting an error.



85

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.720

Undefined variable user name exists on the Fineberg will use an image.



86

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.960

This is looking for variable.



87

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.480

So that means that user names right here



88

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.210

oh we get this problem here.



89

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.940

That's OK.



90

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.670

We've got to go in.



91

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.430

All right.



92

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.440

All right.



93

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.940

Let's do some other



94

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.340

last name.



95

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.170

Rodriguez The almightiness little Martina's user name one.



96

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:48.460

One two just in case he already register a user and one to that G-mail password 1 2 3 1 2 and 3 register



97

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.260

on the phone variable validation code on three hundred.



98

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.830

All right.



99

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.030

Pretty cool.



100

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.520

I love validating stuff.



101

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.970

All right.



102

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.780

So he's looking for this code and he can't find it.



103

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.450

His validation code.



104

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.100

All right.



105

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.290

So the reason is because we misspelled is here.



106

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.890

There we go.



107

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.270

Isn't this fun don't you like this.



108

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.020

All right.



109

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.070

Juan Martinez and I'm leaving these lectures here guys.



110

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.630

I want you to see how the body.



111

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.710

I love the biking.



112

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.830

And if you're taking one of my courses you know that I love debugging because it either it helps me



113

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.150

become better.



114

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:32.050

And he helps you allow more than helps me or I can easily believe his lectures and bring and make another



115

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.560

one.



116

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.510

All right.



117

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.390

So let's just do this one too.



118

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.920

Gmail dot com.



119

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.350

Let's do one three just in case.



120

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.100

Password 1 2 and 3 and 4 1 2 and 3 and 4 register.



121

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.420

All right.



122

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.050

Those non-magic value count at 1.



123

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.660

All right column count does not much value count.



124

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.560

Rule 1.



125

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:02.970

All right.



126

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:22.090

Is failing the Querrey that means the vote count in confirm want 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 we're missing



127

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.600

a value right here you see that.



128

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:30.000

So when you get something like this is because you missing a column in your query.



129

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.050

All right.



130

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:31.930

Beautiful.



131

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.580

So let's see which one we're missing.



132

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.400

We got a last name.



133

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.880

We're missing the username.



134

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.900

All right.



135

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.950

Beautiful.



136

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.170

You see why I love debugging.



137

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.380

All right so that user name is actually before the e-mail so let's do it.



138

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.210

Let's make sure that these are in water.



139

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:51.910

All right.



140

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.680

Because you don't if you don't put it in water you've got to sort of them in the wrong way in the wrong



141

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.490

order in the database.



142

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:06.880

So last name of the last name is user name and we'll just put that in there make sure they're separated



143

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.020

by a coma OK.



144

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.000

Double check this.



145

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.540

So you get no errors right here.



146

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:14.700

All right.



147

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.720

So now let's count one two three four five six seven.



148

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.450

All right.



149

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.320

Looks like we're good.



150

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:28.390

Now let's cross our fingers and let's do it again and let's see we have our APHC admin software so we



151

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.230

can check it to see if it's know or other users there.



152

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.460

All right there's no more other users.



153

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.990

Actually the one then let's do one.



154

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:50.100

And Martinez is the last name and user name one by one at G-mail for one.



155

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.740

I got a feeling one is about to get register right now.



156

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.590

One two three four.



157

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.080

Ah.



158

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.220

All right so now we've got a problem here.



159

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.360

We've got some syntax error on line one way.



160

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.980

What can this be.



161

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.790

All right let's go and check it out.



162

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.430

All right.



163

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.690

Line one is close to the password right here.



164

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.680

So what's going on here.



165

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.010

Why are we getting an error.



166

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.650

All right.



167

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:27.650

So values we got our first name last name user name we missing a code right here you see that.



168

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.430

All right.



169

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.790

I think this is the last one guys.



170

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.750

Perfect.



171

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.230

You see how you end this sometimes in the beginning when I first started this was taking me maybe two



172

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.350

or three hours sometimes two days to figure it out guys.



173

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.650

That's why I wanted to show you here how it's done right.



174

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.120

All right.



175

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:58.860

This one G-mail come and password 1 2 3 1 2 and 3 register user register.



176

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.790

All right refresh.



177

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.440

And now we can see that the user has raised her right.



178

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.820

We got a validation code.



179

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:07.890

We got a password.



180

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.640

There's hash.



181

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:15.120

We got an e-mail using the last name first name and the ID right.



182

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.180

So I hope you learn a lot how to value they call how to debug it.



183

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:23.370

We're not going to be doing a lot of the end up in the course anymore maybe a little bit but not as



184

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.000

much as this.



185

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.960

I want you to get a feeling of debugging.



186

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.350

And so I'm going to leave this lecture on hopefully you can appreciate that.



187

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.200

Thank you so much.



188

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.850

And I'll see you in the next lecture.
