00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.320

All right welcome back my students.



2

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.240

The Last Lecture we created a database with bloated files.



3

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.130

I mean we did a lot.



4

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.950

We compressed the files.



5

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.500

I mean we did a lot right and I show you even how to get a really huge discount we go daddy.



6

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.570

It was a really good lecture I believe so.



7

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.770

So anyway let's go to our panel here.



8

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.190

Let's go back here and let's refresh and we've got these new archived zip that's the files that we downloaded



9

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.990

from our my computer.



10

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.940

So I'm going to extract this and it's extracted.



11

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.130

Now if I refresh reload again which you have all these files in there and we can delete this we don't



12

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.260

need it anymore.



13

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.060

There we go.



14

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.050

Now go back to that application and the application should be located in my domain.



15

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.820

And then logging on this core app.



16

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.300

All right.



17

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:05.320

So the domain that I got is on would be Edwyn code college dot com forward slash Logan underscore app



18

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.420

enter now saying that it cannot connect to the database of course.



19

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:21.430

And because as you know we don't have the right information here right the right stuff the right configuration



20

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.960

for the data.



21

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.020

So let's go in an inside functions.



22

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.210

Let's look for IDB that BHP is right click it lets you just do a call edit and edit and then we're going



23

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.380

to change the configuration here a little bit.



24

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.160

All right.



25

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.670

So we got our text file somewhere.



26

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.330

All right we've got the database name right here.



27

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.460

We've got the logging user so we're going to grab the user first and we're going to replace that route



28

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.080

with a low end user and we got to replace the database name.



29

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.720

Actually the passwords and that's one password.



30

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.510

Copy that based right here in the middle.



31

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.300

And what else.



32

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.860

Now that made almost in the middle.



33

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.860

And then our logging database name right here pasted in there.



34

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.630

All right.



35

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.110

And then save it.



36

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.580

Come back here.



37

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.560

That's it.



38

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.440

We're loggin right.



39

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.830

Beautiful.



40

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.490

So that's the Logan.



41

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.790

This is the home page.



42

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.910

We need to go to Logan So we probably need some type of link here that will allow us to log in.



43

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.350

Right.



44

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.490

But anyway let's go to Logan up here each week and we can see that we have our logo here intact.



45

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.250

Let's actually actually try to do this now let's say one and then that in the last password was Edwin.



46

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.100

And then we can go and say logon and now is same mice who are no rows are expecting one parameter to



47

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.330

be a result.



48

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.410

So we have some type of problem here where I've known roles only 9 9 on the DBI copy HP.



49

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.360

So let's go back here and let's inspect that real quick.



50

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.660

Where is it lying nine.



51

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.730

These are all count and we're now getting resold from this real count.



52

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.230

All right.



53

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.630

And that's in Logan.



54

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.760

We didn't have that problem when we are doing it within our



55

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.280

functions right here let's check it out real quick.



56

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.590

Roll it up BHB.



57

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.840

And we do one here and we do and we do it when we don't have that problem.



58

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.350

All right.



59

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.060

So we've got to look to see what the problem is.



60

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.430

Let's go back



61

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.790

in that resoled roll count.



62

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:12.820

So we are actually making a query somewhere and this is now working.



63

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.040

All right we've got to debug that problem.



64

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.210

Our credentials are not correct.



65

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:22.430

That's what he's saying there but one and one.



66

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.480

And of course we don't we don't we don't want to keep this error display for everybody.



67

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.700

So chances are you already don't you don't have any display by by default.



68

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.560

I haven't displayed by default because I already created a file in my root directory and if I go here



69

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:52.060

to or my home actually in the home to squelch the amount the root directory you're going to see a file



70

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.020

called BHB.



71

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.390

I know that I got right here.



72

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.800

And if you check it you're going to see that I have some calling here desk because God lets me do that.



73

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:10.110

So if I take this code out and I take the lead HP I-9 then those areas will not show.



74

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.480

All right.



75

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.290

So you probably don't have to zero by by default.



76

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.760

I have them.



77

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.340

All right so we get it fixed is we going to see where the problem is.



78

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.720

The problem here is when we are trying to log in we're not getting a result from my school I know the



79

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.910

rules and this is has to be probably in that logging functionality.



80

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.120

So let's go back



81

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.810

to our panel and our logging app real quick.



82

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.020

And let's see if we can fix this in his video.



83

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:55.980

And let's go to functions and right here let's call it and let's go to logons where we log in they use



84

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:03.490

a register the user activate the user validate the user right here.



85

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.130

All right I think it's got to be somewhere here



86

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:42.730

so ero counts rockhound right here in Salt.



87

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.320

So this is the only place we use a row count.



88

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.060

All right.



89

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.380

Saying that we are not getting a result from here



90

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.210

what we got to do is we got to go back to that functionality here and we got to see



91

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.120

so from Querrey



92

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.470

we returning resoled here but we're not really assigning any results.



93

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.250

All right so that's not working there.



94

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.640

So we need to assign every saw to this query and then return it right.



95

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:28.440

So that's the whole reason why that might not work.



96

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:39.320

So resoled and then we confirm it here and then we return the result.



97

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.110

And that's good that we all we have in this place here.



98

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.590

That way we can.



99

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.350

All right.



100

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.640

Well it's all right that should work now.



101

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.710

So let's say they now confirm the result and then we return it.



102

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.730

All right let's check that out now.



103

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:09.580

Answer one and let's do one Antar where we fail.



104

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:09.900

OK.



105

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.380

Now we're getting through.



106

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:18.450

So it's saying that the table my logging app users does doesn't exist.



107

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.980

All right my my table my logging app on discoid the



108

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.720

end users doesn't exist.



109

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.460

OK so we don't have a table there.



110

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.160

That's what he's saying.



111

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.860

So we need to agree we need to import that table that's something that we are forgetting.



112

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.550

So we need to go back to our panel.



113

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.040

Let's see if we can get back from there and



114

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.260

click and return home I click return home with our page.



115

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.320

I was going to take me to my person I that's why I moved the screen.



116

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.890

So we need to have that user's table.



117

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.410

Let's go to BHB my admen



118

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:10.800

right now that we have that our database is going to look for it right here my logging app on that score



119

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.870

D-B and we're going to create that.



120

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.710

Actually we're not going to create it and we're going to import that table.



121

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.960

That table should be in our desktop logging on the score D-B remember that logging on the Square-D be



122

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.930

that as well.



123

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.780

And that's the extension that as well.



124

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.210

All right.



125

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.990

And then you click go and that's beautiful.



126

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.920

That is beautiful.



127

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.430

Now we should get this working.



128

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.030

So now we go to our site again.



129

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.200

Enter.



130

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.460

That's what we were getting in error.



131

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:55.490

I'm glad that we got the error there so we can fix that in that Querrey.



132

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:56.270

All right.



133

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.870

I can take that off so we can fix this here.



134

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.150

I'm glad.



135

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:06.780

All right.



136

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.360

So let's go back here and let's just say Edwin and Logan we are logging now so everything is working



137

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.480

perfectly now.



138

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.620

Beautiful.



139

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.980

We logged out.



140

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.820

All right.



141

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.360

So in the next elections we're going to test some of them are we going to test some of the functionality



142

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.270

like the forgotten password and we're going to make sure that we're getting e-mails.



143

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.250

All right.



144

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:31.920

So we got this working now let's get to work and validation with the e-mails.



145

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.180

Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
