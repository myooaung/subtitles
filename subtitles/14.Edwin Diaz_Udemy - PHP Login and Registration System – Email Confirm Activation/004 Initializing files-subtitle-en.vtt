00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.820

Welcome back the student.



2

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.680

So in this lecture we are going to be initialising ph before so we are going to be creating the foundation



3

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.160

for initialising them.



4

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.040

So now this can be set up in many different ways.



5

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:20.200

And I have been in other courses from me you see me changing it from course to course right.



6

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.260

I changed the file structure just to show you different ways of doing it for my students or I I just



7

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.260

wanted to show you that it could be done in different ways and you're welcome to do it your way.



8

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.460

And on this course I'm going to do it a little bit different from my other courses.



9

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.030

Right.



10

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.270

So instead of putting the functions up BHB right here in the root directory we can just go ahead and



11

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.450

create a folder and we can call it functions.



12

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.500

All right just to keep things a little bit more organized.



13

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.560

Right.



14

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.330

And inside this year then we can start creating our BHB files.



15

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.100

I'm going to create the first file is going to be in it.



16

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.840

That XP.



17

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.750

And this is the father is going to have everything.



18

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.590

There's going to be including in the header right to initialize everything in our application.



19

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:17.400

Another file that we are going to be creating here is functions that BHB is going to be our regular



20

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.630

functions and it's going to open it with a Ph.D. tackier I think I did that for in it.



21

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.370

No I did not.



22

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.280

We're going to open it up.



23

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.860

There we go.



24

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.790

What else.



25

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.790

Then we need maybe Ajax functions.



26

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.910

All right so let's create that real quick.



27

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.680

You file Ageod's on the core functions that BHP.



28

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.440

All right I think we're going to be using a little bit of Ajax in this course.



29

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.240

All right.



30

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.310

All right.



31

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.830

So we've got three files here.



32

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.320

All right.



33

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.140

Anything in it.



34

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.060

All right.



35

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.090

We are going to write in the bottom here we're going to include



36

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.460

functions.



37

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.590

All right.



38

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.220

So these include functions that should be



39

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.270

all right.



40

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:23.370

Another thing that we want to do here would be to include our database connection so let's make a file



41

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.800

for that.



42

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.440

Well the BHB.



43

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.300

All right just to make it simple right.



44

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.880

I need will write above.



45

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.130

We are including as well in heads up here.



46

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.750

All right.



47

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.520

And then we also want to this Ajax function we'll leave it like that for now.



48

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.820

All right.



49

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.660

All right.



50

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.960

All right.



51

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.860

So that's it for now.



52

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.170

And the reason why I'm leaving this slide is actually in my file I just put it up here.



53

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.520

That's fine.



54

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.500

In this in it that BHB we can set up constants for our path.



55

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.510

We can do a lot of things in this in it because this would be the file that will be included in every



56

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.760

other page out there.



57

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.220

And right now let's actually set it up.



58

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.520

So let's go to includes an in the header right here let's include it.



59

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.480

All right.



60

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:29.370

Say include them and you can do require required wants whatever you want.



61

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.890

All right.



62

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.040

And we'll do in it.



63

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.180

Actually it is in a folder called functions



64

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.870

and is in a file going it up actually.



65

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.390

All right.



66

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.740

And let's test it real quick.



67

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.860

Let's go to it and it's just echo something here.



68

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.100

Echo.



69

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.730

It works.



70

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.170

Let's see we don't get any problems right.



71

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.590

Yes.



72

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:06.990

With fresh loops to do all you know what you need on line 3



73

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.460

Sorry guys.



74

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.710

Init



75

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.770

actually I'm sorry guys i didn't get right here.



76

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.640

We already have in it is functions.



77

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:39.810

And then our database I don't know why in the world I was thinking maybe there we go whoops.



78

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.880

So if you get an error like that you know what it is now.



79

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.350

Right



80

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.550

refresh.



81

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.930

And now he says it works right here.



82

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.800

All right.



83

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.980

And of course we got to open our BHB tax right here.



84

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.600

All right.



85

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.680

I was probably doing it in my head and not on the text editor.



86

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.240

But anyway thank you so much for watching ON THE NEXT lecture we're going to start working with a database.



87

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.020

All right.



88

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.510

Take care and I'll see you then.
