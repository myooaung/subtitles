00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,900
Welcome back my student on the last lecture we create some helper functions here for our D-B that BHB

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,000
file that's going to be where function ideas of the database.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,480
And on this lecture we are going to be creating soan general functions that are going to help us do

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,000
other things in functions that BHB our file.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,570
But before we do that let's create a function here another D-B function for the database that is going

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,970
to count the rows of Row Records inside the table of the database.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:39,740
So let's call this rule count per right like this right and we're going to take a resort

8
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,250
and we are going to be returning.

9
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:56,460
My eyes are lying numb rows and then we'll put the results in here like this.

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,030
All right super simple super easy to do.

11
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,280
All right.

12
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,660
All right so once we have that let's jump into functions that BHP.

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,720
BHP tag's if you don't have it open already and they start creating other functions here oops we go

14
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,460
all right.

15
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,910
So the first function that I wanted to have here is something to clear you know with stuff coming from

16
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,620
the form like if you put something in input type ttes.

17
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,940
Sometimes they could put I don't know greater than symbols or crazy symbols like this.

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,440
We want to clear all that out.

19
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,220
All right and we do that with something called H the entities.

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,480
But we're going to create a function that's going to help us do that is going to be easier to use so

21
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:47,800
we can say function let's call it clean and we're going to clean string.

22
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,960
All right.

23
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:55,450
And we are going to be returning a predefined function from BHB already called of male entities.

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,140
All right.

25
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,200
In the end is going to clean that string.

26
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,780
All right.

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,450
Beautiful.

28
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,020
All right.

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,370
That's the first one.

30
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:10,660
Second one would be something called the hetter function that's to read Areca So we're going to call

31
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,070
it redirect cause is easier to do it like this.

32
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,410
And I'll show you in a minute why.

33
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,200
Well first of all keep in mind that we aren't actually creating these helper functions for a reason.

34
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,160
That means if we do it especially here if we are using let's say another type of API for the database

35
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,930
like instead of mice you know we use something for both grass for another database.

36
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:40,120
We could just replace the coding here for that specific database API and we can change the whole thing

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,270
the whole obligation instead of you know having this specifically be to my ask you apply every every

38
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,390
function that we have.

39
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,290
So we have like little plugins that we can plug in to our application and if we use some type of other

40
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,510
data bases API later on we can switch the coding here and if we apply to the whole application is easier.

41
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,230
Right.

42
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,130
But anyway.

43
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:07,270
So for the redirect here we're just going to do the location and we're going to return the header

44
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,840
which will help us redirect.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,710
All right.

46
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:21,070
So here we just put the curly brackets in here and say location and I use this curly brackets and you

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,390
don't have to use them just to make sure that you know that let.

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,080
Whoever has seen my code know that this is a variable in my cell was.

49
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,620
Well you know once I see the curly brackets I noise a variable but if I leave this like this you know

50
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,870
sometimes it's hard to distinguish especially if you have a lot of code and I can also do a raising

51
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,580
here you see.

52
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,590
So this is for complex coding.

53
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,700
Right.

54
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,590
Make sure that you're in it you have your Olby on the score start on top and your session here.

55
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,100
All right.

56
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,350
So want to make sure that.

57
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,280
But anyway and that's for the redirect.

58
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:04,860
That's why we have this function here orby on the score start.

59
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,910
And you fighting tell you to put that in there make sure that you have it right right on the first line

60
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,840
and then session start.

61
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,340
I want to make sure that you have that because if you don't have that you don't have a lot of problems

62
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,890
later.

63
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,350
All right.

64
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,570
So we have this what else can we create.

65
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,120
All right.

66
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,350
Another useful thing is to set session messages.

67
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,810
All right.

68
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,690
I don't want to be doing it all that time to let the user know that something is going on like user's

69
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:42,030
password was updated or something like that because if we use akele to do some things like that to encode

70
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,850
messages if we redirect to another page we would lose that value and we can't actually use echo if we

71
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,320
really are recked right.

72
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:58,060
So let's create a functionality here where we can set messages in sessions and that way we can see it

73
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,180
anywhere in our site.

74
00:04:59,230 --> 00:04:59,780
All right.

75
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,180
So let's set some messages here.

76
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,330
Some functions that would help us with that.

77
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,450
So we're going to grab a message here.

78
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:16,030
This function is going to take a parameter a message write a string and we're going to set a session

79
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,300
with it.

80
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:23,410
But first let's check to see if this is not empty then we can do it because if it's empty we don't want

81
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,590
to deal with it.

82
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,530
So the message is now empty then we'll grab a session.

83
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,870
All right.

84
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:38,580
And let's call the message and then we can apply whatever we put in that message variable.

85
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,420
All right.

86
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:45,820
Beautiful else we don't want to get any errors on the screen so we are.

87
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,340
We'll set the message variable to an empty string.

88
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,410
All right.

89
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,600
That's the first and this function here we'll put it or as before the redirect.

90
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,530
When we are actually inside a function.

91
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:57,850
Right.

92
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,580
So we set the message.

93
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,010
We put some type of string.

94
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,570
We send some type of string and we save it in the session and we can Agway later.

95
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,250
So let's actually create a function to equity.

96
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,240
And this one will be called a set message.

97
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,970
Message like this doesn't take parameters because what we wanted to do is just echo the message right.

98
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,780
So we'll say if it's set

99
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:32,620
and what if it's sent the session message then we'll actually write

100
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,220
and write and then after echoing.

101
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,510
Then we can on set.

102
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,980
So that way the message doesn't stay there all the time.

103
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,360
Right.

104
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,060
Those are pretty cool functions that you're going to see.

105
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,190
We're going to be using a lot.

106
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,530
All right.

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,900
Pretty cool stuff.

108
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:56,710
Another function that I want you to have which is pretty cool is a function to make our forms really

109
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,530
secure.

110
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,840
And we're going to use this later.

111
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,810
I call this a talking generator function is going to be pretty useful.

112
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,060
This is to create some type of strength like this.

113
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:11,620
All right is going to be like an encrypted string and then we can put that in the session and then we

114
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,870
can use it to validate the function.

115
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,130
All right.

116
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,640
I'll show you in a minute what I mean.

117
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:24,510
But anyway let's create a real quick because we're going to need it I'll show you later why generator

118
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,210
you are talking generator.

119
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,850
These are some pretty advanced stuff.

120
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,980
But I want you to know it.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,700
All right is very useful.

122
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:39,030
So we'll use a couple of functions here to create this one is called a unique ID.

123
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,490
And in this unique ID we can use.

124
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,760
Inside here we can use another one called empty random and you can look this up.

125
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:48,890
While they do.

126
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:54,550
But basically you can see this one is going to produce a unique ID and empty random I believe is the

127
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:00,810
name is going to provide some random values.

128
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:07,400
I'm going to send this to true right and then I'm going to I'm going to put this encrypted in the empty

129
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,710
five function is going to encrypt all this for me.

130
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,770
All right and there is a website I believe that will give you this.

131
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,440
That if you look for unique ID in google or something would tell you exactly what it does.

132
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,950
But HP on their Web site we would show you exactly what it does.

133
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,460
All right.

134
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,330
So you can find some more about it there.

135
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,060
I'm not going to go into details here.

136
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:36,790
I'm telling you right now he's going to produce an ID and empty random is going to pull some random

137
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:43,890
values and then we said that's true just to make it bigger.

138
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,510
All right.

139
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,050
It's just going to be more.

140
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,630
And let me look for the description here.

141
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,130
So that way you can unique ID.

142
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,060
Let me see if I can find it where he is or where I can show you what it is.

143
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,810
Real quick.

144
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,900
Right here.

145
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,960
Unique ID

146
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,560
example something like the LMG

147
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,100
unique ID to show you right now

148
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,480
right here there we go.

149
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,850
All right.

150
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,260
So here you can find that if we said this too true it creates a unique ID with a random number as a

151
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,480
prefix more secure than a static prefix.

152
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,520
All right.

153
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,800
But anyway you can find out some more information about this.

154
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,140
But anyway we got this going here.

155
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,990
All right.

156
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:15,110
Now not only are we setting this to a variable where we can send this to a session right here

157
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,610
and we'll call this session talking.

158
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,410
All right.

159
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,390
True true true.

160
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:32,150
And then we can just return the whole day in here.

161
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,800
Beautiful.

162
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,090
All right.

163
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,360
You can play around with this.

164
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,990
You can grab this and create a variable in an empty file and then return and you can see that every

165
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,100
time you refresh you're going to create some random values and it's going to be pretty cool right.

166
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,200
I'll show you later on where we can start this but this is going to go in the hitting input inside the

167
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,950
form and we're going to use this just to make sure that the form is coming from that specific page.

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,480
Now it's playing some more later one when we get to the form.

169
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,250
But anyway we're going to use these functions here just to make things a lot more secure is going to

170
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:10,520
be really cool anyway we are done with this helper functions for now.

171
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,280
We should be done.

172
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:18,170
Make sure that you write your comments here and you can say something like helper functions

173
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,160
right.

174
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,660
Beautiful.

175
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,310
Then here will will create the next functionality.

176
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,080
I think we're going to work with validation next.

177
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,960
All right.

178
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,750
Just have this in place because we are going to be using it.

179
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,220
Thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next lecture.
