1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,400
All right welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,210
Very good.

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:03,750
Very good.

4
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,570
Very good.

5
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,950
We are here again.

6
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,630
Let's check it out.

7
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:15,300
Let's check to see if we are able to get the revalidation going so that way we can get redirected to

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,810
the reset that BHP page or else we get some errors.

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,080
Let's see if we can make this happen.

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,540
All right.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,020
So let's go to that call that BHB paging I think is going to redirect us now.

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,840
All right because our cookie was expired.

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,650
Let's go and get some new session going for this guy right here.

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,260
The line which is a pretty cool guy.

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:37,550
Right.

16
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,490
Don't you think he's always letting us use his e-mail right.

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,480
So.

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,220
All right.

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,600
So now we have to type the raw the right validation for this to happen.

20
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:54,070
So we need to replace this validation code here that we having our text editor.

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,510
Hopefully you are following me with the new one here.

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,820
So we got one right here.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,090
And I would go

24
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:16,940
and we go our new one let's see if now we try to go to that called page with all the credentials where

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,960
all the stuff.

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,220
And it will redirect us.

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:19,640
Right.

28
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:29,370
Well it's not going to redirect as we got to typing that that code in the box is.

29
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:36,050
It will only allow us to go into that what is redirecting us because for some reason is

30
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,990
telling us that something is wrong.

31
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,770
Is hitting one of these guys here.

32
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:56,240
If he's not set get e-mail or get code he's going to redirect us let's check it out again.

33
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,050
OK this is wrong right here.

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:12,720
It is supposed to be e-mail and cool to one G.M. and now the validation could get by let's do it again

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,510
real quick.

36
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,930
Well now we've got the right one let's just correct this Ted.

37
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,250
Add it to real quick here to e-mail.

38
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,450
All right there we go.

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,770
Let's do it again.

40
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:30,120
One e-mail I think I had it in 15 minutes but I when I took it down to one minute again for my cookie

41
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,350
expiration date.

42
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,650
All right.

43
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:40,250
Let's go back to the to the database real quick let's refresh double click here.

44
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,450
Come back here and let's test it before expires again.

45
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,790
Here we go.

46
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,000
Now we should get it right after.

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,220
Now we were able to enter that code.

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:03,630
So now if we enter the code that we have which is this called right here pasted in there and continue

49
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,110
is going to take us to the reset page.

50
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,300
All right so it's working perfectly.

51
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,200
Very good.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,070
Maybe in the future we'll make this code a little bit shorter.

53
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,650
You can see that ball right now is working really good guys.

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,640
So if you're ready to learn some more really cool stuff.

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,660
Stay tuned and we'll get it going all right.

56
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,890
You're doing very good if up to this point.

57
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,400
So I want you to feel very proud of yourself.

58
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:33,180
If you want to go ahead and toast to this location go ahead and get some drinks going where your friends

59
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,000
and your family and celebrate because you're learning something super cool right here.

60
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,880
See you in the next lecture.

61
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,320
Take care.
