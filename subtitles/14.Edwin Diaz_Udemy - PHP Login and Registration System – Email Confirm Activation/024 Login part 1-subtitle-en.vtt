00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.030

All right welcome back my students.



2

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.040

So on this lecture we're going to actually learn how to create the login functionality.



3

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.650

All right.



4

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.620

So let's start.



5

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.810

So now that we know that we're getting something out of it.



6

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.690

Right.



7

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.240

All of our validation.



8

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.110

So this function is actually working and we can add more things later on but right now it's fine with



9

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.680

us.



10

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.590

So right here is where we are going to be calling our log in user function.



11

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.530

Let's create that for let's create a space we're going to grab these comments here and put it right



12

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.090

here and do this user logon.



13

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.220

And I'm going to put a comment here are-I function.



14

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.830

All right.



15

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.970

Perfect.



16

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.560

So we're going to have a function here.



17

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.980

It's going to be called log user.



18

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.130

Right.



19

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.540

And we're going to take the e-mails a parameter and we're going to take it password.



20

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.980

All right.



21

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.000

Beautiful.



22

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.260

And this folks is going to return true or false depending on whether they use a can log in or not.



23

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.110

Right.



24

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.250

So we can



25

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.020

call it right here.



26

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.430

We can say hey logging user.



27

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.930

All right.



28

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.700

He's able to log in.



29

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:33.700

We can redirect the person to admin admin BHB else.



30

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.080

We just display some type of error.



31

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.540

And I think we can use this function right here.



32

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.940

Let's just paste it right here and we can just type in something like your credentials



33

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.930

are not correct.



34

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.910

Something like this.



35

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.710

I think this will work fine for us.



36

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.510

All right.



37

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.090

All right.



38

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.800

So the first thing that we need is we need to do a query here right.



39

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.450

Remember we're getting all these fields from from here.



40

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.230

So they got to be body data they got to be clean but we still need to escape it.



41

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240

Right.



42

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.700

So let's just do as well and as selected for us we're going to select that path we're going to need



43

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:34.460

a password and the IP from the users where e-mail equals.



44

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:44.510

We're going to do a scaping here or e-mail because the e-mail arrived like this.



45

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.470

All right.



46

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.230

We're going to save the query in a resource variable.



47

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.950

So we're going to do this and we can't say if we find something so we get to use our roll count function



48

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.560

that we created to count all those roles in the table.



49

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.860

Any of our roll count is equal to 1.



50

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.580

We found somebody right.



51

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.750

And we can return true of course but we've got to do a couple of things before we do that.



52

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.160

Right.



53

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:24.650

But if we're not able to log in to find our record we're going to return false by this.



54

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.640

All right.



55

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.990

So if we return true.



56

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.420

All right.



57

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.800

Now we could if we



58

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.530

we could use this statement does we ask you all to verify the password and email.



59

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.850

But when we use when we are using encrypted passwords a different story because we have an encrypted



60

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.070

password hash password we need to use the empty five to the code that password.



61

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.980

So that way we can verify that the password from the form is the same password that we have in the database



62

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.190

so we have to use the five to do that.



63

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.880

So we need to take out a password from here take it out from the D.B and use dandified to the coded.



64

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.140

That way we can compare it with the password from the form.



65

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.190

All right so if we find a record why we need to do is we need to graph Fetchit.



66

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:31.570

So we're going to use our custom functions factsheet array that we created a fresh their arrays.



67

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.630

So we're going to fetch that.



68

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.800

We're going to save it here and we're going to bring it out.



69

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.030

So now we can save it in a variable called the repasts work.



70

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.190

This row



71

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.890

is going to be possible.



72

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.180

All right.



73

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.380

So I hope you see what we're doing here.



74

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.390

So once we have that in the past then we can use our Indy 5 to compare that password.



75

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.450

So let's actually see if we can.



76

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.980

We have something going on here.



77

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.430

Semi-colon There we go.



78

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.380

I mean you use a couple of comments here functions.



79

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.760

The function



80

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.860

well all right



81

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.460

all right.



82

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.580

So I'm going to leave this lecture very short.



83

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.790

Well the next lecture we're going to use the M.D 5 to the code the password.



84

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.190

And we're going to verify it at the same time.



85

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.750

It's going to be a pretty awesome lecture.



86

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.470

So thank you so much for watching.



87

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.750

You guys are awesome.



88

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.110

See you in the next one.
