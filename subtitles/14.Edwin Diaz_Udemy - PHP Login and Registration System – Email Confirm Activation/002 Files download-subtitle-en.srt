1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,710
All right we'll come back with a student on this lecture here.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,240
We're going to start working with the files.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,490
All right.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,670
I got some files that I want you to download.

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,470
So go ahead and download it from this lecture is going to be called the Student hyphen files that zip

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:21,960
downloaded unzip it and then on your age the docs I want you to create a folder called logon and then

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,810
inside this folder we are going to be placing whatever I'm giving you on this lecture whatever follows

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,310
on giving you right here.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,930
All right so we're gonna get pasted in there.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,500
And now we have this content.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,750
Now if you go to your local host.

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,460
All right.

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,370
I'm going to show you right now.

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:53,060
But if you go to your local host slash logon you should have something like this right now.

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,850
Basically what I did here is super simple.

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,550
All right.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,290
I gave you a bunch of templates that we are going to be using for the course.

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,190
We are also using Bootstrap which is for those of you that don't know and you should know by now but

19
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:14,280
if you don't know bootstrap is a framework for the amount CSSA has a whole bunch of predefined classes

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,550
or big files with a lot of styles that we can use we can use those classes to make our application a

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,780
lot better like like you are seeing right now this is all bootstrap.

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,990
All right this is I have not caught any CSSA here.

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,120
So if you minimize it you should have some functionality like this.

24
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,120
This is javascript but this is booster up doing this for us.

25
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,500
Right.

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,100
So let me give you an introduction to those files real quick.

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,580
So right now we have a whole bunch of templates that I created for our course and then we have the CSSA

28
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,800
for that we have our bootstrap and some empty stylesheet.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,110
But this is the main file that is creating all this down there.

30
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,420
And we have asked for that with some Bushrod Yes also some javascript double shrive uses to make some

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,870
really cool functionalities.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,840
And of course we download Jake wari because we're going to be using that framework as well for javascript

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,820
for writing javascript in an easier way.

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,160
And we got some empty scripts Yes.

35
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,670
All right.

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,930
So that's it.

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,290
All right.

38
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,240
We shouldn't be dealing.

39
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,680
You shouldn't be dealing with NEHTA Melchior says because this is a course for Logan and registration

40
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,690
right.

41
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,760
We don't want to deal with any of that.

42
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,420
So make sure that you have these files working in your local host and your server basically in your

43
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,440
local environment and on the next lecture.

44
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,740
We are going to work some more with his files so that where we can get to the fun part.

45
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,440
All right.

46
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,410
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
