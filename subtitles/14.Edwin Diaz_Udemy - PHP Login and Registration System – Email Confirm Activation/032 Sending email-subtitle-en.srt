1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,060
All right welcome back my students on The Last Lecture.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,160
We created these checks here just to verify that whatever information we're getting is coming from that

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,270
form or that person is on this form.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:10,980
Perfect.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,680
We don't need to do a lot of validation here because we're going to be able to.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,490
Well we going to do is we're going to send a link to that person.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,220
Right.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,320
We're going to send a link to that e-mail address that's come from the form and they have to they have

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,830
to go into that e-mail and click it.

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,660
All right.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,400
So we need to verify that you know existing our database and we already have a function for that so

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:44,250
we can say something like If e-mail exists and we bring in that post to pro-global which is post and

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,590
we can clean this up a little bit.

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,170
Let's just clean it up before we put it in here.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,310
So it's very clear that we're doing that.

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,720
They should put in a variable.

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:04,400
Let's just keep it up as we go and let's just go do this post email.

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,860
All right.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,000
And this is coming from this input right here e-mail.

20
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,020
All right.

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,560
All right.

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,490
So once we clean it up a little bit actually we are scaping you there.

23
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,160
And that just reminded me make sure that this data that you got up here.

24
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,750
All right.

25
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,160
We are actually scaping.

26
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:30,870
So we're good.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,940
And we just make sure any data they use.

28
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,130
You're skipping just in case I missed something make sure that you did it right.

29
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,430
But anyway.

30
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,830
Beautiful.

31
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,340
All right.

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,710
If e-mail it says

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,960
Just make sure that we have or checks in place or curly brackets post

34
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,540
talking's talking Cherrix.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,940
All right.

36
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,770
And then e-mail check.

37
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,600
So they e-mailed zest Dan we want to go ahead and send an e-mail to that person.

38
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,580
So same email right.

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,700
And we're going to you know let me see is this what we want to do so we're going to send them an e-mail.

40
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:21,000
They're going to click on the e-mail or you know what we can actually from here we can actually verify

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,950
instead of sending an e-mail and take him to the code page which is did this page right here.

42
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:37,950
I think that's a better option called BHP hopes is that it we have an arrow there and 584 I think we

43
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:45,060
stop writing this function right here.

44
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,510
All right.

45
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,800
Call that BHB.

46
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,300
You see that so we can verify that use and send them to this page.

47
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,010
We can send them a code as well and then send them to this page.

48
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,820
You don't want to send them a cold let's send an e-mail let's keep it like that so that way we can send

49
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,430
a covert e-mail and they can do that.

50
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,510
They do that with e-mail that's that's fine.

51
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,770
It's more secure.

52
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:14,050
So we're going to send an e-mail or let's make sure that this is the e-mail right here.

53
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,830
So we're going to send an e-mail.

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:26,200
And that's going to have the e-mail address by and subject object the message and head on.

55
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,190
All right.

56
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,230
So let's work on the subject.

57
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:40,510
The subject is going to say Please reset your password and we're going to verify this later.

58
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:40,920
All right.

59
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,180
But

60
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,820
the message is going to be

61
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,990
like this.

62
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,090
And we can use the delimiter and function at a function I guess show you before if you want to do that.

63
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,550
That's up to you.

64
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,300
All right.

65
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,720
So you can put your the limiter into this.

66
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,910
It's up to you.

67
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:13,690
And I like this for now but please click the link below to reset your password.

68
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,590
Actually you know what.

69
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,550
Let's actually.

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,510
Here is your reset your password reset password.

71
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,290
We said code and we're going to have to give them a code.

72
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,110
So we're going to have to create is called right here.

73
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,590
All right.

74
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,680
So let's do it.

75
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,230
Let's create this validation code.

76
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,200
All right.

77
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:53,650
And the five and we can use the e-mail for that and we can add some Microdyne to it used to make it

78
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,200
a little bit stronger.

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,480
So that would be the validation code right here.

80
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,790
Right.

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,760
It's a dollar sign there is your validation code

82
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,120
click click here

83
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,410
to reset your password.

84
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,690
And then we got to put the address here HTP localhost

85
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,040
code that Ph be.

86
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,780
All right.

87
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,080
And we're going to send some parameters right.

88
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:50,120
We can send the e-mail the user use to make sure that we have the right user and the validation code

89
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,740
ampersand and code.

90
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,970
All right.

91
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,480
Beautiful.

92
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,000
And ahead of course

93
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,880
in code and headers

94
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,520
from.

95
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:23,470
And we could actually make this permanent in that sendmail function made that is permanent but like

96
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,970
a default we don't have to do that no reply.

97
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,040
And this will be your Web site.

98
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,310
Coming from all right.

99
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,420
This looks good.

100
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,030
We send the e-mail and that's beautiful.

101
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,190
All right.

102
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:50,980
In the next lecture we are going to also make sure that this page is only available for a certain amount

103
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,570
of time.

104
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:58,000
But by setting a cookie with an expiration because we don't want anybody to come here if the cookies

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,490
expire and if we send the link to the person are ready to do any of this called here we don't want the

106
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,780
speech to be available.

107
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,700
You know a year from now because anybody can come here and keep trying and trying and trying to hack

108
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,490
it and they maybe it will be successful.

109
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,240
Right.

110
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,100
So we want to make sure that this expires and if it does expire we're going to kick the person out of

111
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,290
here and send them somewhere else and let them know listen you cookies expire.

112
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,740
You need to go and you know go to the recovery that BHP page again and try again.

113
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,690
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

114
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,500
We are done with this functionality for now.

115
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,300
But we are going to again set some cookies here.

116
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,400
And so messages.

117
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,860
All right thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
