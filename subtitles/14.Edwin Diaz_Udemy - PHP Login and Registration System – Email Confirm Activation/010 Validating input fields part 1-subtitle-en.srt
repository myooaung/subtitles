1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,070
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,240
I hope you're really excited.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,030
We are learning something really cool here.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,500
And when this is finished you're going to have are you going to have a full complete application.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,450
Really events really secure really flexible.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,370
We're going to be pretty cool.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,910
You're going to be learning how to do this.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,780
Pretty soon you're going to know everything.

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,650
But anyway.

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,560
So once we pull out the values from the form and we clean them up a little bit then it's time for us

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,450
to check them.

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:35,580
So we could say something like this and we can use a pre-built BHB function SDR Lenn to check how many

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,320
characters each of these is.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,630
So for example if we want to find out this is

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,890
the size of this we'll write this we put the first name inside this function.

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:55,740
And now this function is going to have the amount of characters that the user puts in this input field

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,700
right here.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,430
So if I put three characters that is going to be equal to three.

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,410
All right.

20
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,720
So I'm going to say if this is equal to three That's more than three.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,920
I want you to go.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,540
No you like this.

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,340
For example I'll show you just to show you.

24
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,320
So I'm going to put it equal to two because that is less than 3.

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,640
Email

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,730
Cliggott.

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,470
And now says no.

28
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,040
Well of course we're not going to this play.

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:46,740
No what I want to do is that I want to set a variable to contain a value a set default a default size

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:56,010
value for my minimum minimal function ID and my maximum functionality what I mean with that is that

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,100
if the first name is less than a certain quantity I want it to display an error.

32
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,840
So any fees over a certain quantity I want it to also display an error.

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,690
So I'm going to set this like this.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,290
The minimum is going to be three and the maximum is going to be 20 for example like this.

35
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,890
And then we're going to display an error.

36
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,290
But for that I also won an array.

37
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:26,340
Then I use an array to save all the errors and they have the end of this validation.

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,260
I'm going to display all the arrows that we encounter when we were validation of validating.

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,370
So this is going to be an empty array like this.

40
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,960
Right.

41
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:41,840
So if this is less than men then we have a problem right.

42
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,210
Let's say your first name

43
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,940
first name can not be less than.

44
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,410
And I do this curly brackets because I want to you don't have to.

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,750
This is for complex operation.

46
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,220
When you have double cause you can put this curly brackets and you can do great if you want but I like

47
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,880
to it like this.

48
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,630
That way I can know that this is a variable.

49
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,430
And it's very it's it kind of helps me distinguish words from variables.

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:24,710
But anyway your first name cannot be less than minimum characters or example like that.

51
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,050
Right of course.

52
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,640
Like I said I wanted to save this into my array.

53
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,790
So I don't do it like this.

54
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,430
All right.

55
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:48,760
Now that this is like this I want to actually write a function real quick here.

56
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,600
I'm going to check to see if my arrays empty now empty.

57
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,170
Then we know we have an error right.

58
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:04,040
So if he's 90 I'm going to loop through that array and display each individual value.

59
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,780
So I look through errors as error

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,370
this and aquittal.

61
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,040
All right

62
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,880
ladies.

63
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,790
All right.

64
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,960
Let's go into this real quick.

65
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,660
Let's see what happens.

66
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,330
Refresh Ponzo river anjing.

67
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,760
Make sure there's an e-mail.

68
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,700
Register your first name can be less than three characters.

69
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:47,290
But if we wanted to now we do this to the last name and you'll see that we have a function out of today's

70
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,370
really flexible.

71
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,070
Right.

72
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,900
And we can say the last name here and watch this.

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,230
And it's going to there's no one to want to

74
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,160
register.

75
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,230
And now we get both messages your first name cannot be less than three characters and your last name

76
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,490
cannot be less than three characters.

77
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:17,130
Of course we have to fix the how this looks but you can understand now how this is going to work and

78
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:22,680
we're going to do that for user name right and then we're going to do something different we pass one

79
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,900
confirm.

80
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,240
But I just wanted to show you how to do that.

81
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,820
Another thing is if you wanted to show to also learn how to do this by how to check for empty spaces

82
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,660
is super simple as well.

83
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,610
All right.

84
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,930
We can say something like this.

85
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,750
F and D.

86
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,990
And I'm not going to be using this but I'm going to show you how to do it.

87
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:53,450
If you don't know a first name is empty then we do something like we'll say the error in the array and

88
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,670
we when we can say your first name can be empty.

89
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,300
All right like this if you want to go ahead and do that.

90
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,160
It's up to you.

91
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,340
I already have some H the m l 5 validation.

92
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,020
That's good for me.

93
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,310
All right.

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,150
So if you want to go adding that extra layer of validation is up to you on the next lecture.

95
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,570
We're going to complete this.

96
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,030
And I want you to create a validation for user name.

97
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,430
Oh and another thing is that if we go over of course.

98
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:30,770
All right.

99
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,920
So this is what I want you to do in the next lecture and I take this out on one this.

100
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:43,290
So we're we are checking for first name and last name for the minimum I want you to create the same

101
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:52,470
thing here in this in-thing for this one but checking for maximum value right and displaying a correspondent

102
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,510
string something that corresponds to a max value functionality.

103
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,390
All right so in the next lecture I want to see that.

104
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,790
And we're going to compare code to see if they are the same or right.

105
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,560
Pretty easy stuff.

106
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,240
But I want you to start coding right.

107
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,960
Thank you so much and I see you in the next lecture.
