1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,300
All right we'll come back and buy the student.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,730
So on the last couple lectures we set up our files and downloadable resources and I mean we are ready

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,910
to go to start working with the database.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,370
But now let's actually create a database we don't even have one.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:14,900
Right.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,010
So let's get started doing that real quick.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,990
And you know for those of you that know me from the courses you know that I wasn't feeling 100 percent

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:29,310
on the last lectures is because I you know I have my coffee Well now I do so I'm good to go.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,790
So let's go to local host right for us last BHB adamant my admin.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,950
Of course right there.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,990
And then here we're going to create a database.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,820
All right.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,320
So let's call this database law again on the score.

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,750
I think I already have one.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,780
I don't have one.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,250
Create beautiful.

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,630
All right.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,000
So now inside here we got to create some tables.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,840
All right.

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,030
First is going to be the users table.

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,610
This just create the user stable for now.

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,420
As a matter of fact I think that's the only one we've got to create because this is a logging application.

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:09,740
All right.

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,750
But anyway we need another table in the future.

25
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,300
We'll add it that will add our table if I extend the course let's just click go.

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:27,860
Let's add an ID with an index or primary click OK on that make sure you select these a underscore I

27
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,730
which is autoincrement.

28
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,810
So that way the idea keeps getting incremented every time we add a new record.

29
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,750
All right.

30
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,480
What else do we need to know from the user.

31
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,800
How about first name.

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,100
How about last name.

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,990
That's good to know when you do have a registration number or username and we add more.

34
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:56,030
But let's actually said DiSalvo right now 11 var car 255.

35
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:06,660
I like to do to 55 make our car user name 255 just to make it easy for everybody right all right I'm

36
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:13,260
going to add we need a password and some more columns.

37
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,290
So let's just add three more I believe.

38
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,880
So you got username and password.

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,950
How about active.

40
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,870
Actually let's do confirm

41
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:38,850
let's do validation Valley validation on this core code and let's do active here.

42
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,230
All right.

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,820
Hopefully enough forgetting anything else.

44
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:51,940
All right so last word we're going to make this a Tatz validation code could be tells us well that's

45
00:02:51,940 --> 00:03:00,190
fine and active will make this tiny int which is data type which is like it only takes two values 1

46
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,720
and 0.

47
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,100
I'm going to set it up to be defined as 0.

48
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,630
All right we're going to use it to detect if the user is active.

49
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,380
All right.

50
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,780
So I think we're good Let's talk with checked is real quick to do the password.

51
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,720
We don't need to put anything there because X has all the characters we can put in there.

52
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,420
It would take any characters any amount validation code.

53
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,130
OK.

54
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,530
All right good.

55
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,300
Let's just save it.

56
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,030
Perfect.

57
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,900
So now let's check our connection to the database.

58
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,000
Real quick.

59
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,070
Why NDB.

60
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:43,310
Let's actually create a variable called Call on and let's do my Eskew like connect.

61
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,230
Let's just say loopholes because that is the default name for the host.

62
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:56,730
When you first install the Zam map or ramp whatever local environment software you are using the user

63
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,750
name is root by default password is empty.

64
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:07,600
And our database name which I believe was logging on the score D-B.

65
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,880
All right perfect.

66
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,890
So we have our connection what else.

67
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:17,210
Let's go to our Internet and let's see if it works let's do it right here.

68
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:26,320
I say if Conn is available which is variable right here will bring a positive or negative or actual

69
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,980
force Canek response.

70
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,930
So right now we're testing if that means if it's true.

71
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:41,500
If Con is true or false We're going to tackle something right right now if it's true we can say yes

72
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,910
is connected.

73
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,650
Yay.

74
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,890
All right.

75
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:53,790
So let's go to it local who's Logan.

76
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,100
Yes he's connected so we are good to go.

77
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,280
Our database is connected is created.

78
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,840
Our table was created.

79
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,720
And if we do anything else will actually make it happen on the next lecture.

80
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,600
But we're good to go right now.

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,560
Take care and I'll see you in the next few lectures.
