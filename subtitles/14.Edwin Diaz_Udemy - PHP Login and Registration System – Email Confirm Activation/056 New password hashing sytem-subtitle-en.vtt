00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.010

Welcome back my students on this lecture what I want to do is I want to upgrade our logging application



2

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.640

with a different password hashing system.



3

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.240

And right now we're using in this registration register user function we use AM the 5 and the 5s a little



4

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:26.890

older we might we it's good to use actually password underscore hash is a newer function is more secure.



5

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.810

And of course I'm doing this because one of our students actually requested this.



6

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.190

And I want to make him happy I want to make you happy.



7

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.190

And let's do it.



8

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.390

Let's actually create this so instead of using undefined function we are going to be using password



9

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.640

hash.



10

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.550

Now keep in mind that this function works with BHP or a newer Petri version I believe five point four



11

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.530

or five point five.



12

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.080

If you are looking to 5.3 I don't think it works with 5.3.



13

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.890

I'm not 100 percent sure you can look it up on beach on their web site but you shouldn't be concerned



14

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.770

too much with ABB but you can actually make some type of statement here and and test for that.



15

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.670

But anyway so password we passed a password with this has a couple friend parameters so that password



16

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.650

the algorithm that we are going to be using Well we're going to use this constant call the here.



17

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.380

We also have another parameter that can be an array with options and we're just going to pass the cost.



18

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:39.920

How how tough this password is going to be basically there are more 10 and 12 is actually a good practice.



19

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.100

If you make it this number too big it's going to take too long to have your password.



20

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.880

The reason why we do this is just make it harder for people to hack into our application right.



21

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:59.220

So let's go and look for the next five function logging user right here.



22

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.800

OK.



23

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.310

And we are going to replace all of this out



24

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.260

with something else selects



25

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:24.630

come back here and let's do password hash actually is verify that we go.



26

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.400

So we verify the password.



27

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.400

The old one and the new password was.



28

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:45.020

So if I have this in another if this password is good then we just basically do what we were doing last



29

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.210

session.



30

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.020

Got a piece of code right.



31

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.090

And then after that make sure that you set the session email



32

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.430

we can return TRUE



33

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.080

else we return false OK.



34

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.560

And this should work the same way we were doing before.



35

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.890

So one thing that I have to do here that we have to do is register a user but before we register a user



36

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:32.930

I believe I have the wrong you are held here somewhere when we get in the link.



37

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:42.010

So as you can see I have this Web site here and I don't want that what I'm going to do is in configurations



38

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.330

I want to create a cost and we have this you are all here for development purposes.



39

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.880

So let's go to our configuration class and let's create this constant here.



40

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:10.800

Let's call this the low def development you are l and that's just going to be a string like this



41

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.000

OK.



42

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.040

And I also won a production production one which



43

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.550

which in this case is HTP



44

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.560

and called college I believe it is.



45

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.700

And I think he's logging app or something like that.



46

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.400

OK let's see.



47

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.810

Yep that's the way it is.



48

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.050

OK.



49

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:58.310

So let's actually include that here real quick.



50

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.030

And we have to cut everything out here.



51

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.220

Like this



52

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.040

and like that.



53

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:20.110

And now we have to bring that config and we put the development you are l there just like that.



54

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.860

OK.



55

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.450

And that should work good.



56

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.390

Let's go and register a user.



57

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.040

Let's go here.



58

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.550

Great user link here somewhere right.



59

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.840

But anyway so let's register a new user.



60

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.990

I'm going to register a user called Jimmy or let's call



61

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.150

it doesn't matter.



62

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.310

What am I doing.



63

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:56.430

And joy and joy on recording faculty because he works there.



64

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:03.180

I'm joking by the way and he's Bassel was Edwin believe it or not I don't know why he would have a password



65

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.260

like that because that's easy to crack right.



66

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.060

All right.



67

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:14.550

So we're going to register the user and it looks like something something good happen this click here.



68

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.620

And as you can see your cars be activated.



69

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:25.560

Please log in join the coding faculty and his passwords Edwyn and then log in and voila.



70

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.410

OK.



71

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.670

So thank you very much guys.



72

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.980

We are done here with this functionality.



73

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:41.180

I want to take the time to thank many of you that take the time to review the course and some of you



74

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.010

have given me such an excellent review.



75

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.480

I really look at those.



76

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.190

Believe it or not I don't have all the time in the world to respond to all of you but thank you so much



77

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.950

for giving this course such an amazing review and I'm going to try to keep adding as much as I can.



78

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.140

I appreciate the nice comments that you gave Samuel.



79

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:06.860

E-mails or messages if you want to recommend something to me private message me in this course or you're



80

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.260

not getting contact with me.



81

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.290

If you want to talk about Course related stuff go ahead and make a discussion about it.



82

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.960

OK.



83

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.730

Anything to do with the Course it's something that you one requests or you or any issues you have anything



84

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.890

personal send it to my email Edwin.



85

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.250

Edwin has more editing according faculty come to private message me.



86

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.680

Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next features or the next course.
