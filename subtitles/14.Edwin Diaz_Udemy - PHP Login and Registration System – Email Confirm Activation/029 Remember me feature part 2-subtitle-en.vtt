00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.540

Welcome back a student on the last lecture we talked a little bit about how I get so much money about



2

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.240

you know the cookies and the session.



3

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.460

Right.



4

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.970

And we know how they work.



5

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.490

So now this lecture I'm going to show you how to use them.



6

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.150

Now I'm going to modify this a little bit here in the valley they use the Logan function.



7

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.430

We need to actually take this off a little bit from here because it's not going to work like that.



8

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:32.690

I just remember that if we would try to enclose this function inside the the clean a custom function



9

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.420

is not going to work.



10

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.530

So you might one day do something like this.



11

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.550

All right clean inside the set and that should work.



12

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.050

All right you can try to go that way and you can see that it's not going to work.



13

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.670

But anyway so here we got to make sure that we're passing all these parameter all these things.



14

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.680

There's variables here.



15

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.420

Remember to our logging user function as well.



16

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.230

So all right here we got to pass it in.



17

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.730

Don't forget that.



18

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.750

All right.



19

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.140

And we also have to pass it in right here so we get because we're going to be using it inside here.



20

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.090

Remember.



21

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.150

All right.



22

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.090

And you know you can do whatever you want.



23

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.500

We're going to have to do a check here to see if this is clicked or not because if it's clicked we want



24

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.660

to be able to set the cookie.



25

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.830

And now we don't want to set the cookie so we can do it right here right.



26

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.410

If the user has the right password we don't want to do this function IDs on less.



27

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.940

We know that they have the right pass.



28

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.630

All right and plus we're already setting a session here why not do it here as well.



29

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.150

So we're going to say something like this if remember is equal to on and this check box is going to



30

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.030

be equal to on when he's checked.



31

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.040

And what he's not is going to be equal to all.



32

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.680

So that's how we can detect that.



33

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.340

So if he's on then we're going to set the cookie and how are we going to use up pre-define function



34

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.600

set cookie.



35

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.130

And the first parameter is going to be e-mail.



36

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.500

Second parameter is going to be the content.



37

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.060

And in this case we're just going to set up an e-mail for it.



38

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.200

But we can pull whatever we want that parameter is going to be the time.



39

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.520

I'm going to put the time function.



40

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.450

All right.



41

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.240

So the time function is going to give me all the time from 1970 I believe to now in milliseconds it's



42

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.390

just going to be a horrible horrible number.



43

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:33.890

But if we put a plus symbol and we say you know what 60 that would mean that this cookie we're at Spier



44

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.060

in 60 seconds.



45

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.630

Isn't that beautiful.



46

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.640

Right of course you don't want to set the cookie for 60 seconds.



47

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.220

You want to set up for something like maybe a whole day.



48

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.390

I think it's like thirty six hundred or 86000 seconds.



49

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.580

I just got to look at it.



50

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.880

But we can really do a google search and convert it one day two seconds and you can see how many it



51

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.090

is.



52

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.310

But we'll do that later.



53

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.380

So now we're setting the cookie here.



54

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.370

Now let's go to our logging function here because we only checking for session.



55

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.090

Make sure that we are also checking for cookies.



56

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:18.370

So for set set cookie like this and we write a cookie name that we're checking for.



57

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.920

Right.



58

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.330

So if we find out that the e-mail is a session email is set right we're going to return true or if the



59

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.190

cookies set.



60

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.450

We're going to return true right.



61

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.610

So this should work very good for us right now.



62

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.070

Let's try it.



63

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.790

Make sure that you put your comments I got to start putting my comments when I'm not showing you guys



64

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.620

anything right.



65

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.340

So that way we don't we don't waste time of my lectures putting comments.



66

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.170

But anyway.



67

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.990

Ooh.



68

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.000

Can I use.



69

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.340

You know what we can now use the set like that either



70

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.640

write you can use now instead.



71

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.390

All right let's just take it off for now.



72

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.960

Let's use.



73

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.820

Find out where it is first.



74

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.990

Where is it.



75

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.690

Where is it.



76

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.370

There we go.



77

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.860

We can't use it either.



78

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.270

We can just do it here and clean it up if we want to but that's fine.



79

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.420

We've got to leave it like this right now there's no way.



80

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.450

By the way they're not going to give us their injection through the letter check box but



81

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.380

just make sure you save it will clean it up later or if you wanted to buy it right now let's do this.



82

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.000

All right.



83

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:41.810

So if we write the e-mail and I already have a user call one e-mail that come right if I do one two



84

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.290

and three but I don't check them there's no again.



85

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.070

Now you can go to here using Google Chrome by the way which I think is one of the best browsers I think



86

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.740

already said this.



87

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:59.110

But anyway you go to settings then we go to a show and settings content settings of cookies and sites.



88

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.420

We only got one cookie available and that is the session if we click on it we see that we only have



89

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.020

that session.



90

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.650

This is the name of the identifier for the session.



91

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.160

And how do we get this because we already have sessions start in our application Our application is



92

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.410

already getting starting a session.



93

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.540

So that's how we get this.



94

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.320

And this is the content that goes to the server and then we control over there.



95

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.840

Right.



96

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.450

But anyway enough with the lectures about sessions so the cookie wasn't set right.



97

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.900

So let's log out and let's try again one point two and three.



98

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.830

Remember me log in.



99

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.600

Beautiful.



100

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:48.910

So now if we go here to settings and we go to event settings we are on set and content are cookies and



101

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.380

data.



102

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.250

We see that we've got two cookies one that looks exciting right.



103

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.820

Beautiful.



104

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:02.250

Now we were able to set the cookie and what is the content the e-mail address of the user.



105

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.170

Now he's not going to put the symbol in here but you can see that it is the e-mail address of the user



106

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.610

and he's going to expire in what one minute.



107

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.060

You see that here.



108

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.430

So he's probably already it's by or by now.



109

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.330

All right.



110

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:25.770

So let's go real quick and let me show you let's do it again one two and three.



111

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.430

Logan All right.



112

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.150

So now if we take our browser we close our browser within one minute.



113

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:40.550

I remember we're going to do this on one minute and we try to open our application in admin that BHB



114

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.360

we can see that we still know then right beautiful and remember before it was logging us out.



115

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.290

Why because we didn't have a cookie set.



116

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.020

All right.



117

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.640

So he's working now the next thing is we've got to make sure that we put this in the log house.



118

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.930

Well all right we've got to make sure that we don't set the cookie.



119

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.420

So in the next lecture I'm going to get into that because it just takes a little bit of explanation



120

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.940

but it's working.



121

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.710

We're going to keep refreshing here.



122

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.260

And if you don't you can weigh your 30 seconds.



123

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.120

That is going to take for this to logout and you keep refreshing and refreshing and you're going to



124

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.740

see that this is going to take it to the ancients that BHB because that cookie is going to be on set



125

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.850

soon.



126

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.560

Right.



127

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.420

But anyway thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
