00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,950
It's amazing to start a new day of study together again, along with some warm coffee, tea, whatever

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,170
you're drinking, and all the energy that we need to face our problems.

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,070
Today, we have a challenge.

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,190
One of those that you will remember for a while today, we are going to create a hangman game.

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,840
You remember Hangman.

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:33,540
The one where someone thinks of a word shows you how many letters it has, and you have to guess the

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,400
letter, the word letter by letter until you discover the hidden word.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,760
But if you make a mistake, the poor little hangman is formed.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,110
And if you complete him before guessing the word, you lose.

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,720
Do you think you can program this right now?

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,420
Well, probably not right this moment, but after learning everything I offer you today, you'll be

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,950
able to do it together.

13
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,760
Today we are going to dedicate the whole day to learn a single topic in depth functions.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,810
Functions will allow you to take a big step in your career.

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,080
And I think that if we measure your learning curve so far, this is the point where your skills will

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,590
take a big leap because functions allow you to solve much more complex problems than we have seen so

17
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,160
far.

18
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,830
So when you master functions, your limitations as a programmer will be greatly reduced.

19
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,350
So functions and everything related to them is this fifth day of study.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,350
I won't take any more of your time because you're going to need it.

21
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,910
See you in the next video.
