00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.790
Data science is a special field of science that applies scientific methods, processes and systems to

2
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.150
extract knowledge or a better understanding from data in different forms.

3
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.940
It is a very broad science.

4
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.750
So in this section we do not intend to teach data science, but how to apply Python to data science.

5
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.330
For that, we are going to dedicate this day to learn about three Python libraries that are a world

6
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.720
standard in data analysis and visualization.

7
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.650
And these are numpy pandas and map plot lib.

8
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:49.160
NumPy, which stands for numerical python, is the default mode for doing numerical operations efficiently,

9
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.750
even with monstrous amounts of data and in a very short time.

10
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.880
PANDAS is a library used to manipulate and analyze data in Python.

11
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.490
It is built on top of NumPy.

12
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.590
So many features are similar.

13
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.780
We will use pandas to work with data sets that are structured in rows and columns.

14
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.140
That's why PANDAS is known as Python's Excel.

15
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.580
And we complement all this with Matt Plot Lib.

16
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.500
The preferred library for creating charts in Python data visualization through graphics and data science

17
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.240
is a very important part.

18
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.360
It plays a role in communicating information visually, which can come from tables of millions and millions

19
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.150
of rows while allowing us to better understand our data in ways that we could not do so by reading a

20
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.720
table.

21
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.950
When we finish learning about these tools, the icing on the cake will come.

22
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.070
We are going to be able to apply everything we have learned to build a data model known as machine learning.

23
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.640
This refers to a branch of artificial intelligence that consists of training our computer so that it

24
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.560
is able to predict the outcome of new cases based on its experiences with provided data.

25
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.360
This particular project that we are going to create today consists of a module that will receive the

26
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.600
database of passengers of the famous Titanic based on the analysis of who survived and who did not.

27
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.340
This module will be able to identify which characteristics are the most favorable or unfavorable to

28
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.820
survive the sinking ship and even predict whether new passengers would be able to survive or not if

29
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.670
we put them their science fiction, right?

30
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.810
Not at all.

31
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.140
This is science in action, and you will put it all into action yourself, starting with the following

32
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.710
video.
