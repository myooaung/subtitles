00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.620
Now it's time to devise a structure for cost panel, which is the one below the left panel.

2
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.660
There's so much code to write.

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.650
So let's begin.

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.130
Let's clarify that we're going to establish cost labels and input fields, because this panel contains

5
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.220
labels and input boxes for every product food cost, drink cost, dessert cost, subtotal taxes and

6
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.880
total.

7
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.850
So let's start with food cost.

8
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.460
Let's create a variable named food cost label, which is equal to a label.

9
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.110
So what will it contain?

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.170
A location which is cost panel.

11
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.850
Below left panel.

12
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.400
Let's add food cost.

13
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.070
The next parameter is font, which is dosis size 12.

14
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.380
In bold background is a zero for foreground is white and we created the label.

15
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.430
Now we should place it somewhere inside cost panel.

16
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.640
So food cost label grid and we want it to be in row zero on top of everything and in column zero on

17
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.330
the left.

18
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.280
Let's execute this.

19
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.560
We have a label that looks more like a button, but we'll take care of that soon.

20
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.520
Let's add an input box that should be next to that label.

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.620
So food cost, text entry and the value it will contain is the location in cost panel.

22
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.620
Its font will be doses size 12 and bold.

23
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.050
Its edge will be one.

24
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.060
Its width will be ten.

25
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.530
In state.

26
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.010
We will have to clarify what we'll be able to do with this.

27
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.680
Well, they're not editable.

28
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.360
We just want to see the sum of everything the customer has bought.

29
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.190
So this won't be editable, but read only.

30
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.680
The last parameter is text variable.

31
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.950
And just like we did with the rest of the input boxes, we're going to assign this a variable named

32
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.630
food cost var.

33
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.280
We haven't created that variable yet and we'll do that later.

34
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.560
That's why we're getting an error.

35
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.390
Now we have to place food cost text inside the grid.

36
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.590
In this case, Roe will be zero since it is on the top and column will be one, meaning it will be to

37
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.630
the right of food cost label.

38
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.550
Before executing this, we should create before the explanation a list of variables where we will be

39
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.680
create food cost via so as to get rid of the error and will make it be equal to string var.

40
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.620
Now we execute this and we have food cost and a blank space next to it.

41
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.850
Perfect.

42
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.000
Now we basically have to copy and paste because we have to repeat this with each of the six values we

43
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.510
need.

44
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.190
We have to create drink cost label now and we're going to do the same as before.

45
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.300
Let's make several selections to enter drink.

46
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.020
The rest will stay the same, except that the name of this label will start with a capital D.

47
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.820
We need to create the drink cost via variable, which is equal to a string var and now we should be

48
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:35.020
smart and create the other four variables we're going to need which are cost, dessert, subtotal taxes

49
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.100
and total.

50
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.580
These variables will store what's inside these boxes regarding location.

51
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.770
The drink cost will be in row one.

52
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.470
This looks nice.

53
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.110
So let's organize it a little bit more.

54
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.420
Let's copy, drink again and paste it below.

55
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.210
Let's change everything to dessert.

56
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.100
So we'll select everything.

57
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.000
Then delete, delete it and type dessert.

58
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.220
This will be placed in row two.

59
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.060
That is on the third row.

60
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.340
We execute this and we have our three elements, one below the other.

61
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.130
Let's create the three missing elements which are to be placed to the right of these.

62
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.790
Let's copy the last bit and go down here.

63
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.550
This label will be Subtotal and now we're going to replace what needs to be replaced.

64
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:37.920
It will be linked to the subtotal variable and they will be replaced in row zero and column two, which

65
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.300
would be the third column.

66
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:47.130
This one will also be placed in row zero and column three, which would be the fourth column.

67
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.860
Focus on this difference.

68
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.620
Subtotal is next to food cost.

69
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.090
Are you following me?

70
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.020
There are two left.

71
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.480
We're almost there.

72
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.230
Let's copy this element which will be named taxes.

73
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.350
So we'll change everything in order to enter taxes.

74
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.510
Let's modify this value too, so that it reads taxes in uppercase.

75
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.860
Now we have to change the location.

76
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.830
These ones have to be in row one, each one of them, and in columns two and three.

77
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.430
Okay, we have the taxes.

78
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.590
The last one is total.

79
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.010
So we need to delete taxes.

80
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.630
And I'm assuming you're doing this automatically without even watching the video.

81
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.900
And once you understand that, it's not that complex.

82
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.360
So we place them in row two.

83
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.560
Each one of them.

84
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.510
Columns two and three.

85
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.470
Perfect.

86
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.270
This doesn't look attractive at all.

87
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.100
We need other sizes, so we'll have to configure the padding.

88
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.630
Padding is the increased space inside the content area.

89
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.410
It makes the whole block bigger, but from the inside.

90
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:04.580
So inside the text variable will position ourselves on every one of these and will add one more parameter

91
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.560
to each one of those elements.

92
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.000
Let's add pad x equals 41.

93
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.580
Now let's execute this and we'll see that they were placed in the middle.

94
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.640
Now we have to change the background color.

95
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.080
So let's pick a nice one.

96
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:29.650
Let's go to the cost panel here and add a, B, G that is equal to zero four, which is the color we

97
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.030
chose for the labels.

98
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.780
If we execute this, we see a much prettier panel, and our labels don't look like labels.

99
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:45.430
They were like incorporated into the panel, yet they are separated from the edges of the left panel.

100
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.230
So we'll add one more variable to cost panel, which is pad x.

101
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.990
Let's put 40 and tested.

102
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.500
It's not quite right.

103
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.210
Let's enter 50 and that's it.

104
00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.170
Much better.

105
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.190
The box is as wide as the panel, and I think it's better that way.

106
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.660
So we've almost finished the visual aspect of our application.

107
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.620
Let's go to the next lesson so as to continue with this.
