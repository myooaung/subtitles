1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,480
Now we're going to program our assistance so we're able to tell what day it is today.

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,350
So delete this call and close this function.

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,010
And here I put voice language options.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,930
And now I will create a new function which will work to inform day of the week.

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,900
We can call this function ask day and it won't need any parameters.

6
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,640
And here inside let's create a variable with today's information.

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:48,270
Now we can create a variable called day, which will be equal to date today, and let's print this day

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,660
and inside the same function.

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,410
Let's also create a variable for the day of the week, because in today we need only to separate the

10
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,800
day of the week, which is what we want her to say.

11
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:11,310
So weekday will be equal to day dot weekday, which is whether she tells us it's Monday, Tuesday,

12
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,080
Wednesday or whatever.

13
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,320
Then we're going to print this to see it on the screen.

14
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,610
So let's see how it looks.

15
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,570
And here below, if I call ask day and then we can execute it here.

16
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,980
Return the day in which I'm recording this and the day of the week has a number y.

17
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:36,480
So because the corresponding index for today is a list that contains the name of seven days, it is

18
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,630
to say that this number corresponds to a day of the week.

19
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,600
But I don't want my system to say a number.

20
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,110
For example, today is for I want them to tell me today is Monday or today is Tuesday.

21
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:56,250
So I'm going to need to create a dictionary within my function which contains the names of days.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,480
And in this way my assistant has a word to pronounce.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,960
So let's call calendar to this variable which will have a dictionary whose first element will be the

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,280
key zero and have a value of Monday and they'll speed up the video so all this doesn't bore you.

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,340
Okay, so once I've finished to make this dictionary, we must have seven elements that go from 0 to

26
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,810
6.

27
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,760
This dictionary allows the assistant to associate the numerical value with each day.

28
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,340
So the last thing that we're missing is that our assistant can say the day of the week.

29
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,160
In order to say it correctly, let's call the function, speak from inside the function, ask day.

30
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:46,830
And the message that it will pass will be a literal string confirmed for today is and a call to calendar.

31
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,910
So which index of calendar are we going to pass it?

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,580
The one which is in weekday, which is the numerical value from 1 to 7.

33
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,600
So let's execute again, but it's given as an error.

34
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,880
So what happened here?

35
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:11,130
It tells us name error with the function speak because here it says name ID five is not defined.

36
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,800
So let's review the function speak and what seems to be the problem here.

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,220
We requested ID five, but it doesn't recognize it.

38
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,660
Probably because this has to be before the call to the function.

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,850
So let's put these variables above everything and now it's okay.

40
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,180
So now we can call, speak and it should recognize them.

41
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:40,710
So to remember you can't call something that doesn't exist in the codes logic we execute again.

42
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,940
Today's Friday.

43
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,440
Did you hear that?

44
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,820
So one more time.

45
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,010
Today is Friday.

46
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,090
I love it.

47
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,810
Perfect.

48
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,830
Thank you very much.

49
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,480
Assistant So now we know how to request the date and the next lesson.

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,160
We're going to ask the time.
