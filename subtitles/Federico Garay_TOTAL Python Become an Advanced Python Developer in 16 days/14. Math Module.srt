1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,880
And it is time for the math module whose name says it all.

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,540
Math is another integrated Python module and we only have to import it to be able to use all of its

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,500
resources.

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,830
Basically, this module contains the complete kit of resources to work with numbers and python, from

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,840
simple mathematics to trigonometry passing through different types of routings.

6
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,450
Today, I want to show you some of them so you can learn how to use this resource.

7
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,480
However, you can check the documentation to know more about this resource, the dozens of operations

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,770
it allows you to do.

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,790
If numbers are your thing, this is the chest you should learn to open.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,470
Let's go over to Pi Charm.

11
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,770
And as Phillips said, math is a goldmine.

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,820
Though it's pretty basic and easy to use, we simply import math and now we can see what methods are

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,470
inside the math object.

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,370
So let's create a variable called result that is equal to math dot.

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,060
And here we have dozens and dozens of methods that allow us to do all kinds of calculations.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,510
Let's try some of them, for example, floor, which means round numbers down towards the floor.

17
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:27,270
And if here I put any number of type float to go round it and then we print to see the result in screen,

18
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,040
what is it going to show us when executing it is 89.

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,050
It rounded down the number.

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:41,640
If I use the SEAL method for sealing, which rounds up this value here would have been 90.

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,910
Another element that you will find inside the math module is the letter PI.

22
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:55,790
Well, this is actually not a method, but a value that if we print it, will give us 3.141516, etc..

23
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:03,470
PI is an absolute value that exists and that you can use for your operations like calculating radius,

24
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,190
etc..

25
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,830
We also have some trigonometry.

26
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:16,190
For example, we can create a math log, which is a logarithm that if we pass a number and a base allows

27
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,840
us to create, how many times we have to multiply that base to get the number.

28
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,610
So let's see an example.

29
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,670
If I have 100 and then I have five.

30
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,460
What this math log is going to give me as a result is how many times I should multiply it.

31
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,540
Five so that it gives me a value as 100.

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,940
And if we execute it, it is 2.8, six, one, etc..

33
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,030
So we're going to do it with an easy number.

34
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:53,420
If we put 25 and we execute it so that five exposed to another number x returns 25 but number X should

35
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,320
be two because five times five is 25.

36
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,160
We also have ten, which is the tangent.

37
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,160
If you work with these kind of values, you know that you put here any number and the tangent of that

38
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,450
number will be returned.

39
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,610
We can also get the cosine of a given number with the cost method.

40
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,830
Well, the truth is that this is a module that should investigate according to your interest, because

41
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,790
there are dozens and dozens of methods that allow you to make calculations.

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,670
And as I told you, there are they are from basic to more advanced mathematics, trigonometry, etc..

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,390
And in fact, although it's very complete, math has its limitations, because if you work with numbers

44
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,850
and you do very advanced things with them, maybe you need other modules that don't come with Python,

45
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,960
such as NumPy.

46
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:49,550
If you look for it in pi p or in Google, you will find that numpy has many more options to work with

47
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,060
numbers.

48
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,680
If you really like numbers, that's where you'll get them.

49
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,090
In fact, later in the course, we're going to look at NumPy a little bit more.

50
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,670
So you have these two options, math for the average human beings and numpy for the geniuses.

51
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,760
And for now, I'll let you play with this module for you to get familiar with some alternatives.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,830
And I am off to the next lesson.
