1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,240
Congratulations.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,260
You've finished learning all the content of day two, and now you're able to create a slightly more

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,610
complex program.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,900
You already know how to do things like mathematical operations, data type conversions, string formatting

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,920
and rounding.

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,680
So let's celebrate with a new challenge.

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:36,420
The situation is this You work in a company where salespeople receive 13% commissions on their total

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,410
sales, and your boss wants you to help the salespeople calculate their commissions by creating a program

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,250
that asks them their name and how much they've sold this month.

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,310
Your program will answer them with a sentence that includes their name and the amount of commissions

11
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,390
they are entitled to.

12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,900
Now, this is not a complex program, but that's okay.

13
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,310
You're still learning, even though what you have learned so far is very simple.

14
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,680
Putting it all together in one program can make your new skills get a little bit messy.

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,030
A couple of guidelines.

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,930
This program should start by asking the user for things.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,760
So you're going to need to use input to receive user input, and you should use variables to store that

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,210
input.

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,010
Remember that user inputs are stored as strings, so you should convert one of those inputs to float

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,060
to be able to do operations on it.

21
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,030
And what operation do you need to do?

22
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,010
Well, calculate 13% of the number that the user has entered.

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,510
That is, multiply the number by 13, then divide by 100.

24
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,910
It would be good to print the result on the screen, so make sure this information has no more than

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,810
two decimals.

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,170
So it is going to be easy to read and then organize all that in a string that you would format.

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,400
Remember, we learned two ways to do it and any of them is valid.

28
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,900
All right, go on.

29
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,710
Try to solve it.

30
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,550
And if it gets complicated, Federico will do it with you in the next lesson.

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,990
Go ahead and good luck.
