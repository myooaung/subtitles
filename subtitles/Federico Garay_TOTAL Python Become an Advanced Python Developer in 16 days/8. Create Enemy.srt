1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,380
So the time has come for this lonely rocket to have enemies to fight against.

2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,840
So I've downloaded and stored an image named enemy dot png in my folder.

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,970
You can either search for one on the internet or use mine, which I attached to this lesson for you

4
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:23,870
to download.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,810
This is how I want my enemies to look.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,530
Very well.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,300
Now we have to generate code for my enemy to appear on the screen.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,890
Then we'll make it move.

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,340
So let's copy all the players variables we have here, because what we're going to do is is quite similar.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,400
In this case, there will be enemy variables.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,870
The image variable will be named enemy image.

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,100
And the name of the file containing the image will be named enemy PNG.

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,710
Here we'll type enemy X and the following will be enemy Y.

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,250
And finally, this one will be enemy x change.

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,490
Here we have a different group of variables for our enemy.

16
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:11,870
We'll also copy and modify the player function or change it to enemy function, and the rest will remain

17
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,620
the same.

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,260
The only difference will be the enemy image.

19
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,800
Everything seems fine.

20
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,310
There are no complaints.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,610
The last thing we need to do is go to our player.

22
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,240
Call where we will call our enemy so we type enemy.

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,890
The first variable is enemy X and the second one is enemy Y.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,520
Taking into account how we've done this, the enemy should have the same characteristics as our rocket.

25
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:44,000
However, if we execute this, the enemy overlaps the rocket because they are created in exactly the

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,810
same way.

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,040
They are both located in the same place because both have the same coordinates.

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,170
So let's give the enemy other coordinates.

29
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:58,220
As regards the y axis, we'll enter 200, execute it, and our enemy will appear here.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,550
But our enemy will not be controlled by the user.

31
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,980
Its movements won't be controlled from the keyboard, the enemy will be controlled by the computer.

32
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,400
So we also want our enemy to appear randomly.

33
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:17,060
So like we did before, we'll import our random method which allows us to set a random value.

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,560
So enemy x will be equal to random dot round.

35
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,980
So it is in a random integer.

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:35,180
Regarding the screen width, values will go from 0 to 736 because our enemy is also 64 pixels wide as

37
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,830
in the case of our rocket.

38
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,180
We'll do the same with the y axis so that our enemy appears randomly.

39
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:50,600
We'll enter random rand dent here and the maximum height will be 50 and the minimum will be 200.

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,670
If we execute our screen, we'll see that our enemy appears randomly.

41
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,190
And if I close it and execute it again, the enemy will appear randomly once again.

42
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,730
Every time I close the window and execute it again, our enemy will appear in different places.

43
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,460
So that's how we make our enemy appear.

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,300
So far, we're facing one enemy who doesn't do much.

45
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,400
It's a bit boring, but this will begin to move and attack soon.

46
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,680
So see you in the next lesson.
