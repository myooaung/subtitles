00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.840
This is the first of many lectures we will see on functions.

2
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.010
So far I have marked many topics as fundamental in this course.

3
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.100
While Functions is perhaps one of the most important things in this whole training, we have seen that

4
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.810
methods are functions.

5
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.080
But those functions were developed by the creators of Python and were incorporated by them into those

6
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.890
objects.

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.840
From this lecture on, what we are going to do is create our own functions.

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.510
That is to say we will be able to create our own methods and to design a repeatable code, which is

9
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.450
one of the most important tasks of a programmer.

10
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.030
Functions allow us to create blocks of code that can be easily executed many times and in different

11
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.470
contexts without the need to constantly rewrite the entire block.

12
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.810
This is a crucial point in learning as well.

13
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.590
Functions involve combining everything we have learned so far and making it work efficiently and effectively.

14
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.250
Many students are disappointed when they see that this doesn't come immediately to them or that it takes

15
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.300
time to learn and they often feel frustrated and overwhelmed.

16
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.270
I want you to not look at functions that way.

17
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.130
Seeing them as something that is beyond your reach is completely normal.

18
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.600
Are they challenging?

19
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.410
Yes.

20
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.190
Do you have to be an exceptional genius to understand them?

21
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.960
No, definitely not.

22
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:37.250
You just have to be patient to let something different, new and complex be assimilated little by little.

23
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.970
Federico and I will be with you every step of the way.

24
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.350
So I ask for your patience and to pay attention step by step.

25
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.250
If you find it as difficult, increase your practice time, ask questions, watch the videos again.

26
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.950
It's not bad if you look for additional help elsewhere as sometimes different ways of explaining help.

27
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.190
You understand the whole thing, the whole topic.

28
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.860
The best approach to this challenge is to think about the quantity and quality of skills you are going

29
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.370
to develop and how much they will enable your ability to think of your own projects and create them

30
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.510
in the near future.

31
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.250
So practice, patience, enthusiasm.

32
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.750
And here we go.
