1
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,980
So we already know how to detect if there's a match.

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,630
And we also know how to measure the distance between the people in two different images.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,250
So now we're going to make these two values both result and distance appear in test picture here at

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,700
the top so that the user can see how the comparison has turned out, because so far we can only see

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,050
it in the console.

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,180
So that's what we're going to do in this lesson.

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,500
So first, I'm going to delete this value that we've set because it's too flexible.

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,430
And if we don't set anything, the system will revert to the default limit.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,650
We're going to take this block called Show Images and we're going to take it further down.

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,010
So it's going to show after everything we have to do here.

11
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,620
We're going to remove these prints, which were just for the purposes of you being able to see the results

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,640
in the console.

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,670
And we're going to show the images at the bottom.

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,890
So they're only going to be shown once.

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,050
All the modifications that we're going to do now have been applied, not only the rectangles that we

16
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,450
have created above, but also the visualization of the results that we're going to do next.

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,170
So we're going to write a clarification that says we're going to show results, and it's going to consist

18
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:27,170
of calling CV to remember that this library allows us to manipulate how any image looks.

19
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:34,070
For example, we've used it to put the rectangle and we're going to call its put text method.

20
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,240
Which is going to ask us for several parameters here.

21
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,300
We're looking at them.

22
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,960
We're going to start by setting the image on which we want to put the text, which is going to be test

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,710
picture.

24
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:53,100
Then we're going to set the text, which is the text that is going to be displayed on the picture.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,490
It's not going to be a fixed text.

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,750
It's going to be a dynamic text which is going to be built when we get the results.

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,110
So we're going to write it with a little string that calls result containing true or false.

28
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,620
Then we leave a space and we're going to call distance to show what the distance is between the two

29
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,280
images.

30
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:20,820
But as this is a value that has many decimals, we're going to apply the round method to make it easier

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,780
to visualize.

32
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,640
And inside the brackets, we're going to set it to show two figures after the point.

33
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,300
Then we're going to set the location of the text.

34
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,650
It asks for the coordinates of the left corner of the string in the image.

35
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,330
So let's put in a tuple that says 50 and 50.

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,670
This distance will be enough for it to appear at the left 50 pixels from each edge.

37
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,440
So now we're going to add the font that we're going to use for that we call CV two font, and you can

38
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,970
choose the one you want, and I'm going to choose Font Hershey Complex.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,610
And we're going to set the scale that this font is going to have and we leave it at one.

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,920
The color, if you want, you can make the color red or green, depending on the result.

41
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:16,370
So we can set an if here to be green if the value is true or red if it is false.

42
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,470
For this example, I'm going to keep it simple and make it always green with the value.

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,410
Zero 255.

44
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:24,800
Zero.

45
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,390
And finally, I'm going to set the thickness to two and the other values will be left as they are by

46
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,050
default.

47
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:40,150
So if we now execute this modification, which is going to show us an additional value to see that Brad

48
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:48,460
arrives here and he says that it's false and that the distance between me and him is 0.85.

49
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:56,860
So if I go back to my picture B where I do appear and run it, we're supposed to see in the new picture

50
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,870
the result is true and the distance is now 0.42.

51
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,460
But we have learned one more element in this face recognition training and the next lesson we're going

52
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,920
to start developing today's project, which, thanks to what we have learned so far, we're going to

53
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,410
be able to make a program that sees a person on the webcam and can define whether or not that person

54
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,000
exists in a database.

55
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,730
Our program is going to be a program that registers the attendance of the employees of a company who,

56
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,540
upon arriving at work, are shown on camera and the system stores in a file.

57
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,840
The information about who arrived and at what time.

58
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,620
This is going to be a great lesson and it won't take too long.

59
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,170
So let's get started.
