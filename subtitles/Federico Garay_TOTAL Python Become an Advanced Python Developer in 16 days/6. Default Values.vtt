00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.270
So now that we've created our checkboxes and input boxes for all our elements, we have to enter a default

2
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.900
value.

3
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.940
In this case, it will be zero.

4
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.180
We want that value to be displayed on each of the boxes so as to start a program execution from that

5
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.840
point.

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.490
For instance, when a customer buys two kebabs, the user has to click on check button of kebab and

7
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.050
this box will be activated and they will be able to replace zero with two.

8
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.250
Let's do that.

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.920
We're going to enter zero as a default value.

10
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.130
So how do we do that with our loops?

11
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.330
Notice that we have three big blocks food, drinks and desserts.

12
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.660
We see them better when we minimize them.

13
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.230
So what we need to do is to manipulate the variable we created in food text in which we created an empty

14
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.120
element for each plate we have.

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.010
So inside each loop we're going to call every element we iterate over food text.

16
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.050
Index counter will be equal to a variable named string var.

17
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.650
It would be a string variable, which is another exclusive element of RT k enter.

18
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:29.010
Once we have assigned this type of value, we can call food text index counter once again and call the

19
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.490
set method in order to enter zero as value.

20
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.330
When we execute this, we'll see that all the food has a value of zero like we wanted.

21
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.910
Therefore we can copy these two lines and let's go to drink and paste this after drink, text and replace

22
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.290
food with drink.

23
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.950
Now our drinks have a value of zero.

24
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.090
Let's do the same with dessert.

25
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.500
Go to that block.

26
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.480
Position yourself below dessert, text, paste those two lines and replace food with dessert.

27
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.860
Now, our program has default values.

28
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.180
Why?

29
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.800
We were really fast now.

30
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.310
Anyway, let's continue with the next step.
