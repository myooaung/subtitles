00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,530
Welcome to the sixth day of this intensive Python training.

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:18,890
I'm ready to start full of energy and enjoy what learning and growing brings us in life.

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,580
Today is another day you will not waste because in a couple of hours you will have so many new skills

4
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,810
that you will be able to create a program that yesterday you would have found impossible.

5
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,710
Today you are going to create a recipe box.

6
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:40,880
That is, you are going to be able to write a code capable of managing a collection of files containing

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,810
recipes.

8
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:48,620
And this program is going to be able to read those recipes, create new ones, delete them, create

9
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,990
and delete categories and so on.

10
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:57,180
This means that you will have to learn how to manage files and folders on your computer from Python.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:04,580
So today your code created in pie charm will not only show you things in the console, but will also

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,660
cause real modifications to files and folders on your computer.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,870
Can you feel how your capabilities are growing?

14
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,480
Your next programs will be able to access your computers, directories and do all sorts of things with

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:17,960
them.

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,170
Throughout this day, you will learn how to open and manipulate files, create new files, write or

17
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:30,770
overwrite text files, navigate between directories and create or delete folders.

18
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,170
Learn a couple of super useful tools like Path, Lib and Path and so much more.

19
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:42,680
No matter how your day is going so far, this is the time to focus on Python.

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,520
I'm so excited to have you here, so let's get going.
