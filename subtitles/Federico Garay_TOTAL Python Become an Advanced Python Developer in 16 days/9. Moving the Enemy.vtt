00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.000
So now that we have an enemy, we have to make it move.

2
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.970
The movements won't be created by the user.

3
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.640
There will be automatically generated by the code.

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.100
So what do we want our enemy to do?

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.400
We want it to move from left to right and change directions once it has touched the left and right screen

6
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.000
edges.

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.890
Besides changing directions when touching the edges, we want our enemy to go between 40 or 50 pixels

8
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.340
downwards until putting our rocket at risk of being destroyed.

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.320
So how do we do this?

10
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.400
Let's go back to our code and look for our enemies movements here as we copied the lines of player.

11
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.530
The changing value is equal to zero, which makes our enemy stop once it reaches the edges.

12
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.810
But we don't want our enemy to stop.

13
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.580
We want it to change directions.

14
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.510
So let's change this value to 0.3 so that it takes our enemy to the right, first of all.

15
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.260
We'll also create a changing value for enemy Y change since we want it to move downwards.

16
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.270
How many pixels?

17
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.770
Let's say 50.

18
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.180
I think that's fine.

19
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:26.850
Now let's go to this loop that says modify player location and keep player inside edges.

20
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.310
I did this in order to differentiate this loop from the one we'll create for the enemy.

21
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.220
So now let's copy and paste this and retype modify enemy location.

22
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.940
And keep me inside edges.

23
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.630
So what will be the difference between this and player?

24
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.590
Everything that says player needs to be changed to enemy.

25
00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.890
So to save some time, we'll copy the word enemy and replace player everywhere with it so as not to

26
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.960
type enemy again and again.

27
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.510
All right.

28
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.480
What we have to do now is to decide what's going to happen when the enemy touches an edge.

29
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.720
Player stopped because of this value.

30
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.510
In this case, let's make enemy X change B equal to 0.3.

31
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.600
And if the enemy touches the right edge.

32
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.580
Enemy X change will be equal to -0.3.

33
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.020
So our enemy should move to the right each time it touches the left edge and vice versa.

34
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.700
So let's see how this works.

35
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.100
By executing our rocket, we see that it moves to the edge by means of 0.3, and when it gets there,

36
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.760
it bounces off the edge and starts moving to the opposite direction.

37
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.010
So it's working just fine.

38
00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.160
Now we have to make our enemy move 50 pixels downwards every time it gets to the edge.

39
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:12.280
To do so, we just add in both ifs enemy y plus equals the value of enemy y change which is 50 pixels.

40
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.370
Let's repeat this same line so that our enemy does the same when touching the right edge.

41
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.380
That should do it.

42
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.900
So let's check if this works.

43
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.000
The enemy touches the edge, moves downwards and changes direction.

44
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.300
Then it gets to the other edge, moves downwards and changes direction.

45
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.720
This makes our enemy inherently dangerous.

46
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.870
I'd rather position our rocket a little bit higher so that our enemy doesn't need to go all the way

47
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.470
down.

48
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.710
So let's keep our player in suspense.

49
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.370
Right?

50
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.460
So we move here to play a Y initial position, and let's enter 500 instead of 536.

51
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.320
I think this will be perfect.

52
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.560
And from here on, we'll keep on improving our game and make our rocket go on a mission of destroying

53
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.780
all these enemies before they destroy it.

54
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.870
We'll continue to do this in the next lesson.
