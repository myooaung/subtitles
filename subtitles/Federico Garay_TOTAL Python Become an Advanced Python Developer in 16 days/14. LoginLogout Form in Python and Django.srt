1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:13,190
Now that we have on screen the way to see if the user is logged in or logged out, let's create the

2
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,580
forms so that the user can do this dynamically.

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,370
So on the views, we're going to create a view for this.

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,390
We're going to have to import something else.

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:35,100
We're going to import from Django contrib fourth dot views and from here we're going to import log in

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,610
view.

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,120
And now that we have imported, we're going to create a class.

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,300
It makes sense that we create this class at the top of the list because it's the gateway to all the

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:46,990
other classes.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,400
So we're going to put this class here, which is going to be called log in.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,590
It's going to inherit from log in view colon and inside it we're going to set up some parameters.

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,560
First template name.

13
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,440
This template doesn't exist yet.

14
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,000
So let's define its name now.

15
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,570
And then we must remember to give it this name.

16
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:19,030
It's going to be reached through bass, which is the name of the application slash login page HTML.

17
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,090
Let's remember that to name our template afterwards.

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,740
What fields will it have?

19
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:32,030
Well as this form comes in the login view, then it comes with several fields.

20
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,840
We want to use them all, but we do what we did before.

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,010
Inverted commas, double underscore all and close.

22
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:49,500
We're also going to set up a parameter called redirect authenticated user, which is a Boolean parameter

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,210
that determines whether or not we're going to redirect the user when they're authenticated.

24
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,190
So we want this to be true.

25
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,990
And finally through a function, we're going to rewrite the method.

26
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,020
Get success.

27
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,050
Your URL.

28
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,320
It would be the site that the user goes to once they've logged in.

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,650
We put self here and what we're going to return is a reverse lazy.

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,900
It takes us to tasks.

31
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,970
So what does this mean?

32
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,540
This is going to mean that when the user has successfully logged in, the system is going to automatically

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,630
take them to the tasks page so that they can see the content of that page and therefore they're going

34
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,060
to be able to access all the tasks.

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,180
So this is how we configure login view.

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,220
Now we have to configure the URLs to get there accordingly.

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,210
We also need to import this view that we just created, which is called log in and we need to give it

38
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,840
a path.

39
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,890
We're going to put it up here since it's central and we're going to make a path that takes us to log

40
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,310
in.

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,910
And remember, that's the name we're going to give to the page.

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,600
Then we're going to call login as view as we already know so that it can be seen as a view.

43
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,680
What name are we going to call this?

44
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:18,170
It's going to be name, same as logging, being consistent in always giving the same names.

45
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,510
So we've just created the login view URL.

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,370
Now we want to create that file here.

47
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,810
So we come to base, which is where we said we're going to get this file.

48
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,770
So new file and here we put log in HTML.

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,120
This name has to be the same as the one we put in views.

50
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,620
Otherwise there will be problems.

51
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,380
So let's create this form.

52
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,170
We do it first with ah1 tag, make a header and we're going to put log in.

53
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,050
This is what you're going to see at the top.

54
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,000
And we're going to create a form with the tags that open and close.

55
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,650
We're going to configure it to have a method equal to post.

56
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:09,350
As you know, this is because we're going to provide information and not to receive it or to search

57
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,860
for it.

58
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:17,510
And now inside the phone, we're going to protect it, as we've already learned to do with CE srf token

59
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:27,290
so that the pirates don't come and we're going to call form DOT as P and remember that this is so that

60
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,850
it is organized with a paragraph format.

61
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,560
This makes the form elements line up on top of each other.

62
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:41,060
The system will then automatically understand that form belongs to login view and we're also going to

63
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:47,390
put a button so that the user can send the information once he or she has completed all the fields.

64
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:55,490
So we create the buttons with the tag input whose type is going to be submit and its value is going

65
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,510
to be log in.

66
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,050
This is how the user is going to log in.

67
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,450
Close this input and now we have the form created.

68
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,150
We can set the destination of the link.

69
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,380
Remember that here in task list.

70
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,410
We have left these two links without completing them.

71
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:20,150
Well, now we can complete the one that corresponds to the log in, which is the one we need in case

72
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,250
the user is not authenticated.

73
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,250
Here we simply put the bracket.

74
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,570
The percentage you are l log in, which is the name of our page and close with the same sign and the

75
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,310
bracket.

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,150
And there we have it configured.

77
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,980
If we now come to our site, refresh and go to log in.

78
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,370
Now it takes me to the form that is already created.

79
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,670
In this case, it automatically loaded my data, username and password and I click on login.

80
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,450
I go back to the home, but this time I'm already logged in.

81
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:02,230
And now that we have this configured so that the user can log in from the site, we have to configure

82
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,430
the logging out to.

83
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:04,830
Here.

84
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,830
We're going to use the form provided by Django Directory.

85
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,970
We don't need to create our own view.

86
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:19,730
We come to you, Earls, and we're going to import the logout view by typing from django dot contrib

87
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:24,980
dot auth dot views import logout view.

88
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:34,330
We're going to create a path to this as well, of course, which is going to take us to log out slash

89
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,470
and we put log out view dot as view.

90
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,270
And finally the name, which is going to be consistent.

91
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,150
So it's going to be log out.

92
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:53,920
And now what I need to do is to set the value of the perimeter, which is next page, which is the attribute

93
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,020
that determines where the user is going to be sent once successfully logged out.

94
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,060
So imagine the user logs out, clicks on, log out.

95
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,970
And where is the system going to send them?

96
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,770
You should send them to the login page so that he or she can then log in again if they want to.

97
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,220
So we set this in the as view.

98
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:25,960
And here we set the parameter next page to be equal to log in, which is the name of the login page.

99
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:34,340
And now that we have a destination after clicking on logout we can come to task list HTML.

100
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,740
Because here we miss the define the destination of this log out and now we have that destination created.

101
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,800
We want our ETF takers to bracket sign.

102
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,610
You are l log out percentage and bracket again.

103
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,350
Now everything is set up.

104
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,330
Now that I am now logged in and I'm going to log out and I'm logged out.

105
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,790
And it takes me directly to the login form.

106
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,690
I can log in again and I'm now logged in.

107
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,570
Log out again and I'm logged out.

108
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,250
If I enter the page manually through the address bar skipping this login and it allows me to enter the

109
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:17,610
same.

110
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,780
Of course, this is not desirable.

111
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,300
The user should not be able to do what I just did, which is to enter this pending list without being

112
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,990
logged in.

113
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,720
And that is what we'll do in the next lesson.

114
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,910
We're going to restrict the user from seeing certain content if they're not logged in.

115
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,620
So let's do it.
