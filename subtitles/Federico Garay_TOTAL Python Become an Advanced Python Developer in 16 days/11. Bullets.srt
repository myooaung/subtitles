1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,620
So now it's time for us to make our rockets shoot bullets so as to kill its enemies.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,380
So what do we have to think about here?

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,990
If we execute this, we can see our rocket moving around and we want the bullets to come out of the

4
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,870
rocket regardless of its position on the screen.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,520
If the rockets hear, the bullet has to come out of here and if the rockets hear, the bullet has to

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,710
come out of here and so on.

7
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,550
Another fact we have to take into account is that the bullet should go off in a specific direction.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,420
That is, if the bullet comes out when the rockets here, it should keep moving in that direction and

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,580
not mimic the movements of the rocket.

10
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:53,690
So we have to make the bullets go off in a specific direction from beginning to end, and that is when

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,330
reaching the top of the screen or hitting an enemy.

12
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,780
These are the major aspects we have to think about.

13
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,150
So I already have a bullet image which I found in Flat Icon.

14
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,570
You can look for yours in any site you prefer.

15
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,790
So just like we have the player and the enemy variables, we should have the bullet variables.

16
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,660
So let's copy this and type bullet variables.

17
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,100
Bullet image.

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,110
And because we need a variable to store it in, will copy the word bullet so as to paste it in this

19
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,230
file which is named bullet p and g.

20
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,590
We'll have Bullet X Bullet.

21
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,280
Why?

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,850
Bullet X change and Bullet Y change.

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,180
So what values do we have to change here?

24
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,920
Bullet X won't be a random integer anymore, but it will be zero.

25
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,490
This doesn't do anything special because the coordinate x should change according to the rocket's position.

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,220
Bullet Y is the place where the bullet will come.

27
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,260
Out of that is the rocket.

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,950
And our rocket is set at a level of 500 pixels.

29
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,960
So that's the value we're going to enter.

30
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:07,190
Bullet X change is not the value we're going to employ because our bullets shouldn't move on the x axis,

31
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,130
so we'll leave it at zero for now.

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,130
We actually won't need this variable, but we include it so as to have a more complete code.

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,840
So bullet.

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,090
Why change would be the speed of the bullet because it represents the number of pixels the bullet will

35
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,810
move across.

36
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:30,080
In each iteration we'll enter a low number such as one, so as to be able to actually see that bullet

37
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,580
depending on whether the bullet has been shot or not.

38
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,200
We want it to be visible or invisible.

39
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,740
We shouldn't be able to see it before it is shot.

40
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,500
So we'll add one more variable.

41
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:51,200
This variable will be named visible bullet and it can be true or false that is visible or invisible.

42
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,110
This will initialize as false since the bullet won't be visible as soon as the game starts.

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,620
So we have the variable storing the information on where the bullet will be displayed when shot to shoot

44
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:03,800
it.

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,660
We'll need a function in charge of that.

46
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,930
So besides, the player and the enemy functions will create the shoot bullet function.

47
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,490
So that will be its name and it will receive two parameters a position in X and Y.

48
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,340
We should be able to see a bullet going off upwards so its value in y should decrease.

49
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,870
Now we have to access the visible bullet variable from this function.

50
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,560
To do so, we need to make this variable be global.

51
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,960
So we enter global visible bullet and now we can access that variable.

52
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,010
Now when calling the shoot bullet function, the visible bullet function will change the true and so

53
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,300
the bullet will be visible.

54
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,260
We still have to write the code that makes our bullet visible.

55
00:03:52,670 --> 00:04:00,500
So when we place our bullet in the screen by using screen bullet, which requires two values in the

56
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,290
first place, we have to enter an image which is bullet image, and in the second place we have to enter

57
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:12,740
a tuple along with its coordinates which are x and y, which will be the values we're going to pass

58
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:19,880
to it when calling this functions, since those values are the same as the ones in rocket because the

59
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,230
bullet will come out of it.

60
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,940
We need to stress a difference so that the bullet comes out of the middle of the rocket.

61
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,970
Therefore, we add plus 16 here and plus ten here.

62
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,600
We have the function in charge of creating the bullet.

63
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,810
Then we need to call this function so that the bullet occupies a different space as it moves upwards

64
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,100
in each iteration.

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,400
So let's go to the game loop to enter this call.

66
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,980
This will be the result of an event.

67
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,810
Such events will take place when the user presses the space bar.

68
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,140
So let's go to the press arrow keys, which should be named Press Keys event.

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,100
Let's make it check if the space bar has been pressed.

70
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:11,240
We write it like this and we'll check if event dot key is equal to pi.

71
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,000
Game dot k underscore space.

72
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,770
The name of the space bar.

73
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,060
When someone presses it, we'll call the shoot bullet function.

74
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,550
So what values will we pass to it?

75
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,410
Note that I will enter some things so as not to get the expected result.

76
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,470
This is so I can show you how this works.

77
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,820
Then we'll correct it.

78
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,370
We need an x value first, so let's enter the same value as in Rocket.

79
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,350
So we'll enter player x and the height will be bullet y.

80
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,270
It should appear in the right place, but we'll soon see what's the problem here.

81
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,110
We'll execute this for now in order to see what happens.

82
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,800
So our rocket's here, we move it, and then we press the space bar and nothing happens.

83
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,790
Why?

84
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,880
Because the bullet appears once in the same place.

85
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,020
And then nothing happens.

86
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,560
It disappears as there is no iteration that makes the bullet linger.

87
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,460
We should constantly press the space bar in order to see the bullet.

88
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,020
And that's not the idea.

89
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:19,790
So let's go to the code section where we manipulate the movements and we're going to add bullet movement

90
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:25,070
so that our bullet keeps appearing in each iteration and we can see it moving upwards.

91
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,200
So how do we do that?

92
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,220
Well, we'll type if it's true that bullet is visible.

93
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,980
In that case, we'll call shoot bullet.

94
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:43,040
Every time we iterate once again, we're going to enter player X as position in X and bullet y as position

95
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,730
in Y.

96
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,100
And we're going to do something else.

97
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,710
We'll make our bullet move upwards.

98
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,280
So the value of bullet y will change in each iteration.

99
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,040
Bullet Y will be equal to minus equals the value of bullet y change.

100
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,200
You may remember we entered one.

101
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,340
Here it is.

102
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,030
This means it will be lose a pixel in each iteration.

103
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,860
And that's how it's going to move upwards.

104
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,740
So let's see if we manage to make this possible.

105
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,990
Here's our rocket.

106
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,360
Let's position ourselves and shoot.

107
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,330
The bullet goes up and up.

108
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,060
Great.

109
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,040
So there is a problem.

110
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,070
I can't shoot another bullet, and I should be able to.

111
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,030
And another problem is, look at this.

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,700
If I shoot and move, the bullet mimics the movement of the rocket.

113
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,350
And that's not the idea either.

114
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,840
This bullet shouldn't change its direction.

115
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,030
Well, we're going to solve these problems in our next lesson, so don't miss out.
