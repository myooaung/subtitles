00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.690
Welcome to day 12.

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.370
Today we are going to learn how to use an indispensable tool called TK Inter.

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.680
Although some pronounce it as tachymeter, its function is nothing but to generate graphical user interfaces.

4
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.160
Yes, today we are going to be able to see our code in screen with colors, buttons, boxes and more.

5
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.660
To enter is that tool you may have been waiting to use since day one.

6
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.710
As always, we are going to learn how to use this new tool by applying it in a real world project.

7
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.360
Let's create together a restaurant manager.

8
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.170
This application will allow you to enter all the consumptions that people in a specific table at a restaurant

9
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.410
have made, along with their amounts and prices.

10
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.740
This application will allow you to get a detail of the money that corresponds to each customer.

11
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.980
It will also have a built in calculator so you can make additional calculations and it will also allow

12
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.410
you to generate a receipt with a ticket number, date and everything else, which in turn you can save

13
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.340
in a text file on your computer to print if necessary or send to Kintore is finally coming, and we

14
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.820
all are super ready to face this great challenge.

15
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.310
Let's get started right now.
