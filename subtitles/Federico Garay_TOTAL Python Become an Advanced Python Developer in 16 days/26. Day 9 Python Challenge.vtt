I'm a little tired at this point of the day, so let's do something different.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.070
Instead of explaining the details of today's project, you're going to have to find them yourself.

3
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.220
Along with this lecture, you will find a downloadable zip file, download it and save it in the same

4
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.150
folder where you're going to save your pi charm files for this project.

5
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.280
Then I want you to unzip that file to find the instructions for this project.

6
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.290
Don't cheat the ideas that you unzip that file using the code you've learned today.

7
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.390
There you will find a file called Instructions, which has everything you need to get started.

8
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.820
So let's get to work and I'll see you in a little while to show you if your solution is correct for

9
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.380
this project today.
