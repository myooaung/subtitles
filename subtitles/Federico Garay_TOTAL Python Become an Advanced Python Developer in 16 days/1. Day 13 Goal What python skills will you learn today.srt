1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,760
New Day and new project.

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,490
Today, you will end the day creating something that will surprise you.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,860
Forget Siri and Alexa today.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,840
You are going to create your own virtual assistant, a program that you can talk to.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,180
Yes, talk, not write.

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,810
And that you can ask to assist you in many tasks.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,700
You will be able to talk to your assistant and prepare it to be able to do whatever you want.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,940
The great thing is that you can not only make it capable of performing the tasks we will see today,

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,560
but you can also add as many features as your imagination is capable of developing.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:50,630
To learn how to do this, let's get to know some new libraries, such as P, sx3, which is a module

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,210
that allows Python to talk to us.

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,040
Speech recognition.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,730
The library that allows us to translate the sound of the human voice into text web browser, which enables

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,890
us to manipulate a web browser.

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,580
Pi What kit?

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,460
A tool to connect your code to many websites like YouTube, Wikipedia and more.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,690
Yahoo Finance to search for information on the stock market.

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:22,280
Pi jokes a database of jokes so your assistant will never be boring and wikipedia for everything.

19
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,490
This project is going to take you one step higher.

20
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,380
So let's start right now.
