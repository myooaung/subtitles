1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,790
Far.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,210
The most awaited moment of your first day of study has arrived.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,780
You are going to create your first solo program and you are going to do it applying everything you have

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,130
learned throughout this day.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,050
Imagine the situation.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,220
Your best friend has started a brewery and has everything ready.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,460
His product is fantastic.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,200
It has body, good flavor, good color, and just the right level of foam.

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,500
But it lacks an identity.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,990
He can't think of a name for his beer that would give it a unique and original identity.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,680
So you come to him and say, Don't worry.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,950
I'm going to create a program that will ask you two questions and then tell you what to name your beer.

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,660
It's as simple as that.

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,600
I know that in the real world, we wouldn't need to develop a software just to ask it to questions.

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,210
But until we learn a bit more functionality, well, our programs are going to have to stay in the realm

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,350
of simplicity.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,640
Yet if you're just starting out, this is going to be quite a challenge.

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,610
You're going to create Python code that asks your friend to answer two questions that require a single

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,060
word each and then displays those combined words on the screen to form a creative brand.

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,460
You can use any questions you want.

21
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,750
The idea is for the outcome to be original, creative, and even funny.

22
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:34,080
And if you want to add some difficulty to your challenge, I suggest you try to have the name of the

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,770
beer printed in quotation marks on the screen.

24
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,490
Remember that there are different ways for the print function to show the quotes without interrupting

25
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:52,080
the stream, and it's also possible to print out text in at least two lines using line breaks within

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,620
the code.

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,980
Well, try to do it on your own, and if it gets complicated, don't worry, we will solve it together

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,570
in the next lecture.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,370
Cheers and good luck.
