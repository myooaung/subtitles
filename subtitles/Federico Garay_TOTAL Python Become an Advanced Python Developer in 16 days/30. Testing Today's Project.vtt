00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:16.580
After creating an elaborate program like this, it comes as a necessary part to do testing and bug fixing.

2
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.610
In this lecture, we are going to start running the code and testing its various different alternatives.

3
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.670
It is likely that we will encounter some errors and need to adjust the details of our code so we cannot

4
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.780
skip this part.

5
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.040
Let's get on with it and we're almost done for the final stage.

6
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.420
So we'll see you in Pi Charm.

7
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.760
And now for the long awaited moment has come.

8
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.190
We will see how our program works properly.

9
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.800
We have worked a lot and we have written a lot and now we are going to put all the machinery in motion.

10
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.090
To begin with, I must modify something in Python called configuration.

11
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.530
Remember that for system cells works as we expect.

12
00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.910
We have to go to run then to debug, to edit configurations and finally we set here in this window that

13
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.930
emulate terminal is activated so that the console can be cleaned.

14
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.460
If you don't have it activated, do it then click on play.

15
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.470
I already had it activated.

16
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.240
Now if we're going to execute it inside, run and we choose our file.

17
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.380
My recipes.

18
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.260
So our first screen welcomes us and tells us that the recipes are where they're supposed to be and that

19
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.750
the total number of recipes is eight.

20
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.010
We then have our option menu containing six options.

21
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.150
So let's start with an incorrect option to see if it works as it should.

22
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.370
Type in a letter here.

23
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.970
The letter Q and it tells me again, choose an option.

24
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.160
This seems to work fine.

25
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.630
Let's choose an option.

26
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.530
That is correct.

27
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.850
Such as one.

28
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.070
And it shows me that the options again.

29
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.840
So something is wrong here.

30
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.630
Remember that it is normal if the first test of such long programs have some errors.

31
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.850
If when I type in that letter, it shows me again the same menu.

32
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.350
That means that there is something wrong with the output of the while loop.

33
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.000
So let's pay attention here.

34
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:14.880
We have said that as long as the menu choice is not numeric or the integer of menu, choice is not within

35
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.740
a range of 1 to 6.

36
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.190
It should enter the loop and in fact it does enter the loop, but we're not being able to do it.

37
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.210
It's stop it from repeating the loop.

38
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.070
Let's move on.

39
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.170
Menu choice then becomes the user's input and then it returns.

40
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.140
Menu choice.

41
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.420
Of course, this seems to be the cause.

42
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.160
The problem we have here is the user's choice is an input, which, as we know, are strings, and we

43
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.110
need to process it as an integer.

44
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.520
Otherwise we're never going to get all the conditions for the while confirmed.

45
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.680
So here we have a method, something which is to make menu choice to be casted with an integer.

46
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.200
Let's see if it works right.

47
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.960
We stop the execution and start over.

48
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.920
Okay.

49
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.350
It seems to work fine.

50
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.980
So here we have our welcome.

51
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.660
We have everything as it was.

52
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.040
If we type A wrong letter like Q, it tells us choose an option.

53
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.210
If we put in a number that is not inside the menu like nine.

54
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.220
It asks us to choose an option again.

55
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.430
So now I'm going to choose option number one.

56
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.270
And I have entered the categories which I did not do before.

57
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.150
So let's choose the first one, which is meat.

58
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.530
Then it reads recipes and shows me that there are two recipes in that folder.

59
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.790
I'm so hungry.

60
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.650
Let's choose option two.

61
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.500
This is to read a recipe and when we put two, it shows me that the content that I've stored in that

62
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.160
recipe, because what I've stored inside each recipe we can open.

63
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.960
This one, for example, is nothing more than a text to verify if I'm reading it right.

64
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.280
So now it tells me to press B to go back to the menu.

65
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.120
I'm going to press Q and it's going to tell me the same again.

66
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.270
I press 45 and it happens again.

67
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.010
Now I press B in lowercase and it takes me correctly to the beginning.

68
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.610
So far, read recipe works fine.

69
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.110
So let's choose now.

70
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.420
Create new recipe with two.

71
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.520
We choose a category.

72
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.900
I choose three.

73
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.670
So far so good.

74
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.090
It says, Write the name of your recipe.

75
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.020
My recipe is going to be, for example, mashed potatoes.

76
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.610
Then we need to type inside.

77
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.800
This is the recipe for mashed potatoes and it notifies me your recipe.

78
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.620
Mashed potatoes text has been created.

79
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.700
And yes, as a matter of fact, I come inside here.

80
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.320
And where did I store it?

81
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.660
Oh, in pasta.

82
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.950
Okay, it's not pasta.

83
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.980
But anyway, now I have a new recipe.

84
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.230
Mashed potatoes.

85
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.830
Whose content is this?

86
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.810
Is the recipe for mashed potatoes.

87
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.900
My program has been able to create a file that is now in the real world, or so to speak, in my folder

88
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.770
directory.

89
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.770
This time we type B but capitalized to return and we see that it works fine because we set lower as

90
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.460
the method.

91
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.970
Let's see what happens with the third option, which is create new category.

92
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.160
So we type in three, ask me to write the name of the new category.

93
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.510
My new category is going to be called entries.

94
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.080
It says Your new category entries has been created.

95
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.470
We can see here inside recipes.

96
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.580
Entries is a new category which is of course empty.

97
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:45.830
So we go back to our program and we put B to return and now we choose option four, which is to delete

98
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.610
a recipe.

99
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.670
So I would delete mashed potatoes and go to pasta number four.

100
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.740
And here we have our mashed potatoes.

101
00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.530
Our menu changes the number of categories or recipes automatically according to the number of elements

102
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.480
that it finds in each category.

103
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.500
So here we're going to eliminate two, which is mashed potatoes.

104
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.790
It tells me the recipe mashed potatoes has been deleted, and if I take a look at my folder, we go

105
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.480
back to pasta and we no longer have mashed potatoes.

106
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:24.320
B Again to return and let's focus on option number five, which is delete category.

107
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.980
And I would delete the option that I just created, which is entries.

108
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.400
It notifies me that it has been deleted.

109
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.790
So I'll check by going to the folder and seeing that I no longer have that fifth category here, which

110
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.690
was entries.

111
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.210
So I'm changing my menu accordingly.

112
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.410
And the last option was to exit the program option six.

113
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.910
So we put six and we have finished the execution of our code.

114
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.490
So don't worry, if you find that there are problems in your code, you look for them and solve them

115
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.490
and you do whatever it takes and you're going to get it done.

116
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.800
So congratulations.

117
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.160
We have succeeded in developing a completely new program that is part of everyday life, so we're one

118
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.190
more step closer to becoming expert programmers.

119
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.360
So congratulate yourself and let's have a rest.

120
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.280
So it's been a long day and let's switch off and call it a day together.

121
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.950
So I'll see you in the next lesson.
