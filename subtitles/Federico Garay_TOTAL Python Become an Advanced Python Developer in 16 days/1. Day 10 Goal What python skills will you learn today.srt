00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,280
Welcome to Day ten.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,570
It's a very special one because as of today, your beginner stage is over.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,620
Considering everything you have learned so far, we can say you have learned all the basics of Python

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,250
programming.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,790
So we can also say you already know how to program.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,310
And what you need to know now is to practice and expand your knowledge to know how to apply what you

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,690
have learned in different applications that Python has in the real world.

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,750
From now on, you have to apply the knowledge you already have in different uses programming games with

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,590
graphical interfaces, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, web development,

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,920
interactive graphics, integration to social networks, blockchain, facial recognition, and much,

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,030
much more.

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,440
All of that starts today.

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,520
Also, since you are no longer a beginner, we are going to change our work methodology from today.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,790
Our lectures will be more dynamic and we will develop together the project of the day as we learn new

15
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,600
concepts.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,440
Today, we are going to start with one of the most requested topics.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,550
You are going to program this game in Python learning how to work with a very special library called

18
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,970
Pi.

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,750
Game through PI Game, you will learn to create a game screen and characters assign them images and

20
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,500
movements.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,670
Program What happens when the elements come in contact?

22
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,760
For example, when a shot hits an enemy, you will also learn to calculate the score, to define the

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,960
background, to program the end of the game, and even to add sounds.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,810
And since we are going to exclusively dedicate this day to program the game with PI game, we are not

25
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,560
going to focus too much on the principles of the OP.

26
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,530
For instance, characters are not going to be in separate classes, nor are we going to apply inheritance,

27
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,910
which we could do.

28
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,880
But in order to concentrate on PI game, we are going to write a rather simple code.

29
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,050
I'm sure you're anxious and excited to get started, so I'm not going to take up any more of your time.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,920
We'll see you inside Pi Charm.
