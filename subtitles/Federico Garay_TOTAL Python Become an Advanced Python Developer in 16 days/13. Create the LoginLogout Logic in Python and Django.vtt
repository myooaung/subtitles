00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.320
In this lesson, we're going to learn how to make the logic for our site to have a log in and log out

2
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.980
system.

3
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.250
If we do this, the user will be able to log in with their username and password and then log out if

4
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.910
they wish.

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.910
This will cause the data not to be visible on the screen unless we are logged in as users.

6
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.560
Then we need to add a condition which checks if the user is logged in and if not provide a link to log

7
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.070
them in.

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.290
Up here, for example, there should be a link that says login or something like that.

9
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.100
And in case the user is already logged in, what we have to show on the screen at the top is the user's

10
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.980
name and a button to give them the option to log out.

11
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.920
So we're going to go to our task list, HTML file, which is the one that represents this page we're

12
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.910
looking at here.

13
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.310
And we're going to leave some space at the top because this is where we want to put these elements first.

14
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.960
We're going to put a paragraph.

15
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.660
We're going to do this with the P tag.

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.830
And in this tag we're going to call with the double square brackets, request, dot user, and underneath

17
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.640
we're going to generate a h r tag which serves to create a horizontal bar, i.e. a kind of separator.

18
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.760
And now let's try to understand the logic of this block.

19
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.540
Where is this user going to be requested from?

20
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.870
Well, remember that I'm now logged in as the site administrator and therefore the site already has

21
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.520
a username assigned to me.

22
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.650
We are now logged out as administrators and the site has our username.

23
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.580
So now if I refresh here, here it says window ten, which is my username and the horizontal bar.

24
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.430
If I now go to admin, let's open a new window and let's open the admin page.

25
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.780
You can see that here.

26
00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.290
I can log out with this log out, but I'm not going to log out from here because I'm going to take the

27
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.130
opportunity to show you how the machine sees it from the code.

28
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.000
So let's go to inspect and from here I'll go to application and once here let's look for the cookies.

29
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.670
In the cookies we see the URL of the site and now we see that a session ID has been generated here,

30
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.490
which is the one that has this information.

31
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.600
So if I delete this now, the site no longer has this information.

32
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.590
So let's close, inspect, refresh again.

33
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.340
And I now appear as an anonymous user, meaning that I need to provide my data if I want to recognize

34
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.790
me.

35
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:48.040
So let's refresh this admin and let's log back in and let's refresh again and I appear as Win ten again.

36
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:55.120
But for the purposes of this exercise, I want to log in so I can show how we make this happen programmatically

37
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.320
and not from the admin page since the end user will not have access to it.

38
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.280
So let's come back to the pie chart and inside the same file.

39
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.330
I'm going to put this P tag inside and if to verify the condition we mentioned before.

40
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.690
So how do we put an F inside Django with the square brackets with percentage and here we put if request

41
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.550
user until we apply the property is authenticated.

42
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.920
And now we put the P here with a tab so that the requested user is only displayed if the condition that

43
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.130
there is is an authenticated user is met.

44
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.990
And here we also going to make it so that there is a registered user.

45
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.480
You can see a link with the label A that allows us to log out.

46
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.110
That is to say with this, we give him the possibility that if he's already logged in, he can log out.

47
00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.660
And this link will send us with the h ref to a URL that we have yet to develop.

48
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.450
So for now we leave it empty and then we're going to establish that in case you are not logged in for

49
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.390
which we put brackets sign and else.

50
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.630
In that case, we're going to show him a label that says log in so that he clicks here and can log in.

51
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.050
So where is this tag going to take him?

52
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.700
Well, to ref and we've got to build this URL as well.

53
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.740
So we'll leave it like this for now.

54
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.270
And remember that once we finish and if in Django we have to add the end if and we're all set.

55
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.770
So I go back to my place, I refresh it, and I'm not logged in.

56
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.270
It says, Log in.

57
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.770
If I click here, it won't take me anywhere because I haven't built that yet.

58
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.330
But I'm going to log in here as an administrator and now I'm logged in.

59
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.660
I can see it, says Winton, and the option to log out.

60
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.630
So we need to create a form that appears after clicking on log in so that the user can enter his log

61
00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.740
in details there.

62
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.740
And that's what we're going to do in the next lesson.

63
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.210
So let's get going.
