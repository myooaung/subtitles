00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.530
I know you're eager to start programming, but just give me a minute so I can explain why Python is

2
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.200
the best programming language you can learn and how we're going to make it super easy for you to learn

3
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.070
in this class.

4
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:27.420
The main advantage is that Python is classified as a high level language, and this means that its instructions

5
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.660
are close as possible to human language, which makes it easier to learn and ideal for people who are

6
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.120
just starting out in the world of programming.

7
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.880
However, just because it is easier to learn does not mean that it is less powerful.

8
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.380
Quite the opposite.

9
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.650
In Python you can perform tasks with a few lines of code while in other programming languages.

10
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.690
This would take hundreds of lines.

11
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.570
This enables your productivity to go up.

12
00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.750
On the other hand, it is one of the most versatile programming languages that exists and can be used

13
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.310
in a variety of fields.

14
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.880
In other words, it allows you to program from video games to websites and mobile applications and much,

15
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.510
much more.

16
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.660
In addition to all this, there is a large community behind Python, which means that there are a multitude

17
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.530
of libraries.

18
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.060
This would mean blocks of code that are available for you to use in your programs to do almost anything.

19
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.000
This means you can take them and solve more complex issues that are not relevant to your project.

20
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.610
You simply use the libraries and move on.

21
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.300
As I told you, Python was created to make its code readable, to be as close as possible to the human

22
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.930
language.

23
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.130
That's why I will help you learn it smoothly and to make it feel natural, like having a daily conversation.

24
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.190
But with your machine, then writing or reading Python will be something super logical and understandable

25
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.990
for you at the end of this course.

26
00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.840
I hope you are ready and as motivated as I am, because in the next few minutes you will actually begin

27
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.790
programming.
