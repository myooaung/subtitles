00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.330
So are you ready to add music and sound effects to our game?

2
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.150
I hope you are, because we're going to do it anyway.

3
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.220
So I've already added, along with the rest of the files, three sound files.

4
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.620
One is background, underscore music dot MP three and another one is Punch MP three, which is the one

5
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.540
we'll hear when killing an enemy.

6
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.070
And the other one is shot at MP three, which will sound when we shoot.

7
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.840
So these files were downloaded from the Internet, from free websites.

8
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.340
So once we have these three files in our folder, we'll do something quite simple.

9
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.280
First, we have to import something from pi game.

10
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.070
So from pi.

11
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.480
Game.

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.680
Import mixer.

13
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.250
Mixer is a tool that allows us to work with sounds.

14
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.650
So let's add the background music.

15
00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.200
We'll write add music and call mixer, dot, music, load.

16
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.450
And here we have to write the file name.

17
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.680
In my case, it's background underscore music in order to play it.

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.020
We just use mixer music play and that should be enough.

19
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.460
However, it is background music, so it should play on loop.

20
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.880
To do so, we'll put minus one in brackets.

21
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.150
Minus one means it will play again once it ends.

22
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.210
So let's execute it to test it.

23
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.440
And here you have it.

24
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.940
It's sort of mysterious, but I think it's also a bit loud.

25
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.260
So if we want to turn it down, we can just put before play mixer, dot music, dot set volume.

26
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.350
And here we enter a number from 0 to 1.

27
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.660
Let's put 0.5, which is the half of what I entered before.

28
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.650
Well, it hasn't changed much, so let's try 0.3.

29
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.260
So we have our music.

30
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.600
Now it's time to add sound effects.

31
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.240
Let's do the shoot sound.

32
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.920
And place it.

33
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.960
After the call to the space event, we'll call Mixer Sound note that the capital S and we upload the

34
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.070
file we want.

35
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.310
In this case it's titled Shot Dot MP three.

36
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.540
Now we store it in a variable so as to invoke it from there.

37
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:29.410
So Bullet Sound is mixer sound shot MP three Now we execute it through bullet sound play and that's

38
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.830
it.

39
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.810
Let's check if it works.

40
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.670
Let's shoot.

41
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.480
Perfect.

42
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.640
That's a cool effect.

43
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.160
I like it.

44
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.630
So maybe it is a bit loud as well so you can adjust the volume.

45
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.320
Now we need the sound of the bullet hitting the enemy.

46
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.890
So let's look now for the collisions in our code over here.

47
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.020
If there's a collision, we'll make a collision sound, which is equal to Mixer Sound Capital S and

48
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:04.050
its title, which in this case is Punch MP three and Collision Sound Play so that it's executed.

49
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.260
So now when killing an enemy, we should be able to hear it.

50
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.990
Let's see.

51
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.550
Well, that's an interesting.

52
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.360
Okay, let's continue with our last lesson.

53
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.180
We have to program the end of our game.
