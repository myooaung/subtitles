1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,250
In this lesson, we're going to configure another important detail for our assistant, which is a greeting

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,560
to us every time we start to work.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,660
So our code will have this section to create initial greeting and the function this has will call initial

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,720
greeting and it won't need any parameters.

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,100
And the first thing we're going to do is make our function, say, a greeting.

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,790
This is as straightforward as calling the function speak.

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,850
And we put something like, Hello, I am Hazel or whatever name you'd like to give your assistant,

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,160
your personal assistant, and they could greet you with your name if you like.

9
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,840
So later we can make them say, How can I help you?

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,450
Now we can make the call to initial greeting and they say to us, Hello, I am Hazel, how can I help

11
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:00,900
you?

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,550
And it's that easy.

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,980
A quick lesson is never a bad thing.

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,870
So we will leave it here for now.

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,790
And in the next three lessons, we shall make our assistant do a little bit of everything.

16
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,650
So don't go anywhere.
