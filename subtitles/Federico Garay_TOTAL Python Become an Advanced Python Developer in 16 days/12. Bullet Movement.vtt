00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.470
So we have two problems that need solving.

2
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.440
One, that we can only shoot one bullet.

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.960
And the other problem is that the bullet changes its direction according to the movement of the rocket,

4
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.610
and that shouldn't happen.

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.340
So let's fix this right now.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.420
The first problem stems from this look.

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.690
I'm going to shoot one bullet and the bullet subtracts values from coordinate y until it reaches zero.

8
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.300
But although we don't see it, that bullet is still there and it keeps on subtracting values.

9
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.780
Since the bullet is still there, we can't shoot again.

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.590
And after it vanishes, we need this bullet to reset itself so as to execute it and use it again.

11
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.960
So what we need to do is quite easy.

12
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.310
Let's scroll down until we reach this verification here.

13
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.780
If the bullet is visible, all this happens.

14
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.850
But we have to verify something else.

15
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.660
If bullet y that is coordinate y of bullet is lower than or equal to zero.

16
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.890
In fact, we could enter -64 instead of zero because our bullet is 64 pixels high.

17
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.280
So when the bullet disappears, not when it touches the edge, but when it disappears, we'll need to

18
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.480
do the following.

19
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.210
We'll reset its position.

20
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.090
Bullet Y will be 500 again, which is the level at which our rocket is located.

21
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.340
And visible bullet will be false.

22
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.230
So it will stop being visible.

23
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.240
And it's going to remain that way.

24
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.070
So now we're able to shoot more than one bullet piece of cake, right?

25
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.830
So let's go back here and shoot.

26
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.600
And there goes our bullet now.

27
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.300
Let's shoot again and again.

28
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.280
And we made it.

29
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.070
Our bullets are still mimicking the movements of the rocket, but at least we can shoot several times.

30
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.030
And that's great.

31
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.130
So the second problem arose because here, when we created the space bar event, we used Player X,

32
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.640
the position of our rocket as initial value for the bullet.

33
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.150
Our bullet has to start from the same position as the rocket.

34
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.940
But in order for these two variables not to depend on each other, we're going to make bullet x, which

35
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.470
is a variable we haven't used until now be equal to player x and we'll enter the same value bullet x

36
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.840
to replace player x here.

37
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.200
Now these two variables have been separated.

38
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.620
Now we're calling Bullet X instead of Player X to make our bullet appear for the first time.

39
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.130
But we're using a different variable now that we don't use Player X, we'll position ourselves where

40
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.640
we call the movement of the bullet and we'll call Bullet X, which is no longer linked to the position

41
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.540
of the rocket.

42
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.460
This should do the trick.

43
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.780
So let's execute our window again and we'll shoot and move.

44
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.270
Note that the bullet goes off in a specific direction without mimicking the movements of the rocket.

45
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.870
Even though the rocket moves, the bullet doesn't change its direction.

46
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.340
But a new problem has occurred.

47
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.350
Look at this.

48
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.170
I'll shoot and then press the spacebar.

49
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.880
This modifies the position of the bullet on the screen.

50
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.880
It moves upwards, and if I press the spacebar, it changes its position, which shouldn't happen.

51
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.860
We have to make sure that the space event we generated here only makes changes to the bullet when visible

52
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.030
bullet is false.

53
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.430
This is because if visible bullet is true, it resets the bullet position when visible.

54
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.960
And that's not the idea.

55
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.020
So how do we make sure of that?

56
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.250
Well, before creating the bullet here, we're going to ask if visible bullet is equal to false.

57
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.140
And let's indent this so as to see it inside the F clause.

58
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.290
So these changes which are made by the space bar event will be produced if visible bullet is false.

59
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.960
Well, this is unnecessary.

60
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.130
We don't need to enter visible bullet equals false, but we can simplify it by writing, if not visible

61
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.670
bullet.

62
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.580
So let's execute our game and I'll press the space bar while the bullet goes upwards.

63
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.040
A note that there are no changes.

64
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.410
The Space Bar event makes changes only when visible bullet is false.

65
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.600
That is when the bullet disappears.

66
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.830
So our bullet is ready to.

67
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.120
Now we have to write code for the crashes.

68
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.430
That is when our bullet hits an enemy or when our enemy collide with us.

69
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.880
So we're going to do that in our next lesson.
