00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.220
Welcome to day eight of your Python program or training.

2
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.920
I'm so excited today because we are going to see a lot of tools and strategies that are going to be

3
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.090
very useful for your development in this interesting profession.

4
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.550
At the end of the day, you will be able to create a program that will allow a store owner to organize

5
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.400
the shifts to serve their customers.

6
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.820
All those things to everything you will learn today.

7
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.480
This program will be like a ticket vending machine that asks the customers which area of the store they

8
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.500
want to go to.

9
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.230
And the system will assign them shifts, remembering the last number assigned to each area.

10
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.810
This program may seem simple at first glance, and you may think you can easily create this by using

11
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.840
all of the knowledge you already have.

12
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.580
But the progress we make today will allow you to create this program in a super efficient, economical

13
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.820
dynamic and above all, professional way.

14
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.000
In fact, I think that's the key to today's lecture.

15
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.810
To take the step towards being a more professional programmer.

16
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.450
Because as you go through today's lessons, you will learn how to install packages, how to create your

17
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.110
own modules and code packages, how to anticipate errors that may be generated within your code or by

18
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.850
the end users misuse, thus preventing your program from crashing.

19
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.240
How to find errors in your code thanks to the pilot library and how to improve your code with the Integrated

20
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.740
Unit Test Library.

21
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.800
Finally, I will explain two very important tools in the development of professional code, which are

22
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.720
decorators and generators.

23
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.820
Taking all this into account, you will be ready to create code in a way that will be totally new to

24
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.000
you.

25
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.580
At the end of the day, I won't slow you down any longer.

26
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.550
So let's go to the next lecture together right now.
