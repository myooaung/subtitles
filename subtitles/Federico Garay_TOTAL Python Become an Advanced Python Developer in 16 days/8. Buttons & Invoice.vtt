00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.010
So we're still improving the appearance of our invoice system.

2
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.950
Remember that our right panel is still empty.

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.140
We have to add three more elements.

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.260
The calculator will be on the top sector.

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.430
The check will be on the middle and the buttons will be on the bottom sector.

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.430
So let's do this from the bottom to the top.

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.240
We're going to add the buttons and the space for the ticket.

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.950
So let's close this and go down here where we left off.

9
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.550
We're going to clarify that will begin to create the buttons.

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.190
So since we're going to do that, using a loop will add the names of the buttons to a list.

11
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.070
Our buttons list will have four buttons.

12
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.140
The first one is total.

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.940
The second one is invoice.

14
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.330
The third one is save, and the fourth one is reset.

15
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.230
We're going to program their function soon, so let's start a loop that will place them on different

16
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.010
columns.

17
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.700
The row location is not necessary as the buttons will be at the same level that is row zero.

18
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.810
Let's create a counter named column which will be equal to zero so that it increases a value as we move

19
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.500
forward.

20
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.930
Let's create a loop for each button in buttons, which is our list.

21
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.630
The software will add the button class with capital B to each button.

22
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.540
The button class is a t k enter element that we will get to know now.

23
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.290
Button is an element that contains parameters, of course.

24
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.780
Where will our buttons be?

25
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.060
You're right.

26
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.870
They'll be in button panel.

27
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.560
What text will each of them contain?

28
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.010
We're going to create a different text for each one, which will be equal to button title.

29
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.040
That is whatever text they have as title.

30
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.850
In addition, we're going to add font, which is doses size 14 and bold.

31
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.950
Foreground will be white.

32
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.820
Background will be as or for its edge will be one and its width will be nine.

33
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.600
So we've created our buttons inside the same loop.

34
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.430
Now we have to place those buttons and we'll do that inside our loop.

35
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.000
Make sure to indent everything correctly.

36
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.560
And now let's call button grid, which will let us place the button inside the grid and we'll make it

37
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.220
place the buttons in row zero, but in different columns.

38
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.150
So the value of column will be equal to column the variable we created up here, which will initialize

39
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.960
at zero.

40
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.680
However, once we get out of here, but staying within the loop, that column will change to plus equals

41
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.740
one so that it increases a value and place the buttons in different sectors.

42
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.510
So let's test this.

43
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.500
Here we can see that our buttons are placed like this for now.

44
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.440
This will change once we add the missing elements.

45
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.520
The button panel is in the middle since the other panels don't contain anything.

46
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.590
That's why we see them like this.

47
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.550
These white lines are the two panels piled up.

48
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.860
So we have created the total, the invoice save and reset buttons which are in the right place but lack

49
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.500
function.

50
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.440
They will perform functions soon.

51
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.990
Now we're going to add the check panel.

52
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.200
So let's create the space for invoice area, which will have a variable named invoice text.

53
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.860
This will be a text variable.

54
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.660
It will be on the invoice panel and we'll have dosis as a font.

55
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.540
Its size will be 12 and bold.

56
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.340
Its edge will be one.

57
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.750
Width will be 42 and height will be ten.

58
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.040
That should work.

59
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.360
So where are we going to place our invoice text?

60
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.040
We'll place it in invoice panel, of course.

61
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.570
But in which part?

62
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.650
Invoice.

63
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.120
Text, dot grid.

64
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:10.110
And it will be placed in row zero and column zero because there aren't other elements inside this panel.

65
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.240
So if we execute it, we'll see a blank space that corresponds to the check and then we have our buttons.

66
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.100
This is all for now.

67
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.740
There's one element missing, and once we add it, we'll be able to see the functions performed by this.

68
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.880
In the next lesson, we're going to create a calculator for the right panel.
