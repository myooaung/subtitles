00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.210
Welcome to day 11.

2
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.280
Today we are going to work on a web scraping project.

3
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.310
Web scraping means scraping the Internet.

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.250
The meaning of this expression refers to the fact that we use web scraping to go through website code

5
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.160
and get information from there, just as someone scrapes the surface and gets some particles from it.

6
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.170
And what can we get from a website?

7
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.770
Information, images, graphics, and much more?

8
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.440
Web scraping consists of techniques that allow you to automate that data collection when you need to

9
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.830
take information from a website to use in your projects.

10
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.370
Entering a website and manually copying and pasting information by yourself would take a lot of time

11
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.650
if it was something you had to do frequently.

12
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.430
So today we will learn how to use Python in a couple of extra libraries to perform web scraping tasks,

13
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.060
such as downloading images and other elements from a website.

14
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.420
Today's project is going to allow us to enter the website of an online bookstore and automatically create

15
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.370
a list of all the books that have a rating equal to or higher than four stars.

16
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.460
This program would allow us to build this list just by running code, and it doesn't matter if the book

17
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.340
ratings change with our code, we will be able to rebuild the correct list every day at the push of

18
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.850
a button.

19
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.620
There's a lot to learn, and I don't want you to miss out on anything from this interesting world of

20
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.550
web scraping.

21
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.140
So let's get to it right away.
