1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,950
So now that we know how to print the details of all the books contained in a page, we're going to convert

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,840
this to a list so as to analyze each of its elements and get to the rating.

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,160
So we're going to convert this, which is a print so far to a variable named books, because it will

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,030
contain all the books since there will be all the class product.

5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,360
If we print books.

6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,800
Well we obtain the same but in list format.

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,850
So let's take the first element and create an example which will be equal to books and it's index zero.

8
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,580
So we obtain the first of its elements.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,970
Let's print example and here we have the first book and all the information corresponding to each of

10
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,560
its elements which are in class product pod.

11
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,070
But what do we need to know here?

12
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,720
We need to check if this book has the number of stars that we want.

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,510
So we're going to make a selection.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,330
We're going to make example select class star rating three.

15
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:17,240
Since this book is rated three, stars will enter that name to see if we obtain the information we need.

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,150
So let's execute.

17
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,920
And here's the element we need.

18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,770
So this is how we make a selection that verifies whether the list contains an element or not.

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,060
If we searched for a four star book, we'd get an empty list.

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,020
Therefore, if we get an empty list, we don't want the title.

21
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,940
And if that list contains an element, then we will take the title.

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,170
So let's figure out how to obtain the title of this book.

23
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:51,980
Let's print books again so as to have all the books on the screen and see where we're going to find

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,820
that title.

25
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,820
So it pops up several times.

26
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,170
The title appears on the first tag, the one corresponding to the cover of the book.

27
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,470
And if we go back to the website, we'll see the book and this image that contains some data in its

28
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,740
code, which includes a reference to the title.

29
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:18,320
Well, we don't exactly want this, but if we scroll down, we have this H three tag followed by A and

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,660
the title which is in title.

31
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,880
That's what we want to reach.

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,770
So how do we get that?

33
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,730
Let's go back to our selection and instead of selecting star rating for the stars, we're going to look

34
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,360
for the attack and we have to begin there.

35
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,790
So let's type print example and execute this.

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,240
So we obtain the list containing the A element and it contains a comma and another a element.

37
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,070
So it has two a tags which correspond to the cover and the title.

38
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,020
We want the latter.

39
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,370
So we're going to ask for index one, which is the second element.

40
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,360
Let's execute this once more and here we have our precious tag.

41
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:12,110
Now we have to look for our title so as to obtain a light in the Attic, which is the first book.

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,640
So remember that we can use these objects, the tag type ones as dictionaries, so we can call the keyword

43
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,990
title and execute it and we'll see that title on the screen.

44
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,720
That's how we get to the title.

45
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,810
To sum up, we now know how to identify the rating of a book and how to take its title.

46
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,350
So now that we're able to obtain those features, we only need to combine them in a full loop that iterates

47
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:46,490
over all the pages, check all the books of each page verifies if those books are rated four or five

48
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:53,090
stars, which is our special rule and if the condition is met, takes the title of those books.

49
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,940
So let's do that in our next lesson.
