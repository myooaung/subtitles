00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.110
This was a tough one.

2
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.580
And you've learned a lot of things no matter what, whether you succeeded or not.

3
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.020
And that's what matters.

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.530
If you succeeded, remember that what you will see now may be different from your solution, since ours

5
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.420
is not the only one possible.

6
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.630
As long as your program works, that is fine.

7
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.200
Come with us to the code and let's design our number.

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.040
Guessing game.

9
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.940
Let's program a game between you and me.

10
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.520
This is what I like the most.

11
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.430
So let's go inside our project the day before.

12
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.340
We have to create here a file that is going to serve us to have the game and that I will call guess

13
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.200
the number dot p and now we can start the code.

14
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.150
So let's close here and let's start by first importing from the random library where we're going to

15
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.530
import rand.

16
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.310
INT is the only thing we're going to need here.

17
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.190
So we're going to need to import the whole library.

18
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.490
Then we need to define the variables.

19
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.500
And I think in this game the most important variables are guess which is the variable that's going to

20
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.580
keep track of how many attempts the user has made, starting from zero.

21
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.710
Then we're going to have another variable which is going to be called secret number, and it is the

22
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.890
one that is going to store the number that the computer has thought of.

23
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.580
Therefore, the value that this variable is going to have has to be a random value.

24
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.150
And here random comes into play.

25
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.190
Which will choose a number between one and 100.

26
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.010
Then we will see if it is too much or too little.

27
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.580
Maybe eight attempts is too little for so many numbers.

28
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.740
We will see that with the dynamics.

29
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.490
A third variable will be estimation.

30
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.690
And here I want to store what the users say when we tries to guess so we can compare it with the secret

31
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.230
number.

32
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.100
This variable will start with its value equal to zero.

33
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.290
And finally, a fourth variable where we will store the name of the user.

34
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.180
And this is where the game will begin, because in name I'm going to store an input and this input is

35
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.700
going to ask the user to tell me your name, colon space.

36
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.590
And here the user is going to tell us who he is.

37
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.430
Then I can give him the command along with his name.

38
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.990
We're going to print a little string that is going to say, okay.

39
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.090
And his name, comma.

40
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.930
And it says, I have thought of a number between one and 100.

41
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.010
And here we could make a line break so that the line below it says you have eight guesses to guess.

42
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.870
Just a funny way to say it.

43
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.700
And here we're not going to ask the user to start guessing yet because we're going to leave that for

44
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.240
the while loop where we're going to place the dynamics of the game.

45
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.580
Here.

46
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.800
We just throw away what this game is about.

47
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.660
And here comes the loop then, which is going to be a while.

48
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.560
Why a while and not a four?

49
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.840
Because the while loop is repeated as many times as necessary according to the dynamics of the game.

50
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.020
In this case, as many times as attempts we have.

51
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.890
So we need a loop that stops once either the eight tries elapse or when the user guesses, and the while

52
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.760
will be fine.

53
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.790
So we're going to say then while the value of guess is lower than eight, which is the total we've allowed

54
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.950
the user to have before the game is over.

55
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.140
What are we going to do here?

56
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.170
Well, we're going to rewrite estimated to be equal to an input from the user.

57
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.060
And this input is going to contain what the user answers when we ask what is the number?

58
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.150
Question mark, colon space and this is going to be stored in estimated.

59
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.020
But keep in mind that what's going to be stored here is a string and I want to have an integer because

60
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.310
I need to make numeric comparisons to see if the user has guessed right.

61
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.400
So we're going to do it with a casting here and we're going to put everything that the user enters inside

62
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.120
and int.

63
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.960
And what calculations do we need to do now?

64
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.140
So we're going to evaluate whether the number is greater than less than or equal to the secret number

65
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.810
that the program has thought of before the loop started.

66
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.870
Also, we need to make the guess counter.

67
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.560
Add one more number because we are already inside the first guess.

68
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.250
So guess is now going to be plus equal one.

69
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.150
It means that it is going to add one to whatever it already has.

70
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.300
Now let's start with the if logics.

71
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.390
That is, we start asking ourselves if the estimation is, for example, lower than the secret number.

72
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.570
In that case, we have to give the user more information.

73
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.160
We have to say, my number is higher, and we have to look at another possibility that the user has

74
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.130
given an estimate that is actually higher than the secret number.

75
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.550
Elif This is the case.

76
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.860
Estimation is higher than the secret number.

77
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.860
The message will be similar but different.

78
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.510
My number is lower because we have thrown a higher number than that one.

79
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.680
And a third possibility is that we got it right.

80
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.950
So the else and we don't need to write any logic because the only possibility here is the number is

81
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.680
equal to the second one, then colon.

82
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.530
And we need to print a sincere congratulations.

83
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.470
So we're going to put congratulations and his name.

84
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.430
I'm going to take advantage that we have at stored exclamation point.

85
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.650
And here we're going to let him know how many guesses it took him.

86
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.880
So we'll say you have guessed in we call the variable guess, which is the one that contains that information

87
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.250
and we complete with the word attempts to close the sense of the sentence here.

88
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.370
We have already arrived at the different points of the program then in these two previous if an ELIF

89
00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.870
because what it does after printing is to restart the loop as long as we are still within the eight

90
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.560
attempts.

91
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.080
But in this case, we don't want it to start the loop again and ask again what the number is.

92
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.130
We wanted to exit the loop, so we're going to put a brake keyword.

93
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.680
If you remember, this word escapes the actual iteration and also the loop in general.

94
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.410
So we're out of here.

95
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.930
We can go back to the initial line of the script and we're going to put a final if, because at this

96
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.300
point of the code, we're in a situation where we could have come out of the loop for two reasons.

97
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.100
A because we guess the number and we won in this case, the code is over.

98
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.520
And B, because we ran out of guesses and we lost.

99
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.310
And the code will still need to let us know.

100
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.980
Then we need this last F to see if we still need to inform the user that he or she has lost the game.

101
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.680
So we're learn to ask if the actual value of the estimation at the end of the loop is different than

102
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.700
the secret number.

103
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.680
Then we're going to print a little string saying, Sorry, we've run out of attempts.

104
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.870
The secret number was and here we make a call to disclose the secret number.

105
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.960
With this, we have the program ready.

106
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.280
So let's see if we've made any mistakes or is there something to correct or improve?

107
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.880
So we're going to execute it.

108
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.880
Going to run, run.

109
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.600
And we choose.

110
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.770
Guess the number.

111
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.530
Well, tell me your name.

112
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.090
My name is Ferry.

113
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.510
Well, Ferry, I've thought of a number between one and 100.

114
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.730
You have eight guesses to guess.

115
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.110
Let's see.

116
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.290
My strategy is to go with to the middle in order to shorten the options.

117
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.200
I will try then.

118
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.950
50.

119
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.510
My number is lower.

120
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.250
What's the number?

121
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.010
Well, let's go to 25.

122
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.040
Always the middle.

123
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.660
My number is lower.

124
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.670
What about 17?

125
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.710
Wow.

126
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.700
It's even lower.

127
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.140
Let's go with ten.

128
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:52.780
There it is.

129
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.050
Now I have to go higher.

130
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.040
14?

131
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:55.960
Nope.

132
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.860
Then I have three possibilities.

133
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.480
It's 11, 12 or 13.

134
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.930
Let's go to the middle one.

135
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.690
12.

136
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.400
Congratulations, Freddy.

137
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.140
You have guessed in six attempts.

138
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.450
Pretty close, but I made it.

139
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.580
So let's try one more run.

140
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.120
But this time I'm going to lose on purpose to see if it works out well.

141
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.130
I have to test everything.

142
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.650
So I'm going to pick a number and I'm going to always put the same number to make sure I don't win by

143
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.550
any chance.

144
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.470
And here then we did one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight tries.

145
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.340
And he said, I didn't guess.

146
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.510
Sorry.

147
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.890
You're run out of temps.

148
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.140
The secret number was 80.

149
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.300
Well, what bad look?

150
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:44.270
The good look is that I had a phenomenal day, a day where I learned a lot of things and where I integrated

151
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.060
all that into a program that is now a real game.

152
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.300
People can actually play.

153
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.800
Yes, I know it lacks aesthetics and it lacks graphical user interface.

154
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.940
It lacks sounds.

155
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.070
It lacks many other things that make it fun.

156
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.030
But if you were in the eighties, this game would be a boom and you'd be a millionaire.

157
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.790
Well, it's been an awesome day, and I'm looking forward to the relaxing moment to finish the day and

158
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.200
celebrate the conquest.

159
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.760
See you in the next lecture.
