00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.130
As we have seen, Python provides us with many tools to work in the field of data science, numpy,

2
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.290
pandas and map plot lib.

3
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.410
These are libraries we can take advantage of in order to process, analyze and visualize databases of

4
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.340
all kinds.

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.950
Next, we are going to explore another aspect of data science, which is called machine learning, and

6
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.440
it's a branch of artificial intelligence.

7
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.160
Python can also help us here where we basically want a computer to learn based on its own experience.

8
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.020
Let me give you an example.

9
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.750
How does your email inbox notice if a certain message is about something important to you, something

10
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.390
you want to read, or if it is actually an update from your networks, a promotion from a company or

11
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.420
spam that could even be deleted without you seeing it.

12
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.770
The magic happens thanks to an algorithm that was programmed to do this.

13
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.070
This algorithm was created with some parameters that enable it to recognize one thing from another,

14
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.980
but then it is going to start determining which emails should go to which folder based on observing

15
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.870
your behavior.

16
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.820
But if we take it for granted that this exists and that it surrounds us every day, building this type

17
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.080
of algorithm is not simple and in fact requires a very high level of abstraction, understanding text,

18
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.740
relating concepts, looking for patterns and much more.

19
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.600
And that's machine learning.

20
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.820
There are several forms of machine learning, and today we will see one of the most important forms

21
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.880
supervised learning in this paradigm.

22
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.810
You at the as the data scientists have a database that is already structured, that is it has several

23
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.400
columns or fields and several rows or records within that data.

24
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.710
There is one that we want to be able to predict when new records appear.

25
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.780
For example, we want to learn to predict what customer will eventually buy or our product by taking

26
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.560
into account a database of registered users on the website and certain characteristics of their information

27
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.210
and registered behavior.

28
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.510
In this case, the flow of a supervised learning task scene in a simplified way would be like this.

29
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.950
First, we take the data we already have from our site history and we separate the predictor, the X

30
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.730
variable from a variable.

31
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.220
We want to predict the Y variable.

32
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.920
Secondly, we train our program.

33
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.600
How do we train a machine?

34
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.740
We show our code, the pairs associated between Y and each of the labels and X so that it learns how

35
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.730
the relationships between Y and each of those attributes are.

36
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.960
We also show our code which characteristics are predominant in those who buy and which are predominate

37
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.490
in those who do not buy.

38
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.690
In this way, the machine creates a set of rules or associations so that it can then anticipate the

39
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.530
new case.

40
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.090
And finally, once the model has been trained, we can use it from here.

41
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.180
We expect the model to be able to tell us how likely a new user of my website is to buy my product or

42
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.140
not by using a great approximation capacity.

43
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.140
This allows me, as a business owner to make decisions about how much to invest in targeting a given

44
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.040
visitor or to go plan marketing strategies to specifically attract to my site those visitors who are

45
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.050
most likely to buy what I sell.

46
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.870
To apply all this in Python, you will learn about the Psychic Learn library in the next lecture, which

47
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.300
has everything we need to follow these steps that will allow us to design a machine learning model.

48
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.810
This will help us finally face today's final project.

49
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.260
We are going to create a machine learning model that will allow us to identify if the passenger of the

50
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.350
Titanic is going to survive or not to do so, I'm going to provide you with a data set containing the

51
00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.080
ship passengers records with some of their personal characteristics, and you are going to train your

52
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.490
machine to establish relationships between those attributes so that it can then tell you which characteristics

53
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.840
are most decisive to define whether someone will survive or not.

54
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.950
Will Jack and Rose be representative cases of the results of our model?

55
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.420
We'll see in a few minutes.

56
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.720
In the next lecture, you will return to our lab notebooks to carry out this project through a first

57
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.750
machine learning model decision trees.

58
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:35.040
By using values of some of these properties, a decision tree seeks to find questions in the data that

59
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.860
allow it to classify new instances or, in our case, new passengers of the Titanic.

60
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.690
A decision tree is a structure composed of nodes, branches and leaves.

61
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.210
A new instance is classified by traversing the decision tree at each node.

62
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.440
The tree asks the new passenger a question about one of its attributes.

63
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.900
Depending on the answer to this question, the passenger is then directed through one of.

64
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.630
Of its branches, where it may appear as another node, another question or end up in a leaf.

65
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.170
The leaf contains the label that corresponds to that passenger and that gives the final answer survive

66
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.720
or not.

67
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.250
Let's put it all into practice and see how it works right now.

68
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.090
To about.
