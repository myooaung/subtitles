00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.670
Hazel has almost got all her functions ready.

2
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.320
We're only missing one more which allows our program to close.

3
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.630
We need to do something so that we can leave this loop and finish with our code.

4
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.010
So we're going to program a farewell greeting, which, when Hazel hears, she interprets that she must

5
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.520
leave.

6
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.250
This will be another Elif, which will listen for the word goodbye.

7
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.010
If she hears goodbye in my request, then she will greet us.

8
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.230
Hazel, will you speak to say I'm going to rest?

9
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.930
Let me know if you need anything.

10
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.190
That's the way it is.

11
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.740
Hazel, not to worry.

12
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.040
Now, with a break, we are assured that after saying this, it will leave the while loop and break

13
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.540
the execution of our code.

14
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.980
With this, we are ready to test Hazel and to see how she will execute all the functions we have just

15
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.730
created.

16
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.140
Hello.

17
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.070
I am Hazel.

18
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.960
How can I help you?

19
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.820
Good morning, Hazel.

20
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.650
It's a pleasure to see you today.

21
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.010
So before anything we want to know, please.

22
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.480
What day is today?

23
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.860
Today is Thursday.

24
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.460
Thank you.

25
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.910
Hazel.

26
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.200
That's what I imagined.

27
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.590
Now the.

28
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.610
Please tell me, what time is it right now?

29
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.880
At this moment, it is 10 hours and 52 minutes.

30
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.330
So do a Wikipedia search for online learning.

31
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.980
I am looking for it.

32
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.640
According to Wikipedia, distance education, also known as distance learning, is the education of

33
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.350
students who may not always be physically present at a school or where the learner and the teacher are

34
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.480
separated in both time and distance.

35
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.750
Search the Internet for video school online, of course, right now.

36
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.020
This is what I found.

37
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.560
Play Roxanne by the police.

38
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.360
Oh, what a great idea.

39
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.460
I ll play it right now.

40
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.380
So I'd love to keep listening to this incredible song, but I need to continue with the lesson.

41
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.290
You know what, Hazel?

42
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.950
I'd like you to tell me a joke so I can have a little laugh.

43
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.810
There are only two hard problems in computer science cache invalidation.

44
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.880
Naming things endorsed by one errors.

45
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.280
Ah ha ha ha.

46
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.660
Hazel, I can see you've got a sense of humor.

47
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.020
In fact, please tell me another joke.

48
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.670
Unix is user friendly.

49
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.820
It's just very particular about who its friends are.

50
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.460
Blimey, I need to remember that one.

51
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.510
Okay.

52
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.470
Now please tell me, what is the stock price of Amazon shares?

53
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.670
I found it.

54
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.810
The price of Amazon is $141.49.

55
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.920
This is the information I need.

56
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.200
Thank you very much.

57
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.470
Now, Hazel, I'd like to say goodbye.

58
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.030
I am going to rest.

59
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.280
Let me know if you need anything.

60
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.360
Perfect.

61
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.280
And that's how we close our program.

62
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.700
The code is finished and we can let Hazel rest.

63
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.060
So keep investigating all of these functions and search for new libraries, which will integrate into

64
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.530
other aspects of your computer so that you can assist you with all you need.

65
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.690
So this is everything for today, and we've created a really fun program.

66
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.370
I'm sure you're going to continue personalizing this with lots of energy, so keep going and enjoy yourself.

67
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.910
Tomorrow we will learn something that will change your life as a programmer.

68
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.640
I'm not exaggerating.

69
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.620
I'll see you here again tomorrow.
