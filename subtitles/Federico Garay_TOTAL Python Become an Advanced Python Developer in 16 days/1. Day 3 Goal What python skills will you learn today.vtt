00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.500
Welcome.

2
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:16.260
We are about to start our third day of learning and I propose that you do it with joy and a cup of coffee

3
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.440
or whatever makes you feel ready, because at the end of today's lectures you are going to be closer

4
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.900
to being a python programmer.

5
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.700
In fact, today, like every day, you will learn many new tools which will allow you to create a new

6
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.160
program by the end of the day.

7
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.820
Today you are going to develop a text parser.

8
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.900
What is that?

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.090
A program in which the user will enter any kind of text and the code will give him all kinds of information

10
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.730
about that text, such as the number of words and the times a letter is repeated if a certain word exists

11
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.820
or not in the text and much more.

12
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.080
And although it may seem impossible now, in a few minutes you will be able to program all of this on

13
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.710
your own.

14
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.060
Of course, you will have to learn some new things, like applying the index method to search for elements

15
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.160
inside strings and other data structures, extracting text fragments, discovering the main methods

16
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.650
and properties that strings have to manipulate and analyze their information.

17
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.820
And finally, knowing all the data types that we still need to know, such as lists, dictionaries,

18
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.490
tuples, sets and booleans.

19
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.480
Yes, all that in just one day.

20
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.980
So let's not waste any more time.

21
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.270
And let's go straight to the first practical lecture of the day.
