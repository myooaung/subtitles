1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,910
So far, the user can create new tasks he or she can view.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,600
The tasks he or she has created can edit the tasks, and we need to give the user the possibility to

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,710
delete them too.

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,200
For that, we're going to add a class called Delete View that does two things.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,100
First, it asks you if you're sure you want to delete them.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,970
This would be a form that simply asks you a question on the screen, and once you confirm it, it will

7
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,650
delete the task from the list.

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,880
So let's go to Pie Charm where we're going to go to the task list file.

9
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:49,230
We're going to add a new item, a new cell, and we're going to put it after this one that says edit.

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,050
This one's going to say, delete the URL for now.

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,370
We're going to leave it empty.

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,240
Once we set it up, we'll come back here to add it.

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,360
Let's go back to our page and we're going to refresh it.

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,420
And here it says delete.

15
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,250
But I'm not clicking on it yet because it's not going to take us anywhere for now.

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,660
Let's go back to chart and continue with what's missing.

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,640
Let's create the view.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,800
What do we have to do here?

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,260
We import the class which is also inside edit and it's called delete view.

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,590
We're going to create a class for this, which is going to be very similar to what we're doing so far.

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,830
A classic called Delete Task that inherits from Delete View, and we're going to assign it as we did

22
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:47,740
before, a model that's the same as task and as in the first classes in which we had the context object

23
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,400
name.

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,870
We want that here.

25
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,860
Also, the elements are not referenced as object, but this tab.

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,430
And finally we put a success URL because we want it to take us back to the home of our site once the

27
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,410
task is successfully deleted.

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,930
Now we need to generate the template to establish what is going to be shown when we choose delete.

29
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:18,960
So here in base, we're going to create a new file which we're going to call task, confirm delete dot

30
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,030
HTML as before.

31
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,390
We're giving it the name that the system will look for by default.

32
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,180
Then we'll rename it to our liking.

33
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,630
But for now we're going to leave it as task, which is the name of our list and then confirm delete,

34
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,580
which is the template that will search for delete view when we click on those links.

35
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,200
Well, in this HTML, we're going to put a form we're going to protect it as before with the bracket

36
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,990
and then the percent sign and then CSF token and it's protected.

37
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,610
So we're going to set this form to have the method post as the previous one, because although we're

38
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,290
not going to publish anything here, but on the contrary, we're going to be able to delete something.

39
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,410
We're uploading new information to the database.

40
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,630
We are not asking for anything back.

41
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,280
It's not a query.

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,050
So I hope this doesn't confuse you.

43
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,570
But keep in mind that post is not only publishing something but also sending a piece of information

44
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,020
to make something happen as this is the case.

45
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:29,280
So inside our form, we're going to create a paragraph so we can show something on the screen that tells

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:38,670
the user, you are going to delete this task colon and here you're going to put the name task with quotes.

47
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,100
And this is going to be a variable.

48
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,820
We will put it between two brackets task.

49
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,850
So let's go to the next line and here what we need is the delete button to appear.

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,300
Remember that we do this with an input is going to be type submit and this is going to have a value

51
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,480
the text delete and with this we have it.

52
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,200
We only need to add at the beginning, even before the form a link so that we can go back in case the

53
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,380
user enters delete but then doesn't want to do it.

54
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:23,430
And we put a tag A that says back and that tag takes us to the ref equal to inverted commas, bracket

55
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,440
percentage u r l tasks and we'd be ready.

56
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,350
This is already becoming routine because we already know what are the steps to generate each of the

57
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:34,980
links.

58
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:42,540
What we need to do here is to go to URLs and import the view that we have just generated, which is

59
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,560
delete task.

60
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,840
To which we are also going to generate a path.

61
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:54,070
So here we put the comma, add a path, and this is not going to be the edit task, but delete task

62
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:01,570
and we're going to leave the integer so you can choose which task is the one you want to delete here

63
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,800
instead of edit task.

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,780
It will also be delete task and the name will also be delete task.

65
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:15,400
So the only thing left to do now is to complete what we had left blank in task list here this link without

66
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,180
completing it.

67
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,600
So where should this take us?

68
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,160
Now that we have a name, we open the bracket and we open the percentage and we tell it.

69
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:33,070
We want to go to the URL, delete task, and we put task ID so that it knows which task to go to specifically.

70
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,100
So now we're done and we're going to our side.

71
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,660
So we're going to refresh here and we're going to delete the last two tasks that we created.

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,990
The first one is going to be made up task.

73
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,690
We're going to delete and it shows us the warning message, but it doesn't properly show us the name

74
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,560
of task.

75
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,660
So let's see what happened here, because it's supposed to say task.

76
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,260
So we go to views to see if the name is right.

77
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,850
And here's the error.

78
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,740
It says tasks plural.

79
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,340
The context object name should be task singular.

80
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,870
So let's go back to our site and let's take the opportunity to test the back link and it works fine.

81
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,210
So let's try again for the delete made up task and now it shows the complete message.

82
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,400
I click delete and it's gone.

83
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,690
It's no longer here.

84
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,400
So we go to delete other task and we see the message again.

85
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,210
Delete.

86
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,120
And now I only have the original three tasks left.

87
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,960
At this point, we have the basic functionality of our site completed and working properly.

88
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,670
In the next lesson, we're going to take some time to solve something very important.

89
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:49,000
In any site that handles sensitive information, we're going to generate a functionality so that the

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,060
user can log in and out so that this information can only be seen by someone who has proven their identity.

91
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,030
So we will see this in the next lesson.
