00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:14,510
Today we are going to start talking about a super important topic, which are Python modules and packages.

2
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,920
And for that we are going to talk about something called Pi, pi and pip install.

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,340
So far, all the code we have used is code that we already have because it was installed at the same

4
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,860
time we installed Python on our computer.

5
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:34,070
This means we have used code libraries that come internally installed in Python and these are known

6
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,890
as standard or built in libraries.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,700
At one point we had imported some extra modules like random or path, and still we were able to import

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,780
those modules because we already had them installed on our computer.

9
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,660
Those these standard libraries are very complete.

10
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,260
You will regularly need other extra resources.

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:00,050
And what you will discover in this lecture is that there are thousands and thousands of open source

12
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,660
libraries for almost anything you want to do.

13
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,650
They have been created by other programmers to make your life easier.

14
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,690
Do you want a code to create graphs?

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,740
Do you want to control Excel from Python or send and receive emails?

16
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,560
Do you want code to control a robot remotely?

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,350
Do you want code to do facial recognition?

18
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,440
All of this and much more already exists.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,470
And all you have to do is find it, install it, and import it in order to use it in your programs.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,590
All of this is free and you just have to know how to do it.

21
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:37,730
This is where Pi Pi comes in, which is a repository of third party open source python packages.

22
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:44,370
To install these packages we are going to use the command prompt window applying the pip install command.

23
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,450
This is a command you already have on your computer from the time you installed Python or your computer

24
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:57,620
at the beginning of the course and is an easy way to download packages directly from the pi pi repository

25
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,540
to find a library in pi pi.

26
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:06,680
We usually do it by searching in Google and the links that appear first usually lead to pi pi the page

27
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,210
with the package or its documentation.

28
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,580
In a little while, Federico is going to show you what a typical search looks like.

29
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,890
But first, we are going to show you how to download and install external packages from the command

30
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,790
prompt on windows or from the terminal on Mac or Linux.

31
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,870
So let's get to it.

32
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,440
And where would we start our search if not on Google?

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,070
Do not feel bad for going there because it doesn't matter if you're an expert or a beginner.

34
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,920
Everybody uses Google, so we'll think like an expert who's trying to solve a problem.

35
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,980
They need a code to change the console text color.

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,010
Since Python doesn't allow us to do that using its built in libraries.

37
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,640
We need to find out the appropriate package.

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,700
Well, no one knows every existing package.

39
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,860
And when I say nobody, I mean it.

40
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,970
So online searches are fundamental in a programmer's life.

41
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,800
So how do we search for a package that allows us to change the console text color?

42
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,580
Well, we type it directly into the Google search box.

43
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,250
You want to always start with Python in order to provide the search with context.

44
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,170
Then type packages.

45
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,130
And this should be followed by a reason why you're looking for a package.

46
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,020
So in this case, I want to change the console font type.

47
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,300
So I'll type for console text colors enter.

48
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:33,080
And here I have some options which I can choose, so it's likely they'll show me an archive or a package.

49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,110
So I'm quite interested in this option.

50
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:45,200
Reading Colored Pie P Because it's located in pie P dot org, which is the official website of pie archive

51
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,600
that Phil recommended to you in the introduction.

52
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,450
So this is safe and I know I'm going to find the most of the best options here.

53
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,260
So let's click on this link.

54
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,600
So where is it taking us?

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,480
Well, to pie p dot org site which contains official documents, tutorials and all the information I

56
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,990
need to know how to manage and learn about packages.

57
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:13,160
So here we have some links that take us to release history, download files and the maintainer python

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,620
upgrades are also visible and so on.

59
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:21,230
So we can also see this text and let's be honest, it isn't necessary for us to read the whole of it,

60
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,240
but some important parts.

61
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,960
There are some very large documents and you have to know what to look for.

62
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,120
So you'll learn as you do it.

63
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,300
First, I have to find the word colored, which is the name of my package and the name I have to use

64
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,350
when installing it.

65
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,820
In fact, here I have the command I have to use in the console in order to install the package pip installed

66
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,390
colored.

67
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,740
So let's do that.

68
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,900
So go to command line.

69
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,970
I have this because I work with Windows.

70
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:56,180
So if you work with Linux or Mac, you'll use terminal, which you will follow the same steps afterwards.

71
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,100
So what do we have to type here?

72
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,740
First we need to enter this command to.

73
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,690
Install coloured which is pip install and then coloured, which is the name of our package.

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,890
So in my case, when I press enter, the system will let me know this requirement is already satisfied

75
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,410
because I've been practising in order to teach you.

76
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,980
In your case, the software will start operating until the program is installed and then you'll be back

77
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,460
here.

78
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,180
So now we'll go back to Python, but we'll use it from the console.

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,950
Here we are.

80
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:34,710
See Colon and its location are no longer visible, but these three symbols.

81
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,770
And now I'll import the package from Python.

82
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:43,200
You already know that when we have to work with a library that it's not built in, we have to import

83
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,560
it.

84
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:51,780
So as I've already read the document, I know that from colored I have to import FG, BG and a TTR.

85
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,250
These are foreground background and attributes.

86
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,960
So don't worry.

87
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,660
I don't mean to teach you how to use this package.

88
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,550
That's not what the class is about.

89
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,480
I want to teach you how to install and use packages in general, so I'm going to use it so as to show

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,130
you how I already have it.

91
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,040
And because it is something, it's something fun to see.

92
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:22,650
So I'll create a variable named color and set it up with an fg number one, which is red plus a BG number

93
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,240
15, which is white.

94
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:32,250
Now I have defined a color variable, so I'll print that color plus a text reading hello world.

95
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,860
And this I know because I read the document atr0 so that it restarts itself and stops writing in the

96
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,030
colors I've created.

97
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:47,130
So once I press enter Hello world will be written in the colors I choose.

98
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:53,280
And now I repeat, I'm not teaching you how to use colored, but only demonstrating it.

99
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,390
If you want to use it, you can download it and read the document.

100
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:05,190
The gist of this lesson is that you learn how to search for, install and use any package that you download.

101
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,130
So let's illustrate this with another example.

102
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:13,380
So go back to Google and suppose that you want to look for a Python package that allows you to manage

103
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,190
Excel.

104
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:22,410
Okay, so first we type Python packages for Excel and here we have the first option from Python Excel

105
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,220
dot org.

106
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,830
So let's open it and notice that this site isn't a pi pi yet.

107
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,550
And it reads Working with Excel files in Python here it says This site contains pointers to the best

108
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,230
information available about working with Excel files in the Python programming language.

109
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,880
So here we have a category titled Reading and Writing Excel files and it contains several options.

110
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,390
Then we have writing Excel add ins along with its options and some other stuff we don't need.

111
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,210
So let's go back up and suppose we want a package that allows me to read and write Excel files.

112
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,200
Well, the first one here is Open P Excel.

113
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,320
I don't know if it's better or worse than the others, but I've been researching it a bit and I know

114
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,400
I can go to the documents through this link and it'll take me to the official document.

115
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,500
Open P Excel and I can also go straight to the download.

116
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,800
So this takes me to a similar site to the previous one.

117
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,200
Now I'm in pi pi dot org.

118
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,050
Let's see how to install this.

119
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,000
We have to type pip install open p excel if you want.

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,810
You can read the whole document inside this link which shows everything.

121
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:44,940
So let's go back to command line and we install this with pip install open p excel enter here.

122
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,530
It will happen the same as the previous case when we installed colored.

123
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,900
So now I can go to python and type from open p excel import.

124
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:03,090
All that is an asterisks so I'll press enter and won't get an error so I'm ready to use whatever open

125
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,840
P Excel contains in order to manage Excel files.

126
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,930
So this is how you can use pip install in python and you can find out what external packages are better

127
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,530
for you.

128
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,290
So we're not using any package for now.

129
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,510
I just wanted you to know how to search for and use whatever package you may need in the future.

130
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,370
In fact, we're likely to need to install some packages in order to do some things.

131
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,750
I want to teach you in some of the next lessons, so I hope this was useful to you.

132
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,480
If you have any doubt, please leave it in the Q&amp;A section because next we're going to learn how to

133
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,570
create our own modules and packages using Python.

134
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,100
So see you later.
