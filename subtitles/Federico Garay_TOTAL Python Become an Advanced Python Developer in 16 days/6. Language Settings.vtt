00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.860
So we already have a second function that makes our program able to talk.

2
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.080
So let's delete this call and let's look at configuring some things with the language.

3
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.330
For this.

4
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.300
I want to show you create an example of code that will later be deleted so you can see all the voices

5
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.020
available.

6
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.730
So I will initiate engine.

7
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.620
And again, because I have to do it outside the function so the system recognizes it.

8
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:42.500
Again, I put psx3 dot in it and I'm going to create a loop that is in charge of revising all the voices

9
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.190
available with the property voices of the engine.

10
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:54.140
So I wrote it like this for every voice that is found inside of Engine Dot get property in the property

11
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.860
voice.

12
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.300
So let's make it.

13
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.570
Print the voice of every iteration.

14
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.860
I will execute again.

15
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.870
And here, come out objects in voice.

16
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.580
Each one represents one voice that is installed on my computer.

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.620
So let's choose one of them.

18
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.300
And we say the first says voice ID and it has a very large name and its properties we see its name is

19
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.280
Microsoft David desktop and that it speaks English from the United States.

20
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.650
As you can see, I have other languages which are British, English and Spanish.

21
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.340
When you make this verification on your computer, you're probably going to see distinct voices or maybe

22
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.010
the same.

23
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.800
It depends which you have installed.

24
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.150
The interesting thing is that I have all of these options of voice to give my assistant if I want to,

25
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.280
an assistant that will speak English from the USA and that has a female voice.

26
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.970
I must choose zero.

27
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.700
If you want, you can install other voices.

28
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.720
So how?

29
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.680
Okay.

30
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.410
I'll leave you in the resources of this lesson.

31
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.380
A link to the Microsoft document which tells you how to download language from text to voice for Microsoft

32
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.280
Windows ten.

33
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.200
It's more than easy.

34
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.430
So what I'm going to do is to build a database with the voices I have here.

35
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.960
I will create five identifiers, for example, ID one, which will be equal to everything I have here

36
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.590
from H key until 11.0.

37
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.070
Copy it and paste here between quotation marks.

38
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.920
So let's write the rest of the variables.

39
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.330
ID two.

40
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.950
ID three.

41
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.330
ID four.

42
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.530
An ID five.

43
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.570
The second is David.

44
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.460
The following is zero.

45
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.700
And then our friend Helena.

46
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.460
And finally, let's get to know Hazel, who is from Great Britain.

47
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.190
So let's close here so we can see our options better.

48
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:05.380
And I'll open the function speak again because here I can configure after the init a new line to establish

49
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.490
the engine establishes a property which will be voice and what value do we want to give our voice?

50
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.320
I'm going to try with ID five, which is Hazel from England.

51
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.430
I will return to call the function speak here, which this time is going to say Hello, Federico.

52
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.070
I hope you have a nice day.

53
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.920
So let's execute it again.

54
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.360
Hello, Federico.

55
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.830
I hope you have a nice day.

56
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.280
Okay.

57
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.340
So my name is of Spanish Origins, so pronounces it a little bit odd, but you can understand it.

58
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.620
Also, take note that it says everything without punctuation because I didn't put any.

59
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.120
So let's put a comma and let's call David, which is ID too.

60
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.920
And we execute.

61
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.330
Hello, Federico.

62
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.740
I hope you have a nice day.

63
00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.070
Now that I put the comma, it has added an inflection in the punctuation and it sounds much better.

64
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.380
Now we can try with a voice that speaks Spanish so you can see how it sounds.

65
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.820
If we choose Sabina, which is in the ID one and we execute you, Federico, you'll be.

66
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.880
See, it sounds a little bit strange.

67
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.710
It's better that the voice is pronounced.

68
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:23.590
The text that is written in their own language, saying that if we were to write something in Spanish

69
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.750
questo.

70
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.510
I see.

71
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.980
And we execute.

72
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.200
Hola, Mundo Buendia.

73
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.240
It seems that Sabina speaks more naturally because she's speaking here her own language.

74
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.450
So to continue with our project, I'm going to return to Hazel, which is ID five, and let's continue

75
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.470
with her for now.

76
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.570
So that's how to configure the language and let's keep it up and get going in the next lesson.
