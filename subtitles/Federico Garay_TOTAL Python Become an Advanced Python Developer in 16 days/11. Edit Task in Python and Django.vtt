00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.620
In this lesson, we're going to learn how to edit one of the tasks that has already been created.

2
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.980
That is how to generate the space within our site so that the user can enter here and open a link next

3
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.320
to each task with the text.

4
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.710
Edit to enter the task and modify it.

5
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.550
Before.

6
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.420
There is something I want to change as well.

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.290
Inside our new task, we don't have any link for the user to exit without creating any task.

8
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.560
For example, if he or she entered by mistake and then regretted entering, I would like to put a link

9
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.910
here that says back.

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.020
So we're going to come to the task form and we're going to add another tag, a to put a link and the

11
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.780
content of the link is the text back.

12
00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.300
And this link is going to take us to the h ref square brackets, percentages, u r l tasks and with

13
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.560
that we go back home.

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.900
Now let's go back to our site and to create new tasks.

15
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.240
And we can see the link to go back.

16
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.260
Very good.

17
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.330
Now let's go to what we promised for this lesson, which is the edit tasks.

18
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.990
So we go back to py charm and we go to views.

19
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.720
And here we need to create a new view.

20
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.560
For that, we're going to import something else here inside Django View's generic edit in addition to

21
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.640
create view.

22
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.610
We're also going to import update view.

23
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.570
Jango has tools for everything and now we're going to create a class, as we've done so far with each

24
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.410
of the views.

25
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.320
This class can be called edit tasks and it will inherit from update view.

26
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.250
And inside we're going to do what we've always done.

27
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.950
In fact, I'm going to copy all of this.

28
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.940
Perfect.

29
00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.410
Because we need it to have a module task that includes all the fields and that when it manages to successfully

30
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.620
edit the task, it returns us to the home.

31
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.990
So this would be the same.

32
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.430
Now let's go to URLs to create an address to get here.

33
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.470
We're going to import this view that we have just created called edit task.

34
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.110
And we're going to copy this path, which is the one with the integers, because here we're going to

35
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.110
need a URL for each task number.

36
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.820
And the only thing we're going to modify is that here it has to say edit task and here instead of detail

37
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.710
it is going to say edit task.

38
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.130
And of course the name is going to be edit task.

39
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.960
So the last thing we need to do is to show the link on the screen.

40
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:52.560
Then in the HTML of the task list, we also want a data cell, i.e. a table data cell that says edit.

41
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.170
So we copy this one, paste it below and we're going to change the text.

42
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.740
It won't say see detail, but edit and it will take us to edit task.

43
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.250
That's it.

44
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.230
Well, we're missing one detail.

45
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.870
Now we're adding three cells inside each row of records.

46
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.970
So this top row should have a third cell to keep everything balanced.

47
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.040
Okay, so now we're done.

48
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.650
Let's refresh and see that.

49
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.320
In addition to see details, we have edit.

50
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.700
So if I want to edit milking the cow, I can come to this same form and here I can put milking Mindy,

51
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.740
which is the name of my cow.

52
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.290
So click on Send.

53
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.900
And this task has been modified so we can modify a task that has already been created.

54
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.120
And in the next lesson, we will add one more link that will allow us to delete tasks.

55
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.500
See that?
