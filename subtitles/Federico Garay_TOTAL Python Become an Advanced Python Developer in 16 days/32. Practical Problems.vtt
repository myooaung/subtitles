00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.020
This is a very different lecture because we have learned a lot throughout the day.

2
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.900
And before we move on to the final challenge of the day, I think it's necessary to augment your hands

3
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.640
on activities with some problems that will help train you and your make your ability to think more like

4
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.420
a programmer.

5
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.150
So what we're going to do is the following.

6
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.760
You're going to download the four attached PDF files that we have added to this lecture.

7
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.640
They have a series of practical problems, and you have the challenge of transforming those problems

8
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.420
into code.

9
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.100
Try it yourself, and in the next lecture we will solve all the problems together.

10
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.400
Moving through it to the big challenge of the day.

11
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.620
Take your time and we will be waiting for you in the next lecture with our own solution.
