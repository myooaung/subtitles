00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.470
The content of our site is only supposed to be accessible to someone who is logged in.

2
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.730
So if I'm logged in, I can see what's on the site.

3
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.280
But as we've just seen, even if I wasn't logged in, I could still see the content.

4
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.530
So that's what we're going to change in this lesson.

5
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.590
What we need to do is to build the device into most of our views, the one that shouldn't be accessible

6
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.770
without logging in that prevents unauthorized access in Python.

7
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.620
We're going to go to views and we're going to import something we don't have yet.

8
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.990
We're going to put it here.

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.740
From Django dot contrib auth dot mcs ends.

10
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.510
And from here we're going to import something called login required mixing.

11
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.190
This is useful for many things.

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.570
Among them to establish the attributes of a certain user if they're going to be an administrator, if

13
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.090
it's going to have any other special authorization, and if it's going to be a common user, etc..

14
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.790
But it also allows us to restrict our views.

15
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.180
So we're going to go to the classes that we have here and we're going to make them inherit from log

16
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.650
in required mixing.

17
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.260
So I'm going to copy this and we're going to determine which classes we need to put it in in log in.

18
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.910
Of course not, because we want the login view to be accessible to anyone.

19
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.400
You don't need to be authenticated to log in here because otherwise it would be impossible to log in.

20
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.480
Impending list.

21
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.910
You do make sure you make it inherent from log in required mix in first and then list view afterwards.

22
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.110
So let's try this.

23
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.760
We come to the site and this is the pending list, which I just made it inherent from logging required

24
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.330
mixing.

25
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.020
And if I log out and try to log back in to that page, it's going to give me this error.

26
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.290
So on the one hand, they've managed to get it to restrict me.

27
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.180
I can't see it anymore.

28
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.730
But on the other hand, now I have to configure what unregistered users who try to enter a page that

29
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.890
requires authorization are going to see.

30
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.640
So we don't want them to get this horrible page that doesn't give us clear information.

31
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.340
So we come to the code and we're going to open the settings file and we're going to go down to almost

32
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:29.260
the end here before static URL and we're going to make a place here so we can type in capital letters,

33
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.200
log in, underscore your URL.

34
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.820
And here we're going to set where our website is going to take us when we want to enter unauthorized

35
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.540
pages.

36
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.030
We're going to say that it's equal to login.

37
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.700
That is to say we want to make it take us to where we can have the possibility of logging in.

38
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.250
So if we now go back to our site manually and instead of directing me to that page full of text, it

39
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.750
says, look, if you want to log in, you're going to have to identify yourself.

40
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.900
But for now, I've restricted only this site.

41
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.880
If I log out again and want to log in to Task one, remember I'm not logged in.

42
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.000
I can see Task One without any problems.

43
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.540
I should not be able to see it if I'm not authorized.

44
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.280
This is because I have only restricted the class pending list for now.

45
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.720
Now I should restrict all other classes except the login class.

46
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.390
I do this in task detail.

47
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.530
Of course I do.

48
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.650
Also in create task only authorized users can create tasks.

49
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.190
And also only they can edit tasks and only they can delete tasks.

50
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.450
Now.

51
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.820
Yes, everything is supposed to be restricted.

52
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.190
And if I want to see this task one without being logged in, it takes me to the login page.

53
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.090
So now once I log in, I can see the pending list.

54
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.740
So this is how we restrict whether or not a user can see a certain content.

55
00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.110
We have yet to establish a way to make it so that each user can only see their own information.

56
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.750
Because for now we have the site identify whether the user is logged in or not.

57
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.440
We haven't established how to identify who can see what.

58
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.480
This task list is mine.

59
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.820
And if a different user logs in, they are supposed to be able to see their own tasks and not mine.

60
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.390
And at the same time, I can't see the other user's tasks.

61
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.240
So we're going to do that in the next lesson.
