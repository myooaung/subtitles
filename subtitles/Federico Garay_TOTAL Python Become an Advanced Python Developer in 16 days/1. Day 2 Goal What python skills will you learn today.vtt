00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.840
Welcome to day two of your training to become an advanced python programmer.

2
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.650
Today is a very special day because you are going to learn many factors that, despite being basic,

3
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.820
are fundamental for your future in this career.

4
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.850
So don't stop giving it your best as every day.

5
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.030
Today, you are going to create a program that works by itself, and this time we are going to work

6
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.230
with numbers.

7
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.410
You are going to create a commission calculator.

8
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.470
The employees of a company are going to use your program to find out how much they have earned in commissions

9
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.370
this month.

10
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.670
So let's be very careful about this.

11
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.320
As I said, keep in mind that the first programs you're going to create like today's are not going to

12
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.190
be super attractive or colorful or anything like that for now.

13
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.340
They're just going to be text on the screen.

14
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.410
To achieve today's goal, you're going to have to learn a few things first, for example, knowing the

15
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.640
different types of data that exists in Python, doing conversions between types of data, knowing what

16
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.780
variables are, knowing a bit more about how to format a string to be able to print it on the screen,

17
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.180
doing mathematical operations and also knowing how to round numbers.

18
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.400
So prepare your coffee, your tea, your bottle of water, or whatever it is that will give you energy

19
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.820
that you need to have your best day ever.

20
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.130
I'll be waiting for you in the next lecture to start an unforgettable day together.

21
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.880
Let's go.
