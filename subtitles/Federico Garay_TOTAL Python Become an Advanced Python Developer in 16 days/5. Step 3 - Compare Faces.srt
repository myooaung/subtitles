1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:13,760
In this lesson, we're going to do step three, which is to compare the faces and then measure the distance

2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,280
or difference between the two faces.

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,380
So let's place ourselves before show images to move on to the next step.

4
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,500
And here we're going to perform comparison.

5
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,220
So in a variable called result, we're going to store the result of this comparison.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:37,580
The result is going to be equal to the face recognition object that contains the compare faces method.

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,390
And this method asks for a list of images to be compared with the original image.

8
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,740
But as we in this example, don't have a list of images but only one image, we still have to put it

9
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,210
between braces because it has to be an object of type list.

10
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,030
Even if it only has one element.

11
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:02,750
Then the picture that we're going to put inside this list is coded Face A, which is the one we use

12
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,650
as a base.

13
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:10,370
And the next element is the photo with which we are going to compare it, which is also a single photo,

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,930
and we put coded face B, this is what the comparison is going to be made with so that we can see on

15
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,330
the screen what the result of this comparison is.

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,080
We go to print result and we execute it.

17
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,250
And here we have again received the two photos with their rectangles and everything.

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,750
And now we see in the console that the result of the comparison is true.

19
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,070
This means that it is true that these two people are the same person.

20
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:53,260
And how does Python reach this conclusion that it is true because it has established a point of comparison

21
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,140
or distance between both faces.

22
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:02,980
The system evaluates a series of factors between the two photos, calculates them according to metrics

23
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,200
it has established for this purpose, and comes up with a number that represents the distance between

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,280
the two faces.

25
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:15,340
If that distance is less than 0.6, it means that both people are the same person.

26
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,680
So we're going to look a little bit more in depth at this limit, and we will even learn how to modify

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,040
it.

28
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,920
What we're going to do now is to take Picture A, which is the picture that we have loaded as controlled

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,580
picture.

30
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,800
But this time we're going to compare it with picture, see, which is the picture of Brad Pitt.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,360
This will allow us to reach new and painful conclusions.

32
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,850
So let's see.

33
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,040
Here come the two pictures.

34
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,010
And now we see my friend Brad and me both with the rectangle where our faces are recognized.

35
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,900
But the result is false.

36
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,170
This is very bad news for Brad.

37
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,670
I'm so sorry, Brad.

38
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,980
You officially don't look like me.

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,100
But maybe if you grow a beard, you might stand a chance.

40
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,890
Anyway, you can put different pictures.

41
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,170
Pictures of your family members, pictures of friends, pictures of people you know, and check to see

42
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,420
if it recognizes different people or not.

43
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,210
It is interesting to play with different photos of the same person in different positions, in different

44
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:24,500
environments, with different lighting, etc. to see if the face recognition can properly identify if

45
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,760
it is the same person.

46
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,010
So in the next lesson, there is something great about face recognition that will fascinate you.

47
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,390
And we're on our way.
