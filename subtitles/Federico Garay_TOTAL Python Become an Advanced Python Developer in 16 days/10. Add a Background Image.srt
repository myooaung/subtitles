1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:14,220
So far we've created our characters and we can see them on the screen, and yet we have this pretty

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,170
boring background color which we choose when we begin to set up our game.

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,440
This was just a demo of choosing a background color, and I'd actually prefer a more impressive background

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,120
image, like an outer space image.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,170
Something interesting.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,350
We'll need to look for a new image.

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,240
Then I'm attaching the one I'm going to be using so you can download it if you want.

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,330
In order for you to learn how to look for an image, I'll do almost the same as before.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,780
There are several websites where we can look for images.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,390
I used free pick where I can choose between free and paid resources.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:00,150
You can use other images or illustration sites like Pixabay Pixels, Google Images, among others.

12
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,860
But what's the catch here?

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,680
Well, finding an image in exactly the size that you need is a bit difficult.

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,120
For example, we need an 800 by 600 image here.

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,360
So I'm fond of this one and that's the image that I want.

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,630
If I click to download it, I'll probably get an image whose resolution is not the one that I need.

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,120
So I advise you to download the image and then open it with an image editor so as to configure the image

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,840
size.

19
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,860
I'm using Photoshop, but you can use whichever you prefer.

20
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,190
So I've created a new 800 by 600 image.

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,560
I use this image which was much bigger, and I set up the size I needed.

22
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,030
So once I export this image, it will be just as I need it.

23
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,060
This is not a course on image addition.

24
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,430
I could explain what I did in full detail, but it was basically what we needed to do.

25
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,800
If you want to know more about Image Addition, we have a course on Photoshop usage and many others

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,970
on Image Addition.

27
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,640
You can take advantage of them whenever you like.

28
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,830
So I saved my image as background JPEG and now it is located in the folder where I save all the resources

29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,580
for this course and I can use it inside pie charm.

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,080
And here it is.

31
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,810
So I'm leaving this image in the resources section of the course in case you want to use it.

32
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,690
So let's see how we can use this as a background image in our pie game screen.

33
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,020
We'll go to the section where we stored some images in variables and let's create a new one that can

34
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:43,140
be named background, which is equal to pie game image load here and we'll upload background JPEG,

35
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,150
which I saved in this directory.

36
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,860
So once we create our variable, let's go to the game loop where we can set up the background so we

37
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,480
won't use a background color, but a background image.

38
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:03,930
And so screen won't be created with the fill method, but with the blip method which we use to add an

39
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,100
image to our screen.

40
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,990
Remember, it requires two parameters an image which is stored in the background variable and a location.

41
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,080
So since we want this image to cover the whole background, we have to start at coordinate zero, comma,

42
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,710
zero.

43
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,270
That should do it.

44
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,460
We'll execute our window again and we'll see the image that we chose.

45
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,410
And it looks great.

46
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,240
But you may notice that both our rocket and our enemy are moving a little slower.

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,100
So why is that?

48
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,660
Let me explain.

49
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,350
The image is being loaded through the game loop, which means that it is being loaded in each iteration.

50
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,300
This makes the iterations run slower because our loop is carrying out several tasks.

51
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,450
It loads the image, places it, and so on.

52
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,470
So the iterations that control the character's movements take more time to execute.

53
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,380
And we can appreciate this when opening our game.

54
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,550
To solve this, we have to make all the movements take up more space.

55
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,560
0.3 pixels is a very low value now, so let's change it to one.

56
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:19,040
We'll modify it here inside the if that checks the key down event, we'll change that here to where

57
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,920
we check that our enemy stays inside the lines.

58
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,770
And we'll also change it here where we see it reads 0.3.

59
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,360
Now it is one.

60
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,340
So this will speed up the movement.

61
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,300
Perfect.

62
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,550
This is a suitable speed for our game.

63
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,410
If you want it to run slower or faster, you can modify it like we just did.

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,670
So we're one step closer to finishing our game.

65
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,020
We have to program the attacks as well as the score we get when killing an enemy.

66
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,800
Then we have to learn how to kill those enemies and so on.

67
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,960
So let's go to our next lesson and keep on programming our game.
