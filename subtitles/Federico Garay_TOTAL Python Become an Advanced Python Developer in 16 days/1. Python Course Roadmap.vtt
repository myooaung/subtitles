00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.300
Welcome.

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.510
This is where your journey begins.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.360
Take a selfie and save it with the title.

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.200
My last day without knowing anything about Python.

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.000
Because learning is a one way trip.

6
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.310
My name is Phil Ebner, and I will be your partner in this adventure.

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.570
I am convinced that without fun, there is no learning.

8
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.460
So we are going to face this journey as friends who have a great time working together.

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.280
Before we start, we are going to ask you to take a few minutes so we can show you how your path is

10
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.710
going to be during the next few days.

11
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.210
Today, on day one, you're going to learn some of the Python philosophy.

12
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.730
You're going to install all the software needed for the rest of the course, and you're going to learn

13
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.430
your first commands, the basic ones, which are enough for you to be able to write your very first

14
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.090
program.

15
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.900
At the end of this day, from tomorrow until day six, you will go through the basic training phase.

16
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.990
These days are going to play a key role in your development because you are going to learn the basics

17
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.830
of Python, which is what every programmer should know.

18
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.890
Everything you learn in the future will be based on what you learn during your first few days.

19
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.850
On day seven, you are going to enter the advanced phase.

20
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.390
You're going to understand the philosophy of object oriented programming, which spearheads all modern

21
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:39.280
programming and allows us to have all the Python resources to create agile, robust, economical and

22
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.520
repeatable and easy to maintain programs.

23
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:49.870
At the end of day ten of this intensive training, you will be ready to be a python programmer because

24
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:57.460
you will know everything and up to date programmer knows and you will have accumulated many hours of

25
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.050
real world practice.

26
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.380
You will only lack experience that comes with time.

27
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.980
From day 11 onwards, the expert phase will start.

28
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.010
When you get there, you will already be a python programmer and it will be the time to get to know

29
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.610
its main applications in the real world.

30
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.270
Each day you will delve into areas of development such as machine learning, social network integration,

31
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.760
blockchain and much, much more.

32
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.890
I remind you that this course is strongly based on real world practice.

33
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.420
Each day you will complete it by creating a full program from scratch, and all lessons will be accompanied

34
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.870
by three practical code exercises and a downloadable document with a summary of the topic.

35
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.660
As a result, you can store all this in writing and have everything you have learned nearby in order

36
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.270
to build your own Python manual.

37
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.540
On top of that, each video includes a theoretical introduction and a practical demonstration.

38
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.090
Additionally, at the end of each day, you will have a quiz to review and reinforce everything you've

39
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.790
learned.

40
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.720
It's a time to reflect, summarize and celebrate some of your achievements each day.

41
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.240
We are so ready.

42
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.240
All this amazing content is waiting for you to start on the next lecture.

43
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.260
Are you ready?

44
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.260
Then hit that play button to go to the next lecture.

45
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.130
Right now.
