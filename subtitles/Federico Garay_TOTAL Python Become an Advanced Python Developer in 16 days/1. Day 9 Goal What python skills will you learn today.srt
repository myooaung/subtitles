1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,560
Now that you know what external or third party libraries and modules are and how to install them, let's

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,640
take a step back.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,600
Why?

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,300
Because there are still a lot of built in Python modules that we haven't explored yet, and it's really

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:21,870
worth doing.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:29,040
So we're going to see some very interesting, super useful modules and some of them will be your companions

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,750
for the rest of your career.

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,210
You're going to learn about collections.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,510
We're going to see a bit more about the OSS module, which we saw when we learned how to work with files,

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,220
shuttle and daytime.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,230
So you can work with dates and times a bit more about math and old acquaintance of the course time it,

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,900
which will surprise you and regular expressions.

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:57,180
And lastly, we're going to see how to compress and decompress files with the zip file module.

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,910
With all that in your pocket, you will, by the end of the day, be programming a serial number finder.

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,540
This program, which you are about to create yourself, will be able to go through a series of folders

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,300
and files and find within each file all the text fractions that meet a certain condition.

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,310
But that's going to happen at the end of the day.

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,890
So now it's time to learn everything you need to know.

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,300
Snap your fingers and we'll see you in the first lecture of the day next.
