00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.410
Welcome to Day seven.

2
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.200
It gives us great joy to know that you are still here and that you are still putting your heart into

3
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.890
your learning.

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.490
Today, we are going to keep moving forward as we do every day.

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.830
And you are going to learn so many new features that you're going to be able to program a bank account

6
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.150
at the end of the day.

7
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:34.010
Yes, an actual account capable capable of holding an account balance, receiving deposits and making

8
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.940
withdrawals.

9
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.950
It's not a difficult thing, but it requires us to learn some new things.

10
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.290
And that's what we're going to do in just a minute.

11
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.910
We're going to learn something that I've been wanting to teach you since the very beginning, but I

12
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.110
couldn't do it without helping you all the way through your journey that you've taken up to this point.

13
00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:00.350
What we're going to be looking at from this day forward and for a while longer is called OP object oriented

14
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.250
programming.

15
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.640
Python is one of the programming languages that supports this type of programming, which has a lot

16
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.450
to offer.

17
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.060
And it's the reason why writing code in Python is so easy compared to other languages.

18
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.940
In the next lecture, we will start explaining from scratch what object oriented programming is.
