00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.340
The objective of this lecture is to integrate what we have learned throughout the day with what we learned

2
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.420
yesterday about functions since from now on, almost everything you will learn will surely need to incorporate

3
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.160
into functions so that your programs have a repeatable and orderly structure.

4
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.940
Remember, functions are basically methods created by yourself.

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.570
You create them with the key word death, a name, some parentheses that have arguments or not, and

6
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.290
a colon.

7
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.950
Inside the functions, we can write any code that we need.

8
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.340
And normally the outcome of function is a return in which it returns us some information.

9
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.960
Or it can simply be something printed on the screen, and sometimes both things inside the functions.

10
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.900
We can also put the code that we have learned today so we can have a function for opening files and

11
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.230
a function for deleting files so on.

12
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.970
Remember that the functions created in your code are not executed until you invoke them.

13
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.690
And you can do this as many times as you want, even using different parameters.

14
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.290
This has just been a little small memory aid for you to keep in mind when creating today's project in

15
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.090
which you have to write a lot of code.

16
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.950
And if you don't separate it into several repeatable functions, it's going to get very complicated.

17
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.340
Be sure to do the practices that follow the quiz that summarizes a little of what we have been and seeing

18
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.990
throughout the day, and then roll up your sleeves because today's big project is coming up.
