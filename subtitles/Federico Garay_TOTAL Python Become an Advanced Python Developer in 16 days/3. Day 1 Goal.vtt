00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.200
Every day throughout this course, you will end up creating a program that can be applied in real life.

2
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.690
In this first day will be no exception.

3
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.720
You are going to create a program that will help a user create a clever and original name for a beer

4
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.170
brand.

5
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.970
Well, actually, it could be a use to create a brand name for any kind of product.

6
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.930
But we are going to think about a name for beer just for now.

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.920
Keep in mind, however, the first programs you create like today will not be super flashy with a nice

8
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.580
interface.

9
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.750
Until we get more coding skills.

10
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.510
The outcome of your first programs will be pure code on a black screen that returns a cold and dry result.

11
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.140
As you advance, you will be adding functionality so that your programs are effective as well as attractive

12
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.170
to learn how to program the goal we have set today.

13
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.250
You must first do a few things, such as installing Python on your computer, installing PI charm,

14
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.580
which is the software we will use to work with Python.

15
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.420
And to create the first program, you need to learn a set of tools like the print statement, strings,

16
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.180
concatenation in the input function.

17
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.350
I'll be waiting for you in the next lesson so that we can get started together.
