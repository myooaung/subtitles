00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.560
An important aspect of learning.

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.440
The programmer's craft is learning on your own.

3
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.280
Python is so big that no matter how many hours of video the course has, we would never finish going

4
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.320
through every method and every property of every object that exists in Python.

5
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.290
That's why in this lecture we are going to learn how to use pie terms, context sensitive help and the

6
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.950
official Python documentation so that you can always have all the existing and up to date information

7
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.670
at hand.

8
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.070
We are going to put it into practice right now by delving a little bit deeper into the methods of Python's

9
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.390
own objects.

10
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.680
As we have seen, there are numerous objects in Python and we still have many to discover, and all

11
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.530
of them have, among other things, methods.

12
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.530
They are functions belonging to objects that allow you to manipulate them, analyze them, or make them

13
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.960
perform actions.

14
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:09.050
For example, we have seen that the string object has a method called LOTR, which modifies its contents,

15
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.330
an index method which gives us information about its contents and so on.

16
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.530
It is crucial that you can learn to find and interpret the meaning of the methods by yourself, because

17
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.950
all objects have many methods and we would never finish making videos for everything that exists.

18
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.340
Also, in the future you will work with other programmers libraries and they'll contain new objects

19
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.150
with hundreds of new methods.

20
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.680
This is what we will look into right now with PI term.

21
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.310
So as we have seen, all objects have their own methods.

22
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.880
Some we have learned and I've explained them in detail.

23
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.160
Others I have asked you to see in the notes that we have, we leave next to each lecture and some I

24
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.810
have not even explained, and you will discover them either throughout the course or in your own experience.

25
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.970
So let's say I'm working with dictionaries and those have their own methods.

26
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.320
I'm going to create one here named Dick that has a simple key one and has the number 100 as value.

27
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.720
And let's also create a key number two that has a value of 500.

28
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.510
And I want to apply some method to my dictionary.

29
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.600
You have already seen that in the way to see all the methods that each one of the objects has in invoking

30
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.640
to the instance of the object.

31
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.650
In my case, the variable dick dick that contains my dictionary.

32
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.880
Now I press the dot and python offers me a dropdown box with all the elements that this object has.

33
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.790
We can see some of them have this pink circle and the m these are all its methods.

34
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.690
We see that it has functions and we see that it has properties.

35
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.790
They are with the P here.

36
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.150
So let's focus on the methods for my dick object, which are actually the methods for every dictionary.

37
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.850
Some of them like for example, clear.

38
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.570
We already learned it and we've also learned keys items, but we haven't seen, for example, this pop

39
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.350
item method.

40
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.900
So if I click on it, it is automatically added.

41
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.210
And if I stop with the cursor and hover over it for a moment, I get the contextual help which will

42
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.220
appear and it will give me some information.

43
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.240
It tells me that this element is a dictionary type data dict down here.

44
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.850
It tells me that this method returns a table and it tells me that what it does is to eliminate and return

45
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.990
a pair composed by a key and a value like a total of two.

46
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.500
That is to say that it's going to choose an element of the dictionary.

47
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.760
It's going to eliminate it.

48
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.580
And also it is going to return it so I can store it.

49
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:51.120
It also informs me that the pairs are returned in LIFO leave for order, which means the last one in

50
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.690
is the first one out since the dictionaries are not ordered.

51
00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.210
The order that the pop item will choose will be starting with the last element added to the dictionary,

52
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.880
then the one before that and so on.

53
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.340
In my case, key two would be the one that would come out first.

54
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.860
And here's a direct link to the documentation for this object.

55
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.780
Before we go there, I want to show you that if you open these three dots that you have here, you can

56
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.350
configure some things about these windows, for example.

57
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.730
I can adjust the font size if you need better glasses as I do.

58
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.070
There you can see it's a little bit better.

59
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.180
And here are some other things to configure, so check them out.

60
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.580
This has to do with pie charm, not python.

61
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.600
And if I want to go to the help, I can click here.

62
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.060
Now opens a window in my browser that takes me to the official Python documentation on the Python website.

63
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.220
And here we have pop item.

64
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.330
And it also tells me the same thing, plus some additional information.

65
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.710
And here is what it has changed in version 3.7.

66
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.000
The life out order has been guaranteed in previous versions.

67
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.330
It says pop item would have returned an arbitrary pair.

68
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.250
Notice that the documentation has absolutely everything related to Python.

69
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.410
Nothing is going to be missing from here.

70
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.720
And here you even have a table of contents where you can search for anything you want.

71
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.930
You have a search engine up here.

72
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.920
And if I am, for example, searching for some types of data here, I have the lists, the tables,

73
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.790
the ranges.

74
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.930
And if I choose tables, it will take me to the tables and all its information.

75
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.550
Here, you will never miss a thing.

76
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.550
Advantages of the official documentation.

77
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.660
It is accurate.

78
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:37.480
It is up to date and its official disadvantages are it's not written in a very pedagogical way.

79
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.280
That is to say, the cost of them being super precise is that they don't have any examples or many examples

80
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.620
that they are not very clear with the explanations.

81
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.200
Sometimes at the beginning of your career, you will want to look for more explanatory sites when you

82
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.370
need some extra help.

83
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.410
But always keep in mind the official documentation as the incontrovertible information.

84
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.110
You may not visit this site as often at the beginning of your career, but when you start working with

85
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.070
more complex things, you will be coming to the documentation almost every day.

86
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.980
So I also want you to know the inside pitch.

87
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.070
Another way to find help is to press the control key.

88
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:20.040
And now every time your cursor stops on some element, as you see, it is painted blue and already gives

89
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.480
you a contextual help.

90
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.000
And if I click there, it takes me to the class that corresponds to that object.

91
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.570
You are not yet able to read a class nor understand everything it has in here.

92
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.240
We're going to learn that later.

93
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.760
But for now, I wanted to let you know that if you press this control key and you stand over any element,

94
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.230
it's going to tell you a lot.

95
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.980
Pop item is a dict class and here's what it does, etc. So those are the helpers.

96
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.710
So now that we've learned this, we're able to use this new method pop item that I've just explained

97
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.430
to you now.

98
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.940
But if you were looking at it yourself, you'd be able to figure it out on your own.

99
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.990
I think so.

100
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.720
Now I know what it does and I can start playing with it.

101
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.290
It said here that it removes a pair from my dictionary.

102
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:10.980
Well, then we're going to store it in a variable A because the help said it returned the removed item.

103
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.110
So we'll put it in there.

104
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.470
And also while we're at it, let's print a to see what it looks like.

105
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.920
And also let's print the dictionary again to see what it looks like.

106
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:27.390
Once we remove the last item, see if the help is orientated as right, then we go to run and run.

107
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:33.540
We choose help, which is the name I gave to this file and we see that it has eliminated this element.

108
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.360
The last one that entered and the first one were to leave.

109
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.520
And it tells me that my dictionary only has the key one and the value 100.

110
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.340
So now my dictionary has only one element.

111
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.500
This is just an example of how you can move alone when you have to work with a method that you have

112
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.500
never learned and that no teacher has taught you well, there is a way for you to learn it on your own.

113
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.000
There are many elements.

114
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.060
Of course you still have the question and answer area of the course.

115
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.290
You never lose that, but you also have a way to gain independence.

116
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:10.590
And that's what I want you to be a self learning programmer going forward, because the truth, the

117
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.440
pure truth is that you'll never stop learning.

118
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.060
We're always learning.

119
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.080
We're always running into challenges that we don't have enough tools in our head.

120
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.370
Nobody has all the python in their head to get anything they need at any moment.

121
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.320
So you're going to look for material and you're going to research new methods, you're going to download

122
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.600
new things, and you're going to watch tutorials out there and you're going to need documentation and

123
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.140
help.

124
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.920
So thanks for joining me on this very important lecture.

125
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.230
And let's see what's coming up next.
