1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,430
For

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:15,240
mathematics, everyone's favorite subject at school in programming, numerical operations are very important,

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,760
and that's why you're going to learn how to do some basic and not so basic operations in Python.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,320
In this lecture, as you can imagine, in order to add, subtract, multiply and divide, we use our

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,290
old and familiar basic operation signs.

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,090
But there's much more than that.

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,660
And you're going to learn it right now in pie term.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,640
Okay, let's put these operations into practice inside this operate this file that I've just created.

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,410
You can do the same.

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,690
And let's start with basic operations like addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,750
We're going to create some very simple variables.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,470
X will have the value of six and Y with a two.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,570
We will do some operations with them.

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,950
And since we learn how to make literal strings, we're going to do that in that way.

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,980
I'm going to print it.

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:11,810
Remember to use the F to warn Python that it is a literal string and I want to enunciate an operation

17
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,590
with its result.

18
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,260
For example, x plus y is equal to whatever.

19
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,160
So I open the braces to put inside x.

20
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:25,400
That is to say that the value of x is going to be to be printed, which is this case six.

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,250
Plus, I open the case to write y that we know values two equals.

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,920
And here I open the case and put the operation.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,510
That would be X plus Y.

24
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,220
And now, if I run this, I'm going to go to run and run again.

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,320
And we pick operators.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,890
We get six plus two equals eight.

27
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,730
That's right.

28
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,130
Now we're going to copy this line and we're going to paste it three times to do the subtraction here

29
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,490
as well.

30
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,200
We're going to say that X minus Y equals X, minus Y.

31
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,190
We use the minus symbol to do subtraction.

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,710
Down here we say X times Y equals x times Y using the asterisk.

33
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,350
And down here in the last line, let's say X divided by Y equals x slash Y.

34
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,840
The slash is the division symbol.

35
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,760
If we run this, we have four lines saying six plus two equals eight.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,890
Six minus two equals four and six times two equals 12, and six divided by two equals 3.0.

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,160
Notice that the division returns a float value.

38
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,190
Well, let's move on to something a little more complex.

39
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,130
Let's add one more variable called Z.

40
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,550
We're going to feed a seven into this one.

41
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,880
And the first thing I'm going to do is show you what's called a flow division.

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,020
And what is a flow division from a division is an operation that divides two numbers and rounds the

43
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,050
results down to the nearest integral.

44
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,450
So it'll be the same than doing a regular division.

45
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,940
But if the result is a floating number, it deletes any decimal number and leaves only the integer.

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,040
For example, seven divided by two should be 3.5.

47
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,860
But if we do a fraud division, we get three, because the point five will be eliminated.

48
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,030
So let's try it.

49
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,100
We're going to do a print statement.

50
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,650
Let's make it a literal string.

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:29,860
And we're going to say Z divided to the floor of Y equals and how we write throw a division Z slash

52
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,280
slash.

53
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,000
Why?

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,250
This is different than a regular division.

55
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:40,390
Here we would use only one slash and when we run it, we get seven divided to the floor of two equal

56
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,840
three.

57
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,820
Not 3.5, which would be the exact outcome of seven divided by two, which is the division to the floor.

58
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,960
Now let's learn the modulo or mod operator.

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,380
The modulo returns back to the reminder of a division.

60
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:02,310
In other words, if you do a division and after you get the result here, there is a reminder that is

61
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:02,850
the modulo.

62
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,970
For example, six divided by three equals two and there is nothing left over.

63
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,540
So the modulo of six divided by three is zero.

64
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:19,110
But if we do seven divided by two, how many times does the two fit completely inside?

65
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,500
Seven.

66
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,130
If it's three times an even when we have a reminder, we cannot include two for a fourth time.

67
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,430
Right.

68
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,490
So that reminder is the modular modulo.

69
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,070
Then in this case we can say that one is the modulo of seven divided by two.

70
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,380
So let's say in execution, we're going to print it also with the literal string.

71
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:48,210
We're going to open the quotation marks and we're going to say That's Z, modulo Y, which is two in

72
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,250
this case, is equal to.

73
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,750
And how do we write it?

74
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,240
Well, we use the percentage symbol.

75
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,610
So in this case, it would be Z percentage Y, that's Z mode y.

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,730
Let's run it to check that seven modulo of two is equal to one.

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,980
As we calculated, this type of division is also never done in real life, but we use it a lot in programming

78
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:17,700
to detect what a number is, even because if we try any number mod two and its result is zero, it means

79
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,050
that there is nothing left over.

80
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,480
That is to say it is even.

81
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,180
So it's a clever way to discover odd numbers.

82
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,250
So let's look at the powers now.

83
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,200
Let's copy this over here.

84
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,260
And let's drop X to the power of Y.

85
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,850
Is equal to X and we put twice the asterisk symbol and then y.

86
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:45,230
These two asterisks is what tells Python that we are going to power a number to another factor which

87
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,500
can be two, three, four, ten or whatever you want.

88
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:58,100
So if we run this, we get six to the power of two is equal to 36 because of course, six times six

89
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,180
is 36.

90
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,370
And let's check this another way.

91
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,920
Let's copy it and let's power something.

92
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,870
But this time, to the power of three.

93
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,870
We're going to say the X to the power of three.

94
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,040
I don't have a variable for three, so let's just write three in here.

95
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,320
Is equal to x.

96
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:24,330
Three and we run that and it's going to tell us that six to the power of three is equal to 216.

97
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,360
Great.

98
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,300
And finally, let's learn the square root.

99
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,000
We're going to print one more line here and we're going to say that the square root of we're going to

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,230
delete everything that follows.

101
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:41,750
We open up a set of keys and let's say I want to know the square root of six, for example.

102
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,960
So I put the X, the word is.

103
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,460
And then I should write the operation for the square root, which is first the value you want to take

104
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,010
its root 0.5.

105
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,590
The results of an operation where you have some value to asterisks and 0.5 is going to give you the

106
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,250
square root.

107
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:08,450
And if we run this here, we have the square root of six is 2.4, four, nine, and so on.

108
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,860
And in fact, this result gives us the basis for what we're going to learn in the next lecture, which

109
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,330
is how to round numbers.

110
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,650
So don't miss it.

111
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,960
Feloni Waiting for you in the next lecture.
