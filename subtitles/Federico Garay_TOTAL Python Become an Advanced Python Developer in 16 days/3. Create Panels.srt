1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,440
It's time to set up our application structure, which, as you can see, will be divided in three big

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,160
sections top panel, left panel and right panel.

3
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,010
The top panel will only contain the main title, and that's all in the left panel.

4
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,230
We're going to put two submenus.

5
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,370
The one above will include lists of food, drinks and desserts, and the one below will include costs

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,080
in the right panel.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,030
We're going to add three sections.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,770
Top section will be a calculator.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,260
The middle section will be the printed check and the bottom section will be a couple of buttons with

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,850
which we can use our app.

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,120
So let's begin with the top panel of our app.

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:56,410
We'll type top panel and create a variable named top panel which will be equal to frame, which is a

13
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,630
t k into class, used to create frames in which we can add more elements.

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,800
Now we have to add some settings inside its brackets.

15
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,250
So let's start with location, which will be application.

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,160
It will have a very thin edge.

17
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:22,360
Ed, let's put one because I'm I'm fond of minimalism and will add a relief which contains five options

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,110
flat raised, sunken groove and Ridge.

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,880
So this lets you configure the 3D effects on the edges of the panel.

20
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,780
You should try all of them and see which ones you like the most.

21
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,810
I prefer flat since it's the minimalist one.

22
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,750
So now that I've decided how my panel will look, I'll put it inside my application.

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:53,710
So I call top panel pack and I'll input in the brackets where I want to place my panel side equals top

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,020
and let's execute it.

25
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,180
And the top panel is not visible.

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,320
Why so?

27
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,910
Because we haven't set up any size and we haven't added any element.

28
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,740
So here it is.

29
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,250
It's just a tiny white pixel that you may not see.

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,590
But don't worry, we'll make it visible soon.

31
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,980
So what are we going to add to our panel?

32
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,390
The title, which will be inside a title tag.

33
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:26,620
And let's create the title tag variable which will be equal to another t k enter element, which is

34
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,560
label and we'll set it up.

35
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,750
So where are we going to put our title in top panel?

36
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,360
Then what text will it contain?

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,510
Well, text equals invoicing system.

38
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,940
So what about font colour?

39
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:51,190
Will define this with FG, that's foreground and I'll choose Azure four, which is one of the options

40
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,430
from the table of colours that you can use in TK Enter.

41
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,870
So I'm going to press enter so as not to exit the screen.

42
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,850
As long as we are inside the brackets, we won't move to the next line.

43
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:11,140
So let's choose a font type with the font property and now we open brackets to define this.

44
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm going to choose Dosis and you can pick whatever font type you like.

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,120
So the size will be 58 and this will be the title fund.

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,830
So it has to be big.

47
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:32,320
The background BG will be the same as before Burley Wood and now we need the tag width, which will

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,400
be 27.

49
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,910
So I got this number after running some tests as well.

50
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,290
All right.

51
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:46,060
I've designed the tag so I can call title tag, dot grid, and we can create a kind of grid inside the

52
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,930
top panel.

53
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,370
Then we can choose which row and column a tag will be in, since our tag will be the only element inside

54
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,810
the panel will simply put zero in row and column.

55
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,300
So this may be a little confusing, but as soon as we configure the other panels, you'll understand

56
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,790
the role played by rows and columns.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,160
So we have a title tag ready.

58
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,700
Will we be able to see something on the screen there?

59
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,930
It is awesome.

60
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,110
We have the top panel and it's nice edges.

61
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,300
So far so good font and background go well together too.

62
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,080
Okay, let's keep on creating elements.

63
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,280
Now it's time to create the menu, which is the left panel.

64
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,220
Let's type left panel here.

65
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,250
And this panel will have its own variable so as to create another frame like we did before.

66
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:46,780
And let's set the left panel up so as to add to it application, because this panel will be outside

67
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,740
the top panel.

68
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,300
The left panel will have the same edges and relief as the top panel.

69
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,610
And now we have to place it somewhere by typing left panel pack.

70
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,460
And the side of this panel will be left, since it has to be on the left side of the screen.

71
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,570
So if we printed it now, we'd see a tiny white spot again.

72
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,630
So let's continue with our configuration.

73
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,040
So here should go the cost panel, which contains subtitles and all that.

74
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:23,020
So Cost panel will be a variable named cost panel that is equal to a frame which will go inside left

75
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,620
panel.

76
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:30,250
The edges of this frame will also be equal to one and its relief will be equal to flat as well.

77
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,610
So let's place it somewhere on the screen by putting cost panel pack and.

78
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,180
This time it will be on the bottom side of our left panel.

79
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,630
Now, let's continue with food panel, which, as you can see, should be on the top left corner of

80
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,620
the left panel.

81
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,090
So food panel has a variable named food panel, which is equal to a label frame element.

82
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,320
It's neither a label nor a frame, but a label frame.

83
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,040
We're talking about a frame which contains a built in tag.

84
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,940
So we'll place it on the left panel and the tag will contain a text reading food.

85
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:15,030
So let's choose a font by using font, which will be equal to doses in brackets.

86
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,820
Its size is 19 and it's in bold, comma and enter.

87
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,520
Its edge will be equal to one.

88
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,680
And relief will be equal to flat.

89
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,250
Foreground will be equal to zero four.

90
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,650
And food panel is ready.

91
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,880
So let's call the food panel pack so as to place it.

92
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,400
This panel will be inside the left side of left panel, and that's it.

93
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,990
The following one is the drink panel, which will be quite similar.

94
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,910
So let's copy and paste.

95
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,020
I'll pass on a handy tip to replace food with drink, so I have to position myself at the end of one

96
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,470
of them.

97
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:02,220
Press alt and without releasing click on the end of each food and I have several cursors.

98
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,490
Then I can delete and type drink.

99
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,800
And I just did that once, but I could change all the words I selected if I wanted to.

100
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:18,180
This is a label frame that goes on the left panel and it should say drink, starting with a capital

101
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,780
letter.

102
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,890
Its characteristics should be exactly the same as before, and it should go to the left, too, because

103
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,930
this panel was placed on the left.

104
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,080
This other panel will be further to the left.

105
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,670
So now we have to create the dessert panel.

106
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,800
Copy and paste.

107
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,430
Select delete and type dessert.

108
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,950
The rest is just the same except for this, which just starts with a capital letter.

109
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,570
So in case you're wondering how this looks like, we can execute it.

110
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,920
And here we have our tiny little spot containing all the panels.

111
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,720
Soon we'll be able to see them.

112
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,650
The time has come for us to create the right panel.

113
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:06,080
So let's open a call to right panel containing a variable named right panel.

114
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,610
And let's add a frame which will be stored in application.

115
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,340
Its edges will be equal to one and its relief will be equal to flat.

116
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,430
So let's type right panel pack so as to place it on side equals.

117
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,150
Right.

118
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,290
And that's it.

119
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,570
Keep in mind that right panel contains three elements a calculator, a check, and some buttons.

120
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,500
So let's create the calculator panel first and its variable calculator panel.

121
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,020
This element will be equal to a frame whose location is right panel.

122
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,190
Its edge is equal to one and its relief is equal to flat.

123
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:56,470
We also want its background to be the same as the one we've used before, which is Burley Wood.

124
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,730
Now we have to place it, so calculate the panel pack, but we don't have to type anything here.

125
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,840
Why?

126
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,010
Because this panel will be placed on the top section by default.

127
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,420
Let's copy, calculate the panel and create a last two panels.

128
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,210
Let's make several selections so as to type in voice panel, which is the middle one.

129
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,110
So this is a frame of the right panel.

130
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,830
Its edge background and location are the same as before.

131
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,180
Since the top section has been used, this will be placed automatically.

132
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:41,690
And now our last panel, let's make multiple selections and type button panel and let's leave the rest

133
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,200
as it is and let's check if it works.

134
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,770
Here we have a window which doesn't show anything we've done so far, regardless of all our hard work.

135
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,750
But don't get upset.

136
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,920
Everything that we've created is ready to be displayed in the following lesson.

137
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,500
Only the final touches are missing.
