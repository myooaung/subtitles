1
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,940
Finally, we have to activate the reset button.

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,050
This one here.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,160
Then our program will be ready when we finish programming.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,940
This button will delete everything in the text boxes and deactivate them.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,440
In addition, this button will delete the updated checkboxes.

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:29,540
Empty these boxes here and delete the invoice we have just issued in order to start issuing a new one.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,840
It's not complicated, actually, so let's do it.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,130
We just have to add one more command to this last button, which is in index three, and this function

9
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,930
will be named reset all.

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,130
Of course, the software is complaining as we haven't created that function yet.

11
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,650
So let's scroll up to the function section and let's create reset.

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,220
All of function doesn't receive any parameters.

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:02,750
It should start by deleting the check and we'll do that by writing one single line of code invoice,

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,310
text delete.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,610
And this will delete everything from beginning to end.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,140
We delete the check with this?

17
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,860
So let's try it.

18
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,970
We just pick one chicken and we issue the check.

19
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,360
Click on Reset and the check is gone.

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,590
Now this button will delete the text inside the food boxes.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:29,120
So we'll start a four loop so that for each text in the food text list, it will make text set B equal

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,870
to zero.

23
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,440
We'll repeat this in drink and dessert.

24
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,550
So we type drink here and dessert here.

25
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,750
Let's test it.

26
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,900
In order to fix any problem we might find.

27
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:50,370
We pick one chicken, one juice, one ice cream, and we issue a check and we reset.

28
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,220
Now, every box was reset to zero.

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,820
Now we'll make the boxes remain deactivated.

30
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:04,050
Do so we'll start another loop for each box in the food box list.

31
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:12,450
We will configure each box dot config that there states change to disabled and when we repeat this process

32
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,690
so that it also works for drink and dessert.

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,840
Replace the words and that's it.

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,550
Let's test it again by doing the same as before.

35
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,830
Now invoice.

36
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,700
And when we click on Reset, the boxes are deactivated.

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,980
Now we need another loop to deactivate the checkboxes.

38
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,390
This time we will iterate over each var found in food variables.

39
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,580
Remember that food variables is where the check button value is stored.

40
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,830
It can be zero or one.

41
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,100
In var will add a set starting at zero, which means it is deactivated.

42
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,590
Let's copy this loop so as to use it in drinks and desserts.

43
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,340
Let's run a new test to check if it's working.

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,590
And let's click on Reset now.

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,380
And the checkboxes are deactivated, too.

46
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,770
Now, these boxes need to be deleted as well.

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,930
We'll have to do them one by one.

48
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,030
Let's make food cost.

49
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,880
Var have a set in an empty string.

50
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,430
Let's copy this variable and paste it five times as there are six boxes.

51
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,780
One for drink cost.

52
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:35,250
Another one for dessert cost via another one for subtotal via another one for taxes var and the last

53
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,750
one for total var.

54
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:45,480
We're almost done but test by selecting more elements this time we'll have a lot of things.

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,800
Since it's our last try, let's pick for kebab.

56
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,940
Five beers.

57
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,550
Three COLAs, and now let's execute it.

58
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:03,190
We issue a check and when we click on Reset, everything is reset to zero so that we can issue a new

59
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,760
check.

60
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,850
Our invoice system is ready.

61
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,190
Congratulations on getting so far.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,590
It was quite intense, wasn't it?

63
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,330
So let's get some rest and tomorrow is going to be unforgettable.
