00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.400
So we know how to ask for the day of the week.

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.250
Let's close and delete this and minimize this function and minimize this other one so that everything's

3
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.330
nice and ordered.

4
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.150
Hey, we have a lot of spaces.

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.960
That's better.

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.580
The following will allow our assistant to be able to tell us the time.

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.060
So we put in form what time it is.

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.480
And this function will be called ask time.

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.450
Remember that for now, all these functions are separate.

10
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.620
They aren't integrated into anything as of yet.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.870
At the end of all the functions, we shall create the request center, which will be capable of combining

12
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.060
everything that we're doing into one function.

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.750
Okay.

14
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.830
This function asks.

15
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.390
Time will have a variable with time information.

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.120
Let's create a new variable called time, which has a date time.

17
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.650
Date time now.

18
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:12.480
And if I print this time on screen and then make a call to ask time and execute, I'm informed of the

19
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.970
year, the month, the day, and then the hour, the minutes, the seconds, and finally the milliseconds.

20
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.190
But I don't need to see all of this.

21
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.360
I only need the hour and the minutes.

22
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.360
Also, I want it to be said in a more pleasant way, not just a series of separate numbers.

23
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.700
So within the function, after this print, I will make it so it can say the time.

24
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.550
And this I can do with speak.

25
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.890
And here we put time.

26
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.620
And I will show you what happens if I execute it.

27
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:52.830
Now, as it is the 8th of August, 2020 207 colon 46 colon 01146318.

28
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.380
So clearly like this, it's like a robot telling me the time, but I want it to sound more like a human.

29
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.360
Because if we are being precise with the information, we don't talk like that.

30
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.150
So what we need to do is give it a format.

31
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.540
So let's overwrite the variable time before pronouncing it and we're going to make it so time.

32
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.900
It's equal to a little string which says, at this moment it is.

33
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.770
And here we call time so we can extract hours and we say it is X hours.

34
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.930
And now we call time dot minute to obtain this information.

35
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.780
And here our little string ends.

36
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:41.160
Now, if we execute our assistant again, at this moment, it is 7 hours and 47 minutes.

37
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.120
Perfect.

38
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.410
Now we know the time, and my assistant pronounces it in a much more understandable way.

39
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.850
So you can change this phrase so it says your name, that it includes a greeting, or so that it's said

40
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.830
in a different order, however you like.

41
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.490
So we're ready to make more magic in the next lesson.
