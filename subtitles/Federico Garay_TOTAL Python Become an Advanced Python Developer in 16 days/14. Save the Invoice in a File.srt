00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:12,860
Last lesson, we learned how to issue a check, taking into account everything the diners had.

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,130
And we also learned how to do it using the invoice button.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,040
Now we're going to learn how to use the save button so as to save our invoice as a text file.

4
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,710
This won't be as hard as you may think, because we'll just have to follow three simple steps.

5
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,950
First, we need to configure this button accordingly.

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,450
Let's go to this button located in index two and we'll assign a command to it.

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,090
This is a call to a function we haven't created yet, which will be named save invoice.

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,000
And our software complains, of course.

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,280
Now we'll go to our function so as to create the new one save invoice.

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,240
And once again we'll need to import some elements we don't have yet.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,010
From TK Enter will import an element named file dialog and another one named Message Box.

12
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,560
In our function we'll take all the text from invoice and we're going to store it in a variable.

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,820
It will be named invoice info which will be equal to invoice text, the variable in which we entered

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,160
all the inserts during our last lesson.

15
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:23,390
So let's call the get method in order to obtain its contents and we'll get whatever there is from the

16
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,810
beginning with 1.0 up to the end with end.

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
Now we have stored all the invoice information in a variable.

18
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,410
We'll create a file.

19
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:39,550
Now it can be named my file and it will be equal to a file dialog element.

20
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,110
Don't ask save as file.

21
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:48,020
I think it's pretty obvious title inside it's brackets will have to enter two things.

22
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:57,530
First, a mode which will be w the right mode and second default extension which will be equal to text.

23
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,660
Therefore, our file will have a text extension by default.

24
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,920
So my file is the variable that will contain this file.

25
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,200
Let's call my file.

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,360
Right and here we'll type invoice info and that's it.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,670
Now we have to close it.

28
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,290
So let's use close.

29
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,650
And once the file is saved, will inform the user about it.

30
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:28,550
So let's call message box with the show info method which will ask for a message header.

31
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,490
Let's put notification and then your invoice has been saved and that's all.

32
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,680
So let's try it.

33
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,130
Let's pick one chicken, one kebab.

34
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,320
Two COLAs and two brownies.

35
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,540
Now that we're full, we'll ask for a total and invoice.

36
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,250
And now we're going to save it.

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,550
When we click on this button, we have to choose a location.

38
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,790
I'll save it with the rest of today's files.

39
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,420
Name it.

40
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,400
Invoice one and save it.

41
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,190
And now I see the message.

42
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,940
All right, we accept.

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,100
And if we go to the folder, we'll come across our invoice one.

44
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,570
If we open it, we can see all the information regarding my purchases.

45
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,580
This is huge.

46
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:22,390
Now for the final touch will generate code for the reset button, which resets everything to zero so

47
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,060
that we can assist another customer.
