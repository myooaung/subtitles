1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,840
In order to use some of today's tools, we will need to install an extra resource, which is the C compiler,

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,830
so that we're going to visit the Visual Studio site.

3
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,800
Of course, I'll leave the link in the lesson resources and once there you'll install the community

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,710
version which you're seeing here on the screen during the installation process, which we are going

5
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,770
to do by yourself as it is quite intuitive.

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,690
At some point you're going to come across this window where you can select some options.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,500
It is very important that you include this add on called desktop development with C++.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,800
Once installed, we can go back to pie chart.

9
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:55,340
Now we need to install some libraries that are necessary to do facial recognition, but this time we're

10
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,060
not going to do it through the console as we have done so far.

11
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:05,360
Because I want to show you another way to load Python libraries direct from pie charm without leaving

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,870
here.

13
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,570
So what we do is come to file and to settings and then this window is going to open here and we're going

14
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,800
to go to project.

15
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,030
Here we are.

16
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,270
We're going to choose Python interpreter.

17
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,680
And here this system is going to show you all the libraries that you already have installed.

18
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,320
The ones you see here are mine.

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,880
Yours may be different.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:33,560
To install a new library, click on the plus sign, which is here and this box will open and show you

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,090
all the existing libraries.

22
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,340
And you're going to look for one of the ones we're interested in, which is C make.

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,160
And here it's going to appear for you to choose it.

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,880
Here you see a description informing what this library does.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,080
The latest version that exists, the author and the version.

26
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,520
If you don't want the latest version, you can click here and choose another version.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,400
But generally, you'll always be fine with the latest unless you find there are some bugs in it or it's

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,960
not compatible with something.

29
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,480
And then you can go back to another version.

30
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,460
Finally, you will click on install package as I have already installed it.

31
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,870
I'm not going to do that.

32
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,420
So once you do that, you're going to see that there's going to be a bar that's going to fill up down

33
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,850
here until the library is complete.

34
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,220
And once you're done with CMH, you're going to go on to four more libraries.

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,480
One is the library, and you install that as well.

36
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,230
Then we do the same with the most important one face middle hyphen recognition.

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,360
And you will find this one here.

38
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,510
Then we're going to need NumPy to do some calculations that we're going to need.

39
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,210
So let's delete here and put numpy.

40
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:54,360
This library is also very important for operations with numbers, which we'll see later in the course.

41
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,010
And finally, open CV, middle hyphen python.

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,940
This is another important one which you are also going to install.

43
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,280
And once you have these five libraries installed, we're going to import two of them for now to start

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,910
working.

45
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,180
The first one is Open CV, which is actually imported in the following way.

46
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:21,810
Import CV two and the other library that we're going to install in this first practical lesson is face

47
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,710
recognition.

48
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,720
We do it with import face underscore recognition.

49
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,550
Note that here it should be written with underscore, not the middle one.

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:39,090
And a trick that is also important to know when we have a library with such a long name like face recognition

51
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,530
that you have to write it many times or it takes a lot of screen space.

52
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,710
We can shorten our code by giving it a nickname.

53
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,900
So then when importing it, we put at the end as f r.

54
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,810
By doing it this way, we are giving it a nickname.

55
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,460
From now on I can call face recognition just by typing f r.

56
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:06,300
Then if I put a dot, I can see all the methods that correspond to face recognition without having to

57
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,590
write the whole thing.

58
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,650
So now we have what we need to start working.

59
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,380
So let's get down to work in the next lesson.
