00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.610
So everything about web scraping has been quite theoretical, but let's put it into practice.

2
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.310
In my web scraping file, which I've just created, I'll import the libraries I installed.

3
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.790
So you're supposed to have them before starting this lesson.

4
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.130
So we'll import beautiful soup for and requests and we'll work with HTML soon.

5
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.530
So let's leave this as it is for now and go to the browser to see how it looks.

6
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.070
We're going to work with w the we the without video school dot com and I'll leave you the link in the

7
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.940
resources.

8
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.280
In addition, I advise you to use Google Chrome to follow me during this lesson.

9
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.970
What we're looking at here is the front end, which means that when I searched for the video school

10
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.260
URL, this website sent some information in code format to my browser, and my browser knew how to display

11
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.010
everything.

12
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.770
My browser read that code and said, okay, I have to put these letters here, this video here, that

13
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.530
background image there and so on.

14
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.690
So where is that code?

15
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.020
If we want to see it, we have to right click on any blank space on the website to see the option view

16
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.160
page source.

17
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.910
Here we see an extensive document containing loads of information, and here we have some elements that

18
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.330
we saw in the last lesson, but they are more complex and are linked to other elements that we don't

19
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.050
know yet.

20
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.190
So up here there's a command saying something like hi browser.

21
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.470
The following is a HTML file.

22
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.750
Treat it as such please.

23
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.140
So we have the first tag name head here.

24
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.060
Everything that follows belongs to that tag and it ends here.

25
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.330
So as soon as that tag ends, we have another one named Body, which contains the website's body, which

26
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.460
takes up the whole page and we'll see it ends where the code ends.

27
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.600
So finding something by scrolling up or down is quite difficult.

28
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.860
So fortunately we can employ the strategies of web scraping if we want to find a specific paragraph

29
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.490
or search for less than symbol and P.

30
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.520
So that is to see where the paragraph begins.

31
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.080
And here we have it and we can see where the paragraph ends too.

32
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.700
So look at this.

33
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.060
There's a paragraph that reads, We'll teach you the skills.

34
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.030
But if we look at the code, there's a tag containing style attributes which tell us how the text will

35
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.670
look on that website, which corresponds to S.

36
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.250
So here you'll find everything I explained to you and more.

37
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.060
In the previous lesson, working with HTML and CSS files can be quite challenging.

38
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.180
So pretty basic what we've just learned.

39
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.190
So let's close this.

40
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.060
And suppose we want to find this image inside the code.

41
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.650
Well, right click on this logo and click on Inspect.

42
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.160
This opens a new window in the browser which is selecting this element, and this is the same code we

43
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.000
saw before, but it is focusing on the chosen element and we can see where our logo is created.

44
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.650
So this image is in the IMG tag, which contains information about source, which says where that image

45
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.520
is stored.

46
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.270
And this is the link where the image is actually located.

47
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.270
This information on style.

48
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.510
Then there is class and the more information containing size, height, etc..

49
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.990
So all this information is about that image.

50
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.150
And if we want to search for some paragraph like this one, we have to right click on it and click on

51
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.050
Inspect.

52
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.220
Then we'll be able to look for that paragraph within the code.

53
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.550
So here is where the paragraph starts.

54
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.940
So we see that font weight is 400.

55
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.940
And we see the text itself.

56
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.140
And here is where the paragraph ends.

57
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.810
So the whole paragraph is here.

58
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.690
So what if we want to edit what's inside the paragraph or any part of the website from here?

59
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.380
So let's pick this title and click on Inspect.

60
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.640
Here we have it and we double click on where it says Learn creative skills and let's type learn python

61
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.360
with us.

62
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.100
Press enter and that's it.

63
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.240
We've changed the title, but don't panic.

64
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.490
We're not altering the website itself.

65
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.030
If you open it right now, you won't see the new title.

66
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.430
But the original one, because we changed the instance of the web that is saved on our computer.

67
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.670
In fact, if we refresh the page asking the website to send the information again, we'll see the original

68
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.420
title.

69
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.860
We can't modify the server in which this whole file is located.

70
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.790
Not unless we are administrators as visitors.

71
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.710
We can only change what we are seeing on the.

72
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.220
Screen right now.

73
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.630
Well, this tool will help you find everything without so much trouble.

74
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.530
And if you're planning on scraping webs, you should delve deeper into HTML and CSS as they will enable

75
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.280
you to read and interpret all of this much better.

76
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.920
So now we're going to learn how to use Python from PY charm in order to get more information on this

77
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.210
particular website.

78
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.470
Let's go.
