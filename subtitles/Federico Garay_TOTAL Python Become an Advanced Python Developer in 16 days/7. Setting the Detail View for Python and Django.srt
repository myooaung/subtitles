1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,400
Now it's time to configure the detailed view.

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,750
So what is this?

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,730
It is a page in our application, which opens when the user selects an item from the list.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,310
So let's say I click on buy tomatoes.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,040
In that case, it should open a page showing us all the details of this task and all the information

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,290
that corresponds to this list item.

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,310
So we're going to have to create a view for this detail page.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,820
We're going to go to our view files and we're going to copy all this input that we did from the list

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,840
view and paste it in and do something very similar because we're going to change list the detail.

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,080
And what we're going to import is the detailed view.

11
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,220
We're going to create a class for this element.

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,690
I'm going to name it task detail.

13
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,170
And this class is going to inherit from detail view.

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:58,920
Inside it.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,230
We're going to start to create the content we're going to do as before, and we're going to make it

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,710
a model that is going to have task as its content.

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,770
And this is going to be the model for this class.

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,430
Now we're going to create another HTML file to use as a template so that we can see these elements.

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:26,520
So new file and we're going to name it task detail because that's the name that's going to be automatically

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,960
generated for this file.

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,690
Then we'll see how to rename it.

22
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:37,890
But just as the previous one came task list, this one will take task as its name and add detail to

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,010
it because that's the default name for the detail view.

24
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,810
So don't worry.

25
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,140
We'll see later how we can reassign it to a name of our choice.

26
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,710
So here we have this new HTML and we're going to create a template for it to display our content.

27
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,220
We're going to recreate a header with H one, which is a tag that is going to contain for now the word

28
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,140
task colon.

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,450
And then we're going to assign a content to it.

30
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,660
For now, I want you to see what it looks like.

31
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:14,880
In order to display it on the page, we need to come to the URL's file, which is on the base in addition

32
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,570
to importing into the pending list.

33
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,660
We're also going to import into task detail so we can see it on the site.

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,840
So we're going to copy this whole path because we also need to have a path for this URL.

35
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,200
We're going to add a second element and we're going to put in another path, but this one now needs

36
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,230
to be adapted to lead to the detail page.

37
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,350
Well, when the browser looks for the detail page, it's going to look for a path that contains a primary

38
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,260
key, which is in our context is task.

39
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,360
So this here, instead of being empty, will contain the keyword task.

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,910
That is to say that after the URL of our site will come a slash with the word task.

41
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,330
For now, of course, this doesn't show anything, but if we add that, it's going to be able to get

42
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:10,680
to the tasks and then we'll come back here to set it up and we put task and a slash for the number of

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,190
the task.

44
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:18,150
It's about as we can't put the number here because it can be one, two, three, etc. depending on how

45
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,730
many tasks we have, we're going to tell it that it's going to be an integer colon.

46
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,150
And here the acronym peak for primary key.

47
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,930
So as we said, task is the primary key and it's going to take an integer to peak.

48
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,190
And with this, we're going to be able to build routes that look like this.

49
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,590
First, the original URL.

50
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,720
Then slash task.

51
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,840
And then slash with the number of corresponding task.

52
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,310
When you see it in action, this is going to be very easy to understand.

53
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,970
And what we also need to do here is to replace pending list as view by task, detail as view.

54
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,360
And we're also going to change the name of this page so that instead of pending, it is task.

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:11,010
Then we already have the URL to get to our detail views and we already have the view inside views,

56
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,830
which takes us to the template of detail view.

57
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,180
Then we can test it.

58
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,440
So we're going to come here and we're going to type in, slash task, slash one.

59
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,430
And here we have a page that says task and a colon.

60
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,040
And remember that we are looking at this template that we have here and it doesn't have any special

61
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,150
content right now.

62
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,660
If we look for task one or two or whatever, it's always going to show us the same thing.

63
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,900
So far, we've only configured how to get there and we still need to configure what should be displayed

64
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,350
there.

65
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,940
So now let's see how to pass information to it.

66
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:59,040
Let's go to the task detail HTML file and we'll ask it to show us a variable after task and the colon.

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:06,960
Remember that in Django we passed them with double brackets and the word object, which is also a default

68
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,540
word.

69
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,810
We'll learn how to customize this name.

70
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,770
Once we put this in.

71
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,770
We just have to refresh and we have the text two is milking the cow.

72
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,130
If we put in task one, we will get mowing the lawn and if we put in task three by tomatoes.

73
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,460
So this would be the link to get us to each of the tasks.

74
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,980
And of course we still need to make it possible for the user to get there in a more direct way through

75
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,500
a link that he can click on in the task list and get to the details of each one of them.

76
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:45,000
So now let's customize this name object, which we have here to represent what we want.

77
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:52,080
Let's come to views and let's come to our class and let's add a context object name, as we did before,

78
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,230
which is this case is going to be task.

79
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,550
The previous one you can see here was tasks for pending list, but this one is singular task.

80
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,500
So now in the HTML we can change objects to task and it still works the same, but this time with a

81
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,550
custom name chosen by us, which makes the code easier to read.

82
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,600
And finally, what I want to do before finishing this lesson is to overwrite my template so that it

83
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,690
looks for a name of my choice and not for this task detail that was generated by default.

84
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,520
I'm going to rename this file through refactor rename it, and I want it to be called simply task.

85
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,340
This is so that when you want to create your pages, you can give them any meaningful name you choose.

86
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,810
With this, we refactor them and it already has a different name.

87
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,450
And now, of course, if the code goes looking for it, it won't find it because the name has changed.

88
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,880
In fact, I'm going to prove it to you.

89
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,020
Let's refresh.

90
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:01,390
And it tells us that it doesn't exist because it's looking for task detail, but the file is no longer

91
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,110
called that.

92
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,390
So we're going to change the name it's looking for by going to views again.

93
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,530
Here it is.

94
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,500
And we're going to add another parameter which is going to be template name and it's going to be equal

95
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,710
to base slash task HTML.

96
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,730
That is whatever name I assign to my file.

97
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,070
So if I come back here and refresh now, it's going to search for it by the name I've chosen.

98
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,400
So now we know how to generate our detailed views.

99
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,650
And we're going to go to the next lesson to continue working on developing links that will take us to

100
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,440
the Views page from the task table.

101
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,390
See you in the next lesson.
