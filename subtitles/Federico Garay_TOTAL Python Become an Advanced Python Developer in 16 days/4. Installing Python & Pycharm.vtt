00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.710
For this lesson.

2
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.740
We are going to install the software you need to write your code.

3
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.820
And remember, Python is a language like English or Spanish, so you can write it anywhere in a notebook,

4
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.190
on a whiteboard, on a computer, on a wall.

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.960
And it's always going to be the same language in the same way.

6
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.480
There is a wide variety of applications for writing Python code, and each one offers advantages and

7
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.410
disadvantages.

8
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.340
We call these applications Ides, which stands for Integrated Development Environment.

9
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.420
So these applications are virtual environments that integrate all of Python's functionalities so that

10
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.890
you can develop code in them.

11
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.280
Because actually, if you want, you can write your code in a simple notepad and it would still be Python.

12
00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.540
But a good idea does things like assisting you with code structure, helping you to detect, resolve

13
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.050
and debug errors, running simulations and more.

14
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.880
In other words, a good idea makes your life as a programmer much easier, so it's time to choose one.

15
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.970
We have two and there are so many options.

16
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.050
I don't want to decide for you, but I am going to give you my recommendation on which idea to use to

17
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.720
learn Python in this course, since it is also the one we are going to be using throughout the course

18
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.120
on screen and it's called PY charm.

19
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.560
We use it because it's powerful.

20
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.470
It's interface is simple, it's help system is very clear and complete and well because it's the one

21
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.120
we actually have to use in real life.

22
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.640
But before you install PI charm, you need to install Python on your computer.

23
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.560
I'll leave you and Federico as hands who will guide you throughout this process.

24
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.120
So let's go and do that.

25
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.350
Thank you.

26
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.800
Fail.

27
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.750
And that's exactly what we're going to do.

28
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.570
We're going to install both Python and parts on your computer and we're going to do it all together

29
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.860
so there won't be any problems.

30
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.630
The first thing you're going to do is go to the python dot org site where you have all the documentation,

31
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.280
the software and much more.

32
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.740
It's the official Python site.

33
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.480
Of course, at the time you log in, it may look a little different than it does in my case.

34
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.560
This is always being updated, so don't worry.

35
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.000
But you will surely find the link that says download in which you will find the system recognizes your

36
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.020
operating system.

37
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.060
In my case, Windows.

38
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.710
And here I have the newest, most current version that exists on Python so far.

39
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.210
You may see a newer version.

40
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.560
So let's click here to start the download which is already being done on my system.

41
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.690
What I do is click here to bring up the runner.

42
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.120
We click on Run and I've got some options here.

43
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.840
The first thing we're going to do in this window is make sure that the ADD Python 3.1 checkbox is checked

44
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.440
to the path.

45
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.400
So we're going to click here and then install now and we're going to then start installing it.

46
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.980
So as you can see, it's done very quickly.

47
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.330
It takes practically nothing.

48
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.160
And in a couple of seconds, we already have all the code and all the libraries and all the stuff we

49
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.400
need so that a computer can understand the Python language.

50
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.490
So a few seconds more and we have it ready.

51
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.810
And so we get to this window that tells us that the installation has been successful.

52
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.290
It may appear below in this blank space here, a warning that allows you to choose if you want to disable

53
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.580
path length limit.

54
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.730
If that appears, please enable it and then you are ready to hit finish here and now I've installed

55
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.080
Python on my computer.

56
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.420
If you are a mac user, don't worry.

57
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.520
The process will be quite similar to this one.

58
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.790
Quite intuitive to follow and you won't have any complications.

59
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.270
If you do have any questions, please leave them for me in the Q&amp;A area.

60
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.840
So now we're going to install Page.

61
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.300
We're going to go to the Google Page to search for it here.

62
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:02.110
Note that we are going to do it now is install the software or idea that we are going to use throughout

63
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.140
the program as an interface to program with Python.

64
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.550
Here you simply search for pie charm and surely the first option that will appear is this python the

65
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.470
python idea for developers.

66
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.580
You can come here or directly to download page and it will take us to the official page.

67
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.160
Our site is coming here.

68
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.130
I'll also leave this link for you in the lecture resources if you want to access it directly from there.

69
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.920
And hey, we have two options to install either the professional version or the community version.

70
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.830
We're going to choose the community, which, on the one hand is free and has everything we need to

71
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.280
work with.

72
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.590
Python, a high level professional, has some more features it has cost.

73
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.910
You can try it for free and see if it works for you.

74
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.010
But to start working with Python and start learning it with the community, you will be more than satisfied.

75
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.610
A few more things on this site before we move on to what's next.

76
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.960
You can see the system requirements here.

77
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.350
Must meet all these for Pi Chung to work well on your computer.

78
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.350
The installation instructions, which is basically download it and run it and nothing else.

79
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.430
So let's go here to download and here it starts to install the parts of installation run on my computer

80
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.700
and once it's done downloading we can click on the installer.

81
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.370
So this is going to start the installer running.

82
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.470
We actually choose run and this is going to be pretty intuitive and easy to follow.

83
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.910
We choose next.

84
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.860
Then we leave the default path or choose another one if you want.

85
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.250
I recommend to leave this one.

86
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.690
So we go to next.

87
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.740
And here the only thing we cannot if we want, is the desktop icon.

88
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.140
We click here and nothing else.

89
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.520
The rest check it.

90
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.290
But I would leave it as it is.

91
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.690
We do next then install.

92
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.260
And now?

93
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.800
Yes.

94
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.630
In a few minutes we have patch installed and once this software has been installed on your computer,

95
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.700
this window appears confirming it.

96
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.100
So you can click here to run it now.

97
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.960
But let's show you how to open it.

98
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.490
It's very simple.

99
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:08.330
We do finish and then now you can look for the icon on your desktop or come to the Windows System icon

100
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.320
you will find here.

101
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.110
PY From Community Edition, we click on it and it will open for the first time as we as we run this

102
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.580
program the first time it will ask as if we were going to import the py settings.

103
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.740
We're going to leave it in.

104
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.210
Do not import.

105
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.970
That opens as it comes by threefold.

106
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.730
And this would be the welcome screen where I'm going to change something before we continue, which

107
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.040
is going to be the customize and personalize.

108
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:41.970
So here you can choose what kind of Internet interface you want in terms of color scheme and dark color

109
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:48.250
is perhaps the nicest because it's dark to lose your eyes, to be relaxed and not disturbed by the guy.

110
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.900
Irish colors.

111
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.920
We also have this combination which is whiter, brighter.

112
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.750
But it may not be the most pleasant to work with at night especially.

113
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.230
But during the course I'm going to use this high contrast wall.

114
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.260
While it's not the nicest of them all, but because it's quite garish, I think it's the one that is

115
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.360
the best contrast to show you all the functions in text on the screen as I work on my computer.

116
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.200
So I recommend dhokla, but you can choose any option you like.

117
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.420
So here you can increase the font size of our software, not the text of the code.

118
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.620
We will see that later.

119
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.290
But if I set, for example, 18 this enlarge the whole size in which you can see the letters.

120
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.820
I think this is a bit too much.

121
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.700
I'm going to leave it at 14 for my taste.

122
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.760
It's going to be fine and you have more options here.

123
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.430
But with this to start with, it's going to be fine.

124
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.080
We can go to projects.

125
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.880
Then here you are going to choose if you're going to work with a new project or if you are going to

126
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.650
see a project that you've already started.

127
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.480
I'm going to show you how to create a new project in this lecture so you'll be able to start in the

128
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.290
next lecture.

129
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:59.460
So we click on the plus, and then when we come to this, the first screen, which is the one you'll

130
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.950
see whenever you want to create a new project.

131
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:08.260
When a project is going to have a lot of Python files because you can create a lot of code which interacts

132
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.520
with each other and then you decide where you're going to save that project.

133
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.130
By default here, it gives you a path.

134
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:22.120
I'm going to work with a folder that I'm going to create on my desktop directly to work much more comfortably

135
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.360
there.

136
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.340
So we open my computer.

137
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.680
We're going to go to desktop and this is where I'm going to create my folder.

138
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.540
Of course I'm going to name it because right now my photo doesn't exist yet.

139
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.310
We do it with the backslash and we're going to name it Python.

140
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.870
Nothing more than that.

141
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.500
You can leave the rest as it is to start with.

142
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.770
You learn later what each of these options is for.

143
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.930
But for starters, we're good to go.

144
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.200
So we're going to click Create and this is then we're going to take it to the first run of our software.

145
00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:02.080
You may get a message from Windows Defender at this point that say something like this regarding your

146
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.310
computer security.

147
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.610
You can click directly on fix and that will resolve it.

148
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.780
It's fine.

149
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:15.590
It doesn't appear to me because I have already installed the software before, like many softwares.

150
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.290
This one also starts with the tip of the day.

151
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.480
It's not really something I pay much interest to, so I'm going to ask you to stop showing me these

152
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.800
tips and clothes and move on to running our first instance of PI.

153
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.090
So here we are in Patch on the proper pie chart.

154
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.100
And to maximize it.

155
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.910
And I'm going to ask you not to panic if it looks too complex what you're seeing.

156
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.440
We're going to get to know this interface step by step as the course progresses.

157
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.630
We're going to go from simple to complex, and you're going to master it without any fear.

158
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:54.350
We're going to close this file that we have here that's called Main, which is a class that is generated

159
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.160
by default.

160
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.800
So you'll see this a little bit less overloaded.

161
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.540
Our interface has a column here where we're going to be looking at some options.

162
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.340
This can be hidden or shown again because it's not the core of our work.

163
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.590
Everything important is going to happen in this larger area here, which is where we're going to write

164
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.070
our code.

165
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.710
The rest of the tools for working on our code.

166
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.250
So we're going to concentrate on this area primarily.

167
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.430
We're going to learn what's here in the menu bar.

168
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.940
We're going to learn some tools here that are very important.

169
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.070
But for now, we're just going to stick with what we've opened in pie chart and we're going to create

170
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:36.680
our first file inside the project that we've named Python, which is the folder that I created, remember.

171
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.020
And here it is.

172
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.760
So if I right click here, I have the option to choose new file.

173
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.890
If I choose a new file here, I have to name it and I can name it.

174
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.720
For example, first project.

175
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:57.790
But I'll show you what's going to happen when I hit Accept here with Enter, it's going to ask me to

176
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.840
choose what kind of language it is that I want to have in this file.

177
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:08.080
And I want it to be Python so I can come here and choose Python and then start working here.

178
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.560
So I have that option and I have to.

179
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:17.260
I have my first choice here, open matching files in py charm and then python.

180
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.950
But we're going to make it easier so you don't get too complicated.

181
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.820
We're actually going to come to python right click new file.

182
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:32.170
We could choose Python file here and this would say also save as that step it opens the Python file

183
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:32.950
directly.

184
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:40.030
But if we put file as just now and I want to put first project so it doesn't ask me later what kind

185
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.830
of file I want, I just put dot p y by putting it this way.

186
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.100
I'm already telling it that I want to work with Python language.

187
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:54.280
We hit enter and here is our first project created with the first line ready and the cursor blinking

188
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.810
for me to start typing.

189
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.520
I looking forward to it.

190
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.640
And the next lecture we're going to start writing code.

191
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.530
So thank you very much.

192
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.810
And now we'll see you in the next lecture.
