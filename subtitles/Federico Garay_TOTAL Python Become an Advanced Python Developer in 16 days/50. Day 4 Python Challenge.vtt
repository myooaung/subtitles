00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.100
As we learn to program the number of problems we can solve with code also increases.

2
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.210
This implies that our challenges are going to be harder to solve.

3
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.850
You already know how to use comparison and logical operators, how to control flow and loops.

4
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.320
You know, super useful statements such as random zip range and more.

5
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.020
You are now ready to go up a level and I will ask you to program something a little more complicated

6
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.550
than what we have done so far.

7
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.610
Today, you are going to create for the first time a fully functional game with which you can even have

8
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.690
some fun yourself.

9
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.170
The task is this the program will ask for the user's name and then it will say something like, Well,

10
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.070
John, I've thought of a number between one and 100 and you have only eight tries to guess it.

11
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.470
What number do you think it is?

12
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.800
On each try, the player will say a number and the program can answer for different things.

13
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.310
If the number the user said is less than one or greater than 100, it will tell them that he or she

14
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.520
has chosen a number that is out of play or something like that.

15
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.550
If the number the user chose is less than the number the program thought of, it will tell them that

16
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.610
the answer is wrong and that he chose or she chose a lower number than the secret number.

17
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.750
If the user chose a number greater than the secret number, it will let them know that that it was greater.

18
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.540
And if the user got the secret number right, they will be informed that they have won and how many

19
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.280
tries that has taken them.

20
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.640
If the user has not guessed correctly in their first attempt, they will be asked again to choose another

21
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.760
number and so on until they win or until their eight attempts are done.

22
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.590
So are you up for it?

23
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.090
Of course you are.

24
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.250
I remind you the same as always.

25
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.810
The most important thing is that you accept this challenge, that you have a good time trying.

26
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.850
It's going to be hard, but don't worry about it.

27
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.690
Try to figure out each step.

28
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.420
You know that from what you've learned in this course so far, you have all the knowledge.

29
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.680
It's somewhere in there.

30
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.330
Maybe you have to go back, rewatch a lesson, relook at some of the things that we've programmed so

31
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:27.560
far, but know that you are able to do this and no matter what, even if you get stuck, try spend some

32
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.960
time with it and then we'll follow up and Federico will show you exactly how to do it.

33
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.740
So on to some good music.

34
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.360
A hot or cold drink, depending on your mood.

35
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.580
The time of day, a quiet corner.

36
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.320
Let's get over to program.
