Hi.

2
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.910
I was waiting for you to get here.

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.050
I'm full of energy because today will be a very important day.

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.530
Why am I so excited?

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.760
Because today you will expand your knowledge and capabilities almost twice as much as they are so far.

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.990
Today, you will finish the day programming a game called Guess the number where the player will have

7
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.380
eight attempts to guess a number from 1 to 100, and the program will give clues at each attempt.

8
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.670
When the player succeeds, the program will let them know how many tries they have made.

9
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.280
Yes, you will be able to do this in just a couple of hours.

10
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.740
Of course, there's a lot to learn first.

11
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.100
And as I've said before, it's very important stuff.

12
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.700
You're going to learn the comparison operators in depth, which we saw a little bit yesterday.

13
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.750
You're going to learn how to use the logical operators so that you can combine many comparisons at the

14
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.680
same time.

15
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.130
You are going to learn to control the flow of your program, enabling it to make decisions on the fly,

16
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.100
which will allow your system to choose whether to execute one block of code or another, depending on

17
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.930
the conditions that are presented.

18
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.830
You're going to learn to create blocks of code to be repeated many times and thus begin to automate

19
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.850
processes.

20
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.260
And then you will learn a series of super useful statements.

21
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:41.120
It will be like opening a new toolbox full of utilities such as range statement, enumerator, zip,

22
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.040
random and so much more.

23
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.860
And although you might not know what this is right now, by the end of the day, you will and you should

24
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.380
be super excited to start learning.

25
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.800
It's going to be a long day, so let's get to work.
