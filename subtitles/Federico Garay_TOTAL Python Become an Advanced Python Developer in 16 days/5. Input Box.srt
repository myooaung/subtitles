1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,150
Our application contains a list of all the products and their chat buttons.

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,780
Now we have to add an input box beside each product name so that the user can specify how many items

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,280
the customers bought.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,420
So we need to add a third column to each list and we're going to do it with loops and create food.

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:34,320
Items will create two more lists because we'll need a series of variables which store text boxes and

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,980
another variable which stores the text of those text boxes.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,070
So Food Box will have an empty list for text boxes and food text will also have an empty list, but

8
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,950
for text created inside the text boxes, then we'll enter our loop again.

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:01:00,630
Keeping in mind that we need two blocks of text that are separated, the first one is to create check

10
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:08,280
buttons and the second one goes before counter and will be to create input boxes.

11
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,400
That way everything is neatly arranged.

12
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,310
Instead of having this mess of properties and attributes, we're going to arrange them vertically like

13
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,030
columns.

14
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,130
As a result, we'll be able to display what's inside of each element more clearly.

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,830
I think this is way much better.

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,610
So now let's begin with our input boxes.

17
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,990
Let's create an element for food box, dot, append, and we're going to add an empty element just so

18
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,100
that it exists.

19
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,730
Now let's create a variable for food text using append so that we can call it later.

20
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,990
Now it's time to call Food Box along with its index counter, which will be different according to each

21
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,950
loop iteration and this will be equal to input box.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,060
So what do you call this element inside TK into?

23
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,160
It's called entry.

24
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,380
Consequently, each element of the list will be an input box.

25
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,200
And what will our input box have?

26
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,840
It will have a location.

27
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,880
It will be in food panel.

28
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,890
Then it will have a font equal to Dosis, which is the one we're using.

29
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,120
This time the size will be 18 and it will be in bold.

30
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,800
The edge will be equal to one like the one we've done so far.

31
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,340
Width equals six and finally its state will be equal to disabled.

32
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,610
Therefore this box will be deactivated so that we're not able to enter an amount until the checkbox

33
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,630
is activated.

34
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,910
There's one fundamental attribute missing that would be text variable.

35
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:54,600
In this way, we can associate it with a text variable, which in this case will be food text with its

36
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,920
index counter.

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,000
So the text in this box will be linked to the corresponding text variable and we've created our input

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,630
box.

39
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,700
Now we have to place it inside the panel that contains all our elements.

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,020
It must always be next to each checkbox on the same row.

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,110
So instead of putting it in column zero like checkboxes, we're going to put them in column one, which

42
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,490
is the one on the right.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,820
So food box index counter grid will be equal to row, equal to the number of counter so that the value

44
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,860
decreases as we move forward.

45
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:39,000
The column will be the same for all the input boxes and it will be column one this time.

46
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,270
So this should be enough in order to have input boxes for each food, let's execute it.

47
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,350
And here we have chicken and its input box deactivated.

48
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,150
We can't type anything there.

49
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,720
Then there's the rest of the plates and their text boxes.

50
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,650
Now we have to do the same with drink and dessert.

51
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,170
I'm sure you already know how to do it.

52
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,270
It's basically the same as we've done so far.

53
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,730
So let's copy these two variables and paste them on drink and type drink.

54
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,440
We're also going to paste them on dessert and change these words.

55
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:21,460
Then we have to re-establish the structure of food, will copy, create check buttons and add drink

56
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,060
to it.

57
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,030
So we'll create some line breaks in these properties so that they look more attractive.

58
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,280
If you already got the hang of this, you can do this without watching or listening to me.

59
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,660
It will be better for you.

60
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,850
So let's copy this block in order to create input boxes and paste it on drink.

61
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,450
Replace food with drink and that's it.

62
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,840
Now we have to do the same with dessert.

63
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,830
Let's organize these properties in Python.

64
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,320
Readability is paramount.

65
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,580
The better you can read your code, the faster you will be as a programmer.

66
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,200
So we'll create the input boxes here by pasting the same block and will replace each food with dessert.

67
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,790
Excellent.

68
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:16,120
Now we execute it and we'll see that all of our products have input boxes a complete success.

69
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,420
Congratulations.

70
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,560
So let's go to the next lesson so as to take the next step.
