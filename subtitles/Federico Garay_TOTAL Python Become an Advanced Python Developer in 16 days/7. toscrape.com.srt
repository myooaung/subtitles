1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,870
So it's time for us to start focusing on our next project and to take into account everything we've

2
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,560
learned in order to carry out the web scraping on a real website.

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,900
Because so far we've just learned how to extract one single element from one single site.

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,390
For our next lesson, we're going to learn how to extract different elements from different sections

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,740
of the same website.

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,570
To do so, we're going to use this website named to scrape dotcom.

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,140
You can find the link to this website in the resources.

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,350
This is a website that lets us put into practice web scraping freely since all the images and texts

9
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,670
are copyright free.

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,730
We can take whatever we want and do anything with it.

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,950
To scrape, Dotcom has two sections books and quotes.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,220
We're going to use books, which is fictional online bookstore that contains many examples, such as

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,920
books, product details and more.

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,140
If we click on any book, we'll go to a site containing details such as reviews, cost, title, image,

15
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,170
description and other related products.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320
It indeed resembles a real online bookstore.

17
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,880
So we're going to use this website to put everything into practice.

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,100
So let's establish a goal.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,830
As web scrapers, we have to obtain titles of all four or five star books.

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,650
To accomplish this goal, we'll use everything we know, plus a few more things, because not all the

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,710
books are listed on the same page.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,220
And that's the challenge.

23
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,620
Note that there are thousands of results and we're shown one out of 20.

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,290
If we want to see the rest of the books, we'll have to enter one page at a time.

25
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,290
So we must find out a way to programmatically browse each page and extract information from all the

26
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:55,890
books.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,400
Another challenge is that not all of them are five star books, and we want the titles of those books

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,860
containing four or five stars.

29
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:12,330
Therefore, we shouldn't download this book, this or this, but we should download this as it has five

30
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:12,960
stars.

31
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:20,160
As a result, our program will have to ensure that one part of the HTML code is the condition to be

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,040
met in order to download another part of that code.

33
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,360
So don't worry.

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,290
I'll soon tell you which part of the code is in charge of that.

35
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,960
Anyway, these are today's challenges.

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,440
We'll learn new things in order to respond to those challenges.

37
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,360
And at the end of the day, we'll have sharpened our web scraper skills.

38
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,880
So let's get to the next lesson and find that solution.
