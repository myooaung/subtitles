1
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,380
Let's start to create our app by importing dt k into.

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,990
We have to import everything from it.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,600
So we do so by adding an asterisk and now we can use all its tools.

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,230
Let's clarify everything that we do.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:33,380
Let's initialize T.K. into through a variable and let's name it application and it will be equal to

6
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,320
T, k, capital, t and brackets.

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,430
If we put application and a dot, we can see all the t k into methods and properties.

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,460
So now after initializing the t k into window, it must stay open.

9
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,060
And remember that when a program closes, when its code stops executing, we lose everything we were

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,630
doing.

11
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:04,380
Therefore, here will type prevent window from closing and it will include a call to application dot

12
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,330
main loop.

13
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,000
This creates a kind of loop that is constantly executing itself.

14
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,300
Hence our code doesn't stop executing and our window remains open.

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,620
So we haven't set up anything regarding our window yet.

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,140
And if we want to see it, here it is.

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,860
It's very small and we can see t k up here.

18
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,040
We can maximize it and close it.

19
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,140
Now we'll begin to configure different features according to our needs.

20
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,200
First, we want to set up a specific size.

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,240
So we'll add window size.

22
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:46,580
We'll call application and call the geometry method, which requires the window size and location parameters.

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,440
First, we'll set the window size up, always in quotes.

24
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,570
In this case, it will be 1020 by 630.

25
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,850
So where does this number come from?

26
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,700
So I ran some tests while designing the application, so I came up with this nice size.

27
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,860
It's likely that you don't remember the number of pixels by heart when setting up a window.

28
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:15,290
You'll figure it out as you add or remove elements, and then you'll be like, okay, this.

29
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,640
This is the size I want.

30
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:25,280
After entering 1020 pixels in width and 630 pixels in height put plus so as to configure where you want

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,510
your window to appear.

32
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,860
I want it to appear in zero on the x and y axis.

33
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,780
In other words, my window will appear on the top left corner of my screen.

34
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:43,370
We'll see that after executing, however, the user will be able to maximize it and that will ruin everything

35
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:43,940
we do.

36
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,960
So we have to make sure that the user can't maximize the window.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,690
We'll type prevent from maximizing through application dot resizable and we'll enter values that the

38
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,310
size cannot be changed.

39
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,520
Let's execute this once again.

40
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:09,170
The maximized button has gone and if we position ourselves on the edge, we won't be able to expand

41
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,640
or contract our window.

42
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,870
That's great.

43
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,490
Let's now set a window title which appears up here.

44
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,800
So far it says TK.

45
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:25,880
We set it through application dot title and remember that if you want to change things that I didn't

46
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,090
teach you in this lesson, you have to do your own research.

47
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,970
So add a dot and check if there's anything that can help you do what you want to do.

48
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,830
Right now we need a title, so we put one that we like in brackets.

49
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,580
I'm going to put my restaurant invoicing system.

50
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,520
Let's execute again and perfect.

51
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,070
My restaurant invoicing system looks nice.

52
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,370
Finally, I want to set a background color because I'm not quite keen on this pale gray.

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,210
So window background color, application config.

54
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,650
And this lets us manipulate a lot of our attributes, but we just need BG for now, which stands for

55
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,430
background.

56
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,710
If you enter a specific color in quotes, your window will have that color.

57
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,570
So we can put colors like blue, orange, white, among others.

58
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,150
But those colors are pretty basic.

59
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,030
As you know, there are many gradients, so I advise that you do two things.

60
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,850
Use the RTB system which we have learned about how to use before, or add the lists of colors that I've

61
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,200
left in the resources.

62
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,640
These are all the colors available in TK Enter.

63
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,500
They include the IGP and hexadecimal numbers in order to use them.

64
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,590
So if I want to use this one named Burley Wood, I can type it here.

65
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,040
Burley Wood Now I execute it.

66
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,920
And so I added salmon, which goes.

67
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,870
Well with the other colors, I want to add.

68
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,760
And that's what I plan on doing.

69
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,840
So this is all concerning our window configuration.

70
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,410
For our next lesson, we're going to add elements like panels, buttons, text boxes and so on.

71
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,590
So let's keep on moving forward then.
