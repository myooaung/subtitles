00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.600
This is going to be one of your favorite lessons because it is short but important.

2
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.200
What we're going to do is add links so that once we are in our base page, on the home page of our site,

3
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.630
we can visit each of the items in our list by clicking on a link which they will have next to them.

4
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.290
And so we can easily see the details pages which for now we only know how to access by typing the full

5
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.160
URL.

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.040
So to be able to do this, let's go back to pie.

7
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.100
Let's go to the HTML file of the home page of our site, which is tasks, lists.

8
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.070
And here we'll replicate this line.

9
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.610
Remember what we have here.

10
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.430
We have a table row that then has thanks to a loop, a row for each of the task titles.

11
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.520
So what's going to happen when we duplicate this?

12
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.510
Think of it as a table within the same row.

13
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.570
We will have two table data sets, i.e. two cells side by side.

14
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.350
Although here in the code they're on top of each other.

15
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.760
What you will see inside the page is a cell first and next to it.

16
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.130
Another cell in this second cell is where we're going to put the link.

17
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.970
So we leave TDI so that it starts in the same way.

18
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.480
But instead of putting title, we're going to put a link tag.

19
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.800
Link tags are written with a what is the text I want the user to see in the link.

20
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.460
Well it can be C details for example.

21
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.680
So next to each of the items in the list, we're going to be a link that says C details.

22
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.120
I think that's pretty clear.

23
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.380
So we're going to configure where we want that link to take us.

24
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.450
So we're going to go here inside the opening tag of a make a space and we're going to set up the r f

25
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.510
parameter which stands for reference.

26
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.650
Basically, it's the URL that takes us to the desired site.

27
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.440
So we're going to put this inside square brackets with the percentage signs.

28
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.630
Here, inside is where the URL is going to go with the name task.

29
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.220
And then outside the single inverted commas, we're going to put task ID so that it establishes the

30
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.410
number that corresponds to that task.

31
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.480
So with this, we have set it up and let's do something to make our table look good.

32
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.440
Think that if our table now has two columns, the column with the title and the column with the link,

33
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.400
then we will leave the second cell of that empty row so that this element will not be collapsed and

34
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.240
will remain in row one of our table.

35
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.120
With this, we we are ready.

36
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.580
We go to our page refresh here and the link appears next to each of the elements.

37
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.270
If I click here, it takes me to milk the cow.

38
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.030
If I go to the bottom one, it takes me to mow the lawn and so on and so forth.

39
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.650
Let's move on to the next lesson to make this more and more interesting.
