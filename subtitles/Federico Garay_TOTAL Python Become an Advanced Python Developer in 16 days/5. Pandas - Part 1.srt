1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,340
In this lesson, we're going to start getting to know the second pillar of data science, which is the

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:20,390
PANDAS Library, with which from Python, we can work with our data in a more elaborate way than with

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,960
NumPy.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,130
In fact, pandas, as we already said, is built on top of numpy.

5
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,510
And as we also said before, it is a kind of python excel.

6
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,600
So here you have to read a little introduction in this booklet, which I will also leave for you to

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,860
connect from your own drive and from the link that I will leave you in this lesson.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,630
Here you have the official documentation of pandas and don't forget to visit it.

9
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,580
It will be your ally.

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,620
These libraries are so immense that we cannot go through them all in their richness.

11
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:57,650
But I'm going to show you how to get to know them so you'll be able to start using them as soon as you

12
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,670
finish this lesson.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,280
The first thing we do, like any of the library we need to incorporate into our code, is to import

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,670
it.

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:14,630
We put import pandas and by custom we import it as PD so that we can then run it under that abbreviated

16
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,110
name.

17
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,690
So first, let's see, what are the series Inside Pandas?

18
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,500
PANDAS has some data devices, mainly series and data frames.

19
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,680
Let's start by looking at what a series is.

20
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:37,520
So we're going to create a series of numbers in this case, and we're going to find it's mean we're

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,060
going to create numbers, which is going to be the same as P, the Object Point series.

22
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,780
And here we're going to create a series inside the brackets.

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:58,920
But as a list, we're going to put one, two, three, five, 67, 35, 235 and 62.

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,390
Then inside the same cell, we're going to call numbers and we're going to apply a method called Mean.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,770
This method is going to give us the mean of this series.

26
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:18,540
So by executing, we can know that the mean of this series of numbers is 51.25.

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,890
For now, we're not discovering anything that we can't do in other ways.

28
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,200
But now we're going to try to find the sum of all the numbers that we have in our series.

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,140
We do this by calling numbers again and applying a different method, which is called Sum.

30
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,880
We execute and the sum is 410.

31
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,440
These series objects have many more methods and parameters that you can discover by playing around,

32
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,410
you know, by putting the dart and seeing what it has or by going to the documentation.

33
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,270
So now let's create a different series, a series that doesn't have numbers but strings.

34
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:05,130
We're going to call it colors, and it's going to be the same as a panda object of type series.

35
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,580
And it's going to have a list of strings which are going to be red, yellow and green.

36
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,370
We're going to leave it with three elements.

37
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,870
So we've run this and now colors already exists.

38
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,040
So we're going to display this list, we call it.

39
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,510
And here's the list.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,860
See how it looks.

41
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,370
It no longer looks like a string of elements, one next to the other, but they appear in this little

42
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:39,030
table or mini table, which is sorted with the index number, then shows the value and finally tells

43
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,220
us that the data type is object.

44
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,550
Now we're going to create a different but similar series that is going to contain types of cars.

45
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:55,230
We're going to call it cars, and it's going to be the same as a panda object that has a series that

46
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:01,170
contains a list with, for example, sedan, SUV and pickup.

47
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,770
We call it execute.

48
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,650
And we have here another table with the same format, but with different content.

49
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,380
And here comes the interesting part.

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,220
I told you that PANDAS has, on the one hand the series, but it also has the data frames.

51
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,690
A data frame is a set or a structure of organized data.

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,110
And here we're going to create it by combining the two series that we have created so far, which were

53
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,560
colors and cars, and how do we create it?

54
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:42,780
We set another name, which can be car table, which is going to be the same as a panda object, which

55
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,470
this time is not going to be a series but a dataframe.

56
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,610
So inside the parentheses, we're going to create a dictionary.

57
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,080
So we call the braces to put the key, which in this turn is going to be the one that is going to appear

58
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,950
as the header of the column, which is going to be called car type.

59
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:08,790
We'll put a colon as in any dictionary, and the value that this key is going to contain is going to

60
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,120
be the variable cars that we have created above.

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,380
So we put a comma to go to the next element of our dictionary whose key is going to be called color.

62
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,410
And this is also going to be the header of the column, and the content is going to be whatever is in

63
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,700
the variable colors.

64
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:32,340
So we already have a car table to which we're going to call to be able to visualize.

65
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,960
We execute it.

66
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,330
And look what we have here.

67
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:43,410
It's the double entry table that has rows ranging from 0 to 2 and also some headers which are the keys

68
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,370
of our dictionary and the content organized in a single table.

69
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:54,120
Data frames are very powerful, but not so powerful if they're construction depends on so much manual

70
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,170
data entry.

71
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,870
So far, we can't do anything in a more practical way than in Excel.

72
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,940
So why is it useful to work with pandas?

73
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,390
Well, to work with much larger databases, which you can directly import and analyze in a way that

74
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,550
other programs do not allow us to do.

75
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,590
So here we're going to move on to the second part, and which we're going to see how to connect to this

76
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:22,650
notebook that we have here with our drive disk so that we can take any file that we have from there

77
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,940
and we can bring it here.

78
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,910
So we're going to leave that for the next lesson, where we're going to learn how to connect our notebooks

79
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,440
to our drive files.
