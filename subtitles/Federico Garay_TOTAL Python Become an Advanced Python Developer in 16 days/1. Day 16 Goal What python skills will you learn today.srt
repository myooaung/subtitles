00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,470
We've got into day 16 a day we must not forget, because you are going to learn one of Python's main

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,590
applications Web development today.

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,930
You're going to learn how to create websites with Python, and we're going to meet Django for that.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,870
Django is a framework for web development.

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,880
When we say that it is a framework, we are saying that it is not only an application that we incorporate

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,810
to Python, but it is a whole framework to develop websites.

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,820
Django allows us to manage both the front end, which as we have already learned, is the part of the

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,790
website that is visible to the user as well as the back end, which is the back end site, the data

9
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,220
and the calculations the user does not see.

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,950
In the next lecture we are going to learn what visual environments are in order to create our site.

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,400
Virtual environments are super useful tools to work on our computer with different packages that are

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,070
separate so that they don't clash with each other.

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,390
And the project that you are going to do today is the creation of your first website.

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,380
You're going to create a web application that helps manage a to do list.

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,820
On this site.

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,930
Users will be able to create a user account log in created to do list, edit tasks, delete them, mark

17
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,410
them as completed and search for tasks by keywords.

18
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,680
First, we will create the structure and functionality of the site through Django and HTML and then

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:36,090
we will apply style styling through some CSS codes that your site changes from looking something like

20
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,250
this to something like that.

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,090
Super professional with an intuitive, modern, visual language.

22
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,800
This is going to be a long day.

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,700
So let's jump into action by clicking on the following video right now.
