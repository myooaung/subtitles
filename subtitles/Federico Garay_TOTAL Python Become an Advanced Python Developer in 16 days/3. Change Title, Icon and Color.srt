1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,900
So you already know how to open a screen in which your game can be executed.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,170
Next step is learning how to customize such screen.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,250
In this lesson, we'll change the by game default icon.

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,620
This title and the background color.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,000
This code will be long and contains several compliments.

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,760
Therefore we'll leave comments so as to always remember the task carried out by every block of code.

7
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:42,170
This is used to initialize PI game and this line is used to create the screen and this is the game loop.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,960
So let's move forward with our code.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,320
Always clarifying the intended function of each block.

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,530
Remember that this is really useful.

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,790
We'll adjust the title and icon settings before the loop.

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,060
So here we'll type title and icon.

13
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,940
Now let's call PI Game and you'll notice that every time we change something regarding our PI game,

14
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:12,290
library will need to start by calling PI Game dot, followed by something else in this case display.

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,840
Now we'll call set caption which will give us the window title that will appear here.

16
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,320
This will be named Space Invasion.

17
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,440
You can pick any name you want and if we execute this, we can read space invasion up there.

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,270
This needs a proper icon now, which we can find on the internet.

19
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:40,520
Of course I use flat icon, but you can use any of the page to search for PNG and other types of images.

20
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,720
I'm not related to flat coin, it's just a page I use.

21
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,610
As you can see, I'm searching for UFOs and I'll choose this one.

22
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,170
And if I click on this image, I can download it in different sizes.

23
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,080
I'll choose 32 pixels, which is the right size when using icons, not big drawings.

24
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,850
So now I click here and this downloads the image in my computer.

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,900
I'll save the image in the same folder I'm working with in Python.

26
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:15,350
So I'm going to drag the image right to the folder containing the main program and notice that in pie

27
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:22,160
charm we can see that besides main in day ten I also have UFO, which means I can use it.

28
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,550
Its name is UFO, P and G.

29
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,810
So let's store this image in a variable so as to use it.

30
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:38,120
From there the variable will be named icon and will be equal to pi game dot image, dot load.

31
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,140
And that's how we store the image in the icon variable.

32
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:52,310
And how can we change this image into an icon for our window like this pie game, dot display call set

33
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:58,430
icon and pass icon to it, which is the name of the variable containing the image.

34
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,700
And if I execute it, I can see the little alien beside the title space invasion.

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,950
So what I want to do now is to change the default background color, which is black.

36
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,310
So let's position ourselves inside the for loop because everything that will be updated in our game

37
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,470
has to be inside the game loop.

38
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:27,740
And let's call the screen variable, the one we created before and the fill method fill will require

39
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,910
us to enter a combination of colors in our GB format.

40
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,040
So in case you're not familiar with this, our GB stands for Red, Green and blue.

41
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,270
Here you have a web page in which you can learn how to use it.

42
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,060
Just add values to red, green and blue, and this will make all possible colors.

43
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,510
If we enter zero here, we make black.

44
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:57,230
For instance, if we enter the highest number in green, which is 255, will create vivid green.

45
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,090
And if we want to use blue instead of green, we just enter 150 and that's it.

46
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,120
So if we add 150 in red, we make violet, and that's how we can create colors.

47
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:15,560
So let's create the tuple containing three values inside screenshot fill where we can enter our GB.

48
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,670
I'll pick a color I really like and it's a kind of violet.

49
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,160
You can choose any color you want, of course.

50
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,530
So we're likely to change colors as we move forward anyway, and that way we'll be able to combine them

51
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,540
better with the rest of the elements.

52
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,650
All right.

53
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,200
If I execute this, my color doesn't appear.

54
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,110
That's why I typed it inside the loop.

55
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,940
It's a command that requires the screen to be updated in order to change this green color.

56
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,750
So after establishing this green color will call PI game display update.

57
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,850
And we'll use this method after choosing the background color to update our screen.

58
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,540
And here we can see our screen with the color I picked.

59
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,160
Now this looks better.

60
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,290
Our program is getting better.

61
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:00,950
You don't want to.

62
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,290
Ms..

63
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,230
What's next?

64
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,720
So I'll see you in the next lesson.
