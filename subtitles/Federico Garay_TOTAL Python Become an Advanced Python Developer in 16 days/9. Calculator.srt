1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,590
Our invoice system is missing only one feature now a calculator.

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,860
And this is the last step in the appearance process.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,410
As you can see here, our calculator is basically a grid with four columns and five rows.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,850
The first row would be the display, which occupies the four columns.

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,960
Numbers and mathematical symbols will appear there as we use them.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,770
Basically, we have numbers and mathematical symbols which are aligned in the right column and the bottom

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,040
row.

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:43,280
We have the C button to get the total, the delete button and the zero button which is missing.

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,030
This is what we're going to build right now on pie chart.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,500
So let's add another section to our code calculator.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,880
Quite long.

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,200
Our code, isn't it?

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:01,550
Let's build the display first by creating a variable named calculator display which will be equal to

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,240
entry.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,770
So we've done this before.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,830
Now it's time for us to customise it.

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,390
Firstly, let's decide on a place which is calculator panel.

18
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,880
Secondly, we decide on a font which is doses size 16 and bold.

19
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,450
Then we add the width, which is 32, so as to occupy the total width of our calculator.

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,730
The edges will be one as usual, and that's everything regarding the display.

21
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,550
Now we have to locate it on the panel.

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,640
So calculate the display grid.

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,800
And since it will be at the top, it has to be in row zero, in column zero, and for it to span across

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,200
the four columns will add the column span property, which will be equal to four.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,080
If we execute this, we'll see the calculator display ready just above the check space.

26
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,750
Now time to create the buttons.

27
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,000
We'll create them using a loop.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,570
Otherwise we'd have to write like a mile of code lines.

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,300
There are 16 buttons, so we need to create a loop in order not to write code for 16 buttons.

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,470
We're going to make a list with the names of our buttons.

31
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:20,270
So Calculator Buttons is a list containing everything we're seeing here, and we'll enter the numbers

32
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,420
from top to bottom and from left to right.

33
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,920
So we type seven, eight, nine and plus sign.

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,480
Remember to include quotes.

35
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,260
And next line, four, five, six, and the minus sign.

36
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,810
Now, one, two, three.

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,680
And multiplication sign, which is lowercase x.

38
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:49,370
Now, for the last row, we add the total button, which is c, e, then delete zero and the division

39
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,100
sign, which is the forward slash.

40
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,930
Well, we have the elements representing the buttons.

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,000
Now it's time to create our loop.

42
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,540
But before doing that, I will add some variables necessary to place the buttons in rows and columns.

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:12,910
One variable will be my row and will initialize with one because row zero it's already taken up by the

44
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,570
display.

45
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:20,140
Another variable we will be my column which will initialize with zero because we're going to create

46
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,990
columns zero, one, two and three.

47
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,380
All right, let's start our loop.

48
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:34,140
For each button in the calculator buttons list, we have to make button be equal to a button element

49
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,750
from t k into uppercase.

50
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,840
So how are we going to set up our button?

51
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,930
Each button we create with our loop will be located in calculator panel.

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,360
Each of them will contain a different text because they need to contain whatever there is in the calculator

53
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,230
buttons list.

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,450
That's where we store their names.

55
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:04,560
So just like before we call button title so as to add the name of each button as text font will be dose

56
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,380
size 16 bold foreground will be white.

57
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,110
This is the font color background will be as your four.

58
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,750
So there are two features left.

59
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:22,660
We want the edges to be equal to one and width to be equal to eight so as to occupy our panel's total

60
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,110
width.

61
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,480
This loop creates 16 buttons since it will iterate over each of these elements.

62
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,310
However, we then have to replace them and this could get a bit tricky.

63
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,940
Button up grid.

64
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,280
And now we have to make them place themselves in their corresponding rows and columns.

65
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,930
So row will be equal to my row.

66
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,890
The variable we created before and column will be equal to my column.

67
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,190
But we're going to manipulate these values in each loop because the first loop will work just fine.

68
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,820
The first button will be placed in row one and column zero.

69
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,720
Perfect.

70
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,900
Now how do we place the rest of them?

71
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,170
Well, since we'll make these variables increase the value as the loop iterates, we'll check if my

72
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,940
column is equal to three.

73
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,050
If so, it will go on to a fourth column which shouldn't exist.

74
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,610
So in that case, we're going to make my row B equal to plus equals.

75
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:25,790
One will be increasing values in my row so that it decreases every time it reaches the third column.

76
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,250
But we also have to make sure not to expand our columns more than what's necessary.

77
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,290
So first we'll expand them by entering my column plus equals one.

78
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:43,760
And once my column has been expanded, we need to ask ourselves if my column is equal to four, that

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,370
means it reached a value we cannot accept.

80
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,510
All right.

81
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,930
In that case, my column will reset its value to zero.

82
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,590
That should do it in case we did everything right.

83
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,280
Our buttons should appear on the screen, occupying the panel.

84
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,020
Each of them is in the right place and you can check for yourself.

85
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,840
Our invoice system panel is ready.

86
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,350
So what follows now is the most interesting part.

87
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,760
We have to program it to carry out its functions just the way we want.

88
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,560
What a challenge.

89
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,610
See you soon.
