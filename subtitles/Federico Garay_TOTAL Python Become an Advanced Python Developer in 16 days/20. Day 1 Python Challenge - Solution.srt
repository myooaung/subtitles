1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,850
How

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,490
did you make it?

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,950
Did you have any complications?

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,070
Did something give you more trouble than you expected?

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,770
Well, if you made it, congratulations.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,690
And if not, don't worry about it.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,760
It is normal to encounter difficulties when we are left alone in front of the code.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,040
And next, we're going to create our solution from scratch.

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,400
And when I say from scratch, I mean from scratch of the file.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:38,840
So let's open a column again so we can select our folder, which in this case is called Python, remember?

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,190
And I've saved it on my desktop here.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,990
I right click to choose a new file.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,580
And this is going to give us the opportunity to create the name of the file, which I'm going to name

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,420
Brewery, because it's to create the brand of my beer.

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:02,320
And I don't have to forget to put the dot p y so the system knows it's a python code.

16
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:10,390
So we press enter, our file is created and here we're looking at the inside of the python folder.

17
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,470
This file we're seeing is already open here so we can start writing code directly into this file.

18
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,040
We're going to choose the column to see a little bit better.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,220
Now, my way of solving this is going to be to start by expressing what it is that I want to be printed

20
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,850
on the screen.

21
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,610
And the prompt that gets printed on the screen is the name of your beer is and then the name of the

22
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:33,940
beer.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,290
So let's do that.

24
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,400
So print is the command for something to be displayed on the screen.

25
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,970
I'm going to put it as I expect it to be displayed.

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:50,050
So we open the quotation marks and we say, for example, the name of your beer is and then comes the

27
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,590
name.

28
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,800
But since we don't know it, we're going to put, for example, word one and word two all in a row.

29
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:04,370
Now remember that we want these two words, the name of the bear to appear in quotation marks, so we

30
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,410
select it completely and put single quotation marks.

31
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,340
So that appears.

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,110
Just like that.

33
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,620
Well, we already have what we need to be displayed.

34
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,790
Now let's design the structure of how we want it to be displayed.

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,200
We want to display first the complete string that says the name of your bear is that leaves this space

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,300
and shows this first quotation mark.

37
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,190
And up to here, we know what we have beyond that.

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,450
No, because we don't know the words yet.

39
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,380
So here we're going to close this string with double quotation marks.

40
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,040
Notice now that I'm getting the following as an error, let's leave a space to put the plus, which

41
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,070
means concatenate with well, with word one, which we don't know yet.

42
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,170
After word one, we're going to need a space to separate both words.

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,070
So we're going to concatenate here with a space between quotes.

44
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,580
It will be a string containing the only a space.

45
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,420
But we're going to put another plus sign to concatenate with word two.

46
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,410
And then we need this last single quotation mark to appear.

47
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,690
And for that, we need to transform it into a string that's going to be concatenated.

48
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,240
And here we can see it all very well.

49
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:26,610
So we zoom in and you can see maybe this is a little confusing, but what we have here is a double quote,

50
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,250
a single quote and a double quote to generate a string that contains only one single quote.

51
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,400
So as you can see, if I get out of this form of this line, the system is understanding everything,

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,450
just just fine, except for word one and work two, which gives me an error because Python says, what

53
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:45,930
is this?

54
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,940
I don't know where to get this word.

55
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,900
One word to.

56
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,490
If it were in quotes, Python would know that it's a string, but it's not.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,260
So where do we have this?

58
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,960
Well, we're going to create it.

59
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,510
And now we're going to replace these words.

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,550
So we need two inputs.

61
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,350
A first input, ASIM.

62
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,750
Something for the user to say, a random word, which is going to be the first part of the Bear brand.

63
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,630
And then we need to ask him a question that we can answer with, for example, the name of a city.

64
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,140
And we're going to say, what city would you like to visit?

65
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,940
So we closed the question, put a colon and leave a space.

66
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,780
That would be the first input we need to replace word one for word two, another input asking him,

67
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,530
for example, something something that he can answer with a color.

68
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,890
And it would be something like, What is your favorite color?

69
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,150
Hey, you can get a little bit creative, generate as many questions as you want.

70
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,950
The answers can be funny.

71
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,450
This this is an exercise.

72
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,290
You have to have fun.

73
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:53,950
So to get creative, well, we already have the two pieces of code we need to replace these words,

74
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,580
and we.

75
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,300
We can do it.

76
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,920
I'll select the first one.

77
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:03,280
I'll cut it with Control X and then we're going to replace it here with Control V and we're going to

78
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,170
do the same thing with the second input that's going to go here in place of word to.

79
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,860
And now we have the complete sentence.

80
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,510
Another thing I'd like to do here is to add a line spacing so that they answered.

81
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,210
That looks to be on many different lines.

82
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,330
For now, we're going to run it to see what it looks like.

83
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,440
Note If I now want to run this with shift F10 that will be executed.

84
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,210
It is not a file called Brewery, but this file is called First Project, which is what we've been working

85
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,500
on throughout this whole day.

86
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,720
And probably if you're following my steps, you also have here first project.

87
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,560
So we can't use this triangle to run it, nor can we use shift F10 as you see here in the shortcut because

88
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,840
that would execute this other first project.

89
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,730
So we'd want to change it to brewery, but if we open here, it's not loaded yet.

90
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,220
There's the main and then there's the first project.

91
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,570
The way to add brewery here for a run option would be to come, to run.

92
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,810
And instead of going as we were always going to the first one, which is shift F10, we're going to

93
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,710
do this other role which is with alt shift and F10.

94
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:17,080
When we execute this one, it's going to give us a choice of which files that exist in this project

95
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,850
are the ones that we want to execute.

96
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,040
And in this case it is brewery.

97
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,740
That is going to be executed as soon as we selected.

98
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,960
And in fact, here we have it.

99
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,280
So before advancing, I want you to see that now Brewery appears in this dropdown and we can choose

100
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,820
it to make the execution from now on with shift and F10.

101
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,070
Well, let's come to the code.

102
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,780
And here it says.

103
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,640
What city would you like to visit?

104
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,890
Well, look, the truth is that I'm dying to visit Barcelona, so let's put this.

105
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,030
And what?

106
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,960
What's your favorite color?

107
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,750
Let's say it's purple.

108
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,250
Now.

109
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:00,040
Yes, it tells me that the name of my beer is Barcelona and Purple Grape.

110
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,150
I have my answer.

111
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,840
So the next step in the challenge to add a bit of complication was to have the separated into two different

112
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,290
lines.

113
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,030
So how can we do that?

114
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,660
On one hand, we could do it with different print lines.

115
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:20,770
But if we want to do it all at once, I'm going to make use of the backslash and which stands for New

116
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,160
Line.

117
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,870
As we learned throughout this day.

118
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:29,740
So after it says the name of your bear, we're going to put here instead of a space backslash with an

119
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,470
end, this tells it to jump lines.

120
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,770
So the second line is going to say is and the full name and we're going to make it so that after this

121
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,130
line with the quotation mark ends, it will generate a backslash.

122
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:48,040
N That is a new line and it will say, I don't know, congratulations or whatever.

123
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:54,140
With this we would already have three lines so we run it through shift f10.

124
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,600
Now yes we can do it.

125
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,120
What city would you like to visit?

126
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,620
Well, I've changed my mind.

127
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:06,410
Now I want to visit London and it tells me that my favourite colour is Let's put yellow.

128
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,460
It's not.

129
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,530
But we put it for a change.

130
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,230
And on three different lines we have.

131
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,720
The name of your beer is London Yellow.

132
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,220
Congratulations.

133
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,930
And that is how we've done it.

134
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,010
If you've made it before watching this lecture, congratulations.

135
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,020
And if you've achieved it by watching this lecture, it is equally valid because it is a way to learn

136
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,510
and see how someone else has solved it.

137
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,540
The code may seem very simple up to this point, but when we get on our own and we are left without

138
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,650
the instructor, we get our books burned and sometimes we need a little help.

139
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,300
So it's perfect.

140
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,200
You're here, and I congratulate you for being here, finishing your first day.

141
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,290
If you did it in a different way.

142
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,320
That's valid, too.

143
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,110
And of course it is because in programming there are many ways to achieve the same result.

144
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,710
And then, of course, some may be more efficient than others, more economical than others, more elegant.

145
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,400
But the point is, at this stage of the course is that you have been able to do it.

146
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,950
So I thank you for following me throughout the solution of this project, and I recommend that you don't

147
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,030
miss the next lecture, which is a very special lecture series.

148
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,320
I'll see you there.
