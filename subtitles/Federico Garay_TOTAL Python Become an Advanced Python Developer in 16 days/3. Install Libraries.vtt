00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.450
My virtual assistant is going to require a significant amount of libraries.

2
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.370
So first let's create the project and later we shall install everything that we need.

3
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.530
We're going to call it virtual assistant dot P, of course.

4
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.480
And now I have a place to work.

5
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.390
So in command prompt I will install some of the new libraries I'm going to need.

6
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.260
You can do it here or through py charm in install.

7
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.510
Remember we have learned two ways of doing it, so I'm going to do it here.

8
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.520
I'll write pip install and first one I'm going to need is called ptsx3.

9
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.350
This name is a little difficult to remember, so I have already installed it.

10
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.300
So you'll see something different here.

11
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.440
This is a module that allows Python to talk to us, so I suppose it's going to be something important.

12
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:07.410
So then pip install to install a library called speech recognition, the s and R in uppercase.

13
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.930
And this serves to recognize your voice and transform it into text.

14
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.180
It's going to be very necessary.

15
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.260
So let's go with the next pip install.

16
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.060
This one is called P.

17
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.320
What kit?

18
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.420
We also install it.

19
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.410
This will allow your code to open websites such as YouTube, Wikipedia, and many more.

20
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.990
So now let's install wiki finance, which is Yahoo finance.

21
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.680
And this is a library that allows you to connect your code to the values of the stock market.

22
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.710
In this way, we could ask our assistant to tell us the price of stock we're interested in.

23
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.190
And finally, you're going to love this pip install P jokes, which is a library with a large amount

24
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.270
of jokes so our assistant can tell us a joke every so.

25
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.640
Once you've installed all these libraries, we come to pie charm where we can import all of this and

26
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.110
some of those we already know.

27
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.440
So we start with p, t, tsx3 and we continue importing to speech recognition.

28
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.180
There we go.

29
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.150
And we can put a shortened name as it's very long.

30
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.930
We can put as s r.

31
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.440
Also we're going to import P what kit which we've just installed.

32
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.480
Let's import y finance and I'll put the nickname y f and I'll import p y jokes.

33
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.770
These are the ones we've just installed.

34
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.380
And now we're going to import some that are in the Python's own code, which are web browser.

35
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.550
Here it is.

36
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.270
And this allows us to open web browsers from our code.

37
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.290
And let's import an old friend the famous date time.

38
00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.030
And let's also import another that we have installed, which is Wikipedia, and I'm sure you can imagine

39
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.050
what this library does.

40
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.340
So this is everything we need to start programming.

41
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.120
Our archive has everything it needs and all its tools.

42
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.650
So in the next class, we'll start our first line of proper code.
