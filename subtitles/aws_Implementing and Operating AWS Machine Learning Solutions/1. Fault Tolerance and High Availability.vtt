00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.780
So here within this module,

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.320
we're going to be talking about how you implement a highly

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.730
available machine learning solution.

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.940
And so to get to that point, we're going to be going through several topics.

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.680
First of all,

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.840
we'll be reviewing the concepts of fault tolerance and high availability.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.640
We'll be looking at how we implement auto‑scaling for a SageMaker endpoint.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.290
We'll be looking at how we utilize CloudWatch and

9
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.040
CloudTrail for monitoring SageMaker.

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.680
And we'll be examining a fault‑tolerant approach for leveraging Amazon

11
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.060
SageMaker. And then finally, we'll be reviewing deep learning

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.840
containers as a part of your SageMaker solutions.

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.080
But before we get too deep, let's talk about the concept of reliability on AWS.

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.300
And there's two concepts that we need to review,

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.660
and the first is fault tolerance.

16
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.590
And if we're talking about fault tolerance,

17
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.950
what we mean is that we are able to support the failure of

18
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.470
a component within your overall architecture and yet still

19
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.440
have a functioning system.

20
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.980
And then on the other side, we have high availability. And what this

21
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.610
means is that you're keeping your entire solution up and running in the

22
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.670
expected manner despite issues that may occur,

23
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.640
including things like excessive user demand that you didn't expect.

24
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.620
And so over the course of this module,

25
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.930
we're going to be looking to see how we build machine

26
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.000
learning solutions on AWS that are able to achieve both fault tolerance and high availability.
