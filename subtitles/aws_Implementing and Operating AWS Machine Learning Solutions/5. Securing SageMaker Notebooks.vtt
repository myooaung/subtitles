00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.620
In the previous two clips,

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.810
we talked about infrastructure security and limiting

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.100
what users can do do utilizing IAM.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.180
Now we're going to apply both of those concepts together,

5
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.990
specifically for SageMaker Notebook instances.

6
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.560
And the first thing we need to look at is AWS's recommendation,

7
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.860
and their recommendation for notebook instances is that they are

8
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.440
designed to work best for an individual user.

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.720
So they're not recommending that you share your notebook

10
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.640
instances with multiple members of a team.

11
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.140
So one of the ways we can handle this is by utilizing an IAM policy.

12
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.350
So within IAM, there is an action on the SageMaker service

13
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.260
called CreatePresignedNotebookInstanceUrl.

14
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.940
And this is the action that you will need to specify if you want to

15
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.400
limit access to a notebook instance. So here,

16
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.840
you could have a customer‑managed policy in IAM that is specific

17
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.690
for the notebook instance that a user needs to have access to.

18
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.250
This way you can make sure that only a single user can access

19
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.140
that notebook instance.

20
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.540
But there's another piece of notebook instances that we need to note.

21
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.300
So SageMaker Notebooks are internet‑enabled by

22
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.200
default. And if you think about this,

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.930
this presents an inherent risk because we generally configure our

24
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.240
notebook instances to have access to our company's data.

25
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.430
And if we're also installing packages and code from other places

26
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.540
on the internet to our notebook instances,

27
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.810
it's always possible that this is going to give somebody with

28
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.100
bad intentions access to our data and the ability to do

29
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.110
something we wouldn't want them to do.

30
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.740
So one of the things we can look at is how we limit our notebook access.

31
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.600
So first, you need to know that internet access can be eliminated by

32
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.440
launching your notebook within a customer‑managed VPC.

33
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.240
And if you don't, if you choose not to do that,

34
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.600
then what will happen is your notebook instance be

35
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.160
launched in a SageMaker‑managed VPC,

36
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.470
which will have internet access. Now if you do launch it within a

37
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.750
customer‑managed VPC, you can limit the notebook instance's access through

38
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.000
security groups and the availability of a NAT gateway.

39
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.140
And if you remember,

40
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.460
we talked previously about how we can choose to launch a VPC utilizing VPC

41
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.840
endpoints and not even need an internet or NAT gateway on that VPC. Now an

42
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.550
instance will still be able to access AWS Services if we have configured those

43
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:34.000
VPC endpoints, and specifically we talked about setting up VPC endpoints for both Amazon S3 and Amazon SageMaker.
