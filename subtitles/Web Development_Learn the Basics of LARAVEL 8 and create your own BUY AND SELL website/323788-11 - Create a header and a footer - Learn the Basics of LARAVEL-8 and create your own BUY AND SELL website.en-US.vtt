00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.845
The product list looks good now.

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:07.680
And in this video we are going to add a header and

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.025
footer to make this page look more appealing.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:14.590
Currently, the page looks like this.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.410
And by the end of this video it will look something like this one.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.270
Let me summarize this safes for you first,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.355
let us talk about the header.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:34.680
The first step will be to add a navigation bar at the top using the nav tags of HTML.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.000
Then we sell add divs for the logo on the left and for the links to the right.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.780
And then we'll add the logo and the links.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.340
Now let us get started.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.240
First, I'll remove the welcome message.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.050
Now inside the body at the top,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.670
add a nav tag.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.740
Inside the nav tags add two deeps,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.540
140 logo to the left,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.905
and the other 40 menu items to the right.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:16.805
At some text inside these leaves to make them visible on the page.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:20.075
Now, the text are placed high degree.

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:23.405
We sell place them side-by-side.

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:26.150
To place the div side-by-side.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.730
Let's wrap this deeps by another div and add the class flex to the parent div.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.515
Add another class named justify between

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:44.180
tourist parent div to add maximum possible space between

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.800
the two children deeps as we want them to be on the two ends of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.980
the innovation bar at some pairing with the class P6.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.750
So the first ten seconds tapes are complete and he pays, looks like this.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.190
Now let us replace the text logo by an actual logo.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.760
For now, I'll use the larger logo itself from the welcome page.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.760
Let's copy the SVC for the logo from the welcome view and paste it inside the logo div,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.710
inside the products view.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.275
The logo appears on the page,

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:28.880
but it is too big.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:40.110
Let's replace the class age 16 and 20 from the S visit tag by the class H eight.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:49.550
Now it looks nice. Let's also

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.425
copy the code 40 login and racism links and paste it inside the main wide MPS div,

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:00.480
replacing the text menu items.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.610
Now we can see the links by reloading the page,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.105
but there are a few things that we would like to change.

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:12.140
First, the links are stuck towards the top of

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.385
the navigation bar and are not aligned with the logo.

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:18.440
Secondly, these links are fixed.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.690
So whenever we scroll the page,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.420
they don't move with the nav bar.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.770
Let's fix this.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.290
To make this links move with the nav bar,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.855
we have to remove the class fixed.

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:36.035
But here it seems we don't need the other classes too.

00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:38.225
So let's remove them all.

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:44.780
And to align this links to decenter of the navbar at the class items center to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:53.460
the DFF data is parent of the logo and menuItems leave the one having the flex class.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.110
Now reload the page and it looks perfect.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.265
Now let's also add a footer.

00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:06.230
For the footer too.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.860
We sell add a div at the bottom of the body and add some text to the left.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.110
And we sell display the larval NPH reversals on the right like the welcome page.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.000
So let's add a div before closing the body

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.800
and add two divs inside this 40 left and right portions of the footer.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.370
Let us copy the classes from the header div and paste it here.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:52.250
I will also add a border to the top with the Cloud border t. It is getting the same,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.550
but let's reduce the height a little and add some margin around the complete footer.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.350
Let's add em for,

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:10.025
for Mars in and replace P6 By PX and PY for for horizontal and vertical paddings.

00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:14.900
Add takes him to make the text a bit smaller and

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.790
add text gray 500 to change the color of the text to gray.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.580
Finally, to make the footer look better,

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.300
I'll replace that takes lift width created using larval

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.380
and Tailwind CSS and the texts right,

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.200
with the lava lamp piece we were son,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.480
as in the welcome screen.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.955
So I'll copy this from the welcome screen and add it here.

00:05:43.955 --> 00:05:46.530
Now reload the page.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:56.310
And the products view of her buy and sell website looks pretty good, right.
