00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
So we have learned a lot.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.330
We have started from scratch,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.555
we have learned how to create views to interact with the users.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:10.515
We've learned how to create models to interact with the databases.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:12.885
We have learned about controllers, routes,

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:16.095
we have learned how to create tables in the database

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:19.995
and how to update tables in the database using migrations.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:23.115
We have also learned how to use middlewares.

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:26.385
And we have also learned how to create our own middleware is.

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:28.545
So this has been an amazing journey.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:30.420
I have enjoyed this a lot.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.795
I've enjoyed teaching you the basics of love.

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:36.435
And I hope you have enjoyed this too.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:40.570
And thank you for being a part of the chain.
