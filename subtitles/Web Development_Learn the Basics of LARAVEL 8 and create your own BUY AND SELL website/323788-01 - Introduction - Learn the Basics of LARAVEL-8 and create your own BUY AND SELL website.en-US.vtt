00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
Hello everyone, welcome to this class on larva and my name is k times l.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:04.890
I am from India.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.680
And in this class I'm going to teach you the basics of

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.355
law by creating a simple website from scratch.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:15.510
Larva is one of the most popular web development frameworks in the world.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.900
And it makes it a lot easier by providing

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.880
some simple ways to implement some of the most common task.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.010
For example, let us consider death.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.895
We want to implement authentication in our website.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.645
So we have to allow the users to restrict himself on the website.

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:36.005
We have to store your information securely on the database.

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.140
We have to allow them to login and logout,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.625
and there must be some way for a user to retrieve a forgotten password.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:49.850
Also, we also have to verify the email addresses with which do users registered himself.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.715
So this involves a lot of work, right?

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:56.450
But larval makes this extremely easy for us.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.525
It provides a few out of the box solutions for this,

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:03.845
like larva, about which you are going to learn more in this course.

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:07.550
Rather uses eloquent warm for database interactions,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.410
which makes the database interactions as simple as a few function calls.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.970
And you will realize the true power of eloquent or M

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.700
when you try to establish relationships between multiple tables of the database.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.320
The project structure of Elavil project helps you create clean and organized code.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.735
The analysts easy to start with,

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:34.925
and it grows along with him.

00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:38.990
So once you get comfortable with the basics of law fell,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.190
you can start using the sophisticated tools for tasting dependency injection,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.165
et cetera, to take your project and your skills to the next level.

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:51.605
And in this class, I'm going to make you comfortable with the basic concepts.

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:55.445
We just start from scratch and I'll show you each and every step

00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:59.285
that you need to follow to create a complete bias and website.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.770
So by the end of this class,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.690
you will have your own balance and website.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.040
But more than that,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.495
you will have the confidence to build any website using law.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.445
And in the next video,

00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:12.635
I'll show you the final product.

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:16.890
The wave said that you will be building during this class.
