00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.905
If you take a look at the Getting Started section of the larval documentation,

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:09.820
you will find a link to a page called directory structure,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.505
about which we have already discussed in the last video.

00:00:12.505 --> 00:00:16.105
You can refer to this page whenever you get curious

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:20.035
about the purpose of a particular folder of the larger project.

00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:23.860
Now below that lean to the page directory structure,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.465
you will find another link to a page called starter kits opened at one.

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:31.570
Now lava makes our life easier by providing

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.980
some optional kids to get started with a new larger project.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.830
And we are going to use one of them called larval

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.390
breathe for implementing authentication in our buy and sell website.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.235
The process of implementing authentication involves a lot of work.

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:52.105
We have to allow the users to restate himself on the website.

00:00:52.105 --> 00:00:55.180
We have to store their information on the database.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.365
We have to allow the users to login and logout, of course.

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:04.600
And there must be a way for a user to retrieve a forgotten past hurdles.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.505
And while doing all of this,

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:08.815
we have to keep security in our mind.

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:13.210
Now Lara will breeze simplifies this complete process of

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.470
implementing authentication into a few simple commands.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.225
It will create all the views,

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:23.590
the controller of the roots that are required for implementing authentication.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.070
We dealt us writing a single line of code.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.910
Now there is another starter kit called lava gesturing,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.140
which is a little advanced in terms of the features it provides.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.715
But for beginners, it is recommended to get started with larval breeze,

00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:41.515
as it is relatively simple.

00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:45.890
So in this course we are going to focus only on larval breeds.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.240
We can summarize the complete process into four major steps.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.819
First, configuring the database.

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.515
Second, creating the record tables on the database.

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:04.795
Tarred installing Lavelle breeze itself using Composer and forth,

00:02:04.795 --> 00:02:09.685
Zen editing the authentic as unrelated codes using breeds.

00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:13.015
Let's start with the first one.

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:18.580
To implement authentication, we have to set up the database because tables

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.965
will be created to store the user information and RRR data.

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:28.300
We sell anyways, need a database for the website as

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.965
we also need to store the ads for the products to be sold.

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:36.550
So it is the right time to create the database and configure

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.940
the project to be able to communicate with the database.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.610
Now to set up the database, first of all,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.125
ensure that web server and MySQL is running.

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:54.740
Then open Jim homepage on the browser by entering

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.360
http localhost and go to the PHP

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.765
my admin page by clicking on the PHP my admin link on the top right corner of the page.

00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:10.175
Now click on New from the left panel and

00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:15.935
a form to create a database will appear to the right and tried in name for the database.

00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:19.320
And click on the button, Create.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.230
Let's name it by and sale.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.775
Once the database gets created,

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.240
we will see a form to create a table inside a database.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.020
But we are not going to create the tables from

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.295
this interface in state whistle create them by creating migrations.

00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:43.730
Inside our project.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.230
We are going to create a user for this database here,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.225
click on the item called privileges from the menu on the top.

00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:59.160
Click on the button, Add user account from the section levels and new.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.725
In the login information form, enter a username,

00:04:09.725 --> 00:04:16.695
change the host name to local from the drop-down and add a strong password.

00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:20.570
I am adding a week one for now.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.805
On this section database for user account.

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:34.060
Check the option grant all privileges on the database by Ansel and click the button,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.940
go at the bottom of the page.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.550
Even CMS's like this one.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.470
Now we have to establish the connection between this database and our project. For debt.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.480
We have to add the information of

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.320
the database and the user that we have created just now.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.695
Pretty dot ENV file of the project.

00:04:56.695 --> 00:05:02.465
Inside the dot YAML file make changes to the database configurations.

00:05:02.465 --> 00:05:10.250
Here DVI connection is MySQL DB host is localhost DB port 3306.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.760
This is the port on which MySQL is running.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.780
You can verify it from the gem Control Panel.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.620
Next, add the name of the database and the name of

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.020
the name and the password of the user that we have created essentially.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.270
So here the databases buy and sell.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.370
The username is also buy and sell.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.590
And then I'm adding the password that I have given to the newly created user.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.695
With this, our first step is complete.

00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:47.020
We have completed the database configuration.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.670
Now let's move on to second one.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.470
Creating the tables on the database.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.380
For debt, we have to run the midday sense.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.495
But what does that mean?

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:06.985
Take a look at the folder named migrations inside the database folder of the project.

00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:09.445
Here you will find a few PHP files.

00:06:09.445 --> 00:06:12.205
These are the database migrations.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.895
Debt came inbuilt when we created the larval project.

00:06:15.895 --> 00:06:20.185
We will need to create a few of our own during the project.

00:06:20.185 --> 00:06:28.220
The migrations contain the schema definitions of the database tables.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.010
Inside a migration, we defined the schema to create a table.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.500
We also define changes to schema of an existing table when we need to add,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.600
remove or object columns.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.875
And when we run these migrations with a command that

00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:50.695
the changes that are defined in this file are applied to the database.

00:06:50.695 --> 00:06:53.155
Let's take a look at the first file,

00:06:53.155 --> 00:06:57.670
the name of the file in slag underscore create underscore users,

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.920
underscore, table dot PHP.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.910
And the name itself explains the purpose of defining it creates the users table.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.090
This file contains a migration,

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:16.700
namely create users table that contains the schema definition 40 users table,

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.170
MI Grayson class contents two methods,

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.110
1.5 and the other down.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.995
The RPE method is used to add new tables, columns,

00:07:26.995 --> 00:07:30.280
or indexes to your database while it down metrics should

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.210
reverse the operations far from by the OK admitted.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.270
Here in this migrations create users table,

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.580
you will notice that the up method contains

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.065
the schema for creating the table named users.

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:49.160
While it down method drops the table if it already exists.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.320
You will get familiar with this during the course as we sell

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.830
create migrations for creating and modifying our tables.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.375
Now if we run the command

00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:05.800
PHP artisan migrate on the terminal than all the outstanding migrations will be run.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.940
The functions of the migrations will get executed.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:16.735
It down functions gets executed when we run the command PHP artisan migrate, rollback.

00:08:16.735 --> 00:08:20.650
And as of now we have not run the migrations at all.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.674
So all our outstanding.

00:08:22.674 --> 00:08:25.405
So let's run the migration first,

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:28.480
open the terminal inside the project directory,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.189
and run the command PHP artisan migrate.

00:08:32.189 --> 00:08:35.015
Once the migration is complete,

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:38.165
take a look at the database on PHP, my admin.

00:08:38.165 --> 00:08:43.080
You will find a tree new tables which didn't exist before.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.140
So this second stage,

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.370
creation of authentication related tables is complete.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.230
Now let us proceed to the next one,

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.810
installing Lavelle breeze using Composer.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:05.720
Open the terminal at the root directory of the project and run the command.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.025
Composer Ricard law has less breeze,

00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:14.090
dashed ds div, and hit

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:20.900
Enter and wait for it to complete.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.845
And with this, the third step is complete.

00:09:24.845 --> 00:09:28.670
Now let us process to generate the authentication related codes.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.390
Larva breeze creates the views, the controllers,

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.780
and all other components related to authentication and places

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.755
them in the appropriate directory of the project.

00:09:39.755 --> 00:09:42.350
And to make brisk create these components,

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.665
we have to run the command PHP artisan,

00:09:45.665 --> 00:09:50.040
breads, colon installed on the terminal.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.460
After completion of this commodity,

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.355
if we explored the directories of deposit,

00:09:58.355 --> 00:10:01.145
we shall find a few new views,

00:10:01.145 --> 00:10:06.140
new controllers, and new route files in the respective folders.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:12.230
These are the code related to authentication that larval breeze has added to our project.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.355
Now, if we head over to the browser and load our website,

00:10:16.355 --> 00:10:20.855
we will notice two new buttons for login and registration.

00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:24.570
On the top right corner of the page.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:32.095
Let us take a look at the login page by clicking on the login button.

00:10:32.095 --> 00:10:35.320
This something seems to be broken.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.510
Well, there is one more step lift.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:45.730
Larval breeze has made changes to the app.js file inside the resources less CSS folder.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:51.340
And we have to compile them 40 styles to come into effect.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.165
So to compile the assets, run these commands.

00:10:55.165 --> 00:10:58.134
First run the command npm install.

00:10:58.134 --> 00:11:03.475
It will install the NPM packages on which our project events.

00:11:03.475 --> 00:11:09.540
It will install the scripts that we need to compile the assets.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.810
After completion of this command.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:18.810
Run this command, npm run dev to compile the assets.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.805
And your terminal will display a success masses.

00:11:25.805 --> 00:11:27.560
If no error has occurred.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.155
If you get the error mixes not recognized,

00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:32.180
then you will need to install law.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.789
They'll mix with this command npm install.

00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:37.850
Laura will mix at the rate latest desk,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.605
the same desk Dave,

00:11:39.605 --> 00:11:44.250
and upgrade npm packages using npm upgrade.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:51.080
Now reload the websites and look at the login and races and paces. They look good.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.450
Now, try creating a new user from the racism screen and login.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:02.010
On successful login, you will be taken to a home screen similar to this one.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:09.750
So our authentic isn't system is ready.
