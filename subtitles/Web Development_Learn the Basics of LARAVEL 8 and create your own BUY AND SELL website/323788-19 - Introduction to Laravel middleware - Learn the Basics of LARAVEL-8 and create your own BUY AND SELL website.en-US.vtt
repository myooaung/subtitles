00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.970
In this video, I'll introduce you to the concept of middleware in lab.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.160
But why do we need a middleware?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.010
I'll tell you, we have to treat

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.425
the unauthenticated users from accessing our forum for posting an ad, right?

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:21.780
So whenever a user clicks on the sale button from the Meno,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.780
before even returning the view 40 sale page,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.425
we have to learn whether the user is logged in or not.

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:30.990
If the user is already logged in,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.135
then we sell low decile page.

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:34.965
But if the user is not logged in,

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:40.080
we won't allow him or her to post a product ad.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.255
And instead we sell, redirect him or her to the login screen.

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:45.530
And we are going to do this.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.825
We'd help of a middleware.

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:53.840
Middleware enlarge hell provides a mechanism for filtering HTTP requests.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.620
And Laura Val by default includes civil middlewares.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.340
This medullaris are located in a directory called middleware inside HTTP, inside App.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.260
If you take a look inside this folder,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.185
you will find a middleware named authenticate.

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:12.245
This middleware when applied to a route,

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:15.470
redirect the unauthenticated users to

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.385
the login screen if the user atoms to x, is that true?

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:23.645
So we don't even need to create our own middleware.

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:28.320
This inbuilt middleware authentication will work for us.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.950
So how to use or apply a middleware to a root?

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.020
Let me show you how.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.410
First open the root file with the PHP.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.865
Take a look at the root for dashboard.

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:54.695
Notice how in middleware named OT is applied to this root.

00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:58.910
Dysfunction middleware has been called and the key of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.170
the middleware and closed inside an array is passed to it.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.320
Now let us take a look at defined named carnal inside default EPS less HTTP.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.925
The middleware are registered inside decide,

00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:20.735
uh, keys associated with each of them middlewares.

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:26.584
We can see that the key off is assigned to the middleware authenticate,

00:02:26.584 --> 00:02:30.785
and this is the one that is already applied to the dashboard route.

00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:34.680
We are going to apply the same to the same route.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.085
This middleware OT, intercepts the request to a root

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:43.925
and checks whether the user making this request is logged in or not.

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:45.650
If the user is logged in,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.290
then only it allows the user to proceed.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.760
Otherwise, it redirects the user to the login screen.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.630
So back in our WIP dot PHP file called the function

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.590
middleware on the sale root and pass 4s2 it.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.495
We are not going to pass it in an array as it is not mandatory,

00:03:05.495 --> 00:03:10.230
and it is required when you need to apply more than one middleware.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.950
Now reload the website logout.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.910
If you are currently logged in and try to access the loop sale,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.970
you will get redirected to the login screen.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.040
So we're done middleware to

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.825
our powerful tool for controlling access to different features and parts of her website.

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:39.970
We have learned the basics of middleware,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.790
but the possibilities are endless and we are going to

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.060
explore more towards the end of this course.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.850
Next, we're going to retrieve the list of products from

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.940
the database and display them on the homepage.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.360
But wait, we still have this default welcome page as our homepage.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.610
Let's change this to make the products list page as the homepage.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.210
Inside the root sign remote the roots for the welcome view and

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.685
change the URI of the products root two, root.

00:04:14.685 --> 00:04:16.850
We said also deleted, welcome.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.560
Dot dot PHP file.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.560
Now enter B and S dot go on the browser.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.490
And the product list page is the home-base.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.710
Now, perfect, most recent,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.880
start displaying the products from the database on the screen.
