00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:07.860
The class is complete and now it is time for you to complete your class project.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.370
And if you have watched all the videos and completing each of

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.490
these tapes as part of the instructions of the videos.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.850
Then by now you should have your own buy and sell website ready.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.395
And if you have debt,

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:21.405
then your project is ready.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:24.690
You simply need to take a few screenshots of the different pages of

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.920
the website and share those with us on the project section.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.650
So your class project is to create

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.115
a buy and sell website following the instructions of the class.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:38.565
Now, if for some reason you have not completed the project,

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:41.450
you have not implemented each of these steps.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.065
And so at this moment you don't have a complete ban cell website.

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:47.690
Then there is another way for you.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.305
You have to go to github.com slash tangents,

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:53.450
less lava underscore binds in.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.095
Here, you will find the repository for the project.

00:00:57.095 --> 00:01:00.230
If you take a look at the branches,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.955
will find a brand's corresponding to a video of the class.

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:08.840
You can refer to the quote of this runs where if you find

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.040
any difficulty while implementing the status of that particular video,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.165
and you will find another branch with a similar name,

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:19.850
but the word assignment in it.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.035
This branch contains some tasks for you.

00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:27.230
Now if you take a look at the source code of that branch,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.630
will find a file name, assignment dot TXT.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.175
And inside that file,

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:36.935
you will find some tasks and with the line numbers where you have to make changes.

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:39.200
These are pretty simple task.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.235
Somewhere maybe the argument we pass to a function is missing.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:46.655
And in some cases the function call itself may be missing.

00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:49.490
And you have to add those missing parts.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.590
And once you complete this task,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.910
decode off your assignment brands will be equivalent to the code of the other runs.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:06.439
For example, if you complete the assignment or the brands 1100 crore assignment,

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.820
create header footer, then the quote of debt brands,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.325
your SMM brands will be equivalent to the branch 11 underscore create header footer.

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:20.885
Now we have SMN branches for most of the videos.

00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:25.160
But if for some videos you don't find an assignment prompts,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.735
then it's okay then I have not added a task for you for that particular video.

00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:34.100
Now once you complete all the task of this assignment branches,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.355
you will have your complete Bans Silva absurdity.

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:39.950
So again, you have to take a few screenshots of

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.000
the different pages and share those with us in the project section.
