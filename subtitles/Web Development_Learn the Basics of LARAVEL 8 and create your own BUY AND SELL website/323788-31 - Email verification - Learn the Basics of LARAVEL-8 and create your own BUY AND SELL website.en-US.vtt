00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.765
You know, my image, right?

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:06.420
So you can create an account which my email on

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.320
the website and keep on posting ads on my VM.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.670
Basically, anyone can create an account

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.140
with anyone else's email on the website and keep on using the features.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.285
But this is not good.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:24.750
So to prevent such incidents from happening,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.190
we have to verify the email addresses with which the accounts are created.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.360
And as we are using lauryl ether breeze for authentication,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.655
most of the work is already done,

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:41.500
which some minor configurations are innate verification system will be ready.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.950
First, ensure that the moral user implements the class.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.140
Must verify image.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.120
Open the file user dot PHP from the folder apps less models.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.820
And if he does not already implement,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.965
must verify e-mail then

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:08.850
implemented at the middleware named verified to the dashboard route.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.470
The responsibility of this middleware is to prevent a user from accessing the root.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.190
If the user has not verified his or her email yet.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.950
Open the root file, web dot PHP.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.589
And to reroute dashboard.

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:34.380
At this middleware verified.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.275
Now append the dot ENV file and find the e-mail IT related configurations.

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:52.445
For this course, I'll show you how to send e-mails from your XAML account.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:58.985
But in production, you will probably use one of the many popular e-mail services.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:03.004
Now let's add the configuration to enable

00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:07.470
our buy and sell website to send emails using Gmail account.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.310
Smtp to the property male mailer,

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.850
male host will be smtp dot gmail.com.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.340
Mail port is 5, 8, 7.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.310
Mail, username, the e-mail from which you understand emails, mail password,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.620
the password of that female,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.980
male encryption, TLS, mail from address at the email.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.820
And we want change this fellow male from name.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.565
You'll also have to make some changes to your Google account security settings.

00:02:50.565 --> 00:02:55.565
Search on Google, less secure apps.

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:59.555
And you will find a link like this one,

00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:05.375
my account dot google.com slash lists secure apps.

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:10.265
Inside this phase you will find a switch called allow less secure EPS.

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:13.085
Turn it on, at least for the time being.

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:16.070
In production, you will probably use

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.655
some other SMTP services and then you will turn this switch off.

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:25.670
Now before you taste the functionality,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.685
take a look at the users table on the database ones.

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:32.405
Notice the values of the column e-mail verified at.

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:35.540
Currently the values for this column are null.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.520
Once we get our emails verified,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.450
we'll come back to see if anything changes.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.715
Now try to access the dashboard page.

00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:48.770
You will see something like this.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.940
The messages may look a little different depending on whether an email

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.350
has already been sent before or being sent 41st time.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.675
Now check your inbox.

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:06.095
You should have got an email with a link to verify the email.

00:04:06.095 --> 00:04:11.135
Click on the link and you will be redirected to the dashboard page.

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:13.760
So your email has been verified.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.925
Now take a look at the users table on PHP, my admin.

00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:18.080
Again.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.580
You'll notice the timestamp when the email got

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.110
verified in the corresponding row for the column e-mail verified at.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.170
Now no one can login using someone else's e-mail.
