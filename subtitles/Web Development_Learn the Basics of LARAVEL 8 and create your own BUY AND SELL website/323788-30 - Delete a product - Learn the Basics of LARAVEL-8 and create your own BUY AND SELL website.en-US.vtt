00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.760
The steps that we are going to take to enable the deletion of a product are similar

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.130
to some of the steps that we have taken to implement the editing feature.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.330
First, we sell create a route to make a delete request.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.935
Then create a function inside the products controller to actually delete the product.

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:23.910
And finally, we shall call the delete root on clicking the delete button.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.370
But this tip is going to be a little different.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.780
You will realize by the end,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.155
create a route similar to the one we have created for ADT.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:43.145
But call the function post instead of gate to this first parameter,

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:47.720
pass the URI, delete the ID.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.370
And to the second parameter pass the name of the products controller class and

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.380
the name of the function we want to execute inside the array.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.885
Let's pass destroy.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:02.540
We don't have dysfunction inside products

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.350
controller yet and we are going to create it now.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.950
So append the products controller file.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.620
Create a function inside this class to delete a product,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.040
name it, destroy, add a parameter ID.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.350
Now inside this function,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.150
find the product by this ID is going to function find of the model.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.750
Finally, call the function delete on the instance of the product model.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.505
After deletion, who is a load D dashboard page of the user,

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:47.450
we can redirect the user to one of the controller actions.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.940
The action we are interested in is

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.625
Show own products to redirect the user to this action or this function.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:59.360
We have to call redirect,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.700
and then we have to call again action.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.960
We have to pass the name of

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.225
the controller class and the name of the action or the function.

00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:17.860
The way we have been passing to the root functions.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.640
Now pin the view product dot dot,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.770
dot PHP, where we have the Delete button.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.315
To protect the deletion operation from CSRF attacks.

00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:36.710
We sell create the delete button inside a form,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.810
which sell create a form specified emitted to be

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.470
post and action to be the root for delete.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:59.270
Also add the CSRF directive and add an input element of type submit to create the button.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.620
And let us add all the classes debt we have added earlier to

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.830
the button div and add the text delete as the value.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.200
Now paint the details page for

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.140
a particular product ID you'd like to delete and click on the Delete button.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.000
Or successful deletion, you will be redirected to the dashboard page.
