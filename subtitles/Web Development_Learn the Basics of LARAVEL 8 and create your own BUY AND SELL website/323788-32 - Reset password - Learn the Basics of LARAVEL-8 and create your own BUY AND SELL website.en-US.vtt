00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
Well this one is a surprise.

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:07.485
All the work required to implement password reset is already done by larval breeze.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:12.450
The only thing that we had to do was to add the e-mail configurations.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.090
And as we have already done that in the previous video,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.175
currently there is nothing to do for us.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:21.160
So let us test whether it is working properly or not.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.120
Click on forgot password on login screen,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.500
enter your registered email,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.210
and click on the button to get an e-mail with the password reset, link.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.815
Check your inbox. Open the e-mail,

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:40.655
and click on the password reset link.

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:45.695
Now enter your new password and submit, and you're done.

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:51.180
Try to login. Now let us move on to the next task.
