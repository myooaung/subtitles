00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.500
The homepage of our website is displaying actual list of products from the database now,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.995
but the details space is still showing some static data.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:15.540
And now we start retrieving the details of a particular product by ID

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.845
from the database and display those information on the product details page,

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:22.005
which will remove this static data.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.530
And this process has a tricky part.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.545
You will realize that by the end of this video.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:30.450
So let's get started.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:37.390
The process is similar to what we did while retrieving the list of products.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.955
Create a function inside the products controller.

00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:44.045
Fetch a product by id,

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:46.745
update a route to invoke this function.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:53.550
Display defects item in the product view or do product details page.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.420
Open the products controller now.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.875
Create a function, let us call it show.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:11.220
We shall add a parameter for the idea of a product.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.015
Call the function find of the product model.

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:21.785
Pass the ID to eat.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:28.145
This function fetches the data of a row from the table associated with this model.

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:30.800
By DID pass to it.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.810
And it returns an instance of the model holding the fetch data.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.875
In this case, the table associated with our product model is the products table.

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:46.010
So this function will fetch a particular product

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.430
by the ID passed to it from the products table.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.995
And it will return an instance of the product model holding the fetch data.

00:01:54.995 --> 00:02:00.450
So let us create a variable named product to hold the result.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.890
A return statement called the function view to return the product view.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.730
And we shall pass the variable product to the view using

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.350
the function with the first parameter of this function,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.725
we have to pass the name by which we would like

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:23.315
to access this variable inside the product of u.

00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:28.560
And to the second parameter we have to pass the variable itself.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.530
Now we have to make some changes to the root 40 product details page.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.860
Replaced the closer with a call to the function show of the products controller.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.030
If you are wondering about parsing the ID from the URI to the show function,

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.380
then don't worry, because larva will take care of that.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.550
It will make the ID available to us inside the show function.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.530
Now append the product view,

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.454
the file product dot dot PHP,

00:03:18.454 --> 00:03:21.560
and replace this static strings with the content from

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.690
the variable product that we have fast to this view.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.590
Use the image URL from the product.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.160
Instead of this static URL.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.060
Use product title 40, product tighter.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.315
Use product short description.

00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:43.805
For the short description.

00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:45.905
Then for the long description,

00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:49.610
use the value from the field long description of

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.610
the product and product price for the price of the product.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.320
Now we also have to display the contact information of this sailor, right?

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.345
But how do we get debt?

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:08.930
For that? We have to make some changes to the product model.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.070
We shall do that.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.235
But first let us handle the other issue.

00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:16.505
We have to display the phone number also,

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:18.830
but we are not yet collecting it.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.405
So it will ask the user to enter the phone number during your age, Jason.

00:04:23.405 --> 00:04:25.850
And for that, we have to make some changes to

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.870
the registration form and some other related code.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.170
I'll show you each and every step in the next video.
