00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.700
I have added a few more products and removed the previous two.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.640
The product list-based looks like this.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.965
Not that great, right?

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:15.660
But with this beautiful images that I have downloaded from unsplash.com,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.190
it'll definitely look good.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.920
We just need to modify this a little.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.950
So open the file product dot dot dot PHP.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.300
And let us add this trick losses to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.005
the IMG element H 72 to specify the height of the image,

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.080
object covert to resize the image.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.150
And w fool to force the minister who buy the complete width.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.105
Also specify a height 40,

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:51.710
the 40 short description by adding the class age eight.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.265
Not compiled day assets with npm run Watch and reload the page.

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.720
It looks beautiful.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.890
Now let us take a look at the details page for a product.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.835
Here too, we, if we specify the height of the image,

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.460
the page should look better.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:22.040
Let's do that and see open the file product dot dot PHP at the class,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.250
each 96 to the IMG element.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.260
Now wait for completion of compilation and then reload the page.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.420
And this looks much better.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.050
Now let us come back to the products list screen.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.735
Here. Currently the products are being displayed in the order they have been edited.

00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:47.720
So the first product here is the oldest product

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.040
and we shall reverse this list to display the newest first.
