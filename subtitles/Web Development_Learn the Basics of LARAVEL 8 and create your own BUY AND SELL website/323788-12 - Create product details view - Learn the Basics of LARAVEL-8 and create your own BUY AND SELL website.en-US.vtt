00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
As we have created a beautiful page for displaying the list of products.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.490
Now it is time to display the details of a particular product.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.950
On clicking an item from the product list,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.075
we are going to display the details of that product or a new page.

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:19.030
And in this video, we are going to create that page.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.985
We said create a new view and copy the content of the products view.

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:27.105
We shall keep the same header and the footer,

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:30.645
but replace the code for the main content,

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:36.160
which I'll hide the sailors information if the user is not logged in.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.245
So the first thing we will do is to create a new file inside the views folder.

00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:53.540
Let's name it product dot, dot PHP.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.800
Notice the difference. It is product singular, not products.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.570
Or you may name it anything.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.830
Now copy the content of the products view

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.965
to maintain a consistent look throughout the wave sec,

00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:17.225
we shall use this same header and footer on all the pages.

00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:22.730
So restructure of the product detail space will be similar to the products list page.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.955
We only have to change the main content portion.

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:33.000
Let me add some comments to distinguish the different portions of the page.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.020
I'm collapsing the DBS for clarity here.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.240
Now, are you thinking that this is not

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.210
a good idea to write the same code again and again.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.250
If yes, then you are right.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.175
Because duplication of code introduces lots of

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:05.150
difficulties in maintaining and scaling an app.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.810
For example, let us consider that one day we decide to add

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.470
a new item to the main of the navigation bar.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.705
Then we have to change the related code in all the pages having the navigation bar.

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:21.545
So is there a better way to write this code?

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:24.290
Yes, of course, and I'm going to teach you that.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.820
But for now, first of all,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.760
let us design the layout of the product page.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.405
First remove the code under the section main content,

00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:41.580
and add a new div.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.790
Inside this div, add two more leaves as we sell.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.715
Display the product image on the left graph and some taste information on the right half.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:56.959
Now let's load this page on the browser.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.120
But wait, have we added a route for this page? No.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.430
Then open the file web dot PHP or the root folder and add a route,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.330
add a new route similar to the one for products,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.710
the URI, this thing will be product ID.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.430
We sell also define a route parameter called ID to

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.700
capture the product ID passed through the URL.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.905
We can define a route parameter using curly brackets like this one.

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:31.535
Now here it seems that I have made a mistake.

00:03:31.535 --> 00:03:34.820
We have to keep the views inside the views directory.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.360
And I have created this file product or the dot PHP

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.215
inside the parent of the views directory.

00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:45.630
So let me move this to the proper place.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.090
At this moment, we are not using the ID and we

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.720
are simply returning the view 40 product details.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.885
Once we start working with the database,

00:03:56.885 --> 00:04:02.880
we will use this ID to retrieve the details of a particular product.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.310
Now let us try loading this page on the browser.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.365
So here we have to enter the URI less product flow,

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:23.010
pass any number as DID now n. Here we have the product details page.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.970
Now let's go to the products list page and wrap the D

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.645
for the product item by an anchor tag.

00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:36.660
As we want a product card to be clickable.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.370
On clicking a product,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.460
we sell load the details of that product to the HREF attribute.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.475
We shall pass less products, less one.

00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:52.610
We shall pass the actual ID instead of one here.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.855
For each product.

00:04:53.855 --> 00:04:56.940
When we start displaying actual products,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.715
click on any item of the list.

00:05:10.715 --> 00:05:14.490
And the product details page gets loaded.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.100
Now back in the product view.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.030
Let's add the classes flex

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.980
and am four to the parent div took place the children side-by-side,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.680
and add this class w one-by-two to both

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.190
of the children to divide the space into two halves.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.920
We sell, display an image on the left half and

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.030
some product related information on the right half.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.400
Now the page looks like this.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.560
Let's display the image on the left.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.110
I'll copy the image element from the product list page and added here.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:18.680
Add rounded to the div to make the corners rounded at some shadow using the class shadow.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.505
And add overflow hidden to,

00:06:22.505 --> 00:06:26.900
to hide the overflow so that the amaze does not move out of

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:33.320
the borders of the div 2D image tag.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.990
Add the class object,

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.730
go over and w fool to resize the image to covert the parent div.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.130
Now reload the page.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.110
It looks good, doesn't it?

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.020
Now let's add the content to the right half.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.680
Let's copy the deeps for the product title and product description from the product list

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.860
pays and pasted here inside the div for the right half.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.585
Let's copy the desk refunded once again to display a long description.

00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:17.370
Let me also add some text here.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.790
Let me try changing the font sizes and see if it make any difference.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:32.705
First, I'll remove the text SMM Clause from the title and replace takes excess,

00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:38.910
which takes S and in the description div to make them look a little bigger.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.515
Now let us try to make this container div,

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:53.780
look like a car by adding these classes rounded to make the corners around.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.865
Busy white for white background,

00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:59.735
ML to for adding a margin towards the lift.

00:07:59.735 --> 00:08:04.260
P4 for padding and a shadow.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:13.705
Edit top margin which MT to 2D D 40 long description.

00:08:13.705 --> 00:08:15.475
Now it looks better.

00:08:15.475 --> 00:08:17.260
So move on to the next component,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.470
which will display the sailors information below the description.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.030
So let's add a new div.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:32.485
Let's add some top margin width empty for inside this div,

00:08:32.485 --> 00:08:33.880
add two more leaves.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.460
First, for a label sold by,

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.750
we shall make it smaller,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:43.060
which takes access and a little bold with fonts semi bold,

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.705
and change the text color to gray using the class takes gray.

00:08:48.705 --> 00:08:52.925
Now add another div to display the name of the sailor.

00:08:52.925 --> 00:08:59.150
I'll add the class takes the SM to make the text a little bigger than the level.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.720
And I'll use Taste grief 540 color.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.705
Now copy this and paste it twice,

00:09:17.705 --> 00:09:19.820
once for displaying the phone number.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.800
So change the level.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.735
And another 40 email lists change the level to email address.

00:09:26.735 --> 00:09:32.705
Let's reduce the top margin for these two Little using the class

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:36.470
M22 so that they

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.250
look like parts of the same group of him permission with this seller name.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.950
I'm also adding some arbitrary values here.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.729
Now once the CSS gets compiled,

00:09:49.729 --> 00:09:51.620
reload the page once,

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.150
and it looks beautiful.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.499
Now we are left with the most important piece of information.

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:05.960
The price of the product list display the price at this portion,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.870
the bottom right of this card.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.300
Is it going to look good?

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.645
What do you think?

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:15.410
Let us try and see it.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:24.505
Add a new div. We sell place it absolutely at the bottom right corner of the div.

00:10:24.505 --> 00:10:26.170
For the right-half.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:31.930
For that we will add the classes absolute, bottom 0, right?

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:40.660
0. Now 40 class absolute.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:46.360
To work, we have to make the parent div relative using the class related.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.445
So here is the parent div,

00:10:48.445 --> 00:10:50.995
the root of the right half.

00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:54.290
Let's add the class relative here.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:03.535
We sell, add some margin with the class M6 and make it look like if wheel.

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:08.605
And for that, let's add the class rounded full and add some padding.

00:11:08.605 --> 00:11:17.095
Let us add AX4 for horizontal padding and a little smaller PGY2, 40 article padding.

00:11:17.095 --> 00:11:23.569
Also add a green background color using BZ green 500.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.260
Now add a default it takes inside,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.735
make the text white,

00:11:31.735 --> 00:11:34.675
which takes quite bold, width,

00:11:34.675 --> 00:11:39.350
font bold, and a little smaller using text, SM.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:46.040
Now compile the CSS and reload the page.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:52.520
And wow, the page looks beautiful and feeling happy.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.840
Now one thing lifted before we can prostitute in

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.820
the next video is that we have to hide

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.940
the phone number and the e-mail if the user is not logged in.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.920
To fix this latest first,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.755
take a look at the code of the welcome view.

00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:25.115
Here, this OT directive of Blade II is used to decide which leads to display.

00:12:25.115 --> 00:12:26.690
If the user is logged in,

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.850
then this link is displayed.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.190
The link to the dashboard page.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:35.120
Otherwise, the s-block is considered for rendering.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.330
Now we have to do something similar, right?

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.740
So come back to the product few.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:47.480
Let's start with the phone number and D OS directive before

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.330
the D 40 phone number and add the Directive after the phone number div.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.905
And we also have to add the Directive aimed at the end.

00:12:57.905 --> 00:13:01.820
Now whatever we want to display to an unauthenticated user

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:06.200
have to be added between this IS and a naught.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.600
This is the s-block.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.400
Let's copy the D 40 phone number and paste it inside.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.345
This is block and replace the number of stars.

00:13:17.345 --> 00:13:21.065
Now save and reload the page on the browser.

00:13:21.065 --> 00:13:23.180
If you're already logged in,

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.350
then log out and check whether you can see the phone number or not.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.070
Let's also add a link to

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:39.155
login as an anchor tag and pass the URI slash login to the HREF.

00:13:39.155 --> 00:13:43.310
Ed classes takes excess and takes

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:48.095
blue 500 to the anchor tag to make the text smaller and blue.

00:13:48.095 --> 00:13:52.080
And now do the same for the e-mail. Also.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.070
Now reload the page and it looks complete.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.390
It looks good.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.700
And before proceeding to the next task,

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:16.080
I would ask you to try logging in and notice the different sounds.
