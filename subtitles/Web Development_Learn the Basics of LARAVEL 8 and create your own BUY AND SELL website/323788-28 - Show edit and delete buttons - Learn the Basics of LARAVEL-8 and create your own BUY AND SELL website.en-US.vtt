00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
We sell allow our users to edit and delete his or her own ads.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.770
In this video is I'll add the edit and delete buttons on the product details page.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.500
If the user viewing the page is the seller of the product.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.200
First open the file product dot dot dot PHP.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.130
At the top of the div.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.345
For the right half,

00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:26.990
we shall add an if directive to check if

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.160
OT ID is equal to the idea of the seller of the product.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.315
If this is true,

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:39.695
we sell display the buttons,

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:41.420
are there always will do nothing.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.725
So inside this if and end if directives

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:52.020
add a div to contain the buttons at the class flex to it.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.225
Now at two divs inside this one,

00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:01.820
edit takes for the buttons, edit and delete.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.650
Latest, add some classes to make these buttons beautiful.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.465
I'll add BZ blue 500 to make the edit button blue,

00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:19.840
rounded, full to make the corners rounded.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.795
Ps4 and PGY2 for some horizontal M particle paintings.

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:29.769
Shadow. To add some shadows.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:36.790
Takes excess to make the text smaller, takes white.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.670
To make the color of text white.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.565
Now add this class is to the Edit button to,

00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:52.660
I'll only change the background color to a little red with the class BG raid 300,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.220
and also add some margin to the left with ML 1.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.180
And if we open the details page for a product that has been posted by the logged in user.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.790
It looks like this. We can see the buttons here as

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.340
this ad has been posted by this account with which I am logged in.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.420
Dry, changing the ID on the URL or opening this page

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.969
for others product to see whether the buttons become invisible.

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.910
Party products edit by other users.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.350
And it works. So we don't see the burdens on others product.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.450
Now let's wrap this buttons inside n cortex to make them

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.360
clickable and pass the roots to be loaded to the HREF attributes.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.685
Notice that we are also passing the product ID to the roots as a parameter.

00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:04.775
But as we have not created this roots yet,

00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:07.320
they own work as of now.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.120
So we sell create this route.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:19.520
We sell create a route edit with a root parameter ID to load the product edit form.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.840
And another route with the URI delete slash,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.000
the idea of grip product to be deleted.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.460
If you click on these buttons,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.910
you will get 400 four not found error as of now.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.135
We are proceeding towards our final product, right?

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:48.725
It feels good. Only a few more steps and we're done at least for now.

00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:51.590
So in the next video is I'll create the roots,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.680
the views NG controller functions to handle

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.360
the product edit request and the product delete list.
