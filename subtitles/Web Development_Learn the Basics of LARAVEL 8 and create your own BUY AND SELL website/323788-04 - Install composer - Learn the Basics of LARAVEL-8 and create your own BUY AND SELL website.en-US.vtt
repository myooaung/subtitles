00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.150
As I have already mentioned,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.880
we are going to use composer to install Laura Hill.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.760
So later us install composer first.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.920
If it is already installed on your system,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.960
then you can skip this video.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.650
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP and you can

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.460
get it from the wave set gate composer.org.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.630
Then follow the instructions of the installer to install composer.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.660
Once the installation is complete,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.855
open the command prompt and run the command composer DES,

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:41.680
des person to verify that composer is working properly.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.630
And as the person number appears,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.640
we can be sure that composer has been installed and it is working properly.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.370
Now let's proceed to the next state.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.230
Installation of Love. It.
