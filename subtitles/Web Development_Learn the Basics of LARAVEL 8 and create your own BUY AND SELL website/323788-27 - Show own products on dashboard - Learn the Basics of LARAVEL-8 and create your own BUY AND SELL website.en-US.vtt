00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.995
Haven't you got irritated by the default dashboard page yet?

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.265
This page is not displaying anything useful to the user.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:09.780
And in this video,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.285
we shall try to make this space a little better.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:16.995
Let us display the products being sold by the user in this page.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.100
And if this user has now posted any ad,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.010
then he says simply display a message with a link to the forum for posting an ad.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.040
First, we sell create a new function inside

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.275
the products controller to fetch products by the user ID.

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:37.665
Then update the route to call this function,

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:42.455
and finally display the fetched products on the dashboard view.

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:45.080
So let's get started.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.720
Create a function inside the products controller.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.240
Name it, show ONE products.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.415
Inside this function, fetch the products by the idea of the user.

00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:06.220
We can get that from the class.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.120
Ought.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.560
We sell fetch all the products from the products table of

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.970
the database where user ID is equal to the idea of the logged in user.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.195
We can create such a query using the function

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:23.890
where we have to pass the name of the column by which we want to

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:32.335
fetch the items as the first parameter and the value to this second parameter.

00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:35.860
Here the first parameter is user ID,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.935
as we are storing the seller's ID in this column.

00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:43.195
And two, the second parameter we sell pass author ID,

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:46.720
that gives us the idea of the logged in user.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.630
So this query will fetch all the products where

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.230
the value of the column user ID is equal to ID.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.730
The rochelle ordered.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.665
It results in descending order of the value of the column created at as we did earlier.

00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:10.550
Finally, we have to call the function get.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.170
If you want to paste in it,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.130
this results replace the call to gate which pays in it or simple business.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.635
Returned a view for dashboard from this function and pass

00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:30.510
product's collection as we did inside the index function.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.610
Now open the root file web dot PHP and only dashboard root replace

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.640
the function of the second parameter

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.850
with a call to the newly created function of products controller.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.935
Save the changes and reload the dashboard page.

00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:03.415
You have to log in if you're not already,

00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:06.700
but you own see anything different as we have not

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.075
added the code to display the products on the dashboard page.

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:12.290
So let's add it.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.455
Open the file products dot blade dot PHP and copy the complete div

00:03:20.455 --> 00:03:27.920
containing the each directive and paste it inside the file dashboard dot blade dot PHP.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.550
I'm also making some changes to repairing replaced P4,

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.065
which PX and PY for,

00:03:39.065 --> 00:03:44.520
for the horizontal padding and if article's heading respectively.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.065
Now reload the page.

00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:54.450
And here we can see only those products added by the logged in user.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.455
I'll also change the message from you are logged into something else.

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:06.185
Let us display currently you are not selling anything.

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:09.920
If the user has not posted any ad yet.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.445
Otherwise display the number of ad posted.

00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:16.340
Products, coma, debt you are selling.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.910
So five products you are sailing or something like that.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.520
We can get the number of items of

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.270
the product's collection by passing it to the function size

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:35.100
of using an if directive we sell check is the collection products have any item?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.895
If it does, then we will display the number of products that you're selling.

00:04:43.895 --> 00:04:46.550
Otherwise, after the is directive,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.925
we sell display currently you are not selling anything.

00:04:49.925 --> 00:04:56.345
Let us also display the links to the post and add form 400.

00:04:56.345 --> 00:05:00.215
Add an anchor tag here and

00:05:00.215 --> 00:05:07.380
pass the URL of DIY route for the sale page and edit text here.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.230
Now save the changes and reload the page.
