00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.485
For this course, we will need a web server,

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.620
a PHP interpreter, and a MySQL database.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.665
You may choose to install these tools separately,

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:12.810
but there is an easier way.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.720
You simply need to install jam,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.890
which is a bundle of softwares required for PHP development.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.105
You have to go to the website, approach reframes.org,

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.595
download jam for your system

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:30.625
installed gem by following the instructions of the installer.

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:32.600
You may also need to add

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.120
just the user access control settings of your system for jam to work properly.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.300
Now we will have a control panel like this one.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.215
From this panel you can start or stop the Apache web server.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.715
And my square.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:52.115
There are a few other tools too,

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:56.375
but we are not concerned about them at this moment.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:01:00.600
So start Apache, MySQL.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.560
Now go to the web browser and type HTTP calls less,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.125
less localhost and hit enter.

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:12.860
Now if it page like this one is loaded,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.465
then we can be sure that the server is running.

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:19.760
Now click on this PHP,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.850
my admin button at the top right corner of the page.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.280
And if I pay similar to these four appears,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.245
then it is come from debt.

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:34.350
Mysql is 2 is working properly.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.120
Next, we had to install Laura Hill and we are going to use composer to install larval.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.540
So in the next video, I'll show you how to install composer first.
