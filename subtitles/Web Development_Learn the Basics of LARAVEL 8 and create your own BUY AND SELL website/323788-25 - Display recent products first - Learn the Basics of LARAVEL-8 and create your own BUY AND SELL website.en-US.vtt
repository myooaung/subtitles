00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.840
In this video, I'll show you how to retrieve items either in ascending or

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.549
descending order from a database table by particular attribute.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.100
If we take a look at the products table,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.890
we'll find a column named created at.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.125
This holds the timestamp of inserting a particular item into the table.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:31.250
We sell display our products in descending order by this attribute created it.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.765
So that the most recent ad appears at the first of the product list.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:41.704
And it is pretty simple.

00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:46.610
Open the file products controller dot PHP.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.070
Inside the index function,

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.400
replace the function all BY order BY we shall pass the column name created

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.290
at as the first argument and DESC as the second argument to specify descending order.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.630
Finally call the function gait.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.340
Save the changes and reload the product list page.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.095
Notice the changes.

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:21.545
So here this one bean test cafe racer is the most recent ad that we posted.

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:27.960
