00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.865
I'm glad to have you here.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:04.170
Welcome to the class.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.150
Now, before proceeding any further,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.785
let me show you the final product that you are going to build. During this class.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:13.755
I'm going to teach you how to create a buyer and seller website,

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:17.280
where a user can post an ad to sell something

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.720
and the user can browse through

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.375
the different products that are being sold on the website.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.040
Take a look at the details,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.215
find the contact information of the sailor and contact the seller if you're C,

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.135
gets interested in purchasing the product.

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:35.370
So the website will look something like this one.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.775
On the homepage, we will have a list of products being sold.

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:45.530
The menu at the top right corner,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.085
we'll have a button for a new user to register,

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:50.945
another to login to the website,

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:56.660
and another button for a user to create an ad for a product that he or she wants to sale.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.490
On clicking this sale button,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.730
a product upload page is displayed to the user.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.665
The user can enter a title,

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:08.105
description and a price and upload an image of the product.

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:10.370
On clicking this posted button,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.120
the product information will be saved on the database and it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.785
will get displayed on the product list of the homepage.

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:22.505
When an item of the product list is clicked,

00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:25.250
details of the particular product is displayed to

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.400
the user along with the information of the product.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.530
The product details page will also display the contact information of the sailor.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.080
This contact information will be visible only if the user is logged in our arise,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.790
this information will be kept hidden.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.090
A sailor will also be able to edit or delete his own products.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.500
This is a pretty simple website,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.040
but it needs one to know the basic concepts of Florida.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.560
And I'm going to teach you this basic concepts.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.225
I'll show you each and every step that you need to complete this website.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:08.540
Now there is a process associated with this class,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.955
which is basically your homework.

00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:14.120
And to know more about their project, what you have to do.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.700
Take a look at the video towards the end of the class.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.025
I have kept a video to the end,

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:21.920
but I still recommend you to go and take a look at

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.100
that video now because it will help you plan your project.
