00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Now as we have installed composer,

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:07.125
it is finally time to install Larson and create our first project.

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:11.265
Now if you take a look at the larval documentation,

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:15.775
you will find two approaches for installing larva is income Bowser.

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:21.000
Go through larval.com and click on documentation.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.000
Clay here on installation inside Getting Started off the leaf

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.360
Meno and click on Installation via composer.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.885
In the first approach,

00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:38.280
you have to run this command every time you want to create a new layer of health project.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.110
Or you can follow the second approach and you can install R well globally with

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.130
this command composer global require law has less installer.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.175
And then whenever you need to create a new project,

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:55.100
you can simply run lava new.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.580
And then the name of the project on the document is.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.345
And you will also notice this command, PHP artisan serve.

00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:09.950
This loads D-Wave site using PHP is inbuilt web server.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.580
But as we have already set up our Apache web server,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.440
so we don't use this command.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.225
Now on the jam control panel,

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.865
if we click on this explorer button,

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:25.730
it will take us to the installation directory of champ.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.745
Here you will find a folder named is to dogs.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:33.870
And this is the place where we have to keep all our code.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.415
So let's create a folder here to keep our project organized.

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:42.739
Let's name it projects.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:47.340
Now open the command froms and navigate to this folder.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.655
Or to directly open the command prompt in this folder,

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:57.510
type CMD on the address bar and hit Enter.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.600
Now let's install R over L as global composer dependency by running this command,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.090
composer globally require law.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.500
Ravel's less installer.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.735
And once the larva installation is successful,

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:25.375
we run the command Levin knew DNS,

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:28.270
let me call the website DNS,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.950
which stands for buy-in sale.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.630
After successful execution of this command,

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.029
you will have a new folder inside the project folder named DNS.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.690
On opening this folder,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.675
you will see the structure of a larval project.

00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:55.225
We shall explore the directories of the structure as and when required during the course.

00:02:55.225 --> 00:03:00.020
Now let us try to load the website on the browser.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.480
First, verify that our purchase Server is running from

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.650
the jam control panel and then on the address bar of the browser,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.409
type http columns less less localhost slash projects,

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.125
the directory where we are keeping our project,

00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:21.605
slash b ns, the name of our project,

00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:24.665
the name of the directory of our project.

00:03:24.665 --> 00:03:26.900
If you hit Enter now,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.215
you will see the directory structure of the project.

00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:34.220
And a publicly viewable web page.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.595
Is there inside this folder, public.

00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:43.925
So click here or add less public to the URL.

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:48.930
It loads the default home page of our large-scale project.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.630
We shall remove this homepage and add our own.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.445
But before that we sell add

00:03:55.445 --> 00:04:01.440
a hard shell host for the convenience of accessing the website.
