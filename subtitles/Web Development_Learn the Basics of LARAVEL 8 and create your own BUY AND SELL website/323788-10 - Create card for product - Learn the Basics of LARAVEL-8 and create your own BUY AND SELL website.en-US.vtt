00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.980
Continuing the development from where we lived.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.425
In the last video.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:14.925
Here we will create Dui to display the individual products.

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:16.605
On the products list.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:18.735
We sell create a guard like UI,

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:21.390
where we sell display an image of the product,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.785
a title, description, and the price of the product.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:29.850
When the user clicks on an item from this list,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.145
which will display the details on a new page.

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:36.590
Instead of using the raw CSS styles.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.360
So we shall use the CSS framework named Tailwind CSS to style the elements of the pages.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.560
And la Halle breeze uses tailwind CSS and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.895
as we have installed it to implement authentication.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:58.820
So Tailwind CSS is also installed and is ready to use.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.445
You can verify that by taking a look at defile named whip big dot,

00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:10.740
dot js, you can find it at the root of the directory structure.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.670
Recur tailwind CSS has to be passed to this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.735
function posts cases enclosed inside an array.

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:24.270
And here it is already being passed.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.820
The app dot CSS file inside the resources slash

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.550
css directory to contains the imports necessary for Tailwind to work.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.030
Now we have to add the link to our style sheet to the page

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.455
at this line to the head section of the page.

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:55.520
Essays is a helper function that generous center.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.680
It's the URL for the asset.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.680
And we also have to compile the CSS for that.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.745
Run the command npm run Dave on the terminal.

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:15.390
Ensure that you are inside the project directory on a terminal.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.110
This compiles the Tailwind CSS rate and inside app.js of

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.245
the resources folder to play in season and keeps it inside the public folder.

00:02:30.245 --> 00:02:35.000
Now come back to the products dot played dot PHP file.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.995
And let us try to make the background of the page a little gray.

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:46.160
But how to change the background color of an HTML element using Tailwind CSS.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.360
We have to add a class. Now which class?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.905
Let's find out.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.530
Go to Tailwind CSS documentation.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.040
Scroll down the left phenol Meno To

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.600
find the background section and click on background color.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.655
Here you will find some predefined classes to control and elements background color.

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:13.530
Let's copy BZ gray 50 and add it to the body of the page.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.030
Now if you are expecting the changes to a peer of 30 loading the page,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.800
then you are wrong.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.710
Whenever we make changes to the CSS,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.615
we have to compile it again.

00:03:28.615 --> 00:03:33.130
So run npm, run dev or the terminal.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.580
But wait, if you don't want to keep running this command,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.295
every time you change something,

00:03:39.295 --> 00:03:41.305
there is a better option for you.

00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:45.970
Run this command once in state npm, run what?

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.620
It will keep watching the relevant files for changes and automatically

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.540
start decompile lesson process whenever it detects it change.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.495
Now reloading the page,

00:03:57.495 --> 00:04:01.470
we will notice that the background color changes.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.125
Now add a new div inside the for-loop for the product card.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:22.550
Inside this div, Let's add an image tag for the product image.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.069
I'm adding an image from unsplash.com by the user and m c dx.

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:32.150
Below the image. Add another day 40 product title.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.025
One more below the title for the description of the product,

00:04:37.025 --> 00:04:40.380
and then one more for the product price.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:49.050
Now reload the page and you will see the image and the text repeated 10 times.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.150
Now let's add some styles to this elements.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.555
Let's start with the container day for the product.

00:04:56.555 --> 00:05:01.970
First, let's add some margin using Tailwind CSS class m for.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.430
You will find the margin related classes in this section called spacing in detail

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.685
when CSS documentation add bg white to make the card background white,

00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:16.655
add rounded to make the corners around.

00:05:16.655 --> 00:05:21.810
Let us also add some shadows at the class setup.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.490
Now as we have run the command npm run Watch,

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.595
it will automatically compile the CSS when we make changes and Safety Code.

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:40.370
And the Laura Hill mix compilers and successful notification will appear on the screen.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.050
Once we get the notification,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.095
we can reload the page to see the changes.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:48.450
So let's reload the page.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.325
Now. It looks better,

00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:54.275
but not like the way we want.

00:05:54.275 --> 00:05:56.615
Let's add some more styles.

00:05:56.615 --> 00:05:59.960
First, let's organize the cards in

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.915
multiple columns for that and close the for-loop inside a new div,

00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:09.300
a container for all the products.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:22.159
At the class, greed to organize the children of this div in a grid structure.

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:30.570
Also add greed goals for to specify that we want the grid to have four columns.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.800
You can find this greed related classes on the flexbox

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.550
and grid section of the Tailwind CSS documentation.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.560
Reload the page on the browser and you will feel good.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.475
We are approaching towards the goal.

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:53.780
Now it's top corners of the image are not rounded.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.305
Though the parent div has rounded corners.

00:06:57.305 --> 00:07:01.235
This does not look good and fixing this is easy at the class.

00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:04.200
Overflow hidden to repair endif,

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.490
and deserve corners at the top disappeared.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.660
Let's wrap the title and the description by

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:20.090
a new div and add some padding to this div using the class before.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.780
You can take a look at different bedding and other spacing

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.820
related classes in this basin section of the documentation.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.525
Now let's make the title a little smaller.

00:07:32.525 --> 00:07:39.570
Using the class takes SM and a little bowl using font, semi bowl.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.690
We shall make the description text smaller than the title text.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:50.250
And there is a class called takes access for that.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:59.930
Also, Let's make this description takes a little grayish using the gray 500.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.910
Now let us add a border to the top of the div for the price to

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:10.250
separate each from the above information at the class border,

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.860
t, T for top.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.920
Also add we X4,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.605
four horizon to padding and PY,

00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:21.720
two for high-tech palpating.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:29.060
Let's also make this text bold hand a little smaller using these two classes,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.540
font bold and taste, SM respectively.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:42.620
It looks good, but the space between the two cards sim to be a bit more, right?

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.805
Let's check if reducing the space makes it look any better.

00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:49.325
First, remove the margin from the product.

00:08:49.325 --> 00:08:51.725
These. And we sell,

00:08:51.725 --> 00:08:54.650
add some gap, the greedy itself.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:09:04.190
So add GEF four and at P4 to add an overall padding around the products, contain it.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.050
Now reload the page.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.559
And it looks beautiful.
