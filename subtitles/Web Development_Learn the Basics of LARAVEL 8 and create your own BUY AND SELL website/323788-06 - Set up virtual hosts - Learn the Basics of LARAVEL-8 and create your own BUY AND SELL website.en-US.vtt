00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.695
In this video, I'll show you how to add a hard shell host.

00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:12.085
But what will happen after adding a hard-shelled host?

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:13.900
Let me show you.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.655
This will happen.

00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:21.040
We shall be able to access our website using a domain name like this one,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.780
b ns dot goal.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.230
And it is convenient than typing localhost slash

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.770
projects slash DNS less public every time.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.195
Right?

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:33.220
Now to add a virtual host,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.995
we have to make changes in two files.

00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:39.340
One is inside the champ installation directory and

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.720
the other is inside the operating systems Windows directory.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.200
Let us find the first file.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.450
Go to jam the installation folder,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.140
then Apache, then C, U,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.540
and F, and then extra.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.015
Here you will find a file named HTTPD, deaths be hosts,

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:07.660
dots here and f. Inside

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.445
this file you will find some sample information inside blocks named a virtual host,

00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:17.720
which are currently committed by adding has at the beginning.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.190
We shall add a new virtual host blog.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.025
Here we sell add values for two properties.

00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:26.430
First is the document root.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.090
We sell at the path of the public directory of our Laura Bell project here.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.975
And he says specify IS server name by which we want to access our website.

00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:42.240
So let's add VNS dot go here.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:52.170
Let us add one more block to load the default jam dashboard page by the name localhost.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.760
Now we're done with the required changes in this file.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.600
So let's move on to the second file that I have mentioned earlier.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.540
For debt, we have to go to the directory C,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.650
Windows system 32 drivers and then ETC.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.740
And here you will find a file named hosts will make some changes to this file,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.635
but we have to do that as an administrator.

00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:25.715
So let us open note paid as administrator,

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:28.290
and then open this file

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.540
and add these two lines here to map the local IP address,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.760
2D domain names we want to use.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.604
We have to add the IP address,

00:02:45.604 --> 00:02:48.650
add a space or a tab,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.555
and then the domain name.

00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:56.165
And we have already specified the directories to which the domains to point to right.

00:02:56.165 --> 00:03:00.590
Now restart the Apache web server from Jim Control Panel

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.700
and try typing the domain names on the browser's address bar.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.015
Http, call owns less lesbians that go.

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:15.780
And it loads the homepage of our large-scale project.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.325
Now we are all set to start writing the code.

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:21.635
So open up your favorite ID.

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:24.320
I'm going to use Atom for this class,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.750
which you can find on this website.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.980
Atom dot io.
