00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.004
endpoint configuration?

3
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:13.001
In this challenge, you will modify the default JMX

4
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.008
exposure behavior for Spring Boot Actuator.

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:20.005
Your challenge is to expose one, and only one,

6
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:25.003
Spring Boot Actuator endpoint, the health endpoint,

7
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:30.002
from our DemoApi application as a JMX Bean to VisualVM.

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:34.002
You can see the repository file called CHALLENGE-ACTUATOR

9
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:39.004
for hints and tips found at the root of our demo repo

10
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:41.006
under CHALLENGE-ACTUATOR.

11
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:44.005
And the success criteria screenshot is also in that

12
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:45.008
Read me file.

13
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:47.000
Good luck.
