00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] The exercise files for this course

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:03.009
are stored on GitHub.

3
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:08.002
There is one branch, Main, that holds the two spring demo

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.000
applications that we will use for our lessons.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.007
This project may be forked at will allowing you to

6
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.008
experiment and practice further with any portion

7
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.000
of these lessons as you wish.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.003
You can make your own fork through the GitHub

9
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.002
user interface.

10
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.009
To work with this Java project,

11
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.008
there are multiple integrated development environments

12
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.000
that you can choose.

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.006
By cloning or downloading the project files

14
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.001
at your command line,

15
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.009
you will be prepared to open the project

16
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:38.003
in any IDE that you choose.

17
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.006
Your IDE likely has a specific way to clone a GitHub

18
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:46.004
repository from within the user interface.

19
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.003
And this will vary by environment.

20
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:54.002
And also by your preferred GitHub authentication mechanism.

21
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:58.002
You can also run a clone from the command line.

22
00:00:58.002 --> 00:00:59.008
Once you have the project files on your

23
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.004
local development system,

24
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:04.000
you can proceed to open, compile, and run

25
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.009
the Maven based spring boot project in your IDE.

26
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.002
Again, these exact steps will vary depending on your IDE.

27
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:15.004
The README file at the root directory of your GitHub

28
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:19.000
repository gives instructions for intelligent procedures.
