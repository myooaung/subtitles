00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.001
- [Kathy] No matter what stage of your career you are in,

2
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.003
presenting your work is an important part

3
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.003
of the life of any developer.

4
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.004
And the challenge is simply this.

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:14.001
For starters, communication is very hard work.

6
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.004
When you add to that,

7
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.009
that application performance itself

8
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.006
is an extremely nuanced, multi-faceted discipline,

9
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.002
which is dependent on many variables.

10
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.002
Those two things taken together

11
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:27.009
mean that a little focused attention

12
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.008
on how you're presenting your work

13
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.003
will yield benefits for any developer.

14
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:38.001
This lesson focuses on those formal and semiformal events,

15
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.004
such as iteration demos,

16
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:44.000
or maybe architectural reviews that you find yourself in

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.001
where you need to present,

18
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.007
summarize, and recommend solutions.

19
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:51.001
We have four principles that I'd like to talk about.

20
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.003
These principles are guiding lights

21
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.002
for my presentation work,

22
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:57.006
and I hope that they are useful for you too.

23
00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:01.007
First of all, avoid very technical jargon.

24
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:03.005
Compare this sentence.

25
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:06.000
"Our API responsiveness has degraded

26
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.008
because the logging aspect is joined

27
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:11.003
to a high volume of HTTP response payloads."

28
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.005
Compare that sentence with this one.

29
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:16.000
"We can improve our API responsiveness

30
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
by reducing our logging activity."

31
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The second sentence has less technical detail,

32
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but it gets the point across quickly

33
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.004
with a much higher probability

34
00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:27.003
that your audience will remain engaged

35
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.007
from the start at the sentence all the way to the end.

36
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:33.006
There's a time and a place for additional details

37
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:35.002
and we'll talk about that as we come up

38
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.001
on some other of these principles going forward.

39
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.003
The second principle I'd like to present

40
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:43.004
is the simple principle, use pictures and graphs

41
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:44.008
as much as possible.

42
00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:46.002
This is why some of these tools

43
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:47.006
that we have looked at in the course

44
00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.005
are so valuable because they allow you to extract

45
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:54.003
by screenshots or exported reports, pictures and graphs

46
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.008
that can help you in your presentations.

47
00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:59.009
For example here, we can say our overnight support team

48
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.003
is understaffed now that our request load

49
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:05.002
has increased by 62% last year.

50
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.005
Okay, that's important information.

51
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:10.004
But when you pair that sentence with a picture,

52
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:12.003
suddenly your user is engaged

53
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:15.005
and what you're saying has a little more credibility,

54
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:17.000
because it's clear that you've done

55
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.007
your measuring and you're quantifying

56
00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:22.002
of your recommendations.

57
00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.008
The third principle I like to follow

58
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:26.009
is to first summarize what is important

59
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.000
and also be prepared to go deeper.

60
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.004
So one thing you can say,

61
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:32.009
"We can improve our API responsiveness

62
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.002
by reducing our logging activity."

63
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:37.007
Depending on your audience that might be enough.

64
00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:39.006
However, when you come to your presentation

65
00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:41.004
with additional metrics,

66
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:43.002
for instance, reports that you captured

67
00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:46.006
from your metrics and monitoring tools,

68
00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:48.009
then you show that you're prepared to go deeper

69
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.008
and you can talk about more of the details of nuances

70
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:54.007
with your audience as it becomes necessary.

71
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.000
And then the final principle I'd like to present

72
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.001
is to equip your audience to ask more questions

73
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.001
by explaining trade-offs.

74
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.009
The sentence, "Our API responsiveness has slowed

75
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:08.000
by 26% over the last six months."

76
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.008
This is something you can deliver to an audience

77
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:13.002
as effect that you have learned.

78
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:15.006
However, when you say something like this,

79
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:18.008
"We can solve our slower API response times

80
00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:20.009
with more network throughput

81
00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:24.002
or by splitting our API into smaller microservices."

82
00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:26.002
When you present options like this,

83
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:27.009
then you invite questions

84
00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.009
and you can start talking about trade-offs

85
00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.006
and you can stepping back to some other principles.

86
00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:35.002
You can present additional work that you have done

87
00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:37.001
once you find that your audience is engaged

88
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:39.008
and interested in the trade-offs that they need to discuss.

89
00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:41.002
So those are four of the principles

90
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:44.002
that I like to follow in my day to day work

91
00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:46.000
whenever I come across a formal

92
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
or semiformal presentation that I need to give.
