00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] Spring Actuator

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:03.006
is a very important monitoring tool

3
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:07.003
and useful for production level operational success

4
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.004
for any spring based project.

5
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.002
Spring Actuator is a utility

6
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.001
for monitoring and managing the runtime operations

7
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.001
of your Spring Boot application.

8
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.008
In this video, we're going to talk about configuration

9
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.007
of the actuator in a real project,

10
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:23.003
and also take a quick overview

11
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:27.003
of the capabilities that actuator provides.

12
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.007
Let's jump into a real life demo application

13
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:32.001
and get accustomed to some of the capabilities

14
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.002
that Spring Actuator gives to us.

15
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.007
This is a demo project available

16
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:39.006
to you in the project repository.

17
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.007
We're looking at the demo API project.

18
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.002
Let's close that Explorer

19
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.008
to give us a little more real estate.

20
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:47.006
And the critical thing here,

21
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:50.008
really, almost the only thing you need

22
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.004
to get Spring Boot Actuator going

23
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.001
in your project is this dependency,

24
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.009
in your dependency configuration file.

25
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:02.002
This is a Maven project and so we're in a pom.xml file,

26
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:04.000
it could be different if you're using cradle

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.001
or some other build manager.

28
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.003
At any rate, the dependency you need

29
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:10.008
is Spring Boot Starter Actuator.

30
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:12.008
And once that is in here,

31
00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:15.003
technically that is all you have to do,

32
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:18.006
but we're going to do one other thing for convenience here.

33
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:20.004
We're going to add an attribute here

34
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.004
into our application properties,

35
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.008
exposing all of the capabilities through a web browser,

36
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:27.000
and that will make it easy for me

37
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.007
to demo to you what's possible.

38
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:31.004
So with those two things having been done,

39
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:34.003
our dependency in pom.xml

40
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:36.009
and one property here, the end points,

41
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.001
web exposure property in our application properties.

42
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.004
We're going to start our demo

43
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:43.009
and it looks like we're started up here.

44
00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.008
So now let's first look,

45
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.008
this is kind of a demonstration end point in our API,

46
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:51.005
but what I really want to show you here,

47
00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:55.006
is this new endpoint that actuator gives to us,

48
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:59.002
now that it is configured within our application.

49
00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:01.001
Please notice here in your browser,

50
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:02.009
all of these different categories

51
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.008
of information that are now surfaced to you,

52
00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:09.001
having done very little setup work to start with.

53
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.009
For example, these are all categories of information

54
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.001
that you can pull on the runtime of your application.

55
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.005
For example, the beans that are currently configured

56
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.008
in your application context,

57
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:25.003
a complete listing that is updated periodically

58
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:28.007
to reflect their absolute latest runtime information.

59
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:33.005
For example, this web end point discovery bean

60
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.006
is the one that's enabling us to browse the actuator stuff

61
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:38.005
right here in our browser.

62
00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:40.007
Let's have a look at another example.

63
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:43.004
Oh, well the health check is simply telling us

64
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:46.003
that our application is up and running.

65
00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:48.006
Environment information tells us all

66
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:53.000
about the properties active in our current application.

67
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.004
So a lot of interesting stuff that you get

68
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:57.007
for very little configuration work.

69
00:02:57.007 --> 00:02:59.000
Now let's pause and have a look

70
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.009
at some of the more detailed bits

71
00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:04.003
of configuration information that you ought to know.

72
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:07.002
So the by virtue of putting this dependency

73
00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:09.008
in your build configuration,

74
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:13.003
spring will automatically enable all

75
00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:16.007
of the actuator end points for you

76
00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:18.002
with the exception of one.

77
00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:21.002
And that one is a shutdown endpoint.

78
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:23.004
So let's do something fun here and let's go ahead

79
00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:26.005
and enable that shutdown endpoint.

80
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:31.002
And we're going to do that by adding a new property here,

81
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:39.005
management end point shut down enabled equals true.

82
00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:42.009
This is kind of clearly a security sort of capability

83
00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:46.001
that spring does not want to enable for you by default.

84
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:49.004
But when we activate it here in the properties file,

85
00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:51.000
we will get it.

86
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.004
Now let's do something else.

87
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:55.005
Let's turn off the default enablement

88
00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:58.000
of all of our end points.

89
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.001
Let's say that all of the end points are enabled

90
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:02.001
by the false is false,

91
00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.005
but let's only enable the shutdown end point

92
00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:11.008
and let's for fun enable the health end point.

93
00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:16.002
Now we're still exposing them all to the web,

94
00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:18.009
but we've turned them all off by default

95
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.007
and we've enabled two specific end points.

96
00:04:21.007 --> 00:04:24.002
So let's start this up again and quickly,

97
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:27.002
you will see the difference that the simple configurations

98
00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:30.007
make here in our browser view.

99
00:04:30.007 --> 00:04:32.006
See, now we have health.

100
00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:33.008
We have shut down.

101
00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:36.006
The sub path of health is a part of health.

102
00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:39.000
And then we have the actuator itself

103
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.005
which is what we're looking at.

104
00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:43.008
So that's an example of how to turn off

105
00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:46.009
or rather disable certain actuator end points

106
00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.001
and enable them on an individual basis as you need them.

107
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:54.009
Now, the takeaway with this is that when an endpoint

108
00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.004
is disabled, it is completely removed

109
00:04:57.004 --> 00:04:59.003
from the application context.

110
00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:01.007
So if you really don't need some of these end points,

111
00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:03.005
disabling them as a good idea,

112
00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:06.002
it just helps your application run a little leaner

113
00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:07.004
in terms of all the things

114
00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:09.009
that are loaded into that context.

115
00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.002
Now, so that's a bit about enablement.

116
00:05:12.002 --> 00:05:14.008
You can turn them on by default, off by default,

117
00:05:14.008 --> 00:05:17.004
turn individual things on and off, as you wish.

118
00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:18.009
Let's talk about exposure because

119
00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.008
this is a very important part.

120
00:05:20.008 --> 00:05:23.009
So Spring Actuator has the ability

121
00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:29.007
to expose end points over HTTP, which we are looking at here

122
00:05:29.007 --> 00:05:34.000
in our browser demonstration and also over JMX.

123
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.001
JMX stands for Java management extensions.

124
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:41.005
And by exposing this information to JMX framework,

125
00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:43.005
spring actuator allows you to interact with it

126
00:05:43.005 --> 00:05:47.002
through a Java management console.

127
00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:50.003
By default, when you configure actuator

128
00:05:50.003 --> 00:05:52.004
into your Spring Boot project,

129
00:05:52.004 --> 00:05:59.000
almost all of the enabled points are exposed over JMX

130
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.004
and almost all of them are not exposed over HTTP.

131
00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:05.004
That is why at the beginning of this demo,

132
00:06:05.004 --> 00:06:09.003
we had to put this include line in here to say yes,

133
00:06:09.003 --> 00:06:12.008
please give me all of them over the web so that I can browse

134
00:06:12.008 --> 00:06:16.002
them in a browser that helps her demo along a bit.

135
00:06:16.002 --> 00:06:17.009
So that's an important thing to note.

136
00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:22.007
You can also exclude certain end points from exposure

137
00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:25.006
to either modality as you wish.

138
00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:27.008
Okay, so that's a bit about enablement.

139
00:06:27.008 --> 00:06:32.007
That's a bit about exposure, HTTP and or JMX exposure

140
00:06:32.007 --> 00:06:34.006
for these different functionalities.

141
00:06:34.006 --> 00:06:37.006
Security is a massive part of configuration, of course,

142
00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:40.001
for the actuator end points,

143
00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:43.007
because clearly you don't want people meddling

144
00:06:43.007 --> 00:06:46.005
in your application and doing things for instance,

145
00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:49.000
like a shutdown and unauthorized.

146
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.008
So security configuration is important.

147
00:06:50.008 --> 00:06:53.007
It's outside the scope of what we can cover in this lesson,

148
00:06:53.007 --> 00:06:55.008
but you would configure these endpoints

149
00:06:55.008 --> 00:06:58.006
using spring security like you would

150
00:06:58.006 --> 00:07:01.005
other security considerations.

151
00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:04.006
Let's wrap up this video by having a look

152
00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:06.004
at some additional configuration you can do

153
00:07:06.004 --> 00:07:09.003
with respect to this health metric.

154
00:07:09.003 --> 00:07:13.008
So by default, we have our health endpoint enabled

155
00:07:13.008 --> 00:07:17.006
and exposed to the web and we can see a simple message

156
00:07:17.006 --> 00:07:21.003
telling us that our API is up and active,

157
00:07:21.003 --> 00:07:24.007
but there's much more you can do with health in particular.

158
00:07:24.007 --> 00:07:28.000
Not surprisingly Spring Boot is all about doing things

159
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.008
for us by default,

160
00:07:29.008 --> 00:07:34.003
we can add a couple of additional properties here

161
00:07:34.003 --> 00:07:37.009
on the health end point asking Spring Actuator

162
00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:41.000
to show some additional details and also show

163
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.005
some components that are pre-configured.

164
00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:47.008
So let me not try to explain that, let's just restart this

165
00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:51.002
and I will show you what those give us.

166
00:07:51.002 --> 00:07:53.006
Again right out of the box because that's what spring

167
00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:55.009
is so good at doing.

168
00:07:55.009 --> 00:08:00.008
So notice here with our health metrics,

169
00:08:00.008 --> 00:08:02.005
we have additional information,

170
00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:05.003
not only do we have the status of our application

171
00:08:05.003 --> 00:08:07.004
as a whole, as being up,

172
00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:11.000
but also the actuator now is reporting some automatically

173
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.004
registered components of our application.

174
00:08:13.004 --> 00:08:15.000
We have a database component,

175
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.005
we have an H2 database configured in here to our API.

176
00:08:18.005 --> 00:08:20.009
Spring notices that it's configured

177
00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:24.003
and is reporting us the status on that database.

178
00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:26.004
It's also automatically giving us information

179
00:08:26.004 --> 00:08:28.007
about the disc space that we're running against

180
00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:32.000
on our CPU with some details there.

181
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.003
And the ping status is something we get automatically

182
00:08:34.003 --> 00:08:37.000
out of the box simply by configuring

183
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.005
these two particular attributes on the health end point.

184
00:08:41.005 --> 00:08:46.005
Now there are 16 different components that spring

185
00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:49.006
is capable of configuring by default.

186
00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:52.008
If you have it wired into your spring application,

187
00:08:52.008 --> 00:08:56.002
things like send a mail or JMS queue

188
00:08:56.002 --> 00:09:00.003
or see elastic search with AWS

189
00:09:00.003 --> 00:09:03.002
can be automatically picked up and configured here

190
00:09:03.002 --> 00:09:06.009
is a component that the actuator can report

191
00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:10.005
in detail about the health of these by component.

192
00:09:10.005 --> 00:09:12.006
So that concludes our lesson about configuration

193
00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:15.000
and capabilities of Spring Actuator.
