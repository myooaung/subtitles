00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.006
(bright music)

2
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:07.003
- [Instructor] Are you ready to get your hands dirty?

3
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.005
In this challenge,

4
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.009
you will get a feel for experiencing

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.001
and then resolving a Java Virtual Machine

6
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.008
out of memory error.

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:18.002
As we observed in a previous video,

8
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:23.006
the DemoClient application has some bad JVM heat behaviors.

9
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.003
Your challenge is in two parts.

10
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:29.006
First, take advantage of that bed behavior

11
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:33.004
to force an OutOfMemory runtime error to be thrown

12
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:36.000
by the DemoClient application,

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.003
then fix the error.

14
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.009
For tips and hints and complete instructions,

15
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:45.004
you can see the repository file called CHALLENGE-JVM.

16
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:51.001
It can be found at the Root Directory of our Demo Repository

17
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.007
under CHALLENGE-JVM,

18
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:55.009
and you will find in that file instructions

19
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.005
and hints about how to be successful at this challenge.

20
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.000
Good luck.
