- [Kathy] As you go forward with your work

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.000
to master Spring performance,

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.002
here are some extremely valuable resources

4
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.008
that I would like to recommend.

5
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.004
LinkedIn Learning provides outstanding courses

6
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.002
for expanding your Spring expertise.

7
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:16.003
To follow up on our discussion of hibernate performance,

8
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:18.000
I highly recommend the course

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.006
Java Database Access with Hibernate.

10
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:23.005
You can go deeper on JVM performance with the course

11
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.001
Java Memory Management.

12
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.005
For an all around survey of Spring Boot,

13
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:31.005
check out the Spring Boot 1.0 Essential Training.

14
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.009
Finally, the Spring Actuator documentation

15
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.005
is outstanding and easy to navigate.

16
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.005
Here, you will find detailed implementation details

17
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:43.000
to extend our work on Spring Actuator in this course.
