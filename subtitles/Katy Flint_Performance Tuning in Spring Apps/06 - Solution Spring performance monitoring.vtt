00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.005
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.009
- [Instructor] Now, let's work through a solution

3
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.001
to the Spring Boot Actuator challenge.

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.008
As a reminder, the challenge was to expose one

5
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:15.000
and only one Spring Boot Actuator endpoint,

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.006
the health endpoint, from our DemoApi application

7
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.004
as a JMX Bean to VisualVM.

8
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:24.004
So, let's talk through how this is done.

9
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:28.002
The one configuration we need to add to the repository

10
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:32.003
is the exposure application property.

11
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:33.003
In this fashion,

12
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:46.005
management endpoints jmx.exposure.include=health.

13
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.007
This is the endpoint we're interested in exposing,

14
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.003
management endpoints JMX exposure,

15
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:53.006
and see, it's kind of analogous

16
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.002
to the web exposure endpoints

17
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:57.004
that we'd been working with all along.

18
00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:58.009
There's also one other property

19
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.008
that you inherited in the repository,

20
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:04.006
which is to enable JMX at the spring level,

21
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.007
no need for you to enter that yourself.

22
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.009
So, this one property should be all we need

23
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:17.006
in order to meet the challenge

24
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:20.006
and see if we succeeded.

25
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:25.001
Here's our running DemoApi application, the MBeans tab now.

26
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.001
We get this MBeans because we installed this plugin

27
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:29.009
as the Mbean browser.

28
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.004
Org springframework.boot on the left side,

29
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:35.002
so is our collection of actuator endpoints.

30
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.005
And we have one single endpoint surface tier,

31
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.006
as we're trying to do.

32
00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:44.000
You can see here in the operations tab,

33
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.008
the value for that particular endpoint is out of service

34
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:51.002
because now happens to be the weekend.

35
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:55.001
When you run this, this might or might not be the weekend.

36
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.008
So there, that is one way to solve this challenge.

37
00:01:57.008 --> 00:01:59.000
Well done.
