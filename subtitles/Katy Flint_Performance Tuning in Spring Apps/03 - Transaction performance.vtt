00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] As spring developers,

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:05.007
we code and we test and we deliver Java applications

3
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.001
that usually exist only as part

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.004
of a larger distributed system.

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:14.002
Application runtime monitoring is a class of monitoring

6
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:15.008
that provides a whole system view

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:18.008
of your application performance.

8
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.001
Through application runtime monitoring,

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.003
you can get insights into the transactions between

10
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:28.004
your Java application and the other external systems

11
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:32.002
that you depend on in order to deliver your results.

12
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.006
These transactions are things like HTTP requests

13
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:40.003
to APIs, database performances, other service call,

14
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:42.006
like to messaging platforms.

15
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:45.000
And also alerting is another feature

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of application runtime monitoring frameworks.

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.008
In this lesson,

18
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:51.009
we're going to have a look at a specific APM solution

19
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.003
called Glowroot.

20
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:56.003
Glowroot is an open source APM.

21
00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:57.008
It is easy to run locally.

22
00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:01.000
And so it's a nice learning tool for getting to know

23
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.009
about the possibilities for APM monitoring

24
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:07.006
and what you can learn from them about your application.

25
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:13.006
We will go now and do a demonstration of our application,

26
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.009
and we're going to have a look at some of the features

27
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.009
and functionalities using Glowroot

28
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.000
to get insight into our performance.

29
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
First of all, in order to configure Glowroot

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.001
to work with your local application, really quite simple,

31
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.001
you need to download the tool and install it,

32
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:30.004
which we're not going to cover here.

33
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:31.007
But the thing we are going to cover is

34
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.002
once you get it installed,

35
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:38.008
you need to add to your virtual machine parameters,

36
00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:41.005
a path to the Glowroot executable.

37
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:45.006
So that looks like a Java agent,

38
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.005
JVM parameter,

39
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:50.006
and simply the path to Glowroot will come.

40
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:52.000
You'll download it, unzip it,

41
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.003
and you'll get a jar and you need to put the path

42
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:59.008
to that jar file here in your VM.

43
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:01.007
And then when you start up your application,

44
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:05.002
Glowroot will be able to look at it and monitor it.

45
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:08.001
And that looks something like this.

46
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.005
So without more discussion about it,

47
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.003
let's just have a dive right into Glowroot

48
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.006
and have a look at the things that we can learn from it.

49
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:17.001
So Glowroot is running as it's a self-standing

50
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.005
web application.

51
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.002
It typically runs on port 4000.

52
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:24.001
And because we put in those JVM parameters,

53
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:28.008
now Glowroot has insight into our running Java application

54
00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:31.008
and can give us lots of good information.

55
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:33.008
Let's start and just have a look at what Glowroot

56
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:34.008
can tell us.

57
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:38.000
So Glowroot is divided, as many APMs are,

58
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.008
into kind of transactions, errors,

59
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:44.009
the Java virtual machine runtime, and some reporting tools.

60
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.002
Let's focus right here on the transactions tab,

61
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:49.001
because this is where a lot of the information

62
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.000
you want will be at.

63
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.002
Glowroot does have a separation between startup transactions

64
00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:57.003
and web transactions.

65
00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:59.001
We're going to have a look at our web transactions.

66
00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:00.008
And what we see here on the left

67
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:06.003
are several of the endpoints that our client demo

68
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:08.003
application provides.

69
00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:09.009
And to set up this lesson,

70
00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.007
I have hit a number of these endpoints.

71
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:14.009
So we can jump in here and look at specifically

72
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.009
what Glowroot can tell us about the performance

73
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.001
of our application.

74
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:20.006
Let's start with this quoter endpoint.

75
00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:24.007
So what we can learn from looking at this number

76
00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:28.002
is how our application performed

77
00:03:28.002 --> 00:03:30.002
when we hit this quoter endpoint.

78
00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:33.004
And what we see is that it took five seconds.

79
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.007
That's a pretty long response time.

80
00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:40.001
And it also tells us that our activity on this endpoint

81
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.001
was divided between an HTTP call,

82
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:46.001
some application logging and other.

83
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:46.009
Well,

84
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.000
the first thing you might notice is,

85
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.006
what is all that whole five seconds of other all about?

86
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:52.007
Well, if you didn't know this,

87
00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:55.002
you would kind of go in here and look for yourself.

88
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:58.002
But we know, because we know the code,

89
00:03:58.002 --> 00:04:02.004
that this quoter endpoint is calling out to a service.

90
00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:04.007
And then we have manufactured a delay here

91
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:08.000
by putting in a five second thread sleep.

92
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.008
And the reason we did that is so that I could show to you

93
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:14.002
how it will report to us here in Glowroot,

94
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:16.004
that we spent five whole seconds doing something

95
00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:19.008
that it wasn't sure what, but it's telling us all about it.

96
00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:22.003
So immediately this breakdown here of the activity

97
00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:23.006
is very valuable to us.

98
00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:26.005
It also here in this quoter tells us about the service call

99
00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:30.000
that we did call telling us that the average response time

100
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.007
there is only 137 milliseconds.

101
00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:35.003
So we know that the delay there is much different.

102
00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:38.000
Now let's have a look at a different type of endpoint,

103
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.005
which is long wait.

104
00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:41.009
The response times here are also five seconds,

105
00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:46.001
but what this tells us is that that entire five seconds

106
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:49.003
almost was spent with the HTTP client

107
00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:50.008
waiting for a response.

108
00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:53.001
Again, we can see why that is.

109
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:57.004
Long wait calls our internal demo API,

110
00:04:57.004 --> 00:05:01.006
and that demo API we happened to know also introduces

111
00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:04.003
a five second delay in its response time.

112
00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:06.003
We can't know on the front end that that happened,

113
00:05:06.003 --> 00:05:07.009
but what we can see is, my goodness,

114
00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.006
the service took a long time to respond.

115
00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:11.009
There's something going on over there

116
00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.000
that we should maybe understand.

117
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.005
This is a good spot to have a look

118
00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:18.009
at the slow traces section.

119
00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.000
The slow traces will give us more details

120
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.006
about what was going on in those five seconds.

121
00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:30.005
Now let's look at another endpoint, the query endpoint.

122
00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:31.008
This is a nice one,

123
00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:34.002
because what I can show you here are a couple things.

124
00:05:34.002 --> 00:05:37.002
This one has a nice breakdown of a number of types

125
00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:38.002
of activities.

126
00:05:38.002 --> 00:05:40.005
We've got a JDBC connection, some logging,

127
00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:42.008
and then some other activity here,

128
00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.008
which is an introduced wait time.

129
00:05:44.008 --> 00:05:47.002
But the thing I want to show you here is queries.

130
00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:50.000
You can see a breakdown of queries

131
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.002
every time this endpoint is called.

132
00:05:54.002 --> 00:05:55.009
Glowroot will keep track of the queries,

133
00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.006
keep track of how many times it's been called

134
00:05:57.006 --> 00:06:00.002
and the average performance of that database query.

135
00:06:00.002 --> 00:06:02.007
So this is extremely valuable information

136
00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:05.002
for diagnosing slow query performance.

137
00:06:05.002 --> 00:06:07.009
Let me now show you this oops endpoint.

138
00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.007
Not a whole lot to see here,

139
00:06:09.007 --> 00:06:13.000
we see a pretty fast response time on this one,

140
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.007
but most of the time spent in the spring controller.

141
00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:17.000
That's interesting.

142
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.005
Let's go over here and look at the errors tab.

143
00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:22.000
This is a good place to demonstrate this tab to you.

144
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.002
We have with the oops endpoint a couple of errors.

145
00:06:25.002 --> 00:06:28.002
And again, I can show you why that is.

146
00:06:28.002 --> 00:06:30.006
That is because here on our oops endpoint,

147
00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:33.004
we're just throwing a new runtime exception

148
00:06:33.004 --> 00:06:35.004
just so we can see how Glowroot

149
00:06:35.004 --> 00:06:37.009
will report that back out to us.

150
00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:39.005
Oops shows two errors.

151
00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:44.009
We can trace these errors and get information about them

152
00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:50.006
and actually trace in and see details about that.

153
00:06:50.006 --> 00:06:51.006
A couple more things I'll show you here

154
00:06:51.006 --> 00:06:55.008
in the Glowroot options are the JVM section

155
00:06:55.008 --> 00:06:58.002
gives us a lot of information about the JVM.

156
00:06:58.002 --> 00:07:01.003
We have covered this material in a previous lesson

157
00:07:01.003 --> 00:07:03.007
that some of this is the same kind of things you will see

158
00:07:03.007 --> 00:07:07.004
in J console or visual VM and Glowroot

159
00:07:07.004 --> 00:07:10.009
will also surface JVM statistics here.

160
00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:12.009
And then the final thing I want to point out to you here

161
00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:16.008
in Glowroot is the capability to do reporting.

162
00:07:16.008 --> 00:07:19.009
Very useful when needing to give some type of feedback

163
00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.004
to your application stakeholders.

164
00:07:22.004 --> 00:07:23.002
For instance,

165
00:07:23.002 --> 00:07:27.001
we can get a transaction count on our web transactions.

166
00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:29.004
Let's give it no filter.

167
00:07:29.004 --> 00:07:31.003
Let's make this hourly.

168
00:07:31.003 --> 00:07:35.000
Let's look over the past couple of days for our report.

169
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.005
Now this is interesting. You see 240 transactions.

170
00:07:40.005 --> 00:07:45.002
When we dig a look into what some of these transactions are,

171
00:07:45.002 --> 00:07:47.002
we can actually see something interesting here,

172
00:07:47.002 --> 00:07:49.002
which is the Prometheus tool,

173
00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:50.009
which we've looked at in other lessons,

174
00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:54.009
is making calls also into our client demo application.

175
00:07:54.009 --> 00:08:01.002
And those are also reflecting here in Glowroot.

176
00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:02.008
One final thing I'll show you is here

177
00:08:02.008 --> 00:08:04.004
on the configuration tab.

178
00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:06.004
When you're logged in as an administrator,

179
00:08:06.004 --> 00:08:09.000
there are a number of configurations you can make.

180
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.001
For instance,

181
00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:13.009
you can do some configurations around spring

182
00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:16.004
and some other JDBC configurations

183
00:08:16.004 --> 00:08:20.000
will give you a bunch of options that you can talk about.

184
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.007
Connection pool leaks, connection pool leak details,

185
00:08:22.007 --> 00:08:24.006
some interesting items that you might be interested in

186
00:08:24.006 --> 00:08:28.000
if you're concerned with looking at connection information.

187
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.004
And then finally you can add instrumentation,

188
00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:33.000
which I'm not going to demonstrate to you now,

189
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.003
but you can add additional instrumentation to methods

190
00:08:36.003 --> 00:08:38.007
that you may be interested in getting more detail

191
00:08:38.007 --> 00:08:40.004
about their performance.

192
00:08:40.004 --> 00:08:41.008
So this is a bit about Glowroot.

193
00:08:41.008 --> 00:08:45.006
And Glowroot represents a class of application performance

194
00:08:45.006 --> 00:08:49.002
monitoring platforms that are essential to being able

195
00:08:49.002 --> 00:08:51.001
to get insight into the performance

196
00:08:51.001 --> 00:08:54.000
of your spring application.
