- [Instructor] This course is a survey course

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.002
in spring performance tuning.

3
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:05.008
To get the most out of this course,

4
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:08.000
you will need a fluency with Java 8

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.004
and the Core Spring framework, including Spring Boot.

6
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.004
You will benefit from a basic knowledge

7
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:17.006
of JDBC connectivity, aspect-oriented programming,

8
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.009
and the Java Virtual Machine.

9
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.001
Familiarity with common web and API application patterns

10
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.000
and architectures will also be useful.

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.002
In order to interact

12
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.009
with the hands-on project exercise files,

13
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.008
you will need to be able to clone a git repository.

14
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:37.001
Also required are the abilities to compile and run

15
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.007
a Maven-based spring application in a Java friendly,

16
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.000
integrated development environment,

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.004
such as IntelliJ, NetBeans or Eclipse.

18
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:50.000
We will present our code demonstrations using IntelliJ.

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
However, you can have success with any major Java-based IDE.
