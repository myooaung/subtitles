00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Kathy] This is a survey course on

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.001
spring performance tuning.

3
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:08.005
With a strong emphasis on observability and preparedness,

4
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.007
this course strives to equip the student to not only

5
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:14.000
understand some of the trickier aspects

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.009
of spring performance, but also how to test,

7
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.008
measure, and communicate about performance.

8
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.008
We will start with a breakdown of the foundations of spring

9
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:26.001
performance so that we can understand the complicated

10
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.002
landscape that we work within.

11
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.007
Then we will learn about specific tools,

12
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.006
techniques, and technical hot topics

13
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.007
specific to Java and the spring project.

14
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:39.004
We will wrap up our work with a discussion of essential

15
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:43.005
everyday tools and practices that a spring developer can

16
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.003
adopt in order to make a comfortable habit

17
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.004
out of performance engineering.

18
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.003
I am Kathy Flint, and I've been building software

19
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:53.009
professionally for 25 years,

20
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:58.002
and working with spring in enterprise settings since 2005.

21
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.006
I believe that when it comes to spring performance

22
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:04.007
engineering success is achieved not by a linear approach to

23
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:08.005
isolated metrics, but rather by mastering what can feel like

24
00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:12.000
a bewildering matrix of gains and trade-offs.

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.007
In this course, I will break down the essentials

26
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:19.000
of spring performance engineering into manageable topics

27
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.001
so that the learner is empowered to approach a variety

28
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:26.001
of real world situations with confidence and clarity.

29
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.001

30
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:33.000
confidence and fluency with spring related performance.
