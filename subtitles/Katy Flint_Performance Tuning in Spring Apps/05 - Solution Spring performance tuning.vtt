(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.005
- [Instructor] Let us look together

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.007
now at a solution for the challenge.

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.007
What we're wanting to do is modify

5
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:13.005
the DemoClient application start-up configuration,

6
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.008
to report only the start-up events

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:19.002
that are initiated by the Spring Boot framework.

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.009
Let's have a little context.

9
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.009
Right now, we have a DemoClient application.

10
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.009
It is currently running.

11
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.004
It is currently getting an application startup context

12
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:34.002
using a buffering application startup object.

13
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:37.000
The results of this current startup configuration

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
are that our startup and point from our actuator directory

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.001
is reporting hundreds of events.

16
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:47.001
And we want to narrow that down so that we are just seeing

17
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.009
a specific subset of them.

18
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:53.007
This challenge is asking us to report only the events that

19
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:57.002
are initiated by the Spring Boot framework itself.

20
00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:00.005
So the way we do that is as follows.

21
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.003
We need to add to our buffering application,

22
00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:06.004
startup configuration, a filter,

23
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:10.007
and we're going to add a filter on the startup step,

24
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:14.003
and we want to get the name of the step.

25
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:21.002
And we want to find the steps that start with Spring Boot.

26
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:28.000
This information is coming from the event startup step name.

27
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.009
We can plug our filter in here,

28
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.005
ask for only names that start with Spring Boot.

29
00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:37.003
And now we're still passing the same buffering application

30
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:40.004
startup object to our startup command,

31
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:43.001
and then to our run command,

32
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:48.004
we're going to restart our client application.

33
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:51.002
Let's reload our actuator directory

34
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.008
go back into our startup metrics.

35
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.005
And here we have only a few metrics.

36
00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:58.004
Now we have six metrics,

37
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:02.004
all of them specific to the Spring Boot framework

38
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:03.007
initiated events.

39
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:06.000
So that is one solution to our challenge.
