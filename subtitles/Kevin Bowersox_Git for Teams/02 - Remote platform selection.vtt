00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.040
- [Instructor] In this lesson,

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.050
we'll discuss central repositories

3
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.030
and explore your team's options

4
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.010
for hosting them on a remote platform.

5
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.080
Throughout the course, you may hear me using the terms

6
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.000
remote platform and central repository interchangeably.

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.010
Just be aware that I'm referring to the same concept.

8
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.040
It's where your team stores the shared copy

9
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.090
of the source code.

10
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.000
Teams using Git will require a central repository

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.070
that facilitates their collaboration.

12
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.010
A central repository is, at its core,

13
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.050
just another repository, however,

14
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.040
it allows team members to push and pull changes

15
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.000
to the code base.

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.060
The central repository is normally hosted on a remote server

17
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.050
or located within a Git repository management service.

18
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.070
Let's take a look at a few options for hosting.

19
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.030
One of the simplest options your development team has is

20
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.020
to install Git on a server within your hosting environment.

21
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.070
You would choose this option if you don't require a more

22
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.010
full-featured Git hosting solution

23
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.030
or if you are unable to host code on a third-party service.

24
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.030
Setting up the central repository is relatively simple

25
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.040
once Git is installed on the server.

26
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.020
Simply use the command git inti --bare.

27
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.030
Many teams decide to use a repository manager

28
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.080
for their central repository.

29
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.090
Repo managers often provide a cloud-based

30
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.060
or on-prem service for storing source code with Git

31
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.040
as well as additional features

32
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.030
for managing your team's development processes

33
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.020
and collaboration.

34
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.020
Commonly, you will find the ability to track work items

35
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.090
or issues, manage pull requests,

36
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.020
and conduct code reviews within the manager.

37
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.020
A key feature provided by repository managers is the ability

38
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.090
to control access on repositories

39
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.020
by setting user permissions.

40
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.010
Using the manager to ensure only authorized

41
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.060
individuals have access to the repositories helps

42
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.060
prevent against unauthorized file modifications

43
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.060
and can be used to enforce workflows.

44
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.090
Another feature finding its way into repository managers

45
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.090
is the ability to modify code directly

46
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.030
within the repository.

47
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.020
Sometimes you'll even find built-in IDEs.

48
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.010
Let's compare three of the most common

49
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.030
repository services available.

50
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.080
Specifically, we'll take a look at GitHub, GitLab,

51
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.020
and Bitbucket.

52
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.060
Each of these repository managers provides

53
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.000
the common features we discussed in addition

54
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.090
to some extra capabilities.

55
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.010
Most developers are familiar with GitHub,

56
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.040
a leading repository manager popular

57
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.060
with the open-source community.

58
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.090
GitHub is most often used via its cloud platform,

59
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.050
however, enterprises do have the option

60
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.060
to host GitHub on-premise for a fee.

61
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.060
Additionally, GitHub charges a fee

62
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.090
for private repositories hosted on their cloud.

63
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.010
Those using GitHub will enjoy access

64
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.080
to a Rest API to access their data

65
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.010
and a gist feature for sharing small code snippets.

66
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.090
GitLab is a repository hosting service

67
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.010
that has been gaining popularity.

68
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.000
It is offered as a cloud service

69
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.050
and an on-premise installation.

70
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.010
The on-prem installation is completely free

71
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.080
if using the GitLab Community Edition.

72
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.080
Higher tier services are available from GitLab for a fee.

73
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.030
The repo manager also offers direct support

74
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.030
for CI/CD via its GitLab Runner feature,

75
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.060
which can be used for build and promotion

76
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.020
of software artifacts, so you can get continuous integration

77
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.050
and continuous delivery through this platform.

78
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.000
Finally, Bitbucket is a manager with similar features

79
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.010
and usage models to GitHub.

80
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.010
The main benefit of Bitbucket is

81
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.010
that it integrates extremely well

82
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.040
with other Atlassian products.

83
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.090
If you are already using Jira and Confluence,

84
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.060
Bitbucket is a pretty clear choice

85
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.030
for your GitHub hosting service.

86
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.000
Each of these repository managers

87
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.070
we reviewed are excellent choices

88
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.080
for hosting your development team's central repository.

89
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.080
For the purposes of this course,

90
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.010
we'll be proceeding with GitLab's Community Edition

91
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.090
because of its ability to be installed on-premise

92
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.020
for no fee.

93
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.050
As we proceed, we'll explore the benefits GitLab provides

94
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.000
to your team.
