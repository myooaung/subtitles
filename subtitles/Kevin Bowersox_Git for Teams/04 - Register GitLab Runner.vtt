00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.000
- Now that we've installed GitLab Runner,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.030
we need to register it with our repository manager,

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.000
or GitLab's Core.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.090
So we'll start logged in

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.010
as an administrator within GitLab's UI.

6
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.030
From here we're going to enter the Admin Area,

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.010
and you'll notice we have a section

8
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.060
within the Admin Area dedicated to the Runners.

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.030
If we click on that section,

10
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.040
you'll see that it provides us with some instructions

11
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.020
for setting up a shared Runner.

12
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.060
Shared Runners are able to perform jobs

13
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.050
as part of any project's CI/CD pipeline.

14
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.020
So this is exactly what we want to establish.

15
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.060
You'll notice we get some specific

16
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.050
configuration instructions for registering a Runner.

17
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.090
So, there's kind of an interplay

18
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.050
between the command line and what we have here in the UI.

19
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.000
Let's hop over to the command line,

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.070
and we'll get the process started.

21
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.040
So, we need to issue this command

22
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.040
as an admin using sudo,

23
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.080
and it's simply gitlab-runner and then register.

24
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.080
And it's going to walk us through some questions,

25
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.030
and the answer to those questions are over on the UI.

26
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.060
So, it wants to know the URL for the Runner,

27
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.090
so basically we're just pointing the Runner

28
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.090
at our GitLab Core installation.

29
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.080
So let's just copy the URL here,

30
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.010
head back over to the terminal,

31
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.020
and then we can paste the URL.

32
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.000
It's now going to ask for a GitLab CI token.

33
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.080
Once again, this is found over on the user interface.

34
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.040
So simply copy this nice string of characters

35
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.070
and then navigate back to the terminal,

36
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.060
and we can paste our token.

37
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.080
At this point it's going to ask us for a description.

38
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.040
This is completely optional.

39
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.080
We're just going to leave it blank

40
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.080
and the same thing with the tags.

41
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.030
Now here's the important part

42
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.070
of setting up the GitLab Runner.

43
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.080
It can run in various modes.

44
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.090
There you see docker, virtualbox.

45
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.040
We're just going to be running

46
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.020
the GitLab Runner on the Ubuntu shell.

47
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.090
So, we're just going to specify shell,

48
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.020
and at this point our Runner is now registered.

49
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.090
If we navigate over to the user interface,

50
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.050
we will see, if we scroll down,

51
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.090
that our Runner was successfully registered.

52
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.090
There we see the Runner as well as its IP address

53
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.080
and when it last contacted the GitLab Core.

54
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.000
So we can see registration was successful.
