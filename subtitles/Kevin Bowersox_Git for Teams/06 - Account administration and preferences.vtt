00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Instructor] In this lesson, we're going to walk through

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.010
some simple tips for administering users.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.070
You'll see that I'm logged in as our administrative user

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.050
and we're going to make some changes to the profiles

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.070
of the maintainer and the contributor accounts.

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.020
So let's head into the admin area and then navigate

7
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.020
to the users section on the sidebar.

8
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.080
First, we're going to enter the contributor's account

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.020
and we're gonna take a look at how we can edit the password

10
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.020
for an account.

11
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.090
So this is useful if somebody forgets their account

12
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.090
or you need to set an initial password for a user.

13
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.060
So once you click on the edit button,

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.030
all you need to do is type in the password for the account

15
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.040
and it will then be set for the user.

16
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.090
The next time they log in, they will need to specify

17
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.080
a new password, but they will be able to use that temporary

18
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.050
password you've provided to them.

19
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.060
Another neat feature that we're going to use

20
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.000
is the impersonate feature.

21
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.060
This allows us to enter GitLab as the user to see what

22
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.000
they see when they log in.

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.090
We're going to actually enter the settings for this user,

24
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.080
the contributor, and configure their preferences.

25
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.010
We're going to set the navigation theme for this user

26
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.020
to light red, and the reason we're doing this is so that

27
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.030
we can distinguish which user we're logged in as.

28
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.050
So when we see the red theme, we know that we're working

29
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.060
as a contributor.

30
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.010
I'll just navigate to the bottom of the screen

31
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.010
and then click on save changes.

32
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.060
You'll also note that within the preferences area,

33
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.090
you can do things like adjust the application's layout,

34
00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.000
or specify a particular layout for the dashboard.

35
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.080
There's all sorts of configurations that can be applied

36
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.060
to a user's account to meet their preferences.

37
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.050
To stop impersonating a user, all we have to do

38
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.060
is click on the stop impersonation button at the top right

39
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.000
of the screen.

40
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.090
Now we're going to navigate into the maintainer account,

41
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.080
and we'll impersonate them as well, and adjust their

42
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.010
preferences so that they have a separate theme as well.

43
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.000
So once again on the sidebar, we navigate to preferences

44
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.050
and I'm going to set them up with a green theme.

45
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.000
You'll notice that the top menu now switches over to green,

46
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.080
so we know when we see the green theme,

47
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.040
we're working with a maintainer account.

48
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.050
So these are just a few simple customizations

49
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.000
that you can put in place when administering accounts

50
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.070
or setting up your own profile within GitLab.

51
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.000
We also saw how to set up a new account with a provided

52
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.070
password so that the user can self-service on their password

53
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.040
on the first login.

54
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.090
These can be helpful when onboarding new team members

55
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.000
and setting up their profiles.
