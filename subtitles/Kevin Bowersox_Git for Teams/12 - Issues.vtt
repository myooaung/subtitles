00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] GitLab's workload tracking feature

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.070
is centered around the concept of issues.

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.010
Issues allow new work to be identified

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.010
and provide an area for the team

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.080
to collaborate on the new work item.

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.010
When using Git flow,

7
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.020
issues serve as the seeds for new work items,

8
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.020
eventually growing into feature branches

9
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.050
once the work is defined.

10
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.060
Issues and feature branches provide tight integration

11
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.070
between workload tracking features

12
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.060
and the source code repository in GitLab.

13
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.090
Let's work on building out a new issue

14
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.050
within the issue section of GitLab.

15
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.090
You'll notice we don't have any issues available yet.

16
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.050
So we get this nice button in the middle of the page

17
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.090
to create a new issue.

18
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.070
If we click on that button we get presented

19
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.050
with the new issue form.

20
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.030
We're going to go ahead and create this issue

21
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.050
for the flow project.

22
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.080
We're simply going to title the issue Missing Feature A.

23
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.020
Once we have a title we can go ahead

24
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.000
and write a description for our issue.

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'll simply state that the project

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.040
is missing feature A as requested.

27
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.060
You'll notice that the description section

28
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.050
provides us with a bunch of markup

29
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.050
that we can apply to the text.

30
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.090
Use this to help fully define your requirement.

31
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.040
At the bottom of the form we are able

32
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.000
to assign this issue to our team members.

33
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.080
So here we see the members of our team

34
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.090
and we're going to go ahead an assign this issue

35
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.040
to a contributor.

36
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.020
We can also specify a due date for this issue.

37
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.040
Let's say it's going to be due on Tuesday.

38
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.060
At this point, if we're satisfied with our issue,

39
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.010
we can go ahead and submit it.

40
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.000
We'll now notice if we navigate back into the issue section

41
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.040
we're presented with a list.

42
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.090
If we had more issues they would

43
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.060
all be listed here on the screen.

44
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.080
Drilling down into missing feature A

45
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.000
you'll see that we can now edit

46
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.060
the issue that we've created.

47
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.010
There's also this collaboration section

48
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.090
where a discussion can be added regarding the issue at hand

49
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.020
by all team members.

50
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.070
In this area we can record a variety

51
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.080
of information about the issue.

52
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.060
For example, let's say that we wanna specify an estimate.

53
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.090
There's a neat, quick action syntax that we can use.

54
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.000
So if you use the forward slash you'll see

55
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.020
that we get some auto complete.

56
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.050
And this allows us to select one of the quick actions.

57
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.070
One of those is estimate,

58
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.080
and this allows us to attach an estimate to the issue

59
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.070
for how long we think it will take to complete.

60
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.000
You'll notice the syntax allows us to specify weeks,

61
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
days, hours, or minutes.

62
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.080
Let's say it's going to take eight hours to complete.

63
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.060
Once we've specified this within the comment

64
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.020
we go ahead and hit comment and you'll notice

65
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.070
that our estimate on the right hand side has been increased.

66
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.020
When we have a lot of issues it's very helpful

67
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.000
to track them using the board.

68
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.070
You'll notice that our new issue

69
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.020
is currently sitting in the backlog.

70
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.020
We can add new lists to our board

71
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.030
by clicking on the add list button.

72
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.080
This will create new columns

73
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.090
that we can shift issues between

74
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.020
as they progress through the stages of development.

75
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.050
Once we click on add list you'll see create project label.

76
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.060
This is a little bit of a confusing part in GitLab.

77
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.090
The lists are actually labels.

78
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.030
It's a little bit off in the terminology,

79
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.090
but as long as you know that label

80
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.060
is equal to list you'll be fine.

81
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.000
Once we click on the create project label,

82
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
all we need to do is provide a new name for the label.

83
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.060
In this case we're going to add the Under Development label.

84
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.090
We'll assign a color,

85
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.080
let's say green because development started,

86
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.020
and then we'll go ahead and click on create.

87
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.070
Let's create a new list as well for those issues

88
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.020
that are ready for testing.

89
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.020
We'll set the color here as this nice magenta

90
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.000
and then click on create.

91
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.040
So now if we return back to our board

92
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.060
you see our two new lists.

93
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.050
And we can go ahead and drag feature A from the backlog

94
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.070
to Under Development.

95
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.020
Notice once we dragged the feature under the new list

96
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.080
it was then tagged with the name of the list,

97
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.090
or the label was added to the issue.

98
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.090
This is a way to know the status of a particular work item.

99
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.050
Now let's talk a little bit about milestones.

100
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.060
Within GitLab milestones provide

101
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.090
a way to organize issues for a project.

102
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.030
We can navigate to the milestones area

103
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.050
by clicking on the milestone options on the sidebar.

104
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.080
To create a new milestone all we need to do

105
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.070
is click on the new milestone button.

106
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.030
The milestone is used to group issues together

107
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.060
so that we can track a large initiative

108
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.020
over a period of time.

109
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.010
Let's say that we want to create a new milestone

110
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.080
to track some epic feature.

111
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.020
And we'll add a little bit of a description.

112
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.020
We'll say this feature will be epic,

113
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.020
and then we can go ahead and create that milestone.

114
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.090
If we wanted we could assign dates

115
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.090
for when the milestone's going to begin

116
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.020
and when it's going to end.

117
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.080
Okay, so now we have this new epic feature milestone.

118
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.010
At this point we can return to our list,

119
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.050
and if we click on missing feature A

120
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.050
we can add it to that group of issues within the milestone

121
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.010
by using the edit option on the right hand side

122
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.070
beside milestone and then we just click on Epic Feature.

123
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.010
So now the missing feature A issue

124
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.060
is tracked in that milestone.

125
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.070
You'll also notice that we get a nice history

126
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.090
of all the work that's done on this issue.

127
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.050
If we navigate back to the milestone section

128
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.090
you'll see that we can drill down into the Epic Feature

129
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.000
and it shows us where all the issues

130
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.040
associated with that milestone reside

131
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.010
as far as their status.

132
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.080
So that wraps up our overview

133
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.050
of the workload tracking features in GitLab.

134
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.020
Using this feature your team can easily manage your backlog

135
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.060
and track work on your project.

136
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.050
It will help your team communicate

137
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.000
and collaborate better regarding your workload.
