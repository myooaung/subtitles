00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Kevin] In this course, I've provided you

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.090
with a toolbox of strategies and techniques

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.000
for using Git as a team.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.010
You've seen how tools such as GitLab

5
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.030
support workflows like GitFlow,

6
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.050
and provide a platform for continuous integration.

7
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.020
I hope you've learned some techniques

8
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.070
that will benefit your team and would love to hear

9
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.020
how it's improved your workflow, so stay in touch with me.

10
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.080
You can find my blog at tothought.com,

11
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.000
and I go by the handle of Kevin Bowersox

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.020
on stack overflow, where I can help you

13
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.020
with any challenges you experience.

14
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.070
If you're looking to take your team's practices

15
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.070
to the next level after this course,

16
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.030
I would recommend looking in the LinkedIn Learning Library

17
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.040
for courses on DevOps.

18
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.000
Thanks for taking this course.

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now get out there and put these new Git strategies

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in place for your team.
