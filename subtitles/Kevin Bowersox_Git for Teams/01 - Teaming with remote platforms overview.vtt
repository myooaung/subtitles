00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.040
- [Instructor] This chapter will cover how remote platforms

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.040
make it easier for teams to work with Git.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.000
Remote platforms, or repository managers,

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
provide additional capabilities

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.080
that surround Git repositories.

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.010
These capabilities help development teams organize

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.040
and communicate better regarding changes

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.050
to the project's code.

9
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.070
For instance, in a remote platform like GitLab,

10
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.000
you can manage project work items, perform code reviews,

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.070
or control how code changes flow from branch to branch.

12
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.000
This chapter will start with an overview

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.030
of remote platforms

14
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.040
and a comparison of several prominent repository managers.

15
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.050
Then we'll go hands-on with GitLab

16
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.040
to give you some experience working

17
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.090
with a repository manager.

18
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.000
We will install and configure the tool

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.070
before I give you a basic walk-through

20
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.020
to get you familiar with its features.

21
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.020
Next, we'll step away from GitLab

22
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.000
to look at workflows and branching strategies

23
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.030
that standardize the flow of code

24
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.010
from your local machine to a master production branch.

25
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.080
Then, we'll put the two concepts together

26
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.030
and I'll walk you through the GitFlow workflow using GitLab.

27
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.060
I will teach you each step of the workflow

28
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.030
starting with an issue in the workload tracker,

29
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.010
then building a feature branch

30
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.050
and progressing our code changes all the way to production.

31
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.000
After completing this chapter,

32
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.030
you will understand how the best development teams

33
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.060
promote their code,

34
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.000
and how to use the tools they use to do it.

35
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.010
With this experience,

36
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.030
you'll be able to introduce these practices to your team

37
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.020
to operate more efficiently,

38
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.000
or be confident in stepping in to any new team.
