00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Instructor] GitLab provides many features that support

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.050
development teams using Git as their source code repository.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.020
This lesson will provide a high-level overview of GitLab

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.020
and shows you where to find major features within the tool.

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.020
Projects are a core concept within GitLab.

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.010
Once you establish a project, GitLab provides a wide set

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.050
of features such as a code repository, issue trackers,

8
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.090
wikis, and CI/CD tooling to support the project.

9
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.050
Let's go ahead and build a new project

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.040
by clicking on the create a project option.

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.010
The first thing that we'll need to do

12
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.080
is provide a name for our project.

13
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.050
I'm simply going to call this project flow.

14
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.070
We can then provide a description of a project.

15
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.050
We'll just say this is a sample project used for the course.

16
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.020
From there, we can specify

17
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.050
a visibility level for the project.

18
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.070
This will determine how exposed

19
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.030
your project is to other users.

20
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.000
In our case, we're going to stick with a private project

21
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.020
that will only be available to users

22
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.000
we grant access, explicitly, to the project.

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.040
When we build out a project, we can also choose

24
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.050
to initialize a README file within the repository.

25
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.010
I'm going to go ahead and check that option

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.040
and then hit create project.

27
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.080
Here we see our project's home.

28
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.050
With the project set up, we can explore some of

29
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.040
those major features that we'll be using within GitLab.

30
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.070
You'll notice the left-hand side bar contains a repository.

31
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.040
This is where our code will be stored for the project.

32
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.030
The interface allows you to look through

33
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.050
the different branches found within the repository

34
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.040
from the main screen,

35
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.010
or you can find the branches on the side bar.

36
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.040
Additionally, you can look at the code

37
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.010
from various different aspects.

38
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.080
You can see the latest commits

39
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.080
that were provided to your project.

40
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.040
You can also take a look at the contributors

41
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.070
and their work being performed on the project.

42
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.020
Another nice feature is the graph which will show you

43
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.030
the commit graph for your project and its repository.

44
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.030
When it comes to workload tracking,

45
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.010
GitLab provides some excellent features.

46
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.070
They're all found within the issues section.

47
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.000
Within this section, we can create new issues

48
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.090
which represent work that needs to be done on our project.

49
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.040
You'll also find a board which represents

50
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.040
a simple kanban board that you can use

51
00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.040
to track the progress of the issues as your team works them.

52
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.000
GitLab also provides some features

53
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.030
for labeling and grouping the issues that we work with.

54
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.060
Labels can be applied to each issue, and that allows them

55
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.070
to progress through the different statuses

56
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.090
that are displayed on your board.

57
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.040
It's a little bit confusing,

58
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.090
but we'll focus on that later in the course.

59
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.080
Issues can also be grouped into a milestone.

60
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.070
So, a milestone may contain several issues

61
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.030
which represent the work required to be completed

62
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.040
to introduce a new large feature into your project.

63
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.020
Another important area within GitLab is

64
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.020
the merge requests section.

65
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.040
This section acts a lot like GitHub's pull requests.

66
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.000
Merge requests allow a contributor

67
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.090
without commit permissions on a repository

68
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.060
to request that a maintainer merge in their submitted code.

69
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.070
GitLab's merge requests feature provides

70
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.010
that ability to review and discuss

71
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.040
the changes being proposed before they are integrated

72
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.000
into major branches for the project.

73
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.080
These are some of the major areas that we'll be focusing on

74
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.000
within GitLab during the course.

75
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.020
In addition to the central repository, issue tracking,

76
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.050
and merge request features, GitLab provides support

77
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.020
for CI/CD integration, a docker container registry,

78
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.020
a wiki, and an area to store code snippets.

79
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.080
We'll get to know many of these features a lot better

80
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.000
when we walk through a workflow.
