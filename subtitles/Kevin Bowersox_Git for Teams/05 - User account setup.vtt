00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] When starting out with GitLab,

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.060
the first thing a team should do is setup user accounts.

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.000
User accounts allow team members to log into the tool

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.070
and are used to control their access and privileges

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.080
on specific projects.

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.070
Within GitLab there's two way to create an account.

7
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.010
First, a team member can register for an account

8
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.060
on their own through the splash page for the tool.

9
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.000
Here you see they have to fill out a simple form.

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So what we're going to do is build a maintainer account.

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.040
The maintainer account is going to represent our team

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.060
member who has commit privileges on every branch

13
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.020
within the repository.

14
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.060
They're going to be the folks performing the merge

15
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.060
request from the contributors.

16
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.020
So we go ahead and set up our maintainer account.

17
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.090
And we need to provide some simple information such as

18
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.070
their email, as well as a password.

19
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.090
I'm going to go ahead and simply use password as their

20
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.030
password to keep things simple.

21
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.040
Once we hit the register button,

22
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.090
you'll see that we are logged in as our maintainer.

23
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.060
It's that simple.

24
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.050
So I'm going to go ahead and log out so we can

25
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.080
demonstrate the next way to create an account within

26
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.060
GitLab.

27
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.080
And that way is as the administrator.

28
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.070
So an administrator can create an account for a new user.

29
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.040
So we're going to log in as root and once we're logged in

30
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.080
we're going to access the administration area for GitLab

31
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.010
by clicking the little wrench at the top of the screen.

32
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.080
If we take a look now at the sidebar,

33
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.060
you're going to see the user's section appear.

34
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.020
We already see the maintainer account that we've created,

35
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.040
and we're going to go ahead and build a new user account,

36
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.030
this time for a contributor.

37
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.040
The contributor account is going to represent those

38
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.060
developers on our team that lack commit access and

39
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.080
need to work through a maintainer in order to have their

40
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.090
feature branches integrated within the major development

41
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.020
branches in our repository.

42
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.070
So we just need once again to provide simple pieces

43
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.050
of information.

44
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.070
The name, the username and the email for contributor.

45
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.030
From there if we'd like we can set up additional access

46
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.090
for this user.

47
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.030
We can make them an administrator if we want them to have

48
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.020
higher lever privileges, however for this user,

49
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.030
they can stay as a regular user or one of developers

50
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.080
on our project.

51
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.050
Once we've completed the form,

52
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.090
all we have to do is click the create user button

53
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.050
at the bottom of the screen and we see that the

54
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.090
new user is established.

55
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.030
Now that we have these two users,

56
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.080
we're going to go ahead and assign them to our

57
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.040
flow project.

58
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.000
So at the top of the screen we click the

59
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.090
projects menu area and then click on your projects,

60
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.040
to access the flow project.

61
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.000
Within the flow project we can scroll down on the sidebar

62
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and under settings we find the member's area.

63
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.050
This allows us to assign different users to the project.

64
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.090
So let's first assign the contributor to the project and

65
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.080
we need to select a permission level for this user

66
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.060
on the project.

67
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.080
We're going to go ahead and make our

68
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.080
contributor a developer.

69
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.000
This will give them push permissions and commit permissions

70
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.020
on branches within the repository that are not protected.

71
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.070
Once we've established their permission level,

72
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.010
we can click on add to project and they're now assigned.

73
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.000
From there, we're going to add the maintainer.

74
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.060
Now the maintainer is going to have the higher level

75
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.060
maintainer permission.

76
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.040
This is going to allow them to perform things such as

77
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.070
pushes on protected branches within the repository.

78
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.020
Once we've selected the permission, we just hit add

79
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.060
to project and we now have these two members of

80
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.090
our project established with their roles.

81
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.050
Okay, so now we have our team set up so we can

82
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.000
continue work on our project.
