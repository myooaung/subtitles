00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.050
- [Instructor] Today, every developer uses Git

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.090
for source control.

3
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.050
It's simple, and it's branching capabilities are unrivaled.

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.090
Plus, it's supported by every tool.

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.090
Hi, I'm Kevin Bowersox.

6
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.080
I've been a full-stack Java developer for over 10 years

7
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.060
and I've learned practical steps

8
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.080
that work for teams with Git.

9
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.080
In this course,

10
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.030
I'll give you the best practices I've learned

11
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.070
and introduce you to workflows and tools

12
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.040
that make it easier for teams

13
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.080
to get past the beginner stage.

14
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.080
We'll walk, step by step, through the GitFlow workflows

15
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.040
so that your team can adopt it as a standard

16
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.010
for moving code from your workstation

17
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.010
to production with minimal friction.

18
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.050
I'll introduce you to GitLab as a repository manager

19
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.090
and show you how to automate

20
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.000
common software development tasks

21
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.010
using a continuous integration

22
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.030
and continuous delivery pipeline.

23
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.030
If your team is just starting to use Git

24
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.090
or if you're looking for a better way to manage code

25
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.000
this course is for you.
