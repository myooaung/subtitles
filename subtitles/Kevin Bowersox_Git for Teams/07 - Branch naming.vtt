00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Another important standard

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
for teams to consider, is branch naming conventions.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.050
Your team will be using branching when working with git,

4
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.010
which raises the question of how your team

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.060
will structure branch names.

6
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.020
Keeping branch names short, consistent

7
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.080
and informative is best.

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.020
Let's take a look at how you can do that.

9
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.050
Here we have some examples of branches.

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.080
Notice how we're using short tokens

11
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.040
within the name of the branch to convey information.

12
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.020
If we look at the first branch name,

13
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.080
we can discern that the branch is related

14
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.040
to a bug, so that depicts the type of change.

15
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.040
We also can see that it applies to change number 123,

16
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.030
and that this change is related to an issue with the menu.

17
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.050
It's amazing how those three short tokens

18
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.000
can convey so much information.

19
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.010
I bet you can take a look at the next branch name

20
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.030
and guess what's happening.

21
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.040
We are adding a new feature that has change number 124,

22
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.090
and it's going to be dealing

23
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.090
with the email portion of the system.

24
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.040
Basically, use short tokens your team can agree to

25
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.030
to describe what type of work is being performed,

26
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.010
then apply the ID from your workload tracking tool,

27
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.050
followed by a short name for what will be delivered.

28
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.050
ideally, a tool will recommend a branch name for you,

29
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.000
but if you are manually creating your branches,

30
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.050
establishing a naming convention will help your team

31
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.000
understand what's included within a branch.
