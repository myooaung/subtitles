00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.040
- [Instructor] In this lesson,

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.010
we'll discuss the concept of workflows,

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.000
which define a strategy for managing the flow of code

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
between branches in your git repositories.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.050
Workflows define a consistent strategy

6
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.070
used by teams to commit, merge, and promote their work

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.020
into a central repository.

8
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.050
They dictate how branches are set up

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.000
and how merges occur to them.

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.050
Teams that adhere to a structured workflow

11
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.030
are able to promote changes from developers' workstations

12
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.060
to the repository and ultimately the production system

13
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.090
in a predictable and less error-prone manner.

14
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.060
Workflows often combine various branching strategies

15
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.070
to provide teams with the flexibility

16
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.040
to deal with situations that may arise.

17
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.040
Things such as hot fixes and new feature requests

18
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.020
become simple with the defined workflow.

19
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.070
By structuring how code is delivered,

20
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.010
workflows benefit teams by providing choke points

21
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.070
that allow them to perform quality assurance

22
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.000
and the ability to protect the integrity

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.030
of critical branches.

24
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.040
In the upcoming lessons, we're going to talk

25
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.000
about two specific types of workflows.
