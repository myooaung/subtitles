00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.060
- [Instructor] There's one final thing we'll need to do

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.060
as the maintainer to complete the GitFlow Workflow.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.000
The maintainer needs to update the develop branch

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.080
with the latest changes.

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.030
Remember that we made a minor QA fix

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.030
to the release candidate branch

7
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.020
that was only merged into the master branch.

8
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.050
That change needs to be pulled into the development branch

9
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.060
so that future feature branches

10
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.020
that are branched off of develop include the fix.

11
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's build out that merge request

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.070
so that we can get develop up to date.

13
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.020
So click on Merge Requests on the side bar

14
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.040
and then I'm going to click

15
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.000
on the New Merge Request button.

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm going to select master as my Source branch,

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.090
and then I'm going to select develop

18
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.010
as the Target branch.

19
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.090
I'll then compare the branches

20
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.040
and the Merge Request form

21
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.040
will provide me with a title for the merge request.

22
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.090
We can see that the Source branch is master,

23
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.070
the Target branch is develop.

24
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.000
It's exactly what we want to do.

25
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.050
We see the Commits that will go into develop.

26
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.090
So let's go ahead and submit that merge request.

27
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.000
Then as the maintainer I can go ahead

28
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.010
and click on the green Merge button to update develop.

29
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.010
And at this point our development branch

30
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.070
is now synced with master.

31
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.030
So master and develop are in alignment

32
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.000
and we can start building feature branches

33
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.040
off of develop and continue the cycle

34
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.050
of the GitFlow Workflow.

35
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.030
So that completes the walkthrough of GitFlow.

36
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.070
We saw how changes can flow

37
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.090
from a developer's work station

38
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.080
all the way to the master branch

39
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.000
where the changes are actually out in the production system.
