00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.060
- [Instructor] This chapter is going to focus on

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.080
the basics of how teams collaborate with Git.

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.080
At this point, you're probably familiar

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.070
with common Git commands but haven't considered

5
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.090
how you will interact with others using the tool.

6
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.000
We'll dive into those considerations,

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.040
highlighting basic strategies or low-hanging fruit

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.070
that can be put in place

9
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.030
to get your team off to a good start.

10
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.050
Let's take a look at what we'll be covering

11
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.050
in this chapter's lessons.

12
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.080
First, we'll start out by discussing some of the situations

13
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.020
that may cause difficulty for your team

14
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.020
and how to avoid them.

15
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.000
Then, we'll look at the flip side of the coin

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.040
by discussing some practices your team can adopt

17
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.010
that will make it easier to use Git.

18
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.060
From there, we'll talk about conventions

19
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.000
or some consistent ways of doing things

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.090
that your team can adopt that will allow you

21
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.020
to structure your interaction within the tool.

22
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.070
Finally, we'll talk about how individual team members

23
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.090
will interact with Git depending on the role.

24
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.050
This will set the stage for upcoming lessons

25
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.060
focused on workflows and branching.

26
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.080
Another thing I should point out is that this chapter

27
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.050
features some hands-on demonstrations

28
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.020
where I will simulate interaction between two team members

29
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.020
by using two different terminal windows.

30
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.060
Keep this in mind as we walk through the demonstrations.

31
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.050
After completing this chapter,

32
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.070
you will be able to put some basic strategies in place

33
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.020
that benefit your team's collaboration with Git.

34
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.020
You will also have a strong foundation

35
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.060
for moving into more advanced usages of Git

36
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.000
and its accompanying tools.
