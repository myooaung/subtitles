00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Instructor] Before we explore Gitlab's features

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.050
we'll need to install the software.

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.000
This lesson will focus on how to perform

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Gitlab installation on the Ubuntu operating system.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.080
Gitlab works best when installed on a Linux distribution

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.040
which is why we are using Ubuntu.

7
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.030
We'll be performing the installation

8
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.020
via an Ubuntu terminal

9
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.040
using the Advanced Package Tool or APT-GET.

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.000
The first thing that we need to do

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.060
is update APT-GET by issuing the command

12
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.090
sudo apt-get update.

13
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.040
This will ensure we have the latest packages

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.080
within the manager.

15
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.050
Next, we'll need to install some other packages

16
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.040
used by Gitlab, specifically Curl, OpenSSH,

17
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.020
and CA Certs.

18
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.090
Once again, we will be using sudo

19
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.090
and then we issue the apt-get command

20
00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:03.000
and then install -y curl openssh-server

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.080
and then finally ca-certificates.

22
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.070
Next, we're going to use curl to download

23
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.030
and run a script that will install Gitlab.

24
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.080
We'll use the dash s and then upper case S flags

25
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
when running the curl command

26
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:51.030
and then we need to specify a URL to the script.

27
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.030
So curl is going to reach out to

28
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.010
packages.gitlab.com and you can see the rest of the URL

29
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.070
there, but at the end you see script.deb.sh

30
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.060
and that's the script we're going to pull down

31
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.020
and then we run that script using bash

32
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.070
as an admin.

33
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.060
And that's going to perform the installation.

34
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.060
I'll make sure the URL is provided

35
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.020
within the course materials,

36
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.020
that way you don't have to worry

37
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.050
about typing this out correctly

38
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.080
from the video.

39
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.080
As you can see, a repository is now set-up.

40
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.090
We need to do some additional installation

41
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.030
in order to install the Gitlab Community edition.

42
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.020
Once again, we're going to be performing

43
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.070
this command as an administrator.

44
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.010
And then we need to specify some options here.

45
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.060
So, we set the external URL,

46
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.020
this is going to be the URL that you use

47
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.010
to access Gitlab.

48
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.020
In our case, we're going to be running this

49
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.030
from the local host on port 80.

50
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.020
So that's what I specify for that option.

51
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.030
Then we're going to use apt-get

52
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.090
and we're going to use the install command

53
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.020
and then we simply specify gitlab-ce

54
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.000
for Community edition.

55
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.020
It may take a little while for the install to complete.

56
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.080
But once it does, we can then open up a browser.

57
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.010
Just as we specified, Gitlab will be available

58
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.000
on local host at port 80.

59
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.080
Here's the initial login screen for Gitlab.

60
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.070
You'll notice that it asks you for a new password.

61
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.000
This password is for the root administrative user.

62
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.080
I'm going to go ahead and specify the password,

63
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.030
simply as password, just to keep things simple.

64
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.050
And then click the change password button

65
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.040
and at this point, we can go ahead and login as

66
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.000
the root user using the new password

67
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.090
that we've set up.

68
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.050
So there you have it.

69
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.000
Now with Gitlab installed

70
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.060
and our access established,

71
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.060
we can explore how its features

72
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.000
will allow your team to make better use of Git.
