00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.090
- [Instructor] Before we begin the course,

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.020
let's talk a little bit

3
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.020
about what you need to know ahead of time

4
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.050
to ensure you get the most out of it.

5
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.070
The course teaches tools and techniques

6
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.060
for teams using Git.

7
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.090
It is not a step-by-step course on Git fundamentals,

8
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.030
so you should be comfortable

9
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.050
with basic Git commands.

10
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.010
The course uses Ubuntu

11
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.010
and we do a lot of work on the command line,

12
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.000
so it's important that you can work in a terminal.

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.050
During demonstrations,

14
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.040
I will edit a lot of files with Vim to save time.

15
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.040
However, you can use a text editor

16
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.040
if it works better for you.

17
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.090
Continuous integration and continuous delivery

18
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.000
are another topic we'll discuss.

19
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.090
Make sure you have a general overview of these areas

20
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.040
and the software development lifecycle.

21
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.070
Also, the course uses some sample

22
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.030
Java projects built with Maven.

23
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.040
It isn't necessary that you understand

24
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.030
these technologies completely,

25
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.080
but you should be able to grasp

26
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.080
the concept of a programming language

27
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.090
and a build tool to get the most out of the course.

28
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.080
If you understand these concepts,

29
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.070
you'll do fine throughout the course,

30
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.080
and I'll be there to guide you each step of the way.

31
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.010
Finally, I want to make sure this course

32
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.040
provides you with valuable skills you can use.

33
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.010
If you work as a developer, a build engineer,

34
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.060
or an administrator for applications,

35
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.080
this course has some really valuable content

36
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080
that you can apply to your work.

37
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.090
If this sounds like a fit for you,

38
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.090
join me in the course to learn ways

39
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.090
teams can better manage, build,

40
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.000
and test code with Git.
