00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.050
- [Instructor] In this chapter,

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.090
we'll take a look at how Git repositories

3
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.010
and GitLab can be used for continuous integration

4
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.050
and continuous delivery or CI/CD.

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.080
CI/CD is an essential tool for teams

6
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.000
that want to develop at a faster pace

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.090
and avoid the hassle of manually integrating

8
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.000
and deploying their code changes.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The contents of this chapter will give you an understanding

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.010
of how CI/CD works with Git and GitLab.

11
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.030
We'll fist review CI/CD tools and discuss some

12
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.090
of the most popular options.

13
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.030
We'll then proceed to configure GitLab

14
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.060
so that we can create a CI/CD pipeline.

15
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.050
We'll walk through the installation of GitLab Runner,

16
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.070
a key component in the CI/CD solution provided by GitLab.

17
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.050
Once we have a basic pipeline established,

18
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.030
we'll expand that pipeline

19
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.080
to include quality assurance checks that are executed

20
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.070
as part of each build.

21
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.020
These quality assurance checks will ensure

22
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.030
that our code meets the team's standards

23
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.010
and provides reports on defects.

24
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.000
After completing this chapter,

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.040
you'll understand how to integrate Git

26
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.090
with a repository manager

27
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.040
that can offer your team a CI/CD solution

28
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.000
to improve your efficiency.
