00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
you can also define gender.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:08.230
Equitable's in Interface is a good example of that would be the aerialist class,

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.750
which is going toe implement an interface called the List.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.660
Let's go into the sore score off their list again.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.320
I'm going to make use off the grip code dot com for this purpose.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.180
We have the source code off their list,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.990
and as you can see,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.650
it's going to implement the list in defense,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.750
which I have it here.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.950
The list interface has defined the type perimeter,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.780
which is a general type,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.850
obviously.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.820
And if you see this gender perimeter is used in some of these methods,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.950
for example,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.730
we have,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.190
ah to every method,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:58.250
and it's going to accept that genic type and is actually returning the general type.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.760
And since their A list implemented,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
this interferes.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.950
It has to provide implementation for this method,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.130
and if you scroll down,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.050
you should see it.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:18.610
Let's or chipped here.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.080
This so it had used the same method,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.050
which is dependent interface and has provided the implementation anyway.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.890
All this would make more sense when we talk about the collections framework,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.960
which we will pretty soon.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.920
But I just wanted to tell you that gender variables were extensively used in inter places.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.890
Hope that makes ends.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.220
See you later
