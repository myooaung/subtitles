00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
welcome to my course on complete Java programming,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.050
a complete set off concept that every Java developer should know.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:17.450
I walked with Top Element is as a Java developer,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.670
but it all means nothing compared to my decayed off experience in teaching Java programming

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.670
.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.750
So I know exactly what you need to learn in Java to get a job in the industry.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.610
I explained each and every concept in a very detailed fashion,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.900
but I know the value off time.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.960
So I kept my videos short,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.350
precise and to the point.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.110
I don't like to waste your precious time,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.350
but at the same time I made sure that our course covers all the required Java concepts that

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.050
you need to know.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.820
In fact,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.380
I keep updating this course with latest up bits of java and you receive those updates free

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.380
,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.350
off cost and forever.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.240
Also,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.260
to make sure that you understand the concepts very well.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.580
I personally created an edited all these videos myself without the help off a graphic

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.270
designer.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.300
Once you complete this course,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.580
you'll be confident in attending Java interviews.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.870
This course will also make you stronger in learning any other job based technology with a

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.450
lot of these as this course will lay a solid foundation for your professional carrier.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.390
Okay,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.570
If you have listened to me so far,

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.580
then there is a great chance that this is a course you're looking for.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.550
And you want to end all for this course.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.310
Rest assured that I will take complete responsibility to teach you the technology in the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.480
way.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.350
You understand?

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.550
Leave that hard part to me.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.110
You just need to sit back and enjoy learning.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.200
All right?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.750
I'm pretty sure that I will see you in my next video.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.150
Until then,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.460
Goodbye.
