X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Let's continue.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.250
Not sure if you have observed or not,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.300
but we've been using classes,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.450
methods and objects already.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.810
What does this outdoor parental and mean?

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.070
How does nothing but an instance off a class and we're just trying to call him matter

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.150
inside the class.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.000
What this matter does is just going to have some instructions that will print the statement

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.850
on the console.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.590
And the main that we've been talking about is nothing.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.200
But I mattered with some arguments.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.260
We're gonna talk about this statement pretty soon,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:44.610
and in here classes and objects is nothing but a class so knowingly or unknowingly,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.950
we've been using all these throughout our examples.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.100
Now,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.600
these variables in here doesn't necessarily have to be inside this matter.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.750
It can also be inside a class within this block.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:07.560
Let's try to do the same thing in our mats class so we can have and X equals 10.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.970
We can haven't.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:22.550
Why equals 20 and you can have a method whether we don't need to have static in here.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.150
Should have fixed it in our previous example.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.030
See,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.870
we don't have any area here.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.750
That means we're good.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.040
I want to do control.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.690
Is safe,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.180
we'll create another method.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.200
Would let's do product product off X and Y.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:56.900
We're just going to simply come people is this plane and do a sort sex multiplied.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:08.490
But what I am let's do old shift and F all shift and F that will invent the court that

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.450
looks better now,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.650
using this object.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.170
You can also invoke this method.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.650
No,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.920
no,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.500
that we don't have any arguments in your We'll talk about syntax off methods pretty soon

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.070
and our next reader maybe,

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.340
but yes,

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.160
this is it.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.690
Let's try to understand a little bit more about classes and objects.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.130
What is this called an object?

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.800
This is somewhat similar to real world objects.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.120
If you're talking about real world objects,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.280
it has two things.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.980
One is the state and the behavior.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.170
Let's think about a dog.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.950
A dog will have a state off height.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.250
It can have a state off breed,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.350
or it can have a state off color coming to its behavior.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.850
A dog can walk,

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.020
or maybe running.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.360
Or maybe sleeping,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.250
etcetera.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.890
Let's take another example.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.550
Let's talk about a car.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.530
A car will have a state off brand name.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.890
A car will have the state off number of seats available coming to its behavior.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.310
Start the car,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.500
stop the car or change the gifts.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.250
Etcetera.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.350
An object in programming world does have a state and their behavior,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.520
but I'm talking about a state.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.330
Those are nothing but the fields that we initialize or declare.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.750
Here,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.290
coming to the objects,

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.090
behavior,

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.650
the matters that we're right here.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.060
Or nothing but an objects behavior.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.890
We can have multiple objects from a single class.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.640
Let me explain you in detail.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.050
Fashion.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.050
Let's go toe white board.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.980
Let's Do you have a land off 10 acres Now?

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.900
What you want to do is you want to construct 100 houses.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.740
All these 100 houses are constructed based on one single design.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.750
This design is nothing but a class,

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:24.060
and all these objects that use this design or nothing but in stances off this class or

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.820
objects.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.220
So,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.420
no,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.250
let's try to form definition off a class in an object.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.210
A class is nothing but a blueprint often object or a template using,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.390
which will manufacture multiple objects,

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.460
whereas an object is an instance off a class.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.960
It will have the state off number of bedrooms available or the color of the house.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.280
It can have a behavior off an tenants.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.930
Remote tenants check mailbox,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.650
etcetera.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.380
Let's go back to a workbench.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.900
Just as in our example,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.630
we created multiple objects.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.420
We can also create multiple objects off math class.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.350
For example,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.250
we can say object one.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.210
So essentially,

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.850
what we did here is we have to objects,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.670
but are identical objects.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.900
Doesn't necessarily have to be identical.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.320
Let me explain you what I mean again,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.070
Let's go back to our whiteboard.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.180
Hold all these houses are based out off one single design.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.690
That doesn't mean all these houses should stay identical.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.070
They can very in terms.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.930
Off color,

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.480
number of bedrooms available,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.130
etcetera.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.020
So when we're trying to create an object,

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.930
will also said its state and will give the values,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.540
like number of bedrooms of elbow or the color of the house,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.150
etcetera.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.250
Going back to our workbench.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.290
Sorry about the frequent switching.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.540
No,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.750
let's get rid off this.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.190
So how do we said the state off?

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.110
An object we used constructors.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.270
Let's talk about it a little bit.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.020
A constructor will have the simmers in tax has to that off methods.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.080
We haven't talked about this in tax off methods and constructors.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.550
We will in our next radio.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.460
But Constructor will have the same name as to that of the class name in which it is

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.010
reciting.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.800
So will simply say,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.160
mets.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.230
And then that's it.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.220
We have a constructor here and insert offsetting these values in here.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.490
We're just going to get rid off all these initialization,

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.750
and instead we're going to send Parametric to this constructor,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:55.740
going to say and and said D comma and be all right,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.850
Let's say X equals D.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.500
Why equals now this year?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.080
Bringing us and ever here.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.340
So what's going on?

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.650
Whenever we create an object,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.150
it will definitely call the constructor first.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.950
If you don't create any constructor by default,

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.410
a default constructor will be considered.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.990
What the default constructor,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.310
a constructor without any perimeters and without any content inside.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.590
It is nothing but a default constructor.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.600
So what is the purpose off it?

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.520
Let's Do you have a class called dog?

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.550
Then let's say you have.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.470
You have a field called height.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.050
If you don't set anything,

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.280
constructor will do that for you.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.780
It will say it will give the initial state off the dog.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.290
It will set the default value.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.690
It will set the value to be zero If it is an integer time now,

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.480
since you gave your own constructor with perimeters,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.490
the default constructive will no longer be considered.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.970
You'll have to write another constructor.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:06.480
What does not have any Param it if you don't write one than at least send some para meters

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.510
in here but object,

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.060
so we'll send 10 and 40.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:18.140
So the moment this statement gets executed will set the state off.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.240
This object has X equals 10 and like was 40.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.600
So not think about it in this way.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.150
Let's say this is the house glass.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:34.750
We can set the number of bedrooms and the color of the house using a constructor,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.590
and throughout our program will use those particular fields.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.260
So what do I mean by that?

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.330
Had this been a class call house,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.630
then you can have an object,

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.850
a house object.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.650
So it's a number of bedrooms.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.000
Three and you can have color has great.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.140
We can have another object object to off house with number of bedrooms has to and color as

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:00.560
green.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.250
Something off that sort.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.270
You can have as many objects you can create or manufacture as many objects as you can.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:14.230
So that's what is a job off a constructor now.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.560
I hope it makes sense he can run the program.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.490
You can play with this program in whatever way you want.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:26.350
You can also say object d'Art product to print the statement.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.930
All right,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.470
see you in my next video.
