00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
in this video,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to talk about the file class.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.690
The file class will allow you to access the underlying file system.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.650
In this particular example,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.450
all I'm trying to do is I'm trying to see if this file is existed.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.670
If not,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.750
I'm creating one and displaying some details about it.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.350
For that,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.190
I have an object off the file class,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.150
and I'm going to pass in the path off the directory as an argument.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.760
Do take in order that this part can never be the path of the directory or the path off any

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.750
specific file.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.820
Let's make sure you know,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.510
desktop.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.650
There is no directory with this name.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:54.040
Now let's run the program So file is created in this case.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.010
It's a directory with the name subdirectory because that's what we gave in here,

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.300
and we have displayed the absolute part off the directory.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.230
Let's go to the stop hair.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:19.150
It is so this method make Dears not only created the directory but also the subdirectory.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.350
In our previous examples,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.880
Whenever we have used input streams,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.350
we're passing an argument.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.690
Although this looks like we're passing a string internally,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.400
the spring will become watered into this file.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.850
Object.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.790
So this line in here is internally like this,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:51.610
the new file object and then the path have just demonstrated a very simple example.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.230
But you can explore more such methods inside the file class.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.470
For example,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.450
if you do new order dot you got a lot of methods to explore.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.260
We have these directory method to check to see if the part given is off a directory or a

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.750
file.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.340
You can actually go through the description in here.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.150
Similarly,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.990
we have the deal.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.570
It matter.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.450
This will allow us to delete the file or the directory.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.550
There are many such methods and I would encourage you to go and explore and play with it.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.900
All right,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.010
see you in my next radio.
