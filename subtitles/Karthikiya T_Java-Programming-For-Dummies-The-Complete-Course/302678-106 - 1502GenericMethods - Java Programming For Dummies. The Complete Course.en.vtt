00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.010
in this video,

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.300
we're gonna talk about generate methods.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.640
First of all,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.290
let me demonstrate you the problem that we have without using the General X in here.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.360
I have defined three areas.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.590
One is in Terry,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.310
gather is wre and lastly,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.550
we have the car array.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:28.050
I also have three methods accepting all these three different types off a raise and they

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.390
all have exact same core inside them.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.060
So all this three minute that's or having exact same name has one last the cord except the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.840
different terms off type off arguments that they're receiving not to more.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.350
If I decide to add another Harry with the different data type,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.450
maybe a string or your own object,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:04.550
then I'm going to copy this matter once again and specify the data type in here or whatever

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:04.550
.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.750
This is clearly a problem.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.080
Why should we create so much off court when doing the exact same thing inside all these

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.700
methods?

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.350
That's where the generate methods will come into picture.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.090
So,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.480
with genic methods,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.170
I can get it off all these methods in here and keep only one,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.150
and I'm going to do something to this matter that will enable this method to receive any

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.720
kind of perimeter that's going to come in as an argument.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.040
So for that,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.550
I'm going to make use off something called a type perimeter.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.650
You need to specify the type parliament right before the ricin statement,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.160
and it's going to recite inside the Wrangler brace.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.750
And in here you can little league you any kind off capital letter.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.890
But to this is called the type Perimeter has a good naming convention.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.060
We developers always use capitals T,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.660
and once you defined the type para meter,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.150
it can literally replace all these persuade types to this gender type.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.110
Now,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.180
this letter T is a general type.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.390
This could be end.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.460
This could be a string.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.160
This could be your own object or whatever.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.600
You know,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.050
whatever we have here,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.480
there's nothing but agenda method,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.760
but generally only works with objects,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.120
not primitive types.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.600
So we're to convert all these prim two types into objects.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.890
How do we do that?

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.010
Any guests,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.550
we're gonna make use off the wrapper classes that were talked about in our previous video.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.850
So this is going to be an integer,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:56.650
and this is going to be double and this is going to be character Harry.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.980
No,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.690
guess what?

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.780
Our program will run smoothly,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.700
of course,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.880
since we have print Ellen every capital print in a new line.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:16.390
And let's also have six out statement in here just to make sure that there is a new land

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.080
character after printing all the elements in the area.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.040
No,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.670
let's see.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.150
This looks a lot cleaner.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.320
Anyway,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.010
The point on to make here is we have shrink all those methods into one single method,

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.370
and that has reduced the lines off court dramatically.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.710
And let's say I'm going to create another area.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:52.120
This is string Gary and let's do that string and I'm going to pass in some string elements

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.010
into this very apple.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.650
Whatever.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.340
Say,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.510
banana,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.310
let's get it off restaurant,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.000
these elements.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.820
But our character elements string Gary,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.210
and you can gladly call this method.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:22.150
But passing this argument,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.150
everything works great.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.650
But do keep in mind that whatever the court that you have inside the gender method,

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.400
make sure it works with any type of argument that is expected to enter inside this method.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.020
For example,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.450
say I'm writing an instruction that is specific to string object.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.550
Let's a string as to your IQ worlds area off.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.190
I'm going to get the first element from that area.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.150
It's going to be string,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:09.200
and I'm trying to convert this into a string object like so Now if we have any kind off an

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.850
argument that cannot be converted into a string object,

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.100
for example,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.350
an integer object.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.180
Both interview and string are incompatible types.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.980
If you look at the plants hierarchy off them and that's going to throw around time

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.350
exception that structure on the program.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.570
There it is class caste exception.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:39.110
So make sure you have the cord that matches with any kind off argument that that is

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.850
expected inside that method.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.190
Let's get it off this statement and said,

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.600
The fire,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.550
you can even return agenda type censored off.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.270
Having Boyd as written type.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:06:00.750
You can just have this gender type T and now we can return the gender type from this method

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.750
,

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.980
destroying an example.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.220
But you can play around with it.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.840
Let's undo those changes.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:18.860
So let me just write to you going to say T o B j equals,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.750
say I'm going to have a string apple.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:32.810
He's a fruit or whatever and I had to make sure that I can work or typecast this into the

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.610
gender time.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.750
Only then will I be able to return their object.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.610
Let's come in this lane and run the program.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.250
All it wouldn't use.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.650
This is art statement says out.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.390
No,

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.490
we should see this string printed ones.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.250
So the pilot on the program Great.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.640
Let's undo all those changes.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.990
I just wanted to show that he can return the gender type.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.010
So that's it.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.420
Don't gender methods.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.560
We'll talk more on gender matter pretty soon,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.580
but a good example.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.230
Also,

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.430
one last thing in the skins.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.750
We just used one type para meter.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.470
We can have more than one,

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.250
and we'll see an example off it pretty soon.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.150
See you in my next radio.
