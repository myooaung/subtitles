00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.550
It's time for our first Java program in this video will write a general program and run it

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.550
.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.810
Let's take a look at the steps that we need to forgo.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.850
Let me open up the note pad Step one,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.550
Right?

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.050
The source scored on a text editor.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.480
Step two said the source.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.780
Score as John a Fire Step three.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:38.450
Compile the source scored and generate object quote or intermediate court.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.550
Step four.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.850
Run the program and display a message.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.450
Step five,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.150
Get a sense off accomplishment.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.090
Okay,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.550
lets go step by step.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.310
Now what I suggest you is don't just sit and watch me do this all along and do exactly what

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.820
I'm doing.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.110
This will help you,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.010
even if you're an experienced Java programmer.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.410
So step number one right,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.290
the source code on it.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.150
Extra later,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.720
Amusing Windows operating system.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.290
So I'm going to be using no pat for this purpose.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.550
If you're using any other operating system,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.480
he could do something similar to Not bad.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:34.750
So let's open up Lo pan and right over sore scored less.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.100
First step hoping enclosing briquettes,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:53.990
public static went leave and within the brackets string hoax.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:03.950
Make sure that you take care off upper case and lower case letters.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.240
For example,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.050
if you type string with low case s,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.150
your program will not work this type exact same court.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.260
You don't have to try to understand this court,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.330
but just write it system,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.360
don't out,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.440
don't print.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.030
And then you give you a message here,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.580
I'm going to be giving a P.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:38.420
It's working now.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.150
All we're doing from this program is we're trying to show a text.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.380
So when we execute this program,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.750
we should say this string,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.350
it beats working.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.730
But before that,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.170
let's go to step number two,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.500
see?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.630
The source scored as job.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.720
Oh,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.040
fine.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.160
Let's do that.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.690
So what we have here is the source code.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.940
No,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.460
to save this file as Java file when it happened dot Java at the end of the final name.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.940
So we go to file,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.750
save us and typing First step,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.310
Don't jump.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.320
Make sure the name of the file is same as the name of the class.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.250
If you want to know why it has to be seen,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.250
maybe the answer would be to advanced at this moment.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.130
But as rule off stump,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.850
always give your class name as finally Let's have it in desktop.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.670
So we got a file created.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.390
Here is a java Fine.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:51.890
Now that's more Step number three compel the source scored and Gender object cord or

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.860
intermediate court.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.630
For this purpose,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.570
we're going to be using a tool called Java Sea,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.810
which is a Java compiler.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.100
This comes with Jaedicke,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.580
So let's open Windows Command processor were hitting Windows Key and the letter R and then

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.480
type in CMD hit,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.430
enter or press.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.960
OK,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.490
No,

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.550
let's now get to the location where Java Sea Tool is reciting.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.720
So we go.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.900
Toe City is a comment used to change the directory City stands for change directory and

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:44.830
then we go to see program pilots Java gente que and then we go toe bin directory hit Enter

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.830
.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.570
Let me show you the tool that I've just talked the boat.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.930
Let's run there,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.350
which shows list off directories and files in the car and a tree.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.150
So we should see jealousy here.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.770
So hated his job.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.800
Macedo Dxy.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.200
Now we're going to be using that tool to compel our source scored,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.980
which isn't death.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:21.240
Stop with typing Java Sea and then absolute part off the Java fire,

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.240
which would be see Users.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.770
Admin desktop for step toward job that's a tender.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.890
This should compile source code and gender Intermediate Court.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.650
Let's very favorite has done that.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.680
We'll see a new file generator.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.170
This is nothing but paint immediate court that JV and can understand.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:51.910
Let's more to step in before run the program and display a message for this purpose.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.180
We're going to be using another tool called Java.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.270
So,

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.510
John,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.320
what is the name of the programming language?

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.360
Java is the name of the technology.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.240
Java is the name of the platform.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.370
Java is also the name off the tool used in Jedi K.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.100
So don't get over confused.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.100
Let's go to come and process.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.560
Luckily,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.650
Java totally reciting the same folder so we don't have to love get to some of the directory

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.650
.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.260
So I type in Java.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:26.940
And then we need to specify the location of the class fire by specifying class part so that

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.560
C P stands for class spot and the location of the class file is desktop.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.310
So let's specify that.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.670
See users admin desktop.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:46.020
No with specify the name of the fire,

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.240
which would be first.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:58.680
You don't have to specify dark class here because the total Java is going toe,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.720
consider only class fights.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.040
No,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.080
If we run this,

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.600
we should see our message.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.070
It worked.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.710
We see the message.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.180
IPI,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.800
it's working.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.240
Let's go to step number five.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.890
Get a sins off accomplishment.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.450
I hope you're feeling so.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.410
No,

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.440
I'm pretty sure that you might be having questions.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.350
Like What is this public?

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.670
What do we need to write so much off court?

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.150
Just to display a simple message?

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:45.250
Isn't there a single command that helps us compare and run together for all such questions

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.250
?

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.490
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.850
welcome to Java world.
