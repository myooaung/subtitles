00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.380
so far whenever we created the Lambda expression were also required to create an interface

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.290
to represent the type of the land expression.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:18.130
Wouldn't it be nice if we don't have to create an interface on our own and use one of the

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.620
pre defined interfaces provided in Java libraries in joy?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.400
It a new package was introduced just to solve the purpose.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.840
We have java dot little dot function package that has set off pre defined functional

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.800
interfaces,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.780
and each one of these interfaces has a method defined with a variety off combinations,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.800
off matter arguments and written types.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.140
Depending on your requirement,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.130
you can use one of these.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.050
It can be better explained with an example.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.790
In this example,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.850
we have three interfaces,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.520
an interest one.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.660
We have a matter that's going to accept one argument,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.420
which is up type string and is going to return string an interface to we have exact same

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.660
method except it doesn't written anything in In Diverse Tree.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.860
We have couple of arguments when it's off type string,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.330
the other is off type integer,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.920
and the matter is going to return string.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.230
We also have their corresponding Lambda expressions,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.980
also by the way this land expression can be shortened is just for your purpose.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.600
Off readability.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.360
I have declared the land expression like Sil,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.220
but otherwise you can get it off the angler brackets in here because it is just one

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.860
statement and we cannot have written type in here when you don't have angler braces because

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.350
no computer can figure out the written type by looking at the interface,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.250
let's run the program.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:03.040
Now let's see if we can make use off one of the pre defined function interfaces for this

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.970
land expression.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.720
We have Interface one,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.050
and that has one method.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.550
If you ignore the name of the interface and the name of the method,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.150
in essence,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.500
we just have a method that's going to accept one argument and is going to return something

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.500
.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.750
Let's see if we have an interface in the function package that does exactly same.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.210
If you go around a little bit,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.080
you'd find something called Function,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.150
which is the name of the interface.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.670
If you read the description it says represents a function that accepts one argument and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.610
produces a result returns a result.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.520
This is exactly what we wanted.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.240
Also,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.980
if you observe they're a couple off type arguments.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.660
Let's see what they're doing in this inter press.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.650
We got D and R.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.050
He is actually the general type,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.700
basically the type of argument that she passing toe This method called Apply and it is

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.930
going to return agenda type are in this case.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.530
So now we can certainly make use off this interface in our example for our first land

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.250
expression.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.000
Let's see how we can do that.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.690
So in here,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.280
instruct saying in the past one.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.940
I'm going to make use off that interface called Function,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.850
which is going to take a couple off general cargo mints,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:42.850
string and string because we wonder Metro argument to be off type string,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.340
and I want the matter to written as drink.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.580
Now that's it.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.380
All you have to do is to import this interface by doing control shift.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.950
Oh,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.180
and of course,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.140
we get a narrow here because set string is something part of our interferes.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.150
Now this needs to be a play.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.160
No,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.690
the program.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.970
Walk smartly just as before.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.450
Let's get it off this inter past.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.640
Now let's see if we can do something to the second Land expression,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:23.340
an interface to We have a method that's going to accept on argument and no written type in

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.950
here.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.200
We have something called a consumer interface.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.220
If you read the description that says represents an operation,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.350
that except a single input argument,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.550
which is the general type T and returns no result.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.200
So let's copy this and best door here.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.750
This is going to be off type string.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.270
Let's do country ship.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.780
Oh,

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.380
that's it.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.770
Now we can get it off this interface.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.930
Similarly,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:04.830
for Inter 1st 3 we have something called by Function D and you are the two arguments that

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.700
the matter will accept or is a written time.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.250
Let's copy this and use it in here.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.070
One argument is off type string,

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.830
the other is off in teacher,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.270
and the return type is string as well.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.460
Of course,

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.350
we need to call the methods do pointing them.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.650
It is going to be,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:40.040
except in this case and in here it's going to be again apply.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.250
That should do the trick.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.850
Everything works fine.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.900
Now we have reduced the lines off court,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.290
but at the cost off something.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.290
The problem with this is the naming.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.330
If you look at this,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.990
that the name Consumer.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.550
It might be confusing a little bit because we're not really doing something like consuming

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.780
the elements or whatsoever Are Intent in here is different.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.500
Only the name is confusing.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.260
Even the matters that you're calling apply except doesn't really make sense in our case.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.150
But why?

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:23.300
I'm explaining you this this pre defined function interfaces will come into picture when we

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.650
talk about stream FBI for that wait for some time.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.470
But that's it on this video.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.000
See you in my next video.
