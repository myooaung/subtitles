00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340
in this video,

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.650
I'm going to show you how we can make use off external libraries in our Eclipse project.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.740
The program that I'm going to demonstrate you is actually going to create an ex associate

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.520
and write some continent.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.250
Now we could use existing Java libraries to do the job.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.890
But then why don't we use the external libraries that are specialized to perform?

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:31.660
Our task about your boy is one such library that will I love you to create an associate and

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.480
literally do anything that you normally do on an extra sheet.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.550
So let's download these libraries you're gonna click on.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.750
You have to go to this website and then click on download and download this ZIP file.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.520
It's going to constitute multiple jar files,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.150
which in turn will have multiple dark last files.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.380
And I've already done that.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.440
I've already don't know that this into my local computer.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.350
Let's see how we can import it in our project.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.990
Let's go there.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.510
So what I have in here is a program that chooses those libraries,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.100
and the reason why you're seeing compel tha mirrors is because we haven't yet imported the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.260
required libraries.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.220
So let's import that We're just going to right click on this Project Properties and then

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.160
choose Jeff a Bill path.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.370
Click on this tab Libraries that's going to show you list off library's being used in this

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.950
project,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.450
and by default we got all these jerry system libraries listed.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.340
But apart from this,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.170
we're going to add some external libraries and their multiple ways you can do so.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:52.400
The way which I chose is by clicking this ad external jars and go to the directory.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.160
Wherever you have downloaded the Zip file,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.650
unzip it and then you get this folder,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.510
click on it and literally choose all the jar files that you find inside this.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.440
Say open.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.230
And then again,

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.130
click had extreme libraries.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.160
We also got some Sharples inside the lib directory.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.150
Let's add all of them.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.320
Let's go back.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.450
Let's make sure we're not missing anything.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.280
If you miss something,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.750
then you're going to see a runtime exception.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.550
So let's apply and then click OK,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.950
you should see these areas going away.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.700
It's expand.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.230
So in here we're just creating the Excel workbook,

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.670
and then we're creating the sheet ex associate and I'm populating this list with some

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.580
entries and for this purpose I have created another class called raw Data does just go and

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.880
do constitute some fields with one constructor.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.690
So with this constructor,

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.190
every time we create an object,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.180
we're going to provide the initial values to these fields.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.360
We got some getters.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.580
We can't have a center for these fields because it's a role final.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.120
This is a file which were using to write the content into.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.850
I'm using this method right to write the content.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.350
Everything else is pretty much self explanatory.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.370
And if you run the program,

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.070
you should see that Excel file in that directory.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.750
Let's go there.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.980
Here we have it and we also got some content in it.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.010
There it is.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.650
It's close it.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:57.010
So I just want to demonstrate you how we can make use of external libraries to do a variety

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.750
of things.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.860
All right,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.950
that's it on this video.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.300
See you soon.
