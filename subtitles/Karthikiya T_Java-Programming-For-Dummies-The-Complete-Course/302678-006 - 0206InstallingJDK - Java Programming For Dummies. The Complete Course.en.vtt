00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.650
it's time to install Jericho on your computer so that we can start writing Java programs

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.270
installing Jellicle.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.550
Same as installing any other software.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.140
What are you waiting for?

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.750
Go ahead and install genetic A.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.820
Okay,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.430
relax.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.370
Let me help you out.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.690
Visit their official website that's www dot oracle dot com.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.180
Click on this menu.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.950
Locate the downloads link.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.940
Click on it.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:46.950
There are quite a lot of software's offered by Oracle,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:56.810
but the one that we're interested in his job from this list we want to download Java Gerica

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.750
for developers.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.780
We don't want to download JR D,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.980
which is a random and Roman and as we discussed before,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.370
if you install Jerrick Aid comes for J.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.590
R.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.860
E.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.140
So let's click on this and then Donald J.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.650
Decay.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.830
I've already done that.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.350
I don't have to do it again.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.440
Once you have this exhibit of ah to stubble,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.850
click it.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.750
You may get a prompt that looks something like this.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.500
His installation directory.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.980
If you'd like to change it,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.950
you can change it.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.070
But I would recommend you to just leave it to the default and click next.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.620
It's going to take a while,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.550
so let me pause the video and then get back.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.570
Okay.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.950
We have successfully installed J decay on our computer.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.450
You can just close now.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:12.290
And if you go to the installation directory,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.680
you should be able to see all these files in our next lecture.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.480
We're going to write off US Java program.
