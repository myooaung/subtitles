00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
in this video we're going talk about instance Off operator.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.410
It does exactly what it says.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.550
It will check to see if an object is an instance off the specified time,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.740
and it will give us that bully and result.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.160
Let me just demonstrate you're what I meant.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.700
Let's say we wanted to validate the statement in here,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.350
so we want to check to see if this object is an instance off animal class.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.100
So what we're going to do is system dark out dot print talent,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.950
and we're going to stay.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:43.310
Is any object Annie or biggie in stents?

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.650
Off animal?

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.800
Of course.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.490
Let's kept it off the statement.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.550
That's from the program.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.050
True.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.150
All right,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.390
let me just positively do and commend out all these lines.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.310
They're really misleading.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.190
Hold it here.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.470
Well,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.510
from the program.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.050
Let's try to do the same for this statement.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.900
Let's do control,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.500
see and control.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:37.060
This will give us a compiled a mirror because Captain Dog or two distinct types just as we

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.760
got a compile time error in here.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:51.770
Let's try to do the same for se this statement.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.470
Let's copy this.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.450
Best it over here.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:08.490
Any object belongs to dark Let's try to see.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.320
It's not Let's try to do type conversion.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:21.700
She had the file and tried to run it again.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.750
Class gassed Exception.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.730
Just as we got with this statement.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.350
No instrument,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.140
any object.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.050
Let's trying to do it with a one.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:43.810
I would expect the result off this statement,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.450
which means our expressive typecasting could be successful.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.950
Let's stretch around the program True.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.250
All right,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.890
hope we got a sense off for what instance are for Operator is and there's going to be

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.190
pretty useful operator in future.
