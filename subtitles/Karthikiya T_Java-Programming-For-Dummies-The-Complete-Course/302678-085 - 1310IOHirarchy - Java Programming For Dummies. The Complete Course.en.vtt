00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
All right,

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.750
let's look at the class hierarchy off the job Bible package.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.680
It's quite a large package with lots off glasses,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:16.510
but we've covered all the major classes that are in here also more than anything,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.810
the point I want you to take away from this chapter is depending on the source and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.550
destination.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.490
You need to choose the stream.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.720
For example.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.350
We've used file input stream when we're dealing with files refused by terror input stream

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.450
to read the data from the area,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.750
and we've used object input stream to deal with objects.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.430
It's impossible to talk about each and every class in the job.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.450
I've a package,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.880
but we've talked majority off them.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.410
And I'm sure by now you're capable of understanding the purpose off rest of the class in

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.750
here.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.950
All you have to do is to click one of these classes in see the description,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.800
and some of this are also having examples.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.550
Associate it.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.120
If you look at this hierarchy,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.260
the ultimate parent off all these classes is the object.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.970
Class control is something that will let you enter values from the console.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.950
This is somewhat similar to the scanner example have seen in our in our example.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.300
We've talked about file and we've talked about some of these classes in the input stream.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:36.310
We've talked about the object streams and we talked about our put stream classes,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.070
for example,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:45.500
by Terry are put stream file output stream Accetta and coming to permissions.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.130
Uh,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.930
basically using these classes,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.460
you can deal with the permissions that took you to the file or the folder.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.040
It's ah,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.810
pretty self explanatory.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.380
If you read the description,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.500
the random access file is something that will.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.060
I love you to read the data somewhere in the middle of the file,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.150
and they talked about readers.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.050
We talked about the writer.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.720
Basically,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.050
readers and writers will deal with the character stream,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.620
whereas when you have input,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.290
stream or output stream,

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.300
all these classes that end with stream well actually deal with the byte stream.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.710
And we're ever off some of these exceptions.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.320
And there are they're all child glasses off trouble.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.070
That's what obvious.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.050
I guess we covered majority off this classes,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.590
but we might be missing some glasses here and there,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.560
which is fine and in fact,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.100
some of these classes will be covered at later chapter,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.870
for example,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.850
talking about the pipe.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.960
Denver Stream is something that you'll understand when we talk about the multi threading

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.230
concept,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.580
which will be our next chapter.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.400
Also,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.150
try to put examples off some of these classes in the project files,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.070
along with the description just for the completeness.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.770
So I guess that's it.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.250
This will summarize this chapter,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.020
and we'll definitely be using streams throughout our course.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.420
And in fact,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.060
when we get into Java two Enterprise Edition,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.800
we definitely have to use streams in order to get our job done.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.100
So until then,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.550
stay tuned.
