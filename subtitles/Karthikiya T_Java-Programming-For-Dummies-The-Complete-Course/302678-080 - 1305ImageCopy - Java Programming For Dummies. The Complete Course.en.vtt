00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370
in this video,

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.590
we're gonna talk about how we can make use off job Bible package to copy an image file.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.920
By the way,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.180
all these classes we've talked about,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.710
we're all part off the package called Java Road.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.100
Ivo,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.950
we're gonna talk about all the classes.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.620
And in fact,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.740
we're gonna go through the hierarchy off classes inside this package.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.910
Pretty soon in this example,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.740
since we're dealing with an image file,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.200
we don't need to use input stream leader,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.170
input stream reader especially meant for textural stream.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.690
So we can simply get rid off this.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.010
Let's hear the pile.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.360
Now.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.560
All I'm doing here is I gave the path off the picture,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.580
which in this case,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.540
is my pick Dodger bag.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.800
Let's go there and take a look at that picture.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.090
So this is my pick Dodge a pack.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.160
Well,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.160
the name is my pick,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.150
but this is not me inside the picture,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.450
just that the picture is mine.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.070
But I'm not the one who is inside it anyway.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.670
Within a corporatism age using the output stream again.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.350
This is file output stream,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.560
and we have the exact chord asked to that off.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.340
The one we have seen in our most example.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.780
Let's run the program and we should see a copy off this image with the name my pick Copied

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.730
are epic hit it is.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.950
Here is a wonderful picture from India.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.660
Let's close the file.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.550
All right.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.400
Now,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.690
what I want you to take every from this example is that using the pile input stream and

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.890
pile output stream,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.080
you not only deal with textual data,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.430
you also deal with pictures,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.330
music,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.220
video files,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.760
etcetera.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.410
Now,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.530
what this also explains is that if you were to develop a software or an application like

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.250
photo shop,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.780
our audacity to edit the audio files,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.370
etcetera.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.110
This is what you're gonna do.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.050
You will make use off the byte stream and you will do something with it.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.820
Hope that makes sense.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.300
See you in my next radio.
