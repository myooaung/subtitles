00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
so far in our examples,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.530
we've used files out,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.910
source and destination and for that purpose were created violent put streams and file

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.900
output streams.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.410
But there are multiple types off source and destinations.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.650
In this example,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.740
we're going to use every as a source and dairy has destination.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.290
And for that purpose,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.750
we're gonna have to create a stream that has something to do with Harry.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.370
In this case,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.250
we have a bi tary and you need to enter some values within the range off bite,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.930
which is minus 1 27 2128.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.840
If you enter something greater than that,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.630
for example,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.670
1 29 it's going to shows an error,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.630
saying the mismatch cannot convert prominent to bite that's undue and were greeted bite,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.970
array,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.010
input stream on deposit this area to the constructor off this class.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.840
So essentially,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.420
what this means is this streaming here is going to read bites off information from this

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.050
source,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.950
which in this case is an array,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.380
and all I'm doing here is just looking to each and every bite,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.040
trying to convert each and every bite off information to character.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.120
And I'm just printing it if you run this program,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:31.080
you would see character presentation off all these bites in this area and just as refused

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.020
file output stream to create an or poor stream for file as a destination,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.590
we can have an airy as a destination,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:47.150
and we can use bite area output stream to create the stream between the program and the

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.980
destination.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.650
In this case,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.340
it's another by Terry and instead off writing it to the council.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.850
I'm just going to write it to this area and all I'm doing,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.300
and rest of the code is I'm actually converting that are put stream to an airy,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.020
and I'm kind of assigning it to this bite.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.220
Every and I'm hoping to reach in there re element off it off this area,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.850
and I'm printing it in the form of character.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.970
Let's run this program Peritus.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.450
Alternatively,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.300
you can use a string,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.300
and you can convert that into Harry off bites by using the method.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.020
Get bites off the string class.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.330
Let's have the file and run the program pretty well and good.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.160
On the contrary,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.860
If you're dealing with the character rally,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.190
then you can use the car for a reader to create a character stream between the program and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.060
the character.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.220
Every and you can do something with it and obviously can have car array writer to write the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.610
data into an area.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.870
Just remember,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.970
when we have the stream at the end of this class names,

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.560
then that means we're dealing with the bites if we have a reader or a writer than that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.440
means we're dealing with the character stream.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.410
Okay,

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.850
pretty well.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.270
In Good.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.620
Let's run this program.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.910
There it is.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.660
See you in my next radio.
