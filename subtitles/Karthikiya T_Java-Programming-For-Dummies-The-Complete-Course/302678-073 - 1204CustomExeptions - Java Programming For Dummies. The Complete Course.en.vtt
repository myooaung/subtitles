00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250
in this video.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.030
Let's try to understand custom exceptions.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:10.690
Let's say there is a requirement wherein if the age of the user is less than 18 then you're

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.950
gonna have to throw an exception with some message.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.750
Let's see how it's done.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.780
You just need to simply create a class.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:29.850
Let's call this custom exception whatever the name that you want to give.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.090
And in here,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.250
if you want to make this exception,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.450
had checked exception,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.250
then you want to use.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.250
Then you want to extend exception.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.210
If you want to make your class and unchecked exception,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.300
then you want to use the keyword extends runtime exception.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.850
Remember the runtime exception in the hierarchy?

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.150
Let's go back.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.570
So here it is,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.950
your clearing a new class in here somewhere in here,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.280
and this will be an inject exception.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:23.160
Now all you have to do is create a constructor of this class but string as an argument

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.460
since you wanted to show a message along with the exception and this is a very important

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.240
instruction.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.490
You gonna use the keyboard super to call the super class constructor,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.020
which in this case is runtime exception and you're going to send the same Parametric.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.710
Of course,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.270
this has to be small.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.850
Hess.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.680
No guess what?

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.980
You have just created a custom exception.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.410
Let's try to use it so the age of user is less than 18.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:02:03.170
Then you want to create and new object off your custom exception with some message you are

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.220
under age.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:14.710
You're not allowed to What allowed to help apply for driving?

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.430
Why?

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.710
Since that,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.010
said the file,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.760
let's to control Shift F to give a proper indentation.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.160
And since in here ages 100 we're going to be safe.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.150
What's made this?

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.790
15.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.410
Let's run the program.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.050
No.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.530
Can you guess where we went wrong?

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.200
I'll give you 30 seconds.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.750
Why didn't we have an exception in here?

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.490
That's because wouldn't throw the exception when we had another point?

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.350
Exception are any other exception that JBM took care off throwing the exception,

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.150
but in this case,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.910
it's we.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.850
Since we created exception,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.610
it's our responsibility to throw the exception.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.630
So we're going to use a keyword called through No,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:19.170
let's run the program and I would expect these two instructions should not be Exhibitor

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.710
Hitiris and we also see the message You're underage,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.980
blah,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.140
blah,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.450
blah,

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.430
and we also see the call stack and in kids.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.450
If you want this exception to be a checked exception,

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.710
then you want this class to extend the exception class.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.560
Now,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.290
if you don't want any kind of handler,

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.680
you're forced to provide some kind of handling.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.070
Let's do,

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.300
try,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.690
catch and run the program.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.050
All the subsequent instructions should work now pretty well and good.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:10.380
Now you might get confused between the keywords throws and throw if you open up our example

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.380
.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.550
Our previous example.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.540
Maybe not this in here.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.630
I'm telling the jbm that somebody else is going to handle the exception.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.450
I'm not going to do that.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.020
But whereas in here throw is completely different,

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.830
you're throwing the exception.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.280
I think it's pretty understandable if you're interested.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.610
You can also throw the older existing exceptions.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.250
For example,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:46.780
you can just throw no point or exception on your own in the scarce JV and won't take care

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.940
off.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.590
It hope that makes sense.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.990
That's to control Z.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:58.380
One last thing,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.710
which I wanted to point out,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:08.610
is in our hierarchy we have something called trouble class only if an exception is subclass

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.010
off a trouble class.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:17.200
Will you ever be able to throw that exception and use the keyword truss.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.870
It's as simple as that.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.850
If there is an exception that can be thrown using a true keyword,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.170
then it has to be a child class off trouble.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.650
Hope that makes sense.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.360
See you in my next video.
