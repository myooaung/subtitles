00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
in this video,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.750
I'm going to talk about demon threat.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:11.490
You can think off Demon tread as a thread that runs in the background and it's made a job

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.070
is to support all non demon trends.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.760
So what is a non demon tread?

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.070
Whatever the tracks we have created so far manually are all known demon trends.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.580
A good example.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.830
Off a demon tread would be garbage collector thread that is initiated by the Java virtual

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.370
machine.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.100
The job off garbage collector is primarily to destroy the unused objects and freeze of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.650
memory for future objects.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.530
And there is no need of garbage collector once all the non demon threats are executed,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.290
including the main threat so jbm Before it shuts down,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.230
it will forcefully kill all the demon threats no matter what they're doing.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.510
At that point of time,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.510
you can create a demon tread on your own,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.630
But keep in mind the things that I've just mentioned and one rial time example very would

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.740
want to demon tread is when,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.150
say,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.250
you're developing at backup software,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.710
where it will copy all the files in your system to a remote several that you can figure in

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.760
that case you might want a demon thread running behind the scenes that will constantly pull

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.780
the remotes over to check to see it's health.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.450
I mean,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.490
if the remote server is disconnected or maybe ran out of space,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.920
then you would want to notify the user with a message on his screen.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.800
Another good example would be said,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.280
You're developing a game.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.850
Were people from across the globe the play together as a team like counter strike.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.700
Then,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.640
in that case,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.000
you might want to demonstrate that constantly show the position off all the players in a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.550
map to each one off the player.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.000
So basically,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.270
a demon trade is like a supporting thread,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.350
and the life off demon trade is dependent on the light.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.370
Both non demonstrates,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.350
so they basically live at the mercy off non demonstrates.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.740
Let me just prove that point with an example.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.800
So I'm going to create couple off threads.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.060
I copied the same court from our prayers.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.910
Examples.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.650
Let's call this t two.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.980
And in here.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.250
What I'm going to do is I'm going to have an infinite loop,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.260
for example,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.850
I'm going to use I'm going to say for if I do this,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:56.670
that is going to look me through forever and I'm going to do since out from demon.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:07.310
And I also want to wait for a second dread dot sleep 1000 milliseconds,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.470
which is equal in tow.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.150
One second.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.140
I'm going to have a try.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.150
Catch block.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.740
Let's get it off all this unnecessary junk for the time being.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.690
And in our second thread,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:32.800
I'm going to wait for 10 seconds from t two.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.550
Let's hear the pile.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.830
So basically what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to simulate the behavior where we're

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.750
constantly pulling the remote server and doing something with it.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.890
Say we're checking the health off it.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.240
And for that,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:56.670
we want the polling to happen forever and assume that we're doing something meaningful in

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.150
here.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.830
Maybe if this was a backup software,

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.880
then you might want to do copying the files of whatever.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.160
If you observe the purpose off track,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:14.490
T one is to serve tea to There is no real meaning off this running when the 22 finishes

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.140
executing,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:23.140
so we run the threat t want to be a demon threat before we take a look at how we can make

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.330
this thread a demon trade.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.430
Let's try to run these two threads simultaneously and see what's going to happen.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.360
Do you want not start Tito Dark Start?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.450
It's hard to find.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.550
So in this case,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.250
regardless off Tito finished executing or not,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.000
this thread keeps pulling.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.490
Let's on this program.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:59.430
So now both the threat got started and threat to his waiting for 10 seconds and is done.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.750
But still how 21 is going and it goes forever.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.990
We don't want that.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.470
We want to stop at the moment.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.350
Threat to is finished executing.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.140
So how do we make this thread a demon threat?

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.790
It's very easy.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.580
You just have to use one method in the threat class,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.320
which is t one just do one dot said Damon.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.210
And you say it asked.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.210
True by default,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.150
it is false.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.310
The reason is threat.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.110
The one inherited all the properties from its parent,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.900
since the parent thread,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.050
which is the Threat class,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.090
is a non demon object.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.150
By default,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.880
the child will inherit the same.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.270
If it wonder straight to be a demon dread,

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.260
then you need to set it this manner.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:02.570
Now let's expect this tread to exit when the threat t two finishes exhibiting that's on the

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.060
program.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:14.660
34 by 6789 10 Terrorists were done.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.150
Jbm has killed the strayed t one.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.430
Also,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.230
make sure that you said the straight as demon before you start the threat.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.750
If you do the other way,

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.640
then it's going to throw an exception.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.590
Illegal state exception.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.610
Let's get it off this.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.700
Stop the program.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.060
Also,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.150
it's important to note that you don't want to perform any crucial operations in the demon

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.170
threat because if you have a finally block in the demon trade,

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.280
it will not get executed.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.190
So don't deal with streams in a demon thread unless you make sure that it's finally block

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.990
will be executed before all the non demon tried finish executing.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.100
So that's it on demonstrates,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.550
say you in my next radio
