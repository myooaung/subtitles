00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.270
in this video,

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.980
we're gonna talk about thread group Thread Group allows you to group bunch off related

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.880
trips together so that you can perform operations like interrupt,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.900
suspend,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.580
destroy Exeter with just a single method.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.950
Call off this thread group object,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.300
and here have created an object off third group and I have given it to name bypassing

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.980
string as an argument to this constructor.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.840
And as a first argument to the thread constructor,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.630
I'm going to pass this group object that will make this thread even to be part of this

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.150
group.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.670
Similarly,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.150
I have three threats added to that group in t one.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.390
I'm going to wait for six seconds before Apprentice Message and t two added the same with

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:04.540
nine seconds and 23 20 seconds has started all the threads and in maintain I'm just trying

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.990
to sleep for 10 seconds and by this time,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.050
after mentored waits for 10 seconds,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.920
I'm assuming that T one and T two should be finished.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.250
But 23 must be still be sleeping.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.620
So this statement which will get the active count,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.790
is going to return me the value one because only one thread is Acto at that time and using

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.090
the trade group object,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.710
I'm going to call the matter list.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.250
That's just going to show the details off all the threats in the group.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:02:01.320
Let's run the program after six seconds attractive and punished enough to nine seconds

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.580
strati to finished.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.390
We got one to trade at this point of time,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.700
and we've also listed out all the details.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.770
And finally we have our thread tea tree finished executing after sleeping for 20 seconds.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.250
Likewise,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.790
we have got many such methods inside.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.100
Threat Group can always explore them when you get a chance,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.240
so we can you can destroy,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.350
interrupt.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.210
We can also make yourself wait,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.220
notify and notify.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.870
All suspend and resume can stop the tread.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.010
You can go through the description on the right,

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.900
and I believe all these methods are pretty much self explanatory by now,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.650
and that's it.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.980
You can explore more on your own
