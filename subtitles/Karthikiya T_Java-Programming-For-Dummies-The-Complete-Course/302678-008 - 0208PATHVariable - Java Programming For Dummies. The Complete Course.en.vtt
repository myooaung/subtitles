00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
now every time you want to compile and on the program,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.640
you need to navigate to this bin directory in order to access these tools,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.420
jealousy and java toe.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.220
He's our job.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.050
A little bit.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.940
Windows operating system lets us configure part variable Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.010
You're right.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.990
Click on computer,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.550
click on Properties and then you go to an advanced system.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:35.880
Settings click on enrollment variables and then we're going to be specifying and new.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.650
He was a variable,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.590
which would be abrupt in capital letters and then the value off.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.160
It is the directory where the Java Sea and Java tools or reciting.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.570
So that would be.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.810
See program files Java,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:14.400
Jerry K 1.8 daughter underscore 51 slash But end with the cynical and then click OK,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.030
leak.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.550
Okay,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.750
click OK,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.090
and then you can close this window.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.500
Now let's try to run this program.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.590
This works.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.560
Obviously we're in bin directory now.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.550
Let's try to run the same program outside the BIN directory,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:46.850
so let's open up new common process window nor type Java.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:56.650
Have fun CP for class spot See users Admin desktop,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:06.430
then first who were seen this message this would not have roped with also in the path

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.940
variable.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.930
So when we specify the World,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.550
Java or jealousy operating system tries to search the stool in the current directory,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.770
which in this case would be admin if it is not there,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.380
then it will defer to the path variable that we have just set.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.660
And whatever the part that forgiven path variable,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.330
it will go and look into that particular directory and hence regard the stool working even

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.060
the wherever from the BIN directory.
