00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
in this video,

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.680
I'm going to talk about Shutdown Hook.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.500
There could be instances where you might want to execute set of instructions.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.950
When the program exits abruptly.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.630
For example,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.670
you press control.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.920
See when you're running the program from the common problem or when the interpreter comes

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.160
across with system nor exit statement.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.370
In this two cases,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.860
the program will stop abruptly and jbm Sharp Stone.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.350
In both these cases,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.610
the finalist block will not get executed.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:38.320
But we can make use off the shutdown hook to execute set of instructions before the JBM

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.050
shuts down.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.160
Let's see how we can do that.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.190
I'm going to make use off the same court from our job.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.160
I would chapter,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.800
which will read the file and write the data into another file using streams,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.630
and I passed it in here.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.650
It's exact same good.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.850
Now let's say for some reason I want exit off this program right here.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.590
I'm going to use system.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.550
Don't exit with the state of Zito.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:20.970
The perimeter zero means that we're exiting out of this program without any major issues

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.450
anywhere.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.250
The point that I want to make here is if I run this program,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.110
but Let's have some statement written in here.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:41.450
Let's have says out and finally block.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:51.160
This is just to make sure that the finally block will not get in walked in case all systems

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.750
or exit.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.650
Let's also have one to sort statement in here right before the exit statement.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.460
Let's run the program.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.990
There it is.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.900
No,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.050
let's use shutdown Hook.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.210
So right here or somewhere in here,

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:26.090
I'm going to have the statement runtime dot get run Time Dog had shut down hook,

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.630
and the perimeter that it takes is the thread object so we can copy the court from here.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.600
That's copies entire new object off thread and passed it over here.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.140
And that should do the trick.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.540
Essentially,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.150
with this,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.300
we're telling the job virtual machine that before it shuts down.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.900
That means when system dot exit happens or when they use the process control,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.350
see from the command line.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:06.450
Then we're asking jbm to start this thread Whatever we have in here and run it,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:17.410
let's a from shut down,

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.850
hooked save the file and now run it.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.680
Fair enough.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.880
The Chardon hook will also get executed when the program run smoothly.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.820
For example,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.350
I get it off this statement system not exit.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.210
And around this program still,

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.150
you would see they shut down her getting executed along with the finally block.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.530
You can have as many shutdown hooks as you want,

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.350
but the sequence in which these shutdown hooks will get executed is not within our control

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.350
.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.120
If you want,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.250
you can also remove the shutdown hook.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.360
For example,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.470
let's competence and make this part off threat object and assigned this to a thread

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.050
reprints type.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:24.760
And I'm going to pass this argument and se ri musha don't look,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.740
and this will do the trick.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.400
Obviously,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.170
you don't want to remove shutdown hope without adding it and obviously don't want to do

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.950
them immediately.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.340
There has to be some valid reason why you want to remove shirt.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.090
Don't hook.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.680
Maybe you can put the statement right after you're done with copying the file.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.440
Maybe somewhere in here,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.500
so that the court inside the shutdown who could not get executed after successfully running

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.120
the program that stretch you on the program and there it is.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.780
We don't have this code executed way have removed ID.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.360
All right,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.080
hope that makes ends.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.650
Say you in my next video
