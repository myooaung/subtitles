00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.450
OK in this video,

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.200
we're gonna talk about access,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.730
restriction or access.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.520
Specify arson.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:05.950
Java.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.160
Let's assume you have a robot.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.410
Now.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.080
I have to admit that this is not the best diagram but is the best I can do.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.900
The robot looks more like a draw,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.050
but which is yelling,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.250
But I suggest you to ignore the quality of this diagram and stay focused on the topic.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.960
So let's assume that you own this robot and it's just robot.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.450
Without any intelligence in it,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.250
you'll have to write your own source scored so that the robot will perform a certain task.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.650
Let's say you wanted Robot to perform the task off getting the Pisa from the nearest store

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.650
.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.250
Of course,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.850
it's beyond the current technology.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.680
We don't have our artificial intelligence technology developed to an extent where a robot

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.050
will physically move to a physical store and get your visa.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.690
But let's assume so for the sake of example.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.120
But at the same time,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.350
you don't have knowledge on programming.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.050
You do have knowledge,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.500
but it's very limited.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.410
You can only give the basic instructions to the robots,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.030
but he cannot write the entire program to perform your tasks So what you gonna do is you're

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.110
gonna put chairs the code from outside from a different company and you're gonna use that

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.450
court.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.050
Let's say I'm the guy who is providing you that code where it will have lots of past.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.150
Basically,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.140
it's just a class file called Robot,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.060
and it will have lots off methods like walk or run,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.750
get Pisa,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:01.850
ignore the handwriting and lot of other tests.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.820
Each one of these methods will perform a certain task.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.370
For example,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.250
the Method walk will have instructions that will instruct the Robert to walk.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.780
Same as with the run.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.050
Same as we get pizza.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.920
No,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.750
you put chairs the court from me,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.850
and then you create an object off this class,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.160
and then you will try to use all these methods.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.870
Now,

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.500
do taken note that I'm not going to give you the source scored.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.270
What I would do is I will compel my class and I'll give you the class file so you don't

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.350
have visibility on the source court.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.390
You can only use my code,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.480
but you cannot edit it.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.910
The new robot class you're gonna create probably ecstatic word mean the main method and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.850
then inside that you're going to make use off all the methods,

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.020
whichever is required.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.690
So in order to perform your task off getting pizza from the nearest store,

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:10.670
you're gonna use the method called Walk and you're gonna use the method called Maybe get

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.490
into the car.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.750
Okay,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.300
let me list down here,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.250
walk,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:26.850
get in to the car and start the car.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.250
Except that these their own methods which are deciding on my class.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.200
Similarly,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.890
you keep instructing the robot to perform the task of getting the Pisa.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.150
Now there's a problem here.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.550
You could go wrong with the sequence.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.050
For example,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.450
if you put walk in the end,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.250
then the robot will not even approach the car.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.390
And so it cannot get the Pisa.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.850
So there's a possibility off messing things up.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:07.310
So what I do to solve you that problem I'm not going to expose all the methods which are

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.850
which are not really required.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.650
For example,

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.680
walk,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.120
run,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.150
get into the car.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.000
These are all methods.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.880
I don't want anybody to access what I want.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:26.560
People to access people like you to access is the method like get Pisa and all these

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.150
methods.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.350
I'm just going to use them internally.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.210
If I don't want you to use these methods,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.170
then I'm just going to mark them as private so that your source code does not have any

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.750
visibility off this methods.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.830
And for the methods like get pizza,

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.390
I'm going to make them public.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.850
That means this this method is available for you to use.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.640
This is not any security measure.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.450
This is for the convenience.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.070
This is to provide you the convenience so that you don't mess up with the lodge.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.460
So now by doing this,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.040
you don't you don't write this because you cannot.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.630
For example,

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.790
you cannot access the work.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.550
Matador.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.890
Get into the car,

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.460
etcetera.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.770
Holy condo's is to access the public methods which in this case,

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.480
get pizza.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:29.090
So that way I'm sure that whoever is using purchasing and using my cord will not mess up

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.150
with the logic.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.950
I hope I made myself clear.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:40.650
So now the question arises which matter to Marcus Public and which mattered to mark as

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:47.490
private for all the methods which has the scope off changing over a period of time.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.150
You want to make that method private,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.250
for example,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.910
let's say we have this method get get inside the car.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.730
My current logic is a loving the robot to get inside any car that it sees.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:09.280
This is clearly inappropriate because we don't want a robot to get inside somebody else.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.170
Can't they want Robert to get inside our own car?

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:19.260
So now I have decided to make changes to this matter by adding additional arguments to this

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.720
method,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.850
like which card to get in the number of the car and the location of the car.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.070
The user will send the perimeters,

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.240
but we have a problem.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.400
If I make this mattered as public,

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:39.150
then you will have an error because you're using this matter without sending the arguments

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.150
.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.370
But no,

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.800
you'll have to send para meters.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.450
So because off my change in the code,

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.670
you will end up having an error in your court.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.550
And there are hundreds off people who are using my court like you are,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.030
and that's going to cause a lot off problem.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.450
And in fact it's going to destroy my reputation as a company,

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:11.190
so I will not make this method as public art make it as private so that I'm pretty bolivar

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.320
that nobody can can access this method.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.290
So I'm free to make changes,

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.250
the arguments or with the logic and whichever method is public,

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.810
you should not make any changes to the signature of the method.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.050
Are the logic inside You can make changes off the logic inside that matter public method

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:37.940
but no drastic changes because we know that these methods are being used by hundreds of

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.950
people out there.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.400
Hope that makes sense.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:50.680
So basically to to get the definition off and access busy fire or access restriction the

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.890
key words like private,

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:58.840
public and there a couple of other keywords are actually used to restrict the visibility

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.900
off member variables,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.460
member functions or methods and even constructors.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.270
We'll talk about access restriction on constructors.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.450
You know,

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.260
next radio in this reader,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:17.840
let's take a look at two examples off access specified IRS in our job,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.450
a court.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.950
Let's go to our workbench.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.320
But before that,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.100
let me just mentioned that we have four different types off access but swears public,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.750
private,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:41.820
protected and default Default in itself is not an access basic fire.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:47.110
It's not an official access better where when you don't specify any off these two,

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.160
a method field or constructor,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.850
then by default,

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.350
default access bus fare will be consider.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.050
So we'll see what all these in our examples.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.900
Let's go to our workbench.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.450
I'm in the workbench.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.450
It's expand this project.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:15.950
We have a class called packages from our previous example and the class some name.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.710
Now,

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:18.900
if I make this okay,

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:24.850
the method in here it current existing method is marked as public.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.050
If a method or field or a constructor is marked as public,

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:36.490
that means that mattered is accessible within this package as well,

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.380
less in other packages.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:46.550
If it don't specify any access basic fire,

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.480
then that means it's Ah,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:55.700
it's a default access pacifier and the default access pass for means the matter is

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.540
accessible.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.530
Only Britain that package now.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.080
We got a letter here for obvious reasons,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:09.780
because this method belongs to a different package and the access pass for is default,

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.080
and we've gotten better that it can or axes the method.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.050
So way to make this public.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:23.850
Let's try to create another class inside the same package.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.880
Let's copy the file and passed it.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.350
Let's do re factor copy.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.980
Do it some name one whatever.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:45.990
Inside this what I would like to do is try to create an object basically the same steps.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.250
What we have followed here it's Copy that.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:52.400
And best it over here.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:59.280
Let's have the file.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.290
Alright?

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:02.860
Actually,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.930
we're gonna need the public static word main because this has to be inside.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:14.750
I met the let's copy down as go copy and past it.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:22.060
We didn't have any heroin here.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:28.650
That's because this is a default access perspire and is accessible within the package.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.050
Let's make it private.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:36.570
The private meaning this matter is accessible only Britain.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.050
This particular class.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:43.480
So we get a natural here,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.450
very obvious.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.350
It's so we were understood.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.510
What is private,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:56.580
public and default access Piss fire protected is something that we will cover at later

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.350
point of time.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:03.440
Once we understand the concept off inheritance for now,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.040
this will do.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.070
But now let's just take a look at OK,

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:12.850
let's put the default one or the public one public access space for said the pile.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:19.150
Now let's take a look at the access restriction for member fields or variables,

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.280
same as methods.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.690
If I make this as private,

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.570
you saved the file.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:35.650
Nobody outside this class will be able to access this particular variable.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.680
Let me prove it right over.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.650
So object dot We just got the variable way.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:50.150
But X is missing because we have it marked as private.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.780
And if you don't specify anything,

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.380
that's default,

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.550
so it shouldn't be accessible outside the package.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:04.550
So that's straight access.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:12.280
So none of those two wearables are accessible.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.950
If we make this public,

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.740
it saved the fine.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:25.570
And now we should get the very blacks in the suggestion.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.950
That means it is accessible.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:33.150
That's some Let's undo those changes,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.790
said the file.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.520
Let's get rid off this,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.450
said the file.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:47.150
And that's it.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:53.070
Now we've understood the usage off access pacifiers for methods.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:58.950
Now let's try to understand the real advantage off access pass wires on the variables.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:05.040
They're too good reasons why you want to use access pacifiers on variables one.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.550
If you want to restrict the users off your class,

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:12.960
do not updated the value that the variable is holding.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.600
At the same time,

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.810
you want them to read the value.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.310
Let me show you what I mean.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.490
Let me save your time,

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.450
but right in the court and I'll get back.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:33.980
But maybe I would show you something go to source and then click on insert chord,

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.050
click on getters and centers.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:43.280
Choose this two way tables in here and click Generate.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.280
So basically,

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.830
these methods are to do perform to perform,

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.950
read and write operations on these variables.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:58.480
Get X meaning were just returning the value off X and set X meaning.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.950
We're writing something to this variable.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.950
So from outside this class,

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:07.800
we may not be able to write or update the value directly,

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.910
but we can update the value using this set method.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.450
Set X matter because this is public and this is private.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:21.450
Save the file control s.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:27.150
Now let's say we don't want any right operations toe happen,

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:35.440
So we just We're just going to simply get rid off all these set matters in here and said

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.220
the final Now guess what?

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.040
You can only read these values using these methods,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.150
but you cannot do any updates on these very belts.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.940
If you want to see an example object dark.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.720
Those variables are not directly accessible.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:59.290
But you can no the value from these get X and get my methods.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.930
All right,

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.850
so that is one advantage.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:11.190
The other advantage is Let's do control Z.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.710
We have the Centex method here.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:21.390
And let's say you only want to store value with cheese off multiples off 10.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:26.450
So we cannot just let any value to be stored in here.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.700
For example,

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.060
if user interest in,

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:34.780
then we're going to straight away store the value off X to 10.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.570
If it is 100 since its multiples off 10 we're gonna store it.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.870
If it is,

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.350
say,

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.270
97 then we're gonna obeyed the value,

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.470
maybe a default value to 10.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.810
If this is a dog class,

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.800
then if the variable X is is to mention the height off a dog,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.340
then use a con,

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:04.270
just enter 10 feet or 100 feet because that would never be the height off a dog if the user

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:12.210
enters and inappropriate value will store the default value so we can have the logic in

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:12.660
here.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:29.050
If x 10 Eyck wants,

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:37.120
do the reminder off X When we divided by 10 0 then yes,

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:44.810
we want us toward the value else This don't x gonna give some default value,

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.280
which would be,

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:46.580
say,

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:46.960
10.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.980
Let's hear the fine or better it.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:59.340
Let's make it zero no from altered the class I want to do.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:17:59.590
Right.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:08.760
Operation object d'Art said X 200 system.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.630
Don out.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:15.450
Don't print Owen onto dart.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:22.080
Get the value of X your land.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.630
Do it.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.100
Let's save the file and try to run the program.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:34.130
Great.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.950
We got we got 1500.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.650
Not sure.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.330
Where is this?

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.550
50 is coming from.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.600
All right.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.150
I guess we are printing.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:48.830
Get somewhere in here.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.420
OK,

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.330
We got method,

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.890
I guess.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:51.140
Well,

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:51.460
yes,

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.660
we're calling it or here.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:53.700
All right,

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.570
well,

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.990
let that be there.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:57.250
Now,

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.700
let's try to do a value off 99 for 97.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.450
That is not divisible by 10.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:08.160
And this should you waas zero.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.380
There you go.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.050
Settle.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.290
So it's sort of reading us.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:19.580
Restrict our letting us feed the right value into the fields.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.590
Now,

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.860
I want a point or something in our whiteboard diagram.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.000
Let's go there.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.810
Now This brings me to talk about one of the greatest one of the greatest features off

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.150
object oriented programming.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.450
Language is encapsulation.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:43.830
Encapsulation means hiding in the details and exposing only the essential details is called

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:49.110
encapsulation to give you at real time.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:53.300
Example taken example off a car as a car user.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.100
You don't need to know how the engine works,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.240
etcetera.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.980
You just need to know how to use the break,

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.060
how to control the steering,

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.640
how to change the gears,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.450
etcetera.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.290
All the details,

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:13.840
like engine and all the technical details will be hidden from you so that sort off like the

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:19.130
manufacturer hides all those Internet videos and will expose only the details that are

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.890
required for you to perform your task.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.310
And that's exactly what we're doing here.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:32.340
By marking a lot off methods as private were hiding them were hiding them from the users.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.350
And we're only exposing the essential details,

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:41.350
the public methods and that's called encapsulation in job.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:48.450
We'll talk about more object or entered features as we come across with those examples.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:53.760
So pretty soon you will be an expert in Java.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.450
Trust me.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:59.660
In our next we're gonna talk about access restriction for constructors
