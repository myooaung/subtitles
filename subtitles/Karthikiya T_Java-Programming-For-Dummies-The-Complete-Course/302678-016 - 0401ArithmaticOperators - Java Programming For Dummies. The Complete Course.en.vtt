00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
this chapter will talk about operators.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:09.700
An operator is a special character that does some operation on operations.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.700
For example,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.580
if we have a plus B,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.410
then plus is an operator that does some operation on operate ends in job.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.950
We have different pipes off operators.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.230
Let's take a look at them in this lesson will talk about her,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.690
the magic operators,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.120
marginalise operator and assignment operator.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.570
But before that,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.350
we need to import the project.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.650
I have already bundled the project files as part off this chapter.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.850
You can just download it and import the project,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.430
and this is how we need to do so.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.080
Go to file your import project,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.750
click on from Zip,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:07.970
click on Browse and select the ZIP file that I have bundled named operators.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.250
Click on open click on Import.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.620
All Right Now,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.170
the project got imported.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.500
Let's expand the project.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.900
No need to worry about these packages and all.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.140
Um,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.650
we'll definitely be exploring all these concepts in our future videos,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.780
so expand the source packages.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.180
This will contain the Java source files,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.500
expand it,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.250
expand operators and then double click on or the Matic operators.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:55.670
This will open up the file No to talk about all these buttons and all these panels.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.150
We need to wait for a court to grow a little bit.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.300
So again,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.090
I'm saying it too often.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.530
But believe me,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.520
we're going to cover each and every topic in detail.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.770
Just trust me and follow me.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.970
Double click the tab to expand it.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.320
Heard the magic operators,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.090
our operators that does some er thematic operations.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.090
Take a look at this.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.120
We have any to operator that will find the some off to operate ants we have.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.390
I equals 20 and d will stand out.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.790
One.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.390
This statement will find the some off it and it would bring the airport.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.270
And we have subtraction.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.860
Operator,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.350
this will find the difference between the two or Brent,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:56.030
and we have multiplication operator and the symbol that you need to use to multiply to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:05.240
operate ends Is this something that looks like a stone and we use forward slash to perform

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.850
the division operation.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.000
These are all our thematic operators.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.710
We also have assignment Operator.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:22.250
We use this operator to assign value to a variable and we have already seen this used in

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.900
over previous examples.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.370
It's simple equal sign that we used to assign a value to a variable,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.680
and this is how exactly we did in our math classes as well.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.680
And then we have marginalise operators.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.650
We use percentile symbol for this,

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.570
and what this does is it will find the reminder off to our prints or two variables.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.450
Let's run this program.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.750
Let's double click the tab to shrink it.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:09.130
And then you should not run the program using the run project because doing so will run the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.950
entire project and an entire project.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.190
It is expected that we have will have only one void main method.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.480
By the way,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.180
we will talk about methods in all.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.690
But just remember that her every project we should have only one main method.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.470
But since in all these files,

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.070
for example,

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.810
it's open but twice operators,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.020
we have main method here,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.450
too,

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.750
so we need to run each off these files individually.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.470
So to do so,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.600
we need to right click on the file and then click on run file.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.850
Or we can also use a shortcut,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.380
which is shift key plus up.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.050
Six.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.780
Explicate it to run the program.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.350
All right,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.750
we guard output.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.190
Ignore all the junk here and let's just walk us on the result.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:24.370
So I plus D is 30.1 I minus d is mine 0.9 ex cetera.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.650
Great.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.850
Now you tried to modify the cord you a different value and tried to play with the program.
