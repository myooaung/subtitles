00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
we had talked about gender methods and gender classes.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.640
Now let's put these things together.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.070
No gender class or Java.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.950
We had used one single type perimeter.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.190
However,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.850
at times we might want to use more than one type perimeter.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.650
And that's exactly what we did here in key value Pair door Jama.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.850
I have a couple of gender query bolts and with their gatherers and setters,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.500
along with the constructor to set the values for both these very belts.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.300
Now,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.250
both can we can be off any type in this example.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.450
We're making use of that class to create objects.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.310
So I have instance,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.480
created this class.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.000
But we need to send the type arguments in this case I'm sending in DeGeurin string.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.910
So same goes in here and did your own string.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.350
By the way,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.740
we can have this too defined in here.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.970
Hurricanes just simply ignore it.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.780
Bo Terry Coolant moving on.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.950
So I've created three objects off the class and since this looks like a key and the value

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.920
pair as a good naming convention,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.440
I had used couple guess K for key and upper case we for value.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.630
This makes more sense when we talk about hash map in our collections chapter.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.860
Also,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.320
we have agenda method that's going to take a couple of gender.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.150
Grable's.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.140
And since we're expecting couple of general wearables,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.250
we need to define the same in here.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.190
Britain.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:50.840
The anger braces I'm sending to such objects the objects off cable repair and I'm comparing

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.410
boat.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.570
I'm checking to see if the boat are similar in the scarce.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.070
This to key value.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.550
Pairs are exactly same.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.510
And when we compare both these objects,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.950
we should get the result as true.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.300
And in here I'm comparing P one and P tree,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.980
which are not identical.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.810
Then this should result in forts.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.950
Let's run the program pretty well and good.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.980
See you in my next radio.
