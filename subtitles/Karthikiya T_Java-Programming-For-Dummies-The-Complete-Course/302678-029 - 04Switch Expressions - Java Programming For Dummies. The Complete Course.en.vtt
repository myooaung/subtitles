00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
In this video, we're going to talk about switch expressions,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.165
which we can think of it as an enhanced version of the traditional switch statement.

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:13.994
What I have here is a traditional switch statement with a bunch of cases.

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:17.190
And what I'm trying to do here is we're going to activate one of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.865
these cases based on the integer value.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:24.300
If I say one, that's going to correspond to Sunday.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.505
If I entered two,

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.695
that's going to correspond to Monday.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.875
And if I enter the value seven,

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:35.235
that's going to correspond to Saturday.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.500
But there are certain problems in here.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.905
Number one, the code is taken too many lines of code.

00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:48.260
And number two, there's a risk of so-called switch fall through.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.005
For example, let me just run this program.

00:00:51.005 --> 00:01:01.475
Since I've entered the value to this should print Monday. And it did.

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:07.865
But let's let I forgotten to put the break statement and save the file.

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:11.120
What happens is the control won't break

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.049
and it would just continue executing the other cases.

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:22.610
So this is going to yield some bad results.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.040
So two shouldn't correspond to Tuesday,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.780
but it was printed.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.295
Another problem is let say phi into some value like 12.

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:37.835
There is no default switch statement to take care of that.

00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:40.820
And it's going to return null.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.390
So let's write a switch expression and see how it's going to solve all these problems.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.570
And when did directly assign the switch statement to this?

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.255
And I'm now actually going to use an arrow,

00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:04.385
which is especially introduced operator. Just like so.

00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:10.440
I'm going to do the same for rest of the cases as well.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.590
And of course we can actually get rid of the break statement as well.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.530
It would be taken care automatically.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.215
So with this, not only are we going to get it off the switch Walter problem.

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:47.690
But if you hover your mouse over this editor,

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.999
it says add a default case. It's mandatory.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.420
So in an instance where none of these cases match,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:08.610
then the default case would be executed. Statement.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.140
And everything would work as usual.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:28.580
So this has returned any whatever we had entered into the value two.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.600
Then this MOOC does well.
