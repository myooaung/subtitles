00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
in this video,

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.090
we're going to talk about control statements or sometimes referred to as a conditional

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.850
statement,

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.750
control statements helps and controlling the flow off execution off a program.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.900
Now let's take a look at that real time example.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.670
Let's say you have a source and destination and we have a Robert.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:33.210
Our goal is to send this robot from source to destination and that those assume that we

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.450
have a car,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.160
a bike and a truck.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.250
Now we need to program this robot,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.650
and we need to instruct it to go to destination as fast as it can.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.190
Obviously,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.270
what we're going to write in our program is to tell the robot to work.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.270
However,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.050
it will take a lot of time to reach destination if it walks.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.290
So we need to find a way to go much faster.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.220
So for that we can make use off these Wake ALS,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.310
which are available so instead off saying walk.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.450
What we're going to say is if if a car is available,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.940
then Usucar so Robert will check to see if car is available.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.400
If yes,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.260
then it's going to use the car to reach the destination.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.050
But we have a problem here.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.420
Let's a car is not available.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.280
For some reason,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.300
maybe it was taken by some of the robot.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.700
Or maybe due to technical difficulties,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.150
the car is not starting.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.050
Then that would result,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.120
and Robert not reaching the destination.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.750
So what we want to do is went to tell the Robert that if car is not available,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.550
then start walking.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.850
We say else look,

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.660
now we have two more radios here,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.190
a bike and a truck if a car is not available than my contra,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.860
but use bike or a truck and if major off them or available,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.460
that can walk.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.650
So instead off saying else walk.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.270
We're gonna say,

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.490
Hells,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.120
if bike is available,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.530
then use bike again else.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.950
If truck is available,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.380
use truck else.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.910
Walk.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.840
So what this piece or program does,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.220
is it for it?

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.810
Let the robot check to see if car is available.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.350
If it's not available,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.610
then it will check buses available.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.470
It buses not available.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.350
That was check if truck is available and if truck is not available,

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.550
it will simply start walking.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.370
Good.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.630
Now let's a car is available,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:07.250
which means we're gonna enter this piece off court and note that once we enter this block,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.000
we're going to ignore rest off the cord because we have our car available now.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.220
Inside this car was said Usucar.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.070
Let's program it more specifically.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.370
So if car is available,

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.460
what we're gonna do is to start the car.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.410
And as we know,

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.250
pressing the start button in the car may or may not stop the car.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.690
It may be due toa any number of reasons,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.150
but it may or may not start so,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.650
Carmen,

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.650
or start in the very first goal when to keep trying until it starts.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.310
So in here,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.250
within this block we went to right this program,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.240
I would say while car not Tartar.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.480
Then we're going to do something press star.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.690
But the robot will enter inside the car,

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.380
and it will see if the state off car is not started.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.280
If this condition is true,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.600
then we're gonna enter inside this block,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.280
and we instructed Robert to press start button so Robert will press the start button again

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.280
.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.530
It will go back to this line off court and we'll check to see if car started if not against

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:35.550
contender inside this and and Robert will press the start button and it keeps trying until

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.610
the car starts.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.550
But we have a problem here.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.390
Let's it due to some technical reasons,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.050
the car will never start.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.960
According to our program,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.170
the robot will keep trying forever.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.250
And that would result in draw but not reaching the destination.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.630
So went to solve this problem at the same time.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.790
We don't want to give up trying.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.840
So what we're going to do is we're gonna have maximum attempt off 10.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.210
So the robot is going to try 10 times pressing the start button,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.660
expecting the car to start.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.740
If the car doesn't start,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.230
then we'll just simply give up.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.440
So how are we going to do that?

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:26.230
We're gonna have a variable that says number off Price said Ben.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.220
And then we're gonna have a counter that starts with zero.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.650
Now,

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.700
every time we enter inside the slope inside this block,

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.210
After meeting this condition,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:45.250
you can increment the count by using post increment operator so the count will keep on

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.150
increasing every time we enter this block.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.100
Now we have to have an if condition here,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.150
just as if conditioning here.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.970
And that says if count equals equals tries,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:11.390
which means we have reached the maximum number of tries.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.450
If released the maximum number off price,

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.880
then we're gonna enter inside this block,

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.350
and we're gonna tell the robot,

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.630
too Break,

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.870
which means give up by using this word break.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.640
We're gonna get out off this while loop and we're gonna go ahead with for the lines off

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.580
instructions.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.950
So this way,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.120
the robot will try for 10 times to start the car.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.920
If it doesn't,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.400
it will go ahead with this instructions.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.380
And in here,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.480
we're going to mention the Robert,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.860
too.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.450
Simply walk.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.620
Now.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.420
I believe you got a sense off how control statements are used to control the flow of

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.650
execution off a program.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:06.550
So we have talked about if condition but talked about if else if condition.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:16.850
We've also talked about why loop And we've also talked about one keyword called Brick.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.270
All right,

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.740
in our next video,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.280
we're going to see all of these written in our program
