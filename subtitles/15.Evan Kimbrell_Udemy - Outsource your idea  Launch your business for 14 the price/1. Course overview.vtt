06:02.370 --> 06:04.830
So you're 100 percent covered and that's it.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.640
That's the whirlwind tour.

06:06.690 --> 06:12.900

We're going to have screencast we're going to be literally looking over my shoulder as I go out there

06:34.050 --> 06:36.670
and do exactly what I'm telling you to do.

06:36.760 --> 06:41.490
And I want to narrate the entire time what you should know what you should be thinking how you can go

06:41.490 --> 06:43.100
about this in a professional way.

06:43.200 --> 06:49.500
Then the last thing is when we actually have hands on out there working on individual projects at the

06:49.500 --> 06:55.710
very end we'll be adding a section where I show you a real outsource project a real project here at

06:55.710 --> 06:56.100
