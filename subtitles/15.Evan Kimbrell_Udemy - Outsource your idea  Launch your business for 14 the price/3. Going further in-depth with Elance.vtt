00:05.740 --> 00:10.640
I can bring up user interface for what that looks like.

00:10.860 --> 00:18.000
So in an actual job so this is a job that I had built with an application that I built previously and

00:18.000 --> 00:20.580
you can kind of see what it looks like after you've selected someone.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.750
I use a programmer named Nicholas.

00:22.800 --> 00:29.100
It puts me in a work room with them and there I can see messages I can see my payments and they use

00:29.100 --> 00:32.940
an escrow service it's very easy to use.

00:33.260 --> 00:40.430
You know you just fund an amount and then you use it like you'll use it like a milestone.

00:40.440 --> 00:45.870
So you'll say you know 500 bucks to get stoned and five hundred bucks to get this done and a thousand

00:45.870 --> 00:46.890
dollars to get this done.

00:46.890 --> 00:50.310
And as they finish it and deliver it then you can release it to them.

00:50.380 --> 00:53.430
Lance holds onto the money like an escrow so that you can dispute it.

00:53.430 --> 00:57.770
If anything happens they don't deliver it or they deliver something that you didn't ask for.

00:57.780 --> 01:00.700
Here is an area where again oh here's this.

01:00.770 --> 01:01.780
This is the tracker.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.700
So if I wanted to you I could ask them to use the freelancer tracker.

01:05.700 --> 01:10.280
I didn't because I use a project price and I trusted this freelancer I'd worked with them before.

01:10.470 --> 01:14.040
But if you wanted to you could use this and this is a way of keeping them honest when they're talking

01:14.040 --> 01:19.440
about charging you per hour but also seeing how productive they are if you're doing manual like virtual

01:19.440 --> 01:23.410
assistant tasks or someone's filling out a Excel sheet or something like that.

01:23.710 --> 01:25.290
That could be quite useful.

01:25.290 --> 01:29.280
Being able to make sure that they work for eight hours they are actually working for eight hours and

01:29.340 --> 01:33.870
they're not working for 10 15 minutes of that hour.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.920
They also give you the ability to upload your contract onto here.

01:37.920 --> 01:44.370
L.A. is pretty good at looking at the contracts that you use and then going off of that information

01:44.370 --> 01:45.800
when it comes to a dispute.

01:46.050 --> 01:49.430
So it's not just to prove that you have some legality behind this.

01:49.490 --> 01:56.240
Lance does use the contract language you use to enforce whatever is happening in your project.

01:56.310 --> 01:57.260
Let's see.

01:57.370 --> 02:02.830
Now I think that honestly covers pretty much everything you would want to know about Elance.

02:02.940 --> 02:05.940
Again it's something that I enjoy quite a bit.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.170
I like using it.

02:07.170 --> 02:10.950
I've gotten some really good really talented people off of here.

02:10.980 --> 02:16.500
It is usually my go to unless I'm trying to cut costs from trying to cut costs.

02:16.590 --> 02:18.990
Then why would I go to a freelancer.

02:19.020 --> 02:20.420
And that's coming up.

02:20.760 --> 02:25.590
And if I wanted to have someone who wants to work per hour because they don't know how big the project

02:25.620 --> 02:32.890
is or I want to have a relationship with someone that goes on forever I would use oDesk and so Odessey

02:32.900 --> 02:42.290
is going to be next.
