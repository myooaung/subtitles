Hey guys welcome back to the course.

00:07.290 --> 00:14.070
So in this lecture I'm going to show you how you can take the first step in creating low fidelity wireframe.

00:14.220 --> 00:17.830
Now I'm designing this to be as simple as possible.

00:17.880 --> 00:18.870
I'm showing you this.

00:18.870 --> 00:25.020
Based off of a table and paper and I'm going to show you how I would go about doing it but I make it

00:25.020 --> 00:25.800
really simple.

00:25.800 --> 00:26.980
Everybody has a pen.

00:27.030 --> 00:32.760
Everybody has access to paper and honestly that's really all you need to first get the juices flowing

00:32.940 --> 00:35.310
and to get introduced to the wire framing process.

00:35.310 --> 00:37.860
Now remember we have a five step framework.

00:37.890 --> 00:43.410
Remember all the asss this is structure structure is what we're talking about where to put things on

00:43.410 --> 00:50.880
a page roughly how we want it to feel what we think it should look like compared to other Web sites.

00:50.940 --> 00:54.410
Where should the content kind of roughly be located.

00:54.420 --> 00:57.630
This is really the first attempt at putting something on paper.

00:57.720 --> 00:58.610
It's going to be rough.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.810
It's going to be vague but that's exactly what we want

01:04.490 --> 01:09.400
to do.
