00:06.110 --> 00:08.540
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture.

00:08.540 --> 00:15.680
I'm going to go over a framework that we use at Sprint Keck to understand the process you should go

00:15.680 --> 00:17.280
through when wireframe.

00:17.660 --> 00:22.030
Now the reason why I'm going over this is because pretty much everyone who's taking this course and

00:22.030 --> 00:29.660
once you've done wireframe before is new to the concept of making low fidelity wireframe High Fidelity

00:29.660 --> 00:30.700
prototypes.

00:30.890 --> 00:34.170
So you're probably sitting here thinking what do I do first.

00:34.310 --> 00:35.670
What happens after that.

00:35.750 --> 00:40.960
What's the lead up to the point where I'm actually in a web site in a tool and I'm drawing it out.

00:40.980 --> 00:44.610
Now the process that I'm going to teach you you don't need to memorize it by any means.

00:44.650 --> 00:48.900
It's helpful to come back to this lecture and kind of forget where you should be doing next but it's

00:48.920 --> 00:51.220
really kind of simple system.

00:51.260 --> 00:58.140
We call it the construction flow but I've heard it be called kind of all sorts of other things.

00:58.190 --> 01:01.520
You can also call it like a design stack.

01:01.520 --> 01:08.490
Really it's just like a one through five step process to go from idea to I put it on paper.

01:08.510 --> 01:09.680
It's a wireframe.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.760
It looks good.

01:10.880 --> 01:15.920
It's helpful to use this framework because it helps you understand what comes first what comes second

01:15.980 --> 01:17.590
what comes next.

01:17.660 --> 01:23.180
And it allows you to make a decision about how much how in-depth you want to get and also forces you

01:23.180 --> 01:27.790
to do a lot of thinking about your application that you otherwise probably wouldn't have done.

01:27.830 --> 01:31.700
Once you follow through the steps and you actually get to the wireframe part or the prototyping part

01:31.700 --> 01:37.400
of the variance that 5 you should feel very comfortable with your idea understanding what your user

01:37.400 --> 01:43.850
needs are what should go into it and you should be in a good position to make a good final product.

01:43.850 --> 01:45.530
The framework is very simple.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.690
It starts with strategy.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.680
Then it goes to scope then it goes to structure.

01:51.680 --> 01:55.760
Then it goes to skeleton and then it finishes with surface.

01:55.760 --> 02:03.710
Now each one of those five describes a point as you go down the list your idea starts to evolve and

02:03.710 --> 02:08.330
it starts to become more substantiated starts to become more real remember because there are just lots

02:08.330 --> 02:09.240
of S's.

02:09.350 --> 02:14.730
And also as you go from the top go all the way to the bottom you go from high level overview.

02:14.810 --> 02:20.150
Lots of big broad vague questions once you probably already answered it all the way down to me actually

02:20.150 --> 02:26.170
get to a point where we're talking about pixels and not overarching strategies or ideas.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.890
So number one you start with strategy.

02:28.910 --> 02:33.950
Now a lot of you've already done this but it's a little bit more substantial than you sitting around

02:33.950 --> 02:35.530
thinking about your idea.

02:35.690 --> 02:41.750
We're also going to focus this on the application itself and not just your general business idea or

02:41.810 --> 02:45.290
what the point of the project is a part of your company.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.790
We're not going to deal with that stuff.

02:46.790 --> 02:52.670
We're just dealing more or less with what your application is what it does why it does that and who's

02:52.670 --> 02:53.590
going to use it.

02:53.750 --> 02:58.060
So our strategy is the question like What does your application do.

02:58.070 --> 02:59.380
Seems really obvious right.

02:59.390 --> 03:01.570
But it really does help to write it out.

03:01.580 --> 03:08.330
Now if you have a one sentence answer for what your application does or your idea is that's extremely

03:08.330 --> 03:08.810
helpful.

03:08.810 --> 03:09.920
Put that at the top.

03:09.920 --> 03:14.450
It's almost kind of like the mission or objective that you'd see at the top of your resume.

03:14.450 --> 03:15.770
Pass that right down.

03:15.770 --> 03:18.010
What does it aim to accomplish.

03:18.350 --> 03:20.030
Now think about that a little bit.

03:20.030 --> 03:20.710
Right.

03:20.720 --> 03:27.290
If building an e-commerce store what's it aim to accomplish it the Web site itself aims to accomplish

03:27.650 --> 03:34.820
being able to list out products and sell them and do that seamlessly and to accommodate lots of products

03:34.820 --> 03:36.980
and lots of different users write lots of traffic.

03:36.980 --> 03:43.430
Now if you're building a mobile application let's say the mobile application for happy hours that is

03:43.430 --> 03:49.910
a mobile application that grabs your location tells you what beer and alcohol happy hours are around

03:49.910 --> 03:50.660
you.

03:50.750 --> 03:56.810
Now what's the strategy behind that strategy is that you expect some people that are in their 20s and

03:56.810 --> 04:00.910
30s to be looking for happy hours but they wanted as simple as possible.

04:00.950 --> 04:06.890
So they want an app and then aptest opens up grabs location and delivers results based off a business

04:06.890 --> 04:07.610
directory.

04:07.610 --> 04:08.770
That's honestly it.

04:08.780 --> 04:14.120
I mean that is your main objective just trying to boil that down into one sentence past that point.

04:14.120 --> 04:18.700
Then you need to start thinking a little bit about the user base that's using your application now.

04:18.860 --> 04:20.270
Who do you think is going to use it.

04:20.270 --> 04:23.810
It doesn't need to be accurate you just need to write this out who you think is going to be using it

04:24.080 --> 04:27.530
then it's really just a question of what are your users needs.

04:27.530 --> 04:33.040
Now if you're in the e-commerce store example if someone comes to your site what are their needs and

04:33.050 --> 04:37.610
needs that they need to buy something where their needs be that maybe they need to buy something in

04:37.610 --> 04:39.440
return something.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.280
Are they coming to your site because they want to find more information.

04:42.290 --> 04:49.910
Let's say you're an information site or a blog are they coming to look for lots of small bits of short

04:49.910 --> 04:55.900
form essays or are they looking for long academic research papers.

04:55.910 --> 04:57.380
These are the things we need to figure out.

04:57.500 --> 04:58.810
So groups of people.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.010
What are they looking for.

05:00.270 --> 05:02.780
And how is your site going to deliver that.

05:02.800 --> 05:08.190
Now this is just a mental exercise because it forces you to think about all the stakeholders in your

05:08.190 --> 05:13.060
application and it forces you to think of what is the big picture.

05:13.110 --> 05:17.790
A lot of times what happens is people skip this step though go into wireframe and the search is building

05:17.790 --> 05:21.450
out a bunch of features they don't really need because they didn't sit down and think about what is

05:21.450 --> 05:23.490
the core mission of my application.

05:23.490 --> 05:28.590
Now once you've actually written that out then you can actually use that as a guideline to say OK I

05:28.590 --> 05:32.260
need a service from Trinity to service user I need to serve this need.

05:32.270 --> 05:34.520
Now you don't have to absolutely write this out.

05:34.530 --> 05:35.940
I strongly prefer you do.

05:35.940 --> 05:37.230
It's very helpful.

05:37.230 --> 05:41.990
It's something you can use later whenever you do actually go and get your application built or whatever.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.200
I find it very useful.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.590
You don't actually have to do this in your head.

05:45.720 --> 05:50.520
This part honestly with me it only takes 10 to 15 minutes to even do this.

05:50.670 --> 05:53.250
Probably because I built so many applications now.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.940
And if you're new to it it might take a little bit of thinking.

05:56.040 --> 06:01.440
You don't have to research this at all you don't to jump online and look around at different types of

06:01.470 --> 06:04.300
potential customers or markets or any of that nonsense.

06:04.380 --> 06:08.840
It's just a mental exercise to help you wrap your head around the big big picture.

06:08.910 --> 06:09.180
OK.

06:09.210 --> 06:11.560
So now let's move on to Step Two.

06:11.670 --> 06:18.970
Scope scope is where you are now kind of list out every single functional requirement you can think

06:18.970 --> 06:21.910
of that's going to go into your application or your website.

06:21.940 --> 06:28.300
Previously we've established who the users are and what they need now what functions will we actually

06:28.300 --> 06:29.770
need to put in there.

06:30.100 --> 06:36.600
If people are coming to your Web site because you sell daily deals now if people are coming to your

06:36.600 --> 06:41.130
website because you sell weekly deals and they need to keep up to date with everything that's happening

06:41.970 --> 06:45.390
you're going to need say something that captures their e-mail address.

06:45.510 --> 06:46.320
OK.

06:46.750 --> 06:47.760
Wow.

06:50.030 --> 06:50.770
OK that's great.

06:50.770 --> 06:55.730
Or you write down a function to capture an email address later you're going to figure out how that does

06:55.730 --> 06:56.090
it.

06:56.160 --> 07:00.800
But right now you're just worried about OK that's a function that I think my web site will need to handle.

07:00.800 --> 07:06.460
Try to think about every single thing you try to imagine you are using your web site and your application

07:06.470 --> 07:07.550
what are you going to run into.

07:07.550 --> 07:12.680
What are things that you're going to need these if you will always forget are things like Do your users

07:12.680 --> 07:15.260
need to log in and they need to log in.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.590
Right that our need to log in.

07:17.660 --> 07:19.640
Do they need to have guest access.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.160
Is it a web site that you don't need to log in to see everything.

07:22.220 --> 07:25.510
But if you do log in you get to see other things write that up.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.610
Do you need to use Facebook Connect.

07:27.710 --> 07:32.780
If your application uses some social network information they might need to connect their Facebook that's

07:32.780 --> 07:35.130
another function you'll need to write down Facebook Connect.

07:35.150 --> 07:38.650
Think about things that happen when something goes wrong.

07:38.840 --> 07:43.650
E-commerce store and an e-commerce store what happens if they get shipped the wrong thing.

07:43.700 --> 07:46.460
Your application is going to need to handle that somehow.

07:46.460 --> 07:46.940
Right.

07:47.090 --> 07:50.160
And the user is going to need to find some way of recourse.

07:50.420 --> 07:55.430
So remember to bring in all sorts of things like that to write down for instance ways that they can

07:55.430 --> 08:00.740
process like refunds or something like that or in the case that a user puts their information incorrect

08:00.770 --> 08:01.550
incorrectly.

08:01.610 --> 08:04.980
They can change their password and things like that.

08:05.030 --> 08:08.870
Also don't forget that you are going to be operating this application.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.830
Now when you're operating the application that means that you need to be able to control basic things

08:12.830 --> 08:14.570
like control who your users are.

08:14.600 --> 08:19.390
You don't need to be able to delete users if you need to ban them or anything like that.

08:19.550 --> 08:24.050
You need to keep track of for instance if you're selling something you're going need to keep track of

08:24.050 --> 08:28.280
what you're selling how many you've sold how many even shipped your records things like that.

08:28.520 --> 08:34.010
So keep in mind what it's the bare minimum amount of functionality you need as an administrator.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.490
Write all this down.

08:35.510 --> 08:40.630
Now again if you're selling something don't forget to write down I need to settle payments.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.400
I need to be able to accept payments.

08:42.470 --> 08:47.450
You use Paypal maybe you stripe or make sure that you know that that's going to go in the application

08:47.480 --> 08:51.800
and then you write this down guys organization for this whole list doesn't matter.

08:51.800 --> 08:55.460
Scribble it down songs on a piece of paper you're not going to forget it.

08:55.520 --> 09:00.290
This process I think honestly will take a good chunk of your time.

09:00.340 --> 09:04.900
Not you know 30 minutes not a I mean I'd say it takes maybe an hour or so.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.730
How big your application is how much you've actually put into it.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.580
You really don't want to leave anything out.

09:09.890 --> 09:15.590
Later on it doesn't you know you can think of extra things to add and it's very easy to add it but it's

09:15.590 --> 09:20.030
much easier if you remember at the beginning that you can take everything into consideration and you

09:20.030 --> 09:23.150
can make judgment calls about what's important and what's not important.

09:23.390 --> 09:29.470
That's also a great segue with a lot of people do this section and they're determining their scope.

09:29.720 --> 09:33.620
What's important here is that you don't go crazy with it.

09:33.620 --> 09:35.510
Please do not just go nuts.

09:35.510 --> 09:40.760
A lot of people to say OK need a box that does this and I need this to pop up and you click this it

09:40.760 --> 09:43.200
is going to do this stuff and they just list out.

09:43.190 --> 09:44.900
Way way way too much stuff.

09:44.900 --> 09:50.420
We for instance had a client who built a social networking app and just added features and features

09:50.420 --> 09:52.730
and features and features and features.

09:52.730 --> 09:56.690
So when you're doing this you're trying to think of it from the very beginning.

09:56.690 --> 09:59.780
Think of the things that are essential to what you're trying to do and then think of the things that

09:59.780 --> 10:05.350
are extra I personally like to divide these out electric divide them out by saying number one.

10:05.510 --> 10:07.390
Here's the core functions.

10:07.460 --> 10:12.190
And number two here's the here's the extra extemporaneous.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.890
The non-nut necessary scope with the application.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.990
Try to get all of us out on a scribble paper.

10:17.990 --> 10:21.430
Once you do and what you can't think anything else you always come back to it.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.830
But otherwise you're ready to go.

10:22.820 --> 10:29.810
And number three now number three is when we actually start getting into the wire framing and the prototyping

10:29.810 --> 10:30.590
process.

10:30.640 --> 10:36.950
EP 1 and step 2 those were just the pre-work processes those are the things that we set down in a scribble

10:36.950 --> 10:39.000
pad and think about it.

10:39.230 --> 10:44.480
Once you get the pre-work done then you're ready to actually dive in and start physically making your

10:44.480 --> 10:45.050
mockup.

10:45.050 --> 10:54.380
So number three is structure now structure is the high level way of looking at your page your application

10:54.380 --> 11:00.080
your design what you're doing here is you're just thinking about OK now that I have all my functions

11:00.080 --> 11:02.030
listed out where are these going to go.

11:02.030 --> 11:03.290
Roughly right.

11:03.440 --> 11:07.670
What is my page roughly going to look like is you know look like a traditional web site we're at the

11:07.670 --> 11:11.240
top left we have the logo then you have a navigation bar and you footer.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.550
And in the middle sections are all the content is.

11:13.670 --> 11:18.290
Or maybe it's a little less traditional Maybe it's like a blog or on say the right hand side we see

11:18.530 --> 11:20.990
information or we see articles on the left hand side.

11:20.990 --> 11:22.110
We have the navigation bar.

11:22.110 --> 11:24.130
It's a vertical navigation bar.

11:24.390 --> 11:29.630
You you think about how the layout is going to look roughly where things are going to go.

11:29.660 --> 11:34.230
The best way honestly to do this and we're going to cover this later in the lecture is the set down

11:34.230 --> 11:36.440
of a piece of paper and a pen.

11:36.530 --> 11:43.340
The best way is to literally just take a pen and start jotting off drawing a box for a web site or a

11:43.340 --> 11:48.860
smaller rectangle for a mobile application and start just kind of filling in where you think sections

11:48.860 --> 11:49.460
would go.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.870
You don't like it tear it up try another page.

11:51.870 --> 11:56.490
The point is just to start putting it out there and as soon as your pen starts touching the pad you'll

11:56.490 --> 12:01.110
start to understand whether or not something feels right works right whether or not you should change

12:01.110 --> 12:06.390
it up later in the course we're actually going to do that and I'm going to walk you through when I do

12:06.390 --> 12:10.710
it with an application and then you can get a little bit more of a feel but that's the best way of doing

12:10.710 --> 12:11.020
this.

12:11.070 --> 12:17.220
Now mind us advice for doing structure figuring out where the lay out is where your information should

12:17.220 --> 12:22.140
be where your content should be is actually just to look at other Web sites.

12:22.140 --> 12:26.940
This is a really good way because not all of us are people who spend all day mixing around with Web

12:26.940 --> 12:34.020
sites thinking about what the best way of capturing an email address is or inputting a form or loading

12:34.020 --> 12:35.390
a photograph.

12:35.730 --> 12:40.350
And you look at other Web sites then you can kind of get a gist of how most people do it and how some

12:40.350 --> 12:45.320
other people who are thought leaders do it you're building an e-commerce store think about some the

12:45.450 --> 12:50.070
stores you've been through that you liked the design you liked the layout of go to that site and see

12:50.070 --> 12:50.780
what they do.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.640
Now you can actually kind of think of OK that's interesting.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.470
They put their search bar at the top left.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.630
They don't put it at say the bottom.

12:57.730 --> 13:03.080
Or maybe you find a page that is really long and maybe that's an interesting way of doing it.

13:03.150 --> 13:09.690
If you're building say a content Web site goaland look at other content Web sites look at ones that

13:09.690 --> 13:12.320
are famous and look at ones that you personally like.

13:12.540 --> 13:18.000
Honestly I think that you can benefit just from looking at anyone's Web site and seeing what their structure

13:18.060 --> 13:23.940
is how they lay out the information and you'll find out that it's not you know you want to pave your

13:23.940 --> 13:27.340
own path in some ways but also you want to keep it simpler.

13:27.390 --> 13:33.090
You want to keep it based on what other people do because other users are probably use to certain site

13:33.090 --> 13:33.770
layouts.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.260
So you don't want to deviate too much but that's the best way of doing it.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.200
Find some Web sites you really really like.

13:39.270 --> 13:43.140
If you're building a big web application maybe you could go and look at your favorite software as a

13:43.140 --> 13:46.440
service company or your favorite subscription service.

13:46.440 --> 13:50.880
If you're building an administration panel or something it's like an enterprise enterprise application

13:50.880 --> 13:56.040
maybe you go look at a really nice accounting software like zero is a great example of a really nice

13:56.520 --> 14:00.060
administration panel user flow and structure.

14:00.060 --> 14:04.120
Now keep in mind this process does not need to be perfect.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.980
It's not supposed to be perfect not to be flawless.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.130
Remember we're amateurs at this.

14:09.160 --> 14:13.570
So when the first time you do this you're not going to know everything you're not going to get it perfectly.

14:13.590 --> 14:16.290
The point though is just to start sketching it out.

14:16.350 --> 14:19.180
Getting a rough idea where you think things should go.

14:19.200 --> 14:24.810
Doing some basic research for 20 30 minutes looking at other Web sites getting kind of an idea of where

14:24.810 --> 14:28.920
they put their bottoms where they put their information and then you'll start to form some opinions

14:28.920 --> 14:32.160
whether you like it whether or not you don't and you can start to put that on paper.

14:32.190 --> 14:34.160
Next up is number four which is skeleton.

14:34.170 --> 14:39.510
Now selten we're not really going to talk about a ton right now but it is the wire framing process.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.420
It's the low fidelity mockup.

14:42.510 --> 14:49.770
Later in the course you're going to follow me along as I make a wireframe and I use balsamic and Pinocchio

14:49.830 --> 14:52.420
to make low fidelity wireframe.

14:52.550 --> 14:57.570
You're going to follow along or learn a lot more just watching me do it and talking out loud explaining

14:57.570 --> 14:59.440
to you what I'm thinking and what I'm doing.

14:59.580 --> 15:05.190
But that's the forth process that's when you actually put it out and you start caring about not only

15:05.190 --> 15:11.210
the layout but what the buttons kind of are shaped like where your text is going to go.

15:11.250 --> 15:17.490
You might focus you'll pay attention to more details of smaller things you'll try to get as close as

15:17.490 --> 15:18.440
you can.

15:18.480 --> 15:24.660
You'll start putting actual pieces of elements on your page and starting to get a better visual feel

15:24.660 --> 15:26.030
for what it's going to look like.

15:26.040 --> 15:30.470
One of the biggest differences between structure and skeleton structure we're just going for layer.

15:30.570 --> 15:35.010
This section has this information a section of this information now it's skeleton you're going to say

15:35.190 --> 15:36.960
this is the section in this section.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.880
Here are the individual elements.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.230
That's what you're actually gonna do.

15:40.230 --> 15:46.710
So if I were to say looking at let's say YouTube and I said over here I want recommendations for other

15:46.710 --> 15:51.760
videos now in structure all I would say is I want a list of videos and I'll draw a box and say list

15:51.760 --> 15:52.860
of videos.

15:52.860 --> 15:58.230
However in skeleton what I would do is I would draw it out and then actually decide is the thumbnail

15:58.230 --> 15:59.370
going to be on the left or the right.

15:59.370 --> 16:03.420
How big is the thumbnail how many lines of information should I have.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.900
How big is the whole thing going to be.

16:04.920 --> 16:10.590
Now the the fifth and final section this is surface.

16:10.590 --> 16:13.010
This is not something that's actually covered in the course.

16:13.020 --> 16:15.830
But basically what it is is it's graphic design.

16:15.840 --> 16:19.200
It's going out and getting a visual design for your application.

16:19.420 --> 16:26.070
It's the number five because that is the finish point for getting your application design.

16:26.310 --> 16:31.980
Now in this course we're going to go through Number Five and once we have our designs done we're going

16:31.980 --> 16:38.730
to take those designs and make a high fidelity prototype that works and functions and looks like it's

16:38.730 --> 16:39.250
real.

16:39.270 --> 16:43.920
But if you don't have graphic design skills you're going to struggle with the s.c you have to look for

16:43.920 --> 16:48.770
someone else to do that or someone in your organization to do basic design for you.

16:48.780 --> 16:52.560
There are many many ways of getting that done in another lecture we're actually going to talk about

16:52.560 --> 16:52.940
that.

16:52.940 --> 16:54.030
So that's it.

16:54.030 --> 16:56.330
One all the way through five.

16:56.370 --> 16:58.020
You just follow it in that order.

16:58.020 --> 17:02.760
You don't necessarily need to do every single step of the process but this is by far the easiest and

17:02.760 --> 17:05.940
the most accurate way of doing it especially if you're new to this.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.690
You start at the top.

17:07.920 --> 17:08.830
It's the easiest.

17:08.840 --> 17:11.760
Then it it's a little bit harder but you've already done some of the work already.

17:11.760 --> 17:16.860
So you can draw off of what you did in the previous section and you just keep snowballing it down until

17:16.910 --> 17:18.950
will amaze yourself at what you've actually designed.

17:18.950 --> 17:22.970
Now you don't need to spend a ton of time throughout this entire process.

17:23.100 --> 17:26.450
Just keep in mind the more time you spend the more you'll get out of it.

17:26.610 --> 17:31.080
I think if you give an honest amount of effort teach one or two sections and you follow it in order

17:31.350 --> 17:35.760
you will come out with a much higher quality in productivity much happier with it.

17:35.760 --> 17:40.260
Of course if you already know how to do some of this you don't feel like you need to you can skip it.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.550
I just don't suggest it.

17:41.550 --> 17:43.130
All right guys like usual.

17:43.170 --> 17:44.930
Any questions clarifications.

17:44.940 --> 17:49.320
Posts in the group discussion you have any ideas for better ways of thinking about it.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.740
I'd love to hear it.

17:50.970 --> 17:54.300
If you want to add some things then this is perfectly fine.

17:54.310 --> 17:55.690
This is a system we use.

17:55.830 --> 17:56.930
I think it's simple.

17:56.970 --> 18:03.780
I like it because it works for people who are not you X UI designers you can understand this very easily

18:03.780 --> 18:06.210
and take it in easily just jump right in.

18:06.210 --> 18:10.670
And that's that's really what I like about it it's simple and we get the essence out very quickly and

18:10.690 --> 18:11.790
the questions guys let me know.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.210
Otherwise I will see the next lecture.
