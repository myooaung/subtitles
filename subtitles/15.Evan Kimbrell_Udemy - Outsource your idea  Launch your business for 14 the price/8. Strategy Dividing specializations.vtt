00:10.700 --> 00:11.100
Hey guys.

00:11.100 --> 00:12.890
Welcome back to the course in this lecture.

00:12.890 --> 00:18.620
We're going to talk about another one of the best practices for contracting and outsourcing and it's

00:18.620 --> 00:21.680
called dividing by specialisations.

00:21.680 --> 00:29.750
Now what have you guys who are not totally familiar with web work or mobile work or just in general

00:29.750 --> 00:31.630
digital work design work.

00:32.060 --> 00:35.440
Probably not familiar with every single piece that goes into your project.

00:35.540 --> 00:41.270
So let's say that you're building a web project your project has separate sections to it.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.880
So it's not just that you have one person make you a Web site.

00:44.900 --> 00:48.500
You need someone to do the design and you need someone to do the development.

00:48.530 --> 00:53.540
Now even within the development side there's different sections and within the design side there are

00:53.540 --> 00:54.920
different sections.

00:54.920 --> 01:00.050
Now when I say separate out the specialisations what I mean by that is first you need to recognize that

01:00.050 --> 01:07.040
there are separate sections in your project timeline or in your project scope and then you just divide

01:07.070 --> 01:14.360
by that you look for one person for each section as opposed to one person who does the entire thing.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.600
Now what's the benefit to doing this.

01:16.610 --> 01:21.830
So let's say in one scenario you have someone who says I'm going to make your web application including

01:21.890 --> 01:24.540
everything I'm going to help you with the strategy.

01:24.550 --> 01:27.680
I mean help you with the design I'm going to develop it I'm going to market it.

01:27.710 --> 01:30.980
And then the Olt alternate option is that you get four different people.

01:30.980 --> 01:36.320
One person helps you with consulting the idea one person designs that one person develops it and then

01:36.320 --> 01:38.560
one person helps you with the launch and the marketing.

01:38.600 --> 01:43.850
The difference is is that when you have one person do all of those things they're typically on average

01:43.910 --> 01:45.830
as a whole much more expensive.

01:45.830 --> 01:46.130
Why.

01:46.130 --> 01:50.570
Because it's a much rarer thing to find someone who can do all of those things.

01:50.570 --> 01:53.700
And so their time is much much much more valuable.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.890
Also when you have one person do all of those things that can't possibly be an expert.

01:57.950 --> 02:00.300
Every single one of them.

02:00.410 --> 02:05.550
Typically they're going to be good at one or two things but they can't possibly be a master.

02:05.630 --> 02:07.290
Every single section.

02:07.400 --> 02:12.380
Now the other scenario where you have four different people doing every single session you can pick

02:12.380 --> 02:17.540
people who are good at that one thing and because they're specialists.

02:17.540 --> 02:19.130
That means that that is their craft.

02:19.130 --> 02:24.820
They're not good at other things but they're also not attempting to work on other sections of your application.

02:24.830 --> 02:31.040
Now a specialist you usually end up saving quite a bit of money because it's a it's a question of scale.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.360
Almost one person works on the same thing over and over and over again.

02:34.370 --> 02:39.780
They get really good at that one thing they're faster at it and they can end up charging you less.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.200
And now this can apply in many different scenarios.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.500
Here's a great example.

02:43.640 --> 02:48.950
If you're building a web site or a web application and you get someone to design it and then you get

02:48.950 --> 02:52.250
someone who says I'm going to take that design and I'm going to develop it.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.780
Well you can actually add another step in that process.

02:55.970 --> 03:01.010
When you have a design typically it'll come to you in like a photoshop file or an Illustrator file or

03:01.100 --> 03:03.190
whatever A-P and GPDA.

03:03.980 --> 03:08.720
And then what ends up happening is the developer has to convert that into something that the browser

03:08.720 --> 03:10.320
can actually understand.

03:10.340 --> 03:16.700
They take the images out by a technique called slicing and they do all of the layouts for the actual

03:16.760 --> 03:19.740
application so that it displays correctly on the browser.

03:19.880 --> 03:25.310
Then they do the heavy lifting of actually making the buttons work the functionality work the pages

03:25.310 --> 03:26.470
load correctly.

03:26.510 --> 03:32.930
So what you can do is you can actually find a specialist to do that in-between job which is taking design

03:32.960 --> 03:38.600
and turning it into each team Mallan CSSA which is the preliminary work the developer would have been

03:38.600 --> 03:39.260
doing.

03:39.290 --> 03:45.530
Now typically a developer is good at either back end work or they're really good at taking designs and

03:45.530 --> 03:47.340
making them into HVM else.

03:47.330 --> 03:54.050
SS So in the case that you have someone doing both just generic development typically that means that

03:54.050 --> 03:59.840
they're probably not as good at both sides and they're probably charging you more because they actually

03:59.840 --> 04:01.850
it takes them a lot more time to do it.

04:01.850 --> 04:08.120
Now if I specialized in just taking a design and turning it into something a browser could read of just

04:08.210 --> 04:12.290
images an HMO I'd probably be pretty good at that.

04:12.320 --> 04:17.300
I'd also probably do it in half the time as someone who does not spend a lot of time doing that.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.860
And this is a great real life example.

04:18.860 --> 04:26.660
So if you had to design what you can do is you can go to a studio that specializes in taking Web taking

04:26.660 --> 04:31.580
design and turning them into an age TMLC SS and they cost a fraction of what someone else would charge

04:32.110 --> 04:36.920
your developer probably would charge you $40 an hour and probably tell you take them 20 hours that's

04:36.940 --> 04:41.520
eight hundred bucks but you can go to a company like pixel crayons site slinger.

04:41.540 --> 04:48.110
There's a lot of other ones out there or even just a studio you found on e L'anse that specializes in

04:48.110 --> 04:54.410
this and they're going to charge you probably $100 $150 because they're very good at it.

04:54.410 --> 04:56.630
So think about specializing.

04:56.630 --> 05:01.710
The only downside to specializing is that it requires more management on your side.

05:01.730 --> 05:04.030
It requires a little more coordination.

05:04.040 --> 05:08.630
You need to make sure that the people are helping you in each segment of your application or your project

05:08.930 --> 05:10.360
are in sync with the other.

05:10.570 --> 05:16.180
Now pay attention to the Project Management section of this course that can help you communicate between

05:16.180 --> 05:17.990
them much more easily.

05:18.160 --> 05:21.430
But in general Siskin are required that your a but more on the ball.

05:21.430 --> 05:25.450
You make sure everybody's on the same page everyone understands the same look and feel.

05:25.570 --> 05:30.040
It's really helpful to brief everyone on the same information even if it's not necessarily related to

05:30.040 --> 05:35.010
what they're doing just so they can know what to expect and know what their final product should be.

05:35.020 --> 05:36.890
So if they can handle it off to the next person.

05:36.910 --> 05:38.410
So this is a best practice.

05:38.440 --> 05:43.900
I think it's great if you're an advanced outsource or or contractor if you've worked with web projects

05:43.900 --> 05:44.680
before.

05:44.680 --> 05:49.030
If you're brand new to it you might be tempted just to use one person to do the entire thing which is

05:49.030 --> 05:49.960
perfectly fine.

05:49.960 --> 05:54.310
Obviously pay attention to their portfolio but expect to pay a little bit more money and expect it's

05:54.310 --> 05:56.140
going to take a little bit more time.

05:56.140 --> 06:01.600
So if you're up for it and you think you can do it try to find someone who can do individual segments

06:01.600 --> 06:02.870
of your project.

06:02.950 --> 06:07.770
You save money you save a lot of time and usually the product ends up coming out better.

06:07.810 --> 06:11.720
If you guys have any questions post in the group discussion love to discuss it.

06:11.860 --> 06:13.420
Any experiences you've had.

06:13.420 --> 06:24.310
Just let me know otherwise we'll see in the next lecture.
