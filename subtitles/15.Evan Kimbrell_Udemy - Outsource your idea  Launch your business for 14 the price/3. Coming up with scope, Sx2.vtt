00:05.940 --> 00:06.440
All right guys.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.410
Welcome back to the Course so.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.380
In the previous lecture we went over.

00:10.380 --> 00:16.410
Coming up with your strategy description for your application we're using that theoretical idea.

00:16.410 --> 00:21.440
Remember it's a mobile app that you open up so you are happy hours are around you.

00:22.020 --> 00:29.530
And so what we did is we came up with the basic hypothesis appear basic description.

00:29.610 --> 00:33.590
It's helpful to define what it is not and what it is.

00:34.140 --> 00:38.820
And then down here we gave a pretty good guess at what we think our users will be and a pretty decent

00:38.820 --> 00:41.110
guess that we think our goals should be.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.470
I didn't try to take this on.

00:42.480 --> 00:48.360
You can go crazy with it but just keep in mind it was all for you to help you keep track of what you're

00:48.360 --> 00:52.980
supposed to be doing and later down the line so you don't completely forget an entire section of your

00:52.980 --> 00:54.270
application.

00:54.270 --> 00:56.650
All right so now we're going to move on to scope.

00:56.680 --> 01:03.510
So what I do is just typically in the same document you can you just move on.

01:03.850 --> 01:10.220
And here the point is is to get everything onto the page that you think you want in it for our purposes.

01:10.220 --> 01:15.190
I'm going to keep this application simple and I help you try to understand the thought process I'm going

01:15.190 --> 01:16.560
through as I do it.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.780
But for a lot of you it could be a very complex application.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.970
That's perfectly fine.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.080
Just the point here is to put a lot on it.

01:23.080 --> 01:28.670
Now a lot of times I will get these documents done or will publish them and send them to clients.

01:28.810 --> 01:33.150
And the scope could literally be three to four pages.

01:33.430 --> 01:35.040
I don't think that's necessarily helpful.

01:35.050 --> 01:40.540
As an entrepreneur or someone who's trying to scrap this together very quickly and who's focusing on

01:40.540 --> 01:46.000
getting the most return for their effort but that makes sense for Sprint kayak because we deal with

01:46.000 --> 01:52.750
very high level clients you you're very large accounts and they want to see absolutely every piece of

01:52.750 --> 01:55.300
detail they could because they're approving it.

01:55.300 --> 01:59.500
Now as an individual trying to launch an idea trying to get out there quickly and not drive yourself

01:59.530 --> 02:04.170
crazy in the process I suggest keep it simple keep it vague.

02:04.240 --> 02:10.690
You can always come back and edit it more but just keep it keep in mind that like if you're spending

02:10.720 --> 02:16.240
hours determining your scope generally not particularly helpful you're just going to regret it later.

02:16.240 --> 02:23.980
So in the scope we're really all we're going to talk about here is what are the actual functions.

02:24.040 --> 02:29.320
Now if you remember in a previous lecture we talked a little bit about tasks and functions.

02:29.360 --> 02:33.490
It's listed as an extra lecture if you want to go check that out or we talk about persona's goals and

02:33.490 --> 02:36.590
interactions and tasks.

02:36.820 --> 02:43.810
OK so if you want to check it out there's an extra lecture we talk about persona's goals and tasks but

02:43.810 --> 02:48.010
for the most part we're just talking about functions and task what it physically does the application

02:48.010 --> 02:48.710
do.

02:49.240 --> 02:53.440
And the way that I like to do is like to visualize like when I open up the app or I hit the web page

02:53.440 --> 02:55.150
the home page of the web page.

02:55.150 --> 02:58.610
What exactly do I see and what exactly happens in it.

02:58.660 --> 03:02.020
It's also helpful to list out things that you don't want it to do.

03:02.030 --> 03:07.910
Now one example of something that you might not want to do is have a count logons.

03:07.960 --> 03:12.280
Now if you don't list out an account log in and you show that to someone who's giving you a quote for

03:12.280 --> 03:16.210
design or development they're just going to assume that you don't need people to log in.

03:16.210 --> 03:19.370
It's one of those things that you forget constantly.

03:19.660 --> 03:20.350
So think about it.

03:20.380 --> 03:22.240
Do you need users.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.660
Is there a value to you having users in your application.

03:25.660 --> 03:30.790
Now most of you out there probably would have some value in having users but it's maybe not something

03:30.820 --> 03:34.210
you want immediately when you're launching a smaller version of your application.

03:34.290 --> 03:36.700
Or maybe it's something that you just don't see any value in it right now.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.440
And so it's just not worth dealing with.

03:38.440 --> 03:43.000
Keep in mind that adds a decent amount of scope and it could be really simple but it actually makes

03:43.000 --> 03:46.430
your application significantly more complex.

03:46.620 --> 03:53.280
So what I'm gonna do straight up at the very beginning is I'm just gonna say do not need to collect

03:54.460 --> 04:02.850
user information and create accounts and I put that in italics so now that this is a negative but that's

04:02.850 --> 04:07.090
helpful for me and for anyone to show this to.

04:07.110 --> 04:07.350
OK.

04:07.350 --> 04:11.660
So let's imagine that we're hitting the front page of our application.

04:11.670 --> 04:13.210
I am always a minimalist.

04:13.230 --> 04:16.800
I'm always someone who follows us keep it simple stupid.

04:16.860 --> 04:22.320
So the way I envision this working is it's a mobile application I pull it out of my pocket I open it

04:22.320 --> 04:29.950
up and right off the bat it tells me what it does and then it allows me to look for them.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.880
Happy hours today or tomorrow.

04:31.890 --> 04:33.510
That's the way I'm envisioning this.

04:33.510 --> 04:36.930
OK it's not perfect X but this is something you always add it later.

04:36.930 --> 04:45.340
So what I would say is starts with a landing page of visual graphics.

04:45.520 --> 04:45.720
OK.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.770
Now what does that mean.

04:47.820 --> 04:52.740
This is all web studio speak but a landing page.

04:52.890 --> 04:56.310
It's actually it's a different term and mobile applications is going to call the landing page because

04:56.310 --> 05:02.370
it's much easier understand when you open up the screen it's gonna have a loading screen or a page that

05:02.370 --> 05:03.640
you land on.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.880
And now a lot of people forget about this.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.930
If I open an app do I go straight into the page where I'm signing up what happens in an intermediary

05:12.930 --> 05:15.290
step what happens for that one to two seconds.

05:15.330 --> 05:17.240
What actually gets displayed.

05:17.490 --> 05:23.250
The best way of tackling that in my experience is to make a loading screen that is the same exact thing

05:23.250 --> 05:26.330
as your landing screen just minus all of the input.

05:26.340 --> 05:34.590
So if I had a in this case if I had a page and it just said welcome to mobile you know mobile happy

05:34.590 --> 05:38.300
hours and then below it there chose today or tomorrow.

05:38.490 --> 05:42.990
I would create a screen without those buttons and that would be my landing page and then I'd add the

05:43.000 --> 05:43.920
buttons.

05:44.640 --> 05:49.290
So I would start with a blank page of visual graphics and then I'll give some kind of a clue as to what

05:49.290 --> 05:58.350
I think it should say OCHA to mobile or actually let's make this a little bit more catchy let's say

05:58.980 --> 06:01.780
find happy hours now.

06:01.830 --> 06:06.000
Right because we get to keep it really simple keep it action focused make sure everybody understands

06:06.000 --> 06:08.620
what the getting out of it and also that's short.

06:08.730 --> 06:10.580
So I can put that in on the screen very easily.

06:10.590 --> 06:16.120
Remember the phone screens are quite small so it's a visual graphics find happiness.

06:16.140 --> 06:31.300
Now that's roughly what will go for the first page was to tap obal and then we'll have it as I'm putting

06:31.300 --> 06:35.340
in parentheses anything anything that I think are words that I'm going to use in the application.

06:35.380 --> 06:36.550
You can give us whatever you want.

06:36.550 --> 06:43.270
Remember how you did it so we'll say 4 2 4 4 right now.

06:43.420 --> 06:47.290
And then also day for tomorrow.

06:50.470 --> 06:50.760
OK.

06:50.780 --> 06:52.730
So there you go.

06:53.180 --> 06:53.990
That's the first page.

06:53.990 --> 06:55.610
Now what happens when I click these buttons.

06:55.610 --> 06:57.760
What do you think should happen.

06:58.250 --> 07:03.070
I'm going to guess that since we hit a button for it right now or for tomorrow remember.

07:03.110 --> 07:05.340
Now we're going to scroll up and look at our goals.

07:05.360 --> 07:11.420
Remember those goal said see a visual representation of happy hours on a map near me.

07:11.570 --> 07:15.540
So my guess is we should probably do that first.

07:15.650 --> 07:23.440
What could happen is we'll say displays location pin.

07:23.580 --> 07:24.680
Keep in parentheses.

07:24.810 --> 07:27.090
Asked for your location information.

07:28.570 --> 07:33.970
Remember guys you have to return something and Sulzer app uses it it's you have to ask for certain permissions

07:33.970 --> 07:36.190
so don't forget the screens are in there.

07:36.220 --> 07:39.240
You can use the default user interface that Apple gives you.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.060
I just think they're ugly.

07:40.050 --> 07:41.370
You can skin those.

07:41.740 --> 07:43.150
Maybe that's something you have to deal with later.

07:43.150 --> 07:45.750
Just remember that this is part of the process.

07:45.870 --> 07:54.320
As for your location information and what they say allow say a location pin or the user is user is OK

07:55.630 --> 08:00.730
and since that's the one singular function I'm going to list that as its own thing now within the same

08:00.730 --> 08:07.180
screen and I write this conversationally so as you're reading from the top to the bottom it's kind of

08:07.180 --> 08:09.190
a flow of consciousness.

08:09.190 --> 08:10.950
Honestly that's a bad way of doing it.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.990
But guys you can pick whatever organizational structure you can.

08:13.990 --> 08:18.220
I'm more scatterbrained and this is just typically how I think everyone I work with hates it when I

08:18.220 --> 08:19.910
do this but whatever.

08:19.960 --> 08:34.180
I'm the boss so I'd say within last screen show icon for happy hours to qualify.

08:35.620 --> 08:39.120
Here's a call within two miles.

08:39.290 --> 08:46.940
OK now notice something in that last function what I wrote out was I said first of all we have to now

08:46.940 --> 08:48.950
have described that we have an icon.

08:48.950 --> 08:53.080
Second of all I said IIS or qualify now qualify.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.820
Implies that there's some kind of algorithm that's going to determine what qualifies and what doesn't.

08:58.820 --> 09:05.100
Now when you go and you get this developed you're going to have to define what does qualify mean.

09:05.210 --> 09:09.190
OK in this course we're not doing that recruiting a prototype and that's not something you're going

09:09.190 --> 09:12.950
to able to simulate because you need back and functionality to do that.

09:12.950 --> 09:17.160
At that point it's not a prototype you are you are creating the application itself.

09:17.270 --> 09:22.760
But keep in mind every time you use vague words like this you are implying more information.

09:22.760 --> 09:27.950
If you leave those out a developer or even a designer will come back and say OK what's the qualification

09:27.950 --> 09:30.320
criteria within 2 miles.

09:30.330 --> 09:34.130
Again now that's something that I mentioned two miles.

09:34.130 --> 09:35.690
It should probably be the case.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.140
You can change that.

09:37.340 --> 09:45.170
Now that implies that I should have the function that within that user should be able to determine what

09:45.170 --> 09:51.050
the radius or the diameter around them should be when it comes to looking for happy hours because what

09:51.050 --> 09:52.140
happens if someone opens it up.

09:52.130 --> 09:54.670
They don't do anything they like so they should be able to change that.

09:54.770 --> 10:06.810
So on map screen be able to change radius of search display

10:10.540 --> 10:15.550
and then well it was all described roughly what I think the button should look down dropdown button.

10:15.910 --> 10:19.050
You could do a radio button that takes up a lot more space.

10:19.090 --> 10:22.230
You could do an input text button.

10:22.240 --> 10:27.370
That's a disaster because if you do text or you ask them to type in a number you're just going to get

10:27.370 --> 10:31.440
so many people there and to type in letters or try to search through it or whatever.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.810
Keep it as simple as possible.

10:33.820 --> 10:39.790
Also remember users they like to be they like you to hold your hand hold their hand through the entire

10:39.790 --> 10:40.640
process.

10:40.660 --> 10:43.180
You need to just show them this is what you need to do.

10:43.180 --> 10:44.740
Don't give them so many options.

10:44.740 --> 10:46.560
They have the possibility of getting it wrong.

10:46.750 --> 10:47.100
OK.

10:47.110 --> 10:52.790
So then after all some will say is click.

10:53.220 --> 11:01.060
Icon will display a page about the business.

11:01.300 --> 11:01.830
OK.

11:02.960 --> 11:03.230
OK.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.570
So that is pretty simple and pretty vague.

11:06.570 --> 11:10.390
Now when I say display a page about the business I've identified a new screen.

11:10.410 --> 11:17.370
Now what I'm going to have to do is go back and at least have to go and explain what exactly is going

11:17.370 --> 11:18.530
to be on the page right.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.670
You would never want to leave that just out there.

11:20.670 --> 11:21.450
What does that mean.

11:21.450 --> 11:23.330
There's so much information that could mean.

11:23.460 --> 11:33.130
So let's define that we'll just say business information page and we'll make this its own little subhead

11:33.130 --> 11:33.360
or

11:36.290 --> 11:36.550
OK.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.520
So on the business information page what do we want on here.

11:40.520 --> 11:46.430
I'm going to guess that we should have let's everybody likes cover photos Twitter likes to use cover

11:46.430 --> 11:46.850
photos.

11:46.850 --> 11:50.210
Now Facebook uses cover photos.

11:50.510 --> 11:54.890
Now if you follow other lecture we talk about comparable functions we talked a little bit about trying

11:54.890 --> 11:57.050
to find the thought leaders in your space.

11:57.050 --> 12:01.610
Ones that aren't necessarily comparable but the ones that are setting the design standards follow them

12:01.610 --> 12:04.480
because they have set that standard for a reason.

12:04.520 --> 12:09.440
Don't try to go out of your way to like try something quirky or totally different because it could very

12:09.440 --> 12:10.490
easily backfire on you.

12:10.490 --> 12:13.580
You might end up with an application that no one understands how to use.

12:13.580 --> 12:19.220
So what I could say is cover photo of business.

12:20.380 --> 12:21.810
This is getting a little bit more complicated.

12:21.810 --> 12:38.530
What I could say is a paw on clicking cover photo we see a photo of space pictures and then past that

12:38.560 --> 12:44.110
I want to know what are the happy hours.

12:44.110 --> 12:52.960
And then we could say store phone number or so location number

12:59.110 --> 13:00.580
and then pass that is honestly.

13:00.630 --> 13:03.350
Anything that you could possibly want.

13:03.520 --> 13:08.710
We could come up with a crazy function with a button that says text me the information and then all

13:08.720 --> 13:12.640
you could do is click the button and it could text you the information.

13:12.640 --> 13:16.060
That's one thing you can do I'm not sure if that's entirely useful.

13:16.060 --> 13:21.580
Again I like to start really small and then add features as you get feedback from users.

13:21.790 --> 13:26.230
But for the purposes of this it's easier if I actually design out some actual complexity to it so I

13:26.230 --> 13:35.850
could say again remember we want to list our happy hour prices list happy hour prices now.

13:35.860 --> 13:36.610
Be careful.

13:36.610 --> 13:42.400
I could say something like a button for bookmarking.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.320
Favorite place.

13:44.350 --> 13:44.780
OK.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.530
Now you might think that is innocuous.

13:46.540 --> 13:48.610
You might think that's something that's really helpful.

13:48.640 --> 13:52.360
It is helpful if you want to if you want to keep a list of all the favorite places you've been for happy

13:52.360 --> 13:52.750
hours.

13:52.960 --> 13:57.740
But keep in mind that means where is that.

13:57.740 --> 13:59.360
Where is that bookmarking to get saved.

13:59.380 --> 14:03.630
What's he going to save too if they're not creating user accounts how are they going to save a bookmark.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.350
You can't just save it on the application itself.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.200
That's something it's incredibly difficult to do.

14:09.700 --> 14:15.490
And it would have a lot of problems with it so I wouldn't actually drop this feature because I don't

14:15.490 --> 14:16.540
think that fits.

14:18.070 --> 14:21.010
Now I'm at this point maybe are stumped as to what to add.

14:21.010 --> 14:26.940
So let's go back to our strategy see if there's anything else that we might have left out.

14:27.040 --> 14:31.390
OK within five minutes oping the app be able to find a happy and close proximity check.

14:31.390 --> 14:33.610
I think that you could easily do this in five minutes.

14:33.610 --> 14:37.100
It depends on your loading times tell the price of the happy hours.

14:37.120 --> 14:42.720
Check your position of happy hours near me check see the deals are Demario.

14:42.740 --> 14:45.140
No I mean it's virtually the same thing.

14:45.370 --> 14:47.890
It's just going to have to have some kind of indication that it's tomorrow.

14:47.890 --> 15:02.100
So what we could say is if we'll say if user searched for tomorrow then display at the top that text

15:02.110 --> 15:03.410
tomorrow.

15:03.540 --> 15:04.870
So they don't forget what they're looking at.

15:04.870 --> 15:07.120
That would be a disaster if you could.

15:07.120 --> 15:11.140
Tomorrow they look at a page they're looking at it and they have no visual represent reminder of that

15:11.170 --> 15:12.190
it's for tomorrow.

15:12.250 --> 15:13.290
They end up going today.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.810
They're going to hate your application.

15:15.850 --> 15:19.330
OK so that's a very very basic and I like keeping it very very basic.

15:19.330 --> 15:23.430
You could go pages and pages and pages on this obviously.

15:23.440 --> 15:29.220
Now what I've been implying is that there's an administration panel and what that means is like where

15:29.220 --> 15:30.850
is all this information coming from.

15:30.940 --> 15:33.550
How am I putting all of these happy hours in.

15:33.550 --> 15:35.750
How does this system in take that information.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.160
Also Where am I getting the business photos.

15:38.160 --> 15:43.240
I'm creating a cow for the business itself and they're uploading their photos or am I doing it manually

15:43.240 --> 15:44.770
from my side.

15:44.770 --> 15:47.850
Keep in mind guys there's always two sides to this.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.180
Where is the information coming from.

15:50.260 --> 15:52.530
For the purposes of the application we're not going to do this.

15:52.540 --> 15:57.460
But if I wanted to build out the Administration panel and scope what I just literally do is take every

15:57.460 --> 16:01.930
function and think about what input variables are there where is this photo coming from.

16:01.930 --> 16:06.880
So if I wanted to know where the photo is coming from I'd have to say ability to

16:09.400 --> 16:24.960
ability to create new businesses ability to add photos to new businesses Innes's etc. etc. and I would

16:24.960 --> 16:27.030
just go through all the information I had before.

16:27.060 --> 16:32.940
We're not going to do this in this course just because you get the point but you understand that you're

16:32.940 --> 16:37.110
going to run into a wall if you get all the way through your prototype and you're not aware of the fact

16:37.110 --> 16:39.200
that you have to build an Administration panel.

16:39.210 --> 16:45.210
Prototyping is mainly to get user feedback to pitch clients to pitch investors to show your friends

16:45.600 --> 16:50.460
so you don't really need to build an Administration panel no one needs to know how you pull the strings

16:50.460 --> 16:51.780
in the back.

16:51.780 --> 16:57.750
We call this the Wizard of Oz experiment remember the Wizard of Oz.

16:58.110 --> 17:05.250
The actual wizard at the very end used levers and mechanisms to create effects that made him look like

17:05.250 --> 17:06.730
he was magical.

17:06.750 --> 17:11.250
They don't need to know how you're doing it you don't need to pull the curtain back prototyping again

17:11.430 --> 17:16.300
just to convey exactly what you're doing and be able to get better at communicating your idea.

17:16.410 --> 17:21.420
So we can skip that but when you do get to the point where you're building this do not forget to put

17:21.420 --> 17:27.510
that stuff back in when you go to a developer you're going to have to have every single function not

17:27.510 --> 17:29.690
just the consumer facing functions.

17:29.720 --> 17:34.900
OK so the other sections of this were actually the cover in video structure.

17:34.950 --> 17:39.030
We're going to do a video and I'm going to show you how you can cover your structure very quickly using

17:39.030 --> 17:45.690
a scratch pad and using some of the pre-made design templates that I'm uploading onto this course.

17:45.870 --> 17:51.600
Skeleton we're going to do that in Pido go and balsamic so I can show you how those two are different

17:51.660 --> 17:55.550
and how to get up and running very quickly and then surface again.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.690
That's not something we're going to cover in this course.

17:57.690 --> 18:02.460
It will be a follow up course but we will cover prototyping and we'll just use Design assets that we

18:02.460 --> 18:03.460
have going forward.

18:03.660 --> 18:07.770
Okay guys if you have any questions post in the group discussion if you think I skipped over anything

18:07.770 --> 18:11.340
you think I missed anything you'd like to see in here or want me to clarify anything.

18:11.460 --> 18:20.850
Just let me know otherwise we'll see in the next lecture.
