It thought I'd talk really quickly about something that a lot of you guys have been mentioning which

00:10.650 --> 00:13.740
is what do I do at this stage in the process.

00:13.740 --> 00:19.320
If there's something in my application I forgot to tell the freelancer to do.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.560
First off don't fret about it.

00:20.560 --> 00:21.300
It's not a big deal.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.780
A lot of developers expect this to happen.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.430
If they're a good developer they should know that you're going to forget things.

00:27.480 --> 00:33.690
I do it all the time still to this day and I have a professional process by which I and other people

00:33.690 --> 00:39.760
go through and develop the specifications and what you should do if that is the case to rectify this

00:39.790 --> 00:40.350
issue.

00:40.380 --> 00:46.870
One look at the contract in the agreement that you had with them if you're on a per hour basis it's

00:46.870 --> 00:50.950
really simple you say hey I screwed up this is something I'd like to add and they're just going to charge

00:50.950 --> 00:52.750
you for the amount of time that it takes.

00:52.750 --> 00:56.820
So that works perfectly but if it's a fixed price what you need to do is look back at your specifications

00:56.820 --> 01:00.560
in your contract and see whether or not it actually does include it.

01:00.610 --> 01:05.740
And then if it doesn't explicitly include it look to see if it implies that there are a lot of times

01:05.740 --> 01:11.320
that you'll forget to say all this simply because you didn't think that they would need that instruction.

01:11.320 --> 01:15.850
For instance you might think that you don't need to explicitly tell them that you need intermediary

01:15.850 --> 01:20.590
screens like you don't need a screen that pops up and says error or when something goes wrong they might

01:20.590 --> 01:25.330
just have standard text at the top or they might not display anything because they're following the

01:25.330 --> 01:26.770
instructions to the T.

01:26.890 --> 01:29.210
If that's the case look to see if it's implied.

01:29.230 --> 01:34.990
Most developers that you tell them that this was implied or they should have known that the product

01:34.990 --> 01:37.990
wouldn't be good if they didn't do this we'll do that.

01:38.170 --> 01:44.350
And if they don't then unfortunately you just need to negotiate out a additional payment try to keep

01:44.350 --> 01:49.800
it low try to obviously say that like you know it's both your fault that's not a big deal that's the

01:49.800 --> 01:52.610
worst case scenario and you still just have to pay a little bit extra money.

01:52.620 --> 01:57.510
But if your contract did cover at your specifications and then you great if it didn't allow you to pay

01:57.510 --> 01:58.260
a little bit extra.
