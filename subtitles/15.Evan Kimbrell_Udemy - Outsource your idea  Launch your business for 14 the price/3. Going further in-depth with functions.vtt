WEBVTT

00:05.770 --> 00:12.960
So now we've gotten to the point where we've created as many functions as we had in the job posting.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.850
Now if you're looking at this and you think this is complete Oh it is not complete in the slightest.

00:18.850 --> 00:21.210
There's a lot of things you need to ask yourself.

00:21.250 --> 00:27.420
So really basic questions that a lot of people miss are how does someone log out.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.350
Can they log out.

00:32.660 --> 00:34.610
That's something that people always seem to forget about.

00:34.610 --> 00:38.120
You have to have some kind of power management.

00:38.120 --> 00:42.740
So for instance what happens if a user forgets their password.

00:42.740 --> 00:48.320
Since we're using Facebook logon for this example that's not a great example because everyone knows

00:48.320 --> 00:49.210
their password.

00:49.340 --> 00:53.450
But if you are using e-mail logons How do you reset your e-mail.

00:53.840 --> 00:58.280
What if they forget their email or password.

00:58.280 --> 01:02.360
A lot of people also forget when they say log in with e-mail address.

01:02.360 --> 01:09.010
OK that's nice but at the same time you have to then say they have to have a registration screen.

01:09.020 --> 01:10.370
How do they register.

01:10.610 --> 01:13.420
And on the registration screen what's on it.

01:13.430 --> 01:16.960
I mean do we have a caption that makes sure that they're not a robot.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.870
Do we have in-depth information about them.

01:20.870 --> 01:24.080
Do we ask their birth date do we to validate their birthday.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.820
Do we need to validate their e-mail address.

01:25.820 --> 01:30.690
Do we need to send them one of those e-mails to verify that this is in fact their e-mail address.

01:30.860 --> 01:33.560
These are all things that you need to think of.

01:33.590 --> 01:38.630
And since we are all so used to using the Internet and using applications to do things we don't think

01:38.630 --> 01:39.780
about very often.

01:39.920 --> 01:43.780
But these are things that you just keep in mind to make sure that you're not missing.

01:43.880 --> 01:49.260
This one is one of the most common that I always see people forget and we get estimates here at Sprint.

01:49.550 --> 01:52.160
I would say 90 percent of people forget this.

01:52.190 --> 02:03.230
What do you as an administrator need to be able to do with the app app information.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.650
Now what do I mean by that.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.290
You have users.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.960
How do you handle these users.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.440
How do you know how many users you have.

02:11.510 --> 02:17.190
How do you delete users that are being abusive or spamming your system.

02:17.240 --> 02:23.360
How do you fix errors that if there's an error that pops up in your application.

02:23.360 --> 02:29.630
These are all things that you should consider and consider ways of not only remedying them but you also

02:29.630 --> 02:35.780
need to think of all of the things as you as a business manager might need to do or might need to fix

02:36.050 --> 02:37.790
or might need to accommodate.

02:38.060 --> 02:45.970
Now this is what I'm referring to when I say what's an admin panel what goes on my admin panel the admin

02:46.010 --> 02:53.600
panel is typically the page that the site owner or the app owner will go to to not only check the health

02:53.600 --> 03:02.480
of their application but to do basic tasks delete users change information for users update users be

03:02.480 --> 03:07.910
able to monitor how many messages they're going through how many matches have been made.

03:07.910 --> 03:13.960
These are all internal statistics for you as a business owner or product manager.

03:13.970 --> 03:15.570
So I would summarize it as.

03:15.590 --> 03:21.650
What do you as the manager need to be able to do.

03:23.490 --> 03:30.010
Now keep in mind having an Administration panel adds a lot of kind of heft to the estimate.

03:30.010 --> 03:34.840
So if you need something really simple make sure that is really simple but it's just really important

03:34.840 --> 03:40.720
that you do think about what you need and you make sure that you're not accidentally leaving something

03:40.750 --> 03:41.420
out.

03:41.710 --> 03:46.750
So if you're still kind of wondering what exactly an Administration panel is if you guys have ever used

03:46.750 --> 03:54.550
WordPress when you log into WordPress to create pages or add images or change information that's an

03:54.550 --> 03:55.640
Administration panel.

03:55.680 --> 03:55.890
OK.

03:55.900 --> 04:01.090
And so now we've been reminded about the Administration panel we might want to add that as a function

04:01.360 --> 04:09.390
so be able to see total number of users in the system.

04:10.540 --> 04:16.680
Able to reach users so well keep that simple that's relatively simple.

04:16.870 --> 04:23.620
You could even go so far as to say need to have password or authentication in order to log in to my

04:23.650 --> 04:27.910
Administration panel because you don't want people accidentally accessing it and then screwing with

04:27.910 --> 04:28.480
your system.

04:28.480 --> 04:32.720
But you want to keep it simple just keep it simple OK.

04:32.740 --> 04:33.770
Now what.

04:33.790 --> 04:35.310
Now we need to think about this.

04:35.560 --> 04:39.710
Now that I'm someone who's in this application I put in all my information.

04:39.790 --> 04:44.500
OK so now I see four to five matches per day I'm logged in the application.

04:44.500 --> 04:49.810
Now what we need to make sure that we're not forgetting about all the functions that happen after that

04:49.810 --> 04:50.350
fact.

04:50.410 --> 04:53.180
How do I message them how do I view them.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.290
Do they have a profile page.

04:55.300 --> 04:56.020
I really don't.

04:56.200 --> 04:56.800
I don't know.

04:56.800 --> 05:03.520
So it's up to you to kind of determine what exactly would that happen after this point I could say clicking

05:03.550 --> 05:12.380
on a user shows me a page of page displaying there.

05:12.520 --> 05:20.880
She say their questionnaire answers questionnaire answers and their photo.

05:21.120 --> 05:21.900
OK.

05:22.290 --> 05:23.820
Now here's one thing with photos.

05:23.820 --> 05:26.100
How do you view the photos it literally just on your screen.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.470
What happens to be clicked the photo.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.160
Can I see a zoomed in version.

05:29.310 --> 05:40.400
Ok that might be logical I think that clicking on profile photo will zoom in and display it.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.340
Display it.

05:43.470 --> 05:44.740
It's a light box.

05:44.780 --> 05:45.200
OK.

05:45.340 --> 05:49.970
If you're not familiar with the light boxes or light boxes when you're looking at an image it displays

05:49.970 --> 05:55.460
the image from the forefront above the page of the app or whatever you're using and then it fades out

05:55.460 --> 05:56.640
the background.

05:56.660 --> 06:01.130
That's what a lightbox is it kind of is like that theater view that you have in YouTube.

06:02.170 --> 06:02.560
OK.

06:02.600 --> 06:10.310
So now we probably need to include something along the lines of messaging something along the lines

06:10.310 --> 06:16.220
of something to entice them to message the other person and we could say something like answers to each

06:16.220 --> 06:17.550
question.

06:18.360 --> 06:23.990
Have plus or minus icons next to them.

06:24.310 --> 06:35.570
These icons late to whether or not that user's preferences are similar.

06:35.580 --> 06:38.350
Now you might need to be able to define this a little bit more.

06:38.360 --> 06:44.410
A good developer will read this and ask you specifically do I get a plus if it's an 8 and an 8.

06:44.410 --> 06:46.620
Or do I get a plus if it's a 6 and an 8.

06:46.620 --> 06:47.430
How does that work.

06:47.430 --> 06:49.220
What are the boundaries.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.660
You could easily display.

06:51.660 --> 06:52.590
Explain that.

06:52.590 --> 06:56.670
I don't really need to get into it but make sure that you do at least give a sentence about it say maybe

06:56.970 --> 07:02.300
as long as their answer is within three plus or minus you get a positive if that's not it's a minus.

07:02.320 --> 07:07.320
OK then last thing we want to do is be able to message the person and let's just be lazy we'll just

07:07.320 --> 07:16.310
say clicking the message is the same always and and

07:20.340 --> 07:22.820
OK so here's what's going to happen.

07:22.830 --> 07:27.190
It's a little sketchy but I'm just making this up as we go so well as you say there's a message button

07:27.190 --> 07:30.920
on the person's profile if they like them they want to contact a message.

07:31.020 --> 07:33.310
It populates a text message in a pre-filled message.

07:33.330 --> 07:39.550
And that message is always going to be the same except that it's going to use the original user's name

07:39.550 --> 07:45.550
so it'll say David was viewing your profile and is interested or David says hi or something along those

07:45.550 --> 07:46.080
lines.

07:46.210 --> 07:49.230
You would probably want to specify those out.

07:49.750 --> 07:55.600
Now here I might own as display something like the phone number never displays.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.880
It's actually a randomized phone number.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.830
And here's my essay that I want to use as a tool to handle this.

08:01.840 --> 08:06.670
There's a lot of different things you can say but the point is that you want to list off as much as

08:06.670 --> 08:08.750
you possibly can.

08:09.340 --> 08:15.940
OK so we've just on the first go with this I just kind of went through the user and I tried to just

08:15.940 --> 08:21.250
list off everything I could think of that they'd run into as they went through it's a very simple application.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.800
There's some things that I always see that I've left off right.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.300
Uploading a profile photo.

08:25.300 --> 08:29.160
How does that work exactly when I upload a profile photo does it resize it.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.060
Do they have to cross the photo.

08:31.150 --> 08:32.260
Where do they get the photo from.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.820
Can they pull the photo from the Internet.

08:33.820 --> 08:35.950
Can they pull it off their phone.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.530
Can they get it from their Facebook.

08:37.530 --> 08:40.180
There's a lot of different ways you can do that.

08:40.180 --> 08:44.200
Never underestimate the power of details.

08:44.420 --> 08:50.020
Never get to a point where you think OK I've completely left everything out because there's always something

08:50.080 --> 08:51.630
you might have left out.

08:52.010 --> 08:57.460
OK so this is a pretty good example of what your function sheet should look like if you guys have any

08:57.460 --> 09:01.190
trouble writing this function section or the scope section.

09:01.240 --> 09:05.320
Just let me know and send me a message or put it in the group discussion.

09:05.470 --> 09:07.450
Longer is better.

09:07.900 --> 09:12.550
And I think also though as you start writing this out you might realize that a lot of these you don't

09:12.550 --> 09:17.650
actually need it so it's always good to go back and do some cleaning and get rid of the things you think

09:17.650 --> 09:20.240
are superfluous and might just jack up the price.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.340
So focus on being as comprehensive as possible.

09:23.340 --> 09:27.540
Don't forget basic mistakes like how do you log in log out.

09:27.550 --> 09:30.280
How do I access basic information about myself.

09:30.340 --> 09:34.150
You know things like do have a Terms of Agreement and a privacy policy.

09:34.150 --> 09:36.880
How do they contact an administrator if there's a problem.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.520
How do they contact me.

09:38.580 --> 09:40.530
Does that link to my Web site.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.660
Do I have an administration panel.

09:42.670 --> 09:45.890
What happens if they forget their e-mail in their password.

09:45.910 --> 09:48.740
What exactly do I need to control.

09:48.790 --> 09:51.960
How do I handle images things like that.

09:51.970 --> 09:57.940
There are a lot of things that are very mundane that you just might run into that you just never thought

09:57.940 --> 09:58.140
of.

09:58.150 --> 10:03.430
And I always do suggest opening up an application someone else's application and going through it and

10:03.430 --> 10:06.640
just taking a mental note of everything that you run into.

10:06.670 --> 10:10.200
There's a lot of these things that fade into the background like intermediate screens.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.530
Do we have loading screens.

10:11.530 --> 10:15.300
Do we have explanation screens have welcome screens things like that.

10:15.790 --> 10:20.710
OK guys like I said if you need help with any of this stuff post just post in the group discussion.

10:20.770 --> 10:22.900
Now we're going to move onto the pages section.
