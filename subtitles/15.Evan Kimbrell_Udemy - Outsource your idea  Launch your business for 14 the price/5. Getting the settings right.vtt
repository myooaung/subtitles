00:05.640 --> 00:06.020
Hey guys.

00:06.020 --> 00:10.620
Welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to go over all of those settings that are

00:10.620 --> 00:16.410
included in your job posting category skills duration.

00:16.410 --> 00:20.520
All of those different little toggles that you can put which ones are important.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.100
Which ones are not.

00:22.140 --> 00:26.760
You'd be surprised some of these make a huge difference on how successful your projects going to be

00:26.760 --> 00:29.030
and some of them are just not a big deal.

00:29.040 --> 00:34.230
We're going to cover each individual one and talk about what you need to do depending on what you're

00:34.230 --> 00:37.410
trying to accomplish but in general what are the best practices.

00:37.410 --> 00:39.260
So let's go to screencast.

00:39.300 --> 00:39.540
All right.

00:39.540 --> 00:44.120
Let's talk about the details that are attached to your postings.

00:44.130 --> 00:47.930
So you're in L.A. It's going to ask you a category of work.

00:48.020 --> 00:50.900
Can I ask you for a specific set of skills or groups.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.250
I'm going to ask you if you'd like hourly or fixed rate.

00:53.250 --> 00:56.580
How many hours do you think they're going to be working and then it's gas.

00:56.610 --> 01:02.880
Things like Job visibility location preferences when it's going to start and how long you want the post

01:02.880 --> 01:05.600
to be posted for now on freelancer.

01:05.720 --> 01:12.470
They're a little bit simpler they just ask for your budget fixed price per hour or then they'll going

01:12.470 --> 01:17.040
to ask you if you want to pay them extra money for a variety of services and we're going to cover all

01:17.040 --> 01:25.060
of these and then on up work which is oDesk remember they asked very similar things they ask again for

01:25.060 --> 01:29.620
a category subcategory skills a fixed price per hour.

01:29.620 --> 01:34.540
They ask you for your budget they'll ask you again job visibility and how many freelancers you want

01:34.540 --> 01:39.530
and then they have things called preferred qualifications cover letter and screening questions.

01:39.580 --> 01:42.090
Now in the next lecture we're going to go over screening questions.

01:42.220 --> 01:48.610
I'm going to skip over that but I'm going to show you these are very very important things in your posting.

01:48.640 --> 01:55.120
They can really determine the batch of bids that you get if you get good details and you do them correctly.

01:55.120 --> 02:00.190
You're going to have a much better group of kids you might get fewer beds but they're going to be much

02:00.190 --> 02:01.680
higher quality.

02:01.690 --> 02:07.660
We really want to focus on getting rid of all of those junk beds that just take up time from you having

02:07.660 --> 02:11.730
to read them and having to determine that they're not very good.

02:11.770 --> 02:18.520
So I start with Lance Lance is pretty simple when you ask for a category of work they break it down

02:18.520 --> 02:26.320
into a really a very imprecise group if you're going to be doing programming or anything to do with

02:26.320 --> 02:33.670
web sites anything to do with applications anything to do with desktop applications or really anything

02:33.670 --> 02:35.550
it's going to be under I.T. programming.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.490
And then you get to select a section now.

02:37.600 --> 02:44.650
Sections are important because this is how people find it when they're searching for browse by jobs.

02:44.650 --> 02:49.660
It's a criteria they can select and then pick their area.

02:49.660 --> 02:56.930
Occasionally you'll find things that overlap database development database administration.

02:57.190 --> 03:02.530
Typically the best thing to do is to just google what these words mean and that can help you quite a

03:02.530 --> 03:06.170
bit to determine what exactly it should go in.

03:06.220 --> 03:10.240
It's not the end of the world if you get one of these wrong because you're actually going to be getting

03:10.240 --> 03:17.130
the majority of your freelancers or your contractors from this skill groups and I'll explain why.

03:17.370 --> 03:21.910
Now in every single one they're going to ask you for specific skills or groups.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.570
I've never actually used the group's function.

03:23.560 --> 03:29.860
I always do skills when asked for skills you need to think about your project and what specifically

03:29.860 --> 03:32.560
someone should need to know to be good at it.

03:32.740 --> 03:37.150
But then you're also going to think about things that might be adjacent only related because a lot of

03:37.150 --> 03:42.190
times you might just not be able to find exactly the skills that you want.

03:42.270 --> 03:47.400
What happens is when someone say let's say you know we'll just grab one AB testing.

03:47.410 --> 03:54.520
Let's say that someone has a profile on elance and they have selected that they're good at AB testing.

03:54.520 --> 04:00.580
So when I make this project it's actually going to end up displaying on their personalized page when

04:00.580 --> 04:01.450
they log in.

04:01.450 --> 04:05.190
Sometimes it even messages them if they have the exact skill set.

04:05.410 --> 04:08.630
So Lance has done the majority of the work for you.

04:08.650 --> 04:12.790
They're going to go out and look for people specifically with that skill set and they're going to get

04:12.790 --> 04:15.670
alerted to your job postings.

04:15.670 --> 04:18.480
So this is the most important thing.

04:18.490 --> 04:24.270
Honestly don't spend more than a minute trying to figure out what you should be and usually it's obvious

04:24.310 --> 04:25.620
but sometimes it's not.

04:25.660 --> 04:31.570
It can get a little more complicated when you're doing something like appear you have design and they

04:31.570 --> 04:33.350
kind of lost a lot of things into it.

04:33.370 --> 04:38.740
Like what do you do if you want someone to do your logo and your banner ad or a brochure and a banner

04:38.830 --> 04:45.340
ad typically you just pick one or the other it doesn't really matter and then focus on including both

04:45.340 --> 04:49.000
those skill sets when you select skills.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.980
But yeah it can get a little complicated especially when you do things like sales and marketing.

04:53.980 --> 04:59.050
A lot of these things to be honest some of them I'm not totally sure what the difference is but I'm

04:59.050 --> 05:03.250
telling you right now it doesn't really matter if you get it exactly right.

05:03.250 --> 05:08.740
Just try to get one of the categories that scrape edges with what you're trying to do because typically

05:08.740 --> 05:15.070
someone who is looking and you know a in a category is going to have skills that are related to an adjacent

05:15.070 --> 05:16.340
category.

05:16.480 --> 05:22.210
If someone's looking at email marketing they probably also have skills in e-mails and e-mail like bulk

05:22.210 --> 05:27.370
sending or say skills in writing e-mails or things like that.

05:27.430 --> 05:30.040
So you really can't go wrong.

05:30.130 --> 05:35.090
So for the project up above I'm just going to try to make this.

05:35.260 --> 05:37.700
We'll try to set the skills for what was.

05:37.750 --> 05:38.880
You know I did before.

05:38.930 --> 05:44.560
So what I usually do is just go for the obvious one which is there's an iOS application so you can always

05:44.560 --> 05:45.740
just type in Iowa.

05:48.190 --> 05:53.370
And then here we go we have iOS 5 6 7 iOS development iOS jailbreaking.

05:53.370 --> 05:58.150
Now Iowa currently is in iOS 8.

05:58.210 --> 06:01.690
They just haven't updated this to say iOS 8.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.350
Why do they have five six seven.

06:04.420 --> 06:10.390
Because a lot of times what'll happen is Apple update and have a new iOS but not every single person

06:10.390 --> 06:16.330
has learned the new S and Tri-Cities of the new operating system or the new tools and so someone might

06:16.330 --> 06:23.740
list iOS 6 and not list iOS 7 because they have not yet figured out how to deal with a flat design or

06:23.740 --> 06:26.230
any of the new architecture changes.

06:26.230 --> 06:33.430
Typically what I will do in this case is I will pick the broad one because anyone who list 5 6 7 is

06:33.430 --> 06:36.540
going to be listed in iOS development also.

06:36.580 --> 06:37.580
Not particularly.

06:37.590 --> 06:41.400
I don't care if someone bids and they only have iOS 5 listed.

06:41.410 --> 06:43.480
Chances are they can figure it out.

06:43.660 --> 06:48.970
I'm not really it's not worth trying to whittle it down even farther than that so I would just say iOS

06:48.970 --> 06:55.030
development and then typically what I like to do is pick the most recent one because what that will

06:55.030 --> 07:00.400
do is increase the match for someone who isn't iOS developer because chances are they have both of these

07:00.400 --> 07:01.670
listed.

07:01.840 --> 07:07.420
I would not list Iris jailbreaking because that is specific to a technique you use to jailbreak.

07:07.420 --> 07:10.630
The phone has nothing to do with creating applications.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.070
OK so then what would I do past that.

07:13.090 --> 07:14.500
Well here is it.

07:14.500 --> 07:19.520
Now I have kind of almost exhausted my list because that's exactly what I was looking for.

07:19.810 --> 07:25.480
What I might do now is I might look for specific skills or frameworks that I'd like to include.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.490
Remember how we mentioned SML tools.

07:27.640 --> 07:28.650
So I said Twilley.

07:28.670 --> 07:33.280
So let's try to do Twilio this might save me some time right because someone might actually know how

07:33.280 --> 07:34.350
to use that theory.

07:34.750 --> 07:41.140
I can add that now that was a specific skill that I included adding details like small things that might

07:41.140 --> 07:46.800
be involved in it and they don't have to match every single skill set in order to apply.

07:46.810 --> 07:51.190
Now that you've exhausted pretty much everything you would have.

07:51.610 --> 07:54.670
Now you can look for things that are adjacent but not related.

07:54.670 --> 08:00.820
And obviously what I like to do is I'll just look for like mobile development and it'll give me something

08:00.820 --> 08:04.680
very generic so like mobile development framework.

08:04.690 --> 08:12.320
You know someone who is skilled in mobile development frameworks probably might have skills in Iowa.

08:12.370 --> 08:14.330
So I might pick that.

08:14.500 --> 08:20.090
Really I'm just trying to get the audience of that group because I'm looking to make an op iOS app I'm

08:20.120 --> 08:21.450
looking for mobile developers.

08:21.450 --> 08:25.850
I'm looking for anything that that group is likely to have to get their attention.

08:25.900 --> 08:29.710
Now it's up to you whether or not you want to list out other things like android.

08:29.710 --> 08:34.930
This might be confusing to someone if he says iOS app and they get a list as Android.

08:34.930 --> 08:40.690
They might think that oh maybe down the line you want to make an Android app a lot a lot a lot of times

08:40.690 --> 08:45.160
people make Android apps but they do not make iOS ups or the other way around.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.980
I usually say no don't do that.

08:48.010 --> 08:54.700
So really I think it's always best your best case scenario is you max out however many options you have.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.600
Right now I have five.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.480
I now have four and I need to get to five.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.080
There is no advantage to putting fewer than 5.

09:02.080 --> 09:07.090
So you should always pick something and if you're really stretching for something just try to get something

09:07.480 --> 09:10.640
roughly in the same general area.

09:10.750 --> 09:15.540
So maybe we could try AppStore AppStore optimization App Store.

09:15.570 --> 09:18.910
Again this might be something that might be on their profile.

09:18.910 --> 09:25.120
We could try to make something really really vague or your just a mobile just to see what shows up.

09:25.120 --> 09:29.860
So we have J queery mobile mobile app testing development framework here.

09:29.860 --> 09:36.400
And here's a perfect world mobile programming super vague that would fit who anyone who wants to work

09:36.400 --> 09:39.380
on this it could fit a lot of other people as well.

09:39.400 --> 09:44.020
Generally vague ones are helpful or helpful to have a couple of vague skills because that's going to

09:44.020 --> 09:45.520
broaden the group that you get.

09:45.700 --> 09:51.730
Broaden the group that sees this but then get other specific one so that you don't have people applying

09:51.730 --> 09:53.680
when they don't even have the right skill sets.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.690
They like a Windows developer or something like that.

09:56.770 --> 10:02.690
Now setting your work arrangement it's really just going to ask for a fixed price or for an hourly.

10:02.740 --> 10:05.240
Now this is up to you if you wanted to work hourly.

10:05.250 --> 10:09.550
You could put hourly in if you wanted to work fixed rate you put fixed rate have a separate lecture

10:09.550 --> 10:14.800
in this course specifically talking about these two because there is a lot more that goes into this

10:14.800 --> 10:18.660
determining what you want to pay how you want to pay them what you want to pay them.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.310
That's really deserves a lecture in and of itself.

10:21.310 --> 10:24.190
So if you want to know how to do this one correctly.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.980
Go and find that lecture.

10:25.990 --> 10:29.330
It's just about whether or not you pay someone time and materials.

10:29.380 --> 10:34.150
Also known as hourly or whether or not you use fixed price and if you do use fixed price how do you

10:34.150 --> 10:35.740
do that correctly.

10:35.770 --> 10:43.270
So if I was not specific as to what I wanted what I would typically do is I would pick a fixed price

10:43.330 --> 10:48.730
and this is something that's very specific to Elance you go decide later.

10:48.750 --> 10:49.510
There you go.

10:49.860 --> 10:55.830
OK so what that basically means is that's the non-commitment decide later means that when someone sees

10:55.830 --> 11:01.920
your profile or job posting they're not going to see what your budget is.

11:01.920 --> 11:07.020
Anyone who's worked with the app development studio and were guilty of this as well knows that you should

11:07.020 --> 11:10.130
never tell them your budget immediately.

11:10.290 --> 11:17.940
If someone knows your budget automatically It's amazing how the quotation that you're getting or the

11:17.980 --> 11:21.820
estimate you're getting starts to fit that budget regardless of what it is.

11:21.930 --> 11:25.550
You'll find that this is a very it's very US centric but in.

11:25.740 --> 11:28.740
I save between 500 and a thousand dollars from my budget.

11:28.830 --> 11:36.060
It will physically block people from bidding below dollars and block them from bidding over a above

11:36.060 --> 11:37.160
a thousand.

11:37.170 --> 11:39.760
Why would you not want that to happen.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.860
What if you post something that actually costs $2000.

11:43.860 --> 11:45.910
Everybody knows it.

11:46.080 --> 11:50.010
What's ended up happening is that people are serious just aren't going to bid because they can't bid

11:50.010 --> 11:56.400
the correct amount and other people are going to just assume that somehow it has to be in this range

11:56.700 --> 12:01.650
so they bid in the range and you just end up having problems later because they feel like they're underpaid

12:01.910 --> 12:04.650
or they feel like the estimate was just faulty.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.880
So you're setting yourself up for failure pretty much right at the get go.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.660
Never poder range.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.350
It's not worth it.

12:12.420 --> 12:16.530
It limits who's going to look at it and limits who's going to bid it always just put decide later.

12:16.530 --> 12:18.930
Similarly you can do this with hourly as well.

12:18.930 --> 12:24.300
You can say hourly decide later what that's going to do is it's going to give you a broad range of people

12:24.300 --> 12:28.830
you'll get people in the United States bidding $60 an hour or a hundred dollars an hour and then you'll

12:28.830 --> 12:34.500
get people from India bidding $5 an hour then you can make a merit based judgment.

12:34.500 --> 12:39.420
The only time that I'd ever select one of these is if I specifically knew exactly what I was looking

12:39.420 --> 12:39.970
for.

12:40.020 --> 12:45.540
If I had experienced this and I knew the kind of like developer profile that I wanted.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.340
That's the only time that I'd ever do this personally.

12:47.510 --> 12:50.280
This is why I like to do fixed price decide later.

12:50.280 --> 12:54.570
In general if you want to leave the door open as much as possible you could say hourly decide later

12:54.580 --> 12:57.880
because typically people like hourly better.

12:58.140 --> 13:01.470
I always say I use the X price because it's simpler.

13:01.470 --> 13:04.620
If you do hourly you do you have to pick how many hours a week.

13:04.680 --> 13:10.500
But again they leave the door open just to say decide later so you can do that as well.

13:10.500 --> 13:14.400
One thing to keep in mind though is if you do say hourly someone comes and bids on it and you try to

13:14.400 --> 13:16.160
fix it change it to fix price.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.630
You might have a problem whereas the other way around.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.700
No one's ever going to complain.

13:21.480 --> 13:28.550
OK so quickly job posting visibility this is you know you always it's public or private.

13:28.550 --> 13:29.960
So if it's private.

13:29.960 --> 13:33.350
That just means you have to manually invite people to bid.

13:33.350 --> 13:35.210
There's really no advantage to doing that.

13:35.210 --> 13:40.700
You should take advantage of the freelancer profile the contractor profile that these platforms have.

13:40.730 --> 13:45.440
That's why we use these because they're going to get you tons and tons of attention and estimates if

13:45.440 --> 13:46.510
you do private.

13:46.550 --> 13:51.260
I understand what the point of this is you're just taking advantage of their posting software.

13:51.380 --> 13:55.030
And at that point you might as well just do a job posting so I do public.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.850
And this is the one thing that you might want aside turning this off.

13:57.860 --> 14:02.330
This means that will get indexed on Google and it gets index for quite a long time.

14:02.330 --> 14:08.300
So if you have sensitive information or you don't want someone to know that you're moving into a certain

14:08.300 --> 14:14.140
space or you're not you know you're launching in a certain area you might want to keep this off.

14:14.300 --> 14:19.290
Maybe if you're doing something that's a little sketchy You might want to turn it off as well.

14:20.850 --> 14:22.680
Preferred candidate location.

14:22.710 --> 14:26.970
This is very very faulty system.

14:26.970 --> 14:29.170
I personally can't stand this.

14:29.190 --> 14:34.980
It works better on plants than the other ones because what you can do is you can say country and I could

14:34.980 --> 14:35.960
just pick the country.

14:35.970 --> 14:41.550
Now you can literally go down to the city and state but what you'll find is that you just don't get

14:41.550 --> 14:47.370
very many bids like if I just said I only want people from Alabama or California.

14:47.370 --> 14:48.900
It's just going to be a waste of time.

14:48.900 --> 14:55.560
We're going to spend two weeks waiting for maybe a bid or two bids being really specific sounds great

14:55.590 --> 15:00.630
because maybe you want someone in person but it's just not really there's not a huge advantage to that.

15:00.630 --> 15:05.360
If you want to work with someone in person there are much better ways of doing this.

15:05.520 --> 15:10.820
That wouldn't be outsourcing then actually you're just working with the contractor in person.

15:10.830 --> 15:20.640
So one of the biggest problems that you have with the other systems is that they only have this option

15:20.960 --> 15:22.000
selector region.

15:22.020 --> 15:28.140
So you have to say like oh I want eastern Asia and North America what is wrong with that.

15:28.140 --> 15:33.030
Obviously I think you guys can figure this out pretty quickly if I say North America thinking Oh Canada

15:33.030 --> 15:35.560
and America United States.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.260
Well guess who else is in North America.

15:39.270 --> 15:44.930
Mexico you have the Caribbean you have Central American countries.

15:45.090 --> 15:45.860
Is that exact.

15:45.900 --> 15:49.150
Is that who you were thinking of when you thought North America.

15:49.330 --> 15:51.000
This just doesn't really make any sense.

15:51.000 --> 15:58.500
Like even if I say Southern Asia it doesn't really mean anything like you could quite literally be getting

15:58.500 --> 16:02.820
people from Vietnam and Thailand when you meant India.

16:03.600 --> 16:08.490
And same thing with Eastern Europe like Eastern Europe includes some areas that are actually quite expensive.

16:08.490 --> 16:10.790
Is Austria included in Eastern Europe.

16:11.020 --> 16:15.240
It's always kind of it's hard to make a call on this.

16:15.270 --> 16:20.790
The only thing I've ever seen be effective with this is if you just knew an area that worked well that

16:20.790 --> 16:24.990
fit within your price range and you knew your budget and your experience and you might say something

16:24.990 --> 16:28.480
like Eastern Europe that's the only thing I could think of.

16:28.480 --> 16:33.900
There's no reason why you'd ever like select these unless you for instance lived in Australia and you

16:33.900 --> 16:36.000
specifically wanted someone from Australia.

16:36.090 --> 16:40.590
But in that case you would just pick the country you wouldn't say Australia Oceana because then you

16:40.590 --> 16:47.650
might get someone from now Peru or you know Kiribati year know those random islands that are.

16:47.790 --> 16:50.040
I mean is Indonesia included in this.

16:50.040 --> 16:50.760
I don't even know.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.810
So if you're specific about the country pick the country.

16:53.820 --> 16:59.910
But this is always just a faulty kind of system and you'll see that the other ones post this job for

17:00.930 --> 17:02.190
Elance.

17:02.430 --> 17:08.520
I typically will post them longer than the other ones but there's really no point in listing this past

17:08.520 --> 17:16.200
15 days unless you have absolutely no hurry to hire someone what will happen is you say you post this

17:16.200 --> 17:22.230
for 15 days or seven days or so say seven days within one day you're going to get 80 percent of your

17:22.230 --> 17:28.460
bids and then you're going to get a trickle over the next couple weeks because if I'm someone who's

17:28.470 --> 17:34.740
looking at a project and it's been up for a week already and there's already 32 bids What is the point

17:34.740 --> 17:36.560
of me bidding on that.

17:36.570 --> 17:44.100
So it's a massive disincentive for people to come and bid on your project and that's why I don't really

17:44.100 --> 17:45.450
think there's a point in making it.

17:45.450 --> 17:49.400
List the list keeping the listing open for a really long period of time.

17:49.420 --> 17:57.120
There's not necessarily a negative to it but if you really wanted a long term kind of opportunity than

17:57.120 --> 18:04.200
maybe you'd put it something longer again there's really no point in making a huge long runway like

18:04.200 --> 18:04.470
this.

18:04.470 --> 18:09.660
There is an advantage to putting one day to day three day because people will see that they say oh it's

18:09.660 --> 18:11.250
a three day project I need to bid.

18:11.250 --> 18:15.070
Now if it's a 90 day project they're probably not going to.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.870
They'll say oh I'm in a bid later and just forget about it.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.910
OK proposed start date this is helpful.

18:21.920 --> 18:26.950
You do have a specific start date because certain freelancers look at that and go OK well if I get accepted

18:26.950 --> 18:30.590
for this job I need to get my other jobs done by this time.

18:30.650 --> 18:36.770
But you could just say start immediately after proposals selected and just tell people that OK so that

18:36.770 --> 18:41.640
is Elance put the most time and thought into either and because they are the best they're going to give

18:41.650 --> 18:44.620
you the most thoughtful bids.

18:44.990 --> 18:50.030
But a lot of the things you just cover transferred to the other ones so it's not you didn't have to

18:50.030 --> 18:58.250
do this over and over and over again.
