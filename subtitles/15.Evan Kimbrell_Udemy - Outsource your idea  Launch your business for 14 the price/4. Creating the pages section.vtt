00:06.180 --> 00:07.770
OK so let's talk about pages.

00:07.770 --> 00:12.640
Pages are one of the it's one of the sections that is definitely required.

00:12.660 --> 00:18.660
It's one of the sections that I in my experience it's much easier to handle when you've gone and done

00:18.660 --> 00:20.450
wireframe first.

00:20.880 --> 00:25.620
So again if this is something that you struggle with please do go to the end of the section and look

00:25.620 --> 00:27.930
at the wire framing section.

00:27.930 --> 00:33.710
You do not need to write your spec requirement your spec sheet first then the wireframe.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.690
You can always do it the other way around.

00:35.760 --> 00:40.230
That does end up helping quite a bit with this especially people who are not who are new to this but

00:40.230 --> 00:44.550
the whole idea behind pages is that we're going to list out every single page that we can think of in

00:44.550 --> 00:45.630
the application.

00:45.630 --> 00:47.730
There's a lot of room for error here.

00:47.820 --> 00:52.950
So if you forget about a page it's typically something that will come up during your first discussion

00:52.950 --> 00:58.610
with a developer or with a designer or whoever you're outsourcing or contracting with.

00:58.740 --> 01:01.010
So don't worry if you forget about something.

01:01.020 --> 01:04.840
But also at this point you know we've already written our section on scope.

01:04.980 --> 01:08.760
So there's a good chance that you'll catch most of it because of your get to a point where you're stuck.

01:08.760 --> 01:13.040
You can always just scroll up and see all the functions you listed before.

01:13.110 --> 01:16.950
Think about it and think about what page you would go on and a lot of times you'll run into a function

01:16.980 --> 01:19.230
that you actually haven't listed a page for.

01:19.230 --> 01:26.650
So the way that I always do it is just list it out by page name and then a description description honestly

01:26.670 --> 01:28.100
is just one or two sentences.

01:28.110 --> 01:32.850
We don't need to get into depth with it really all it is is that when a developer or someone giving

01:32.850 --> 01:39.240
you an estimate or is building off of this looks at it they can look and mentally see every single page

01:39.240 --> 01:44.230
that you have just to have a better idea of how big this application is.

01:44.340 --> 01:51.170
It helps them organize in their head and in their estimation what exactly is going to go into it.

01:51.180 --> 01:57.270
Now one thing that's important to note is that when you're doing an application functionality is one

01:57.270 --> 02:01.850
thing and it takes certain time to be able to say let someone log in or log out.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.060
But also there are multiple ways of handling that.

02:05.070 --> 02:08.960
Now you could have one page or they log in and it all happens on one page.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.210
You could have it on multiple pages.

02:11.280 --> 02:14.730
The more pages you have the more time it takes someone to build.

02:14.730 --> 02:20.430
So if you ever have the option of choosing fewer pages or more pages I usually decide to pick fewer

02:20.430 --> 02:21.380
pages.

02:21.390 --> 02:23.610
Now there's a there's obviously exceptions to this.

02:23.610 --> 02:29.070
You know if you have a user base that you want to kind of walk all along your process if it's someone

02:29.070 --> 02:35.550
that you if your users are people that you think need a little more hand-holding then more pages can

02:35.550 --> 02:36.580
be better.

02:36.660 --> 02:40.490
It's easier for them to fall that process but usually I say simpler is better.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.820
It's not going to balloon your suit or Balloon your application to have multiple pages for the same

02:44.820 --> 02:45.380
thing.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.360
But it does it end up shaving off a little at a time if you can reduce the page number.

02:50.370 --> 02:54.330
So again you only need to write one to two sentences describe each page name.

02:54.390 --> 02:57.050
It is just so that they know what you're referring to.

02:57.060 --> 03:01.020
We're not listing how we don't need to go and capture the functions and then list them the page it doesn't

03:01.020 --> 03:02.160
really matter.

03:02.160 --> 03:07.560
So here are some questions that I've written that help people fill this section out.

03:07.560 --> 03:12.840
And this is kind of made for people the people that we work with and what they always seem to forget.

03:13.230 --> 03:18.150
So I always suggest that when you do go and write your pages section come back to this lecture look

03:18.150 --> 03:22.920
at the questions ask yourself the questions and see if you fit any of these questions and if you're

03:22.920 --> 03:24.330
missing anything.

03:24.330 --> 03:29.010
So the first question is what is the first page the user sees and this is something that people frequently

03:29.010 --> 03:32.930
forget about in an app in a mobile application.

03:32.940 --> 03:36.470
It could be a landing page in a web site.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.830
It could also be its own landing page it could be like a pitch page.

03:40.830 --> 03:45.540
It could be that page that kind of introduces with the concept is it only has one button.

03:46.050 --> 03:48.500
So keep in mind what does what does it look like.

03:48.630 --> 03:51.210
Does it look like any other random web site.

03:51.210 --> 03:55.090
If that's the case then you don't necessarily need to make a separate page for the first page.

03:55.290 --> 04:01.370
But if it has a landing page aspect to it or a splash page make sure that you list that out OK.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.880
Do you have any Sign-Up pages.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.840
No it's something that people always kind of forget about.

04:04.920 --> 04:09.590
Not only do people have to log in if you have an account system but they also have to register.

04:09.810 --> 04:15.420
And in both those cases you need to have pages that handle say they log in and get their password wrong.

04:15.420 --> 04:18.800
That's a separate page if they need to register.

04:18.810 --> 04:24.570
That's a separate page even There's even a page that says no confirmation we use signed up please check

04:24.570 --> 04:26.690
your email for verification.

04:26.880 --> 04:32.340
So make sure that you're handling that because virtually every application is going to have this unless

04:32.340 --> 04:36.190
you're just building a Web site that's informational In that case you don't really have sign up pages.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.770
So can they edit their account.

04:37.770 --> 04:40.640
That's another one I see people miss all the time.

04:40.780 --> 04:47.550
You usually in any application have an account button and you go up and you click at the top right where

04:47.550 --> 04:52.380
you can go and change your password change your information sometimes change a profile photo things

04:52.380 --> 04:53.300
like that.

04:53.430 --> 04:58.230
So make sure that you are facilitating that if you have accounts.

04:58.290 --> 05:03.830
Now if you have accounts are signing in and creating profiles and you don't have that that's going to

05:03.830 --> 05:08.270
be a problem your users are going to have some difficulty and you're going to have them e-mailing you

05:08.270 --> 05:13.960
saying hey I need to change my information or I lost my password or whatever it is.

05:13.970 --> 05:15.140
And that's actually not worth it.

05:15.140 --> 05:19.220
I mean if you think you're saving money by leaving this section out don't do it because actually you're

05:19.220 --> 05:24.860
going to lose time and time is money when everybody kind of avalanches on top of you asking you how

05:24.860 --> 05:27.040
do I do these basic functions.

05:27.080 --> 05:27.400
OK.

05:27.440 --> 05:34.070
Do you have an about us or a contact form that is very common you know if you're a startup it's very

05:34.070 --> 05:36.260
common to give information about yourself.

05:36.470 --> 05:42.140
It kind of lends credibility to whatever you're doing it helps people understand that you're a small

05:42.140 --> 05:46.760
team or a big team or helps them get to know you.

05:46.790 --> 05:51.620
This is kind of par for the course and it's gotten to the point where if people don't do it it's looks

05:51.620 --> 05:52.510
weird.

05:52.520 --> 05:58.010
So you want to make sure that if that's something you want to display then absolutely do it.

05:58.100 --> 06:03.640
Not necessarily a mandatory page but keep in mind this is something that a lot of people forget about.

06:03.770 --> 06:05.450
Also similar contact form.

06:05.450 --> 06:06.880
How do they contact you.

06:07.810 --> 06:12.310
You know if you're trying to run a large operation maybe you need to have a contact form that has a

06:12.310 --> 06:17.620
decision tree or they have to you know change information first and then message you where they have

06:17.620 --> 06:21.790
to say for instance do they have an account or they don't have a account or what are they asking you

06:21.790 --> 06:25.220
a question about or who do they need to contact and then contact you.

06:25.390 --> 06:30.850
Or it's just a page I mean that's the most common thing I see is it's a page and it has a contact form

06:30.850 --> 06:37.450
you put name e-mail address subject and maybe and then your message ID and maybe one of those captured

06:37.450 --> 06:37.840
boxes.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.260
So do you have that do you want people to be able to contact you easily.

06:41.260 --> 06:46.830
Chances are you usually do some common pages that you should not forget about.

06:47.020 --> 06:48.790
A lot of people use how it works.

06:48.790 --> 06:50.320
That is something that's helpful.

06:50.320 --> 06:56.560
Now it's not absolutely crucial to the success of your application but it's something that is helpful

06:56.560 --> 06:59.860
for users to understand what's going on what do you do.

06:59.860 --> 07:01.700
How do I pay you money.

07:02.290 --> 07:05.790
And if you don't have that you might have a confused user base.

07:05.790 --> 07:08.010
Again not completely mandatory but very helpful.

07:08.050 --> 07:08.920
Same thing with an FAA.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.210
Q Do you need an FAA.

07:10.210 --> 07:16.120
Q Do you anticipate people being confused about what you do if you're trying to start a business build

07:16.120 --> 07:19.710
a web application that is rather complicated.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.930
It's very helpful to have an FAA queue.

07:22.090 --> 07:25.000
Pricing is another thing if you're building an online software.

07:25.050 --> 07:27.100
It's very nice to have a pricing page.

07:27.100 --> 07:31.780
That's something that you will get actually a lot of flack for if you trying to sell something you don't

07:31.780 --> 07:33.290
ever see the price.

07:33.330 --> 07:34.130
OK.

07:34.240 --> 07:39.990
Do you have a separate page for every function or are some of them small enough for one page.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.580
That one's pretty easy the way that I kind of like to think of it is are you making an informational

07:45.580 --> 07:48.600
Web site that just tells information about who you are what you do.

07:48.730 --> 07:54.100
If that's the case then you typically will have separate pages for everything you have a page that talks

07:54.100 --> 07:57.720
about this or a page that does this or a page that displays this.

07:57.730 --> 08:03.250
Now if you're building an application or someone creates an account logs in and has sort of a portal

08:03.280 --> 08:08.190
feel to it then chances are most of your functions are going to fit into a couple pages.

08:08.260 --> 08:11.950
You don't want a page for every single thing they can do.

08:11.980 --> 08:19.510
So in that case just kind of think about what you need and what would be overburdening your user what

08:19.510 --> 08:20.250
is too much.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.580
Now imagine you are a user and you're using your application.

08:23.650 --> 08:28.630
Do you really want to go to a separate tab or a separate page every time you want to say send a message

08:28.630 --> 08:33.360
or check some information or read information.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.380
Usually that's kind of over done.

08:35.380 --> 08:39.190
And this is one of those things that it helps if you do your wireframe first because when you go and

08:39.190 --> 08:43.480
start wireframe ing you start to realize you have a lot of space on the page.

08:43.630 --> 08:49.200
And so there's a lot of areas where you can fit in that functionality that we went over previously and

08:49.210 --> 08:51.920
you don't need to have a separate tab up in your head.

08:52.090 --> 08:55.480
And I wrote this out here because this is incredibly important.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.120
All refer to your function list when you get stuck.

08:58.120 --> 09:03.010
And if you have wireframe to refer to those as well so you don't you're functionless and your wireframe.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.780
This section should be very very easy.

09:05.790 --> 09:06.010
Okay.

09:06.090 --> 09:11.380
And I'll show you kind of how I would go about doing it with the fake application that we just made.

09:11.380 --> 09:17.430
So this is a mobile application keep in mind so I would say you know my first page would be.

09:17.500 --> 09:22.990
And I typically like to use conventions like this I'll just label them one through however many pages.

09:22.990 --> 09:28.000
So if they don't know the page name like the specific title you used for because they can get kind of

09:28.000 --> 09:32.750
obscure and they have lots of pages it can just refer to the number and that's really quite helpful.

09:32.770 --> 09:41.400
So I would say the landing page landing page with Sign-Up screen with sign up on and remember.

09:41.410 --> 09:44.870
So now we look down at the question do they need to register register button.

09:44.950 --> 09:46.180
OK so that's the first page.

09:46.210 --> 09:50.670
And then what I'll do is I'll just give a just a quick description of it.

09:50.860 --> 10:04.590
First Pidge users use after opening the application for the first time lets them log in or count splays

10:04.920 --> 10:08.520
loke called the lovely Lulu.

10:08.850 --> 10:09.390
OK there you go.

10:09.390 --> 10:11.980
So that's page number one.

10:12.130 --> 10:15.010
Now again try to visualize this as a user.

10:15.010 --> 10:20.470
Now what would happen if I signed up I signed up I would go to the main screen that we described before

10:20.740 --> 10:25.720
if I did not sign up and had to register them I'd have to go to a registration page so we'll make sure

10:25.720 --> 10:29.510
that we have a registration page striation page.

10:29.770 --> 10:29.990
OK.

10:30.010 --> 10:38.140
And then in the scription I'm just going to give a limited effort explanation of what are the form the

10:38.220 --> 10:47.120
form information that I have to give so collect information to a user account and then we could say

10:47.750 --> 10:55.350
have the option to fill out basic mation about themselves.

10:56.420 --> 11:05.300
And the option to create the account with Facebook I'm going to break my rule and add a third sentence

11:05.570 --> 11:07.420
which is fine because it's important.

11:07.430 --> 11:13.000
And then I would say something along the lines of must capture location.

11:13.010 --> 11:16.870
Remember this is a location based mobile application.

11:16.870 --> 11:17.380
OK.

11:17.570 --> 11:24.200
And then I would say we'll call this the main screen because once they get in to the page they're going

11:24.200 --> 11:31.100
to have the main screen where they have to do things like look at their matches message their matches

11:31.120 --> 11:31.710
etc..

11:31.760 --> 11:37.010
So you can also see where they can set their profiles so we'll just call out the main screen.

11:37.220 --> 11:41.570
Again it doesn't really matter what you name these things it's all that matters is your description

11:41.570 --> 11:42.530
makes sense.

11:42.530 --> 11:53.600
So in the main screen will say this is the main screen where the user sees their daily matches and can

11:53.750 --> 11:56.690
access their account page.

11:56.780 --> 11:57.600
OK.

11:58.190 --> 12:02.660
And we had a couple other pages and guys honestly if you if you get the point.

12:02.780 --> 12:04.040
Move along.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.290
They don't need to watch me do this entire thing.

12:06.330 --> 12:10.280
You just I understand that a lot of people are so new to this that they would really like to see me

12:10.280 --> 12:13.540
go from point one to point to 100.

12:13.640 --> 12:18.770
If you get it you can always just move along move on to the next lecture where we start talking about

12:18.830 --> 12:20.430
the user description.

12:20.430 --> 12:24.620
So after the main screen we now kind of recognize that there's a fork in the road.

12:24.680 --> 12:29.310
They get a look at other people's matching profiles or they can change their account information.

12:29.390 --> 12:40.580
So I will say Account Information page Pidge account information page we would say user can view their

12:40.610 --> 12:43.930
basic information change

12:46.030 --> 12:52.900
questionnaire answers and change their password.

12:53.450 --> 12:54.090
OK.

12:54.190 --> 12:59.290
And this is why this is so helpful to go in this process like you're a user because I've just uncovered

12:59.290 --> 13:00.460
something that I've missed.

13:00.460 --> 13:03.800
Right now it is this change questionnaire answers.

13:03.820 --> 13:04.120
OK.

13:04.120 --> 13:08.570
Well I forgot to add that is a page that would actually be its own page.

13:08.830 --> 13:14.740
So we now have to decide where that goes is that after the registration page has that been between the

13:14.740 --> 13:17.620
landing page and the registration page I guess it doesn't really matter.

13:17.680 --> 13:21.480
We will just say it goes here to update all the numbers.

13:21.640 --> 13:26.450
So we'll say questionnaire screens again.

13:26.530 --> 13:30.260
We don't need if it's three screens of all the same functionality.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.410
It doesn't really matter we don't need to make three separate sections of it.

13:33.630 --> 13:35.280
And the questionnaires we have.

13:35.300 --> 13:39.640
And then we can say oh well we're asking questions they answer the questions this one through 10 how

13:39.640 --> 13:40.900
many questions did it ask.

13:41.020 --> 13:46.000
Well good thing we have a function section oh three screens of questions total of 25 questions.

13:46.000 --> 13:46.590
Great.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.190
OK.

13:47.200 --> 14:02.520
So user goes through three screens of questions totaling 25 questions or questions or one through ten

14:02.620 --> 14:10.470
answers I say submit button at the bottom for each page.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.200
OK great.

14:12.220 --> 14:13.600
So that one's done.

14:13.660 --> 14:15.810
Now we can go back to where we were.

14:16.630 --> 14:23.110
We will say this is the now we've seen our matches we can go and look at their profile.

14:23.320 --> 14:23.830
OK.

14:23.830 --> 14:27.650
So profile page of matches.

14:28.430 --> 14:40.110
Then I'll say the description user can view the file of each match and we can say and see you know X

14:40.110 --> 14:44.750
Y Z information it's up to you.

14:44.750 --> 14:50.270
You could describe whatever information you want to add or you'd say oh they see their profile photo

14:50.900 --> 14:53.690
and they see a ranking.

14:53.690 --> 14:58.210
I think we said that it shows all their questions and they get to see a percentage.

14:58.220 --> 15:08.660
I think that's what we were saying so lists so we'll say like display's profile photo and Web site area

15:08.660 --> 15:13.480
to Provo area and lists and lists.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.810
There are question answers with that percentage.

15:18.150 --> 15:18.620
OK.

15:18.660 --> 15:25.010
And a lot of you who are a little more adept at noticing details we've uncovered a lot of functionality

15:25.010 --> 15:26.090
questions.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.200
You know if you've noticed that.

15:27.200 --> 15:32.810
So like when I'm writing this out there's a lot of things that should be going to your head of what

15:32.810 --> 15:34.290
else is included in this.

15:34.290 --> 15:37.620
When I say display's profile photo what else is included.

15:37.640 --> 15:43.430
What happens when I click the profile photo does it zoom in does it become a light box when it displays

15:43.460 --> 15:44.200
area.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.740
What else does that mean.

15:45.740 --> 15:50.590
Does the display area and then say the distance between where I am and where they are.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.950
Is it the area they signed up with is it the area that they're at right now.

15:55.070 --> 15:57.720
These are all things that you'll need to specify.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.320
You typically do these in the function section.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.360
So what I can do is I can go.

16:02.420 --> 16:06.550
I should probably specify this and then go up to the functions included and change it.

16:06.590 --> 16:09.350
Now if you forget some of this stuff don't worry.

16:09.350 --> 16:16.490
The best way of remedying that is to go back through your sections and reread these as you read them

16:16.490 --> 16:17.790
you'll get more questions.

16:17.870 --> 16:23.450
And as you make wireframe you'll start to give yourself more answers that all start to become a lot

16:23.450 --> 16:26.340
more clear as you go and you do more of this stuff.

16:26.360 --> 16:31.760
Also when you do talk to your developer you're going to want to go over this together or your designer

16:31.800 --> 16:36.500
and they'll notice things immediately because they have to build this literally.

16:36.560 --> 16:40.820
And so if there's anything missing they will ask you it's just generally a good idea that you get all

16:40.820 --> 16:46.220
this stuff done up front and not later because then later it can become an issue.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.510
We're going to cover in this course.

16:47.510 --> 16:52.000
How do you deal with the extra work so it's not a big deal but obviously it's it's an ideal.

16:52.100 --> 16:57.740
So we want to make sure that we get it all done up front and then we say lists or questions of the percentage

16:57.740 --> 17:03.870
again that was not really very specific right like what exactly does that look like what does it mean.

17:03.890 --> 17:07.630
Is it does it look exactly like the form that the person submitted.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.540
These are all things that you'll decide later on.

17:09.670 --> 17:10.010
OK.

17:10.010 --> 17:14.380
And then the last thing and this is all kind of implied and we didn't ever put this into the functions.

17:14.390 --> 17:17.590
But now that I realize it we should go back and probably put this in the function.

17:17.600 --> 17:25.330
So what we can say is message screen will go down.

17:26.430 --> 17:33.350
Screen where they can message each other.

17:33.590 --> 17:40.500
I think that we originally said that the functionality that it would connect to you by email.

17:40.610 --> 17:44.460
Keep in mind guys we're not actually building this so if you change your mind and you want to have a

17:44.470 --> 17:48.310
message screen we can change a message screen if you wanted to do it the other way around.

17:48.320 --> 17:52.790
Then I think it was it just connects you with an email so we could say that but if I wanted to build

17:52.790 --> 17:56.170
a message screen I could say it's a screen or you message each other.

17:56.390 --> 18:02.420
But then I wouldn't I need to specify what is the screen roughly look like does it look like I message

18:02.470 --> 18:03.680
and what's app.

18:03.770 --> 18:07.770
Can I send a Mowgli's can I send photographs.

18:07.790 --> 18:09.770
How did those photographs display.

18:09.770 --> 18:12.380
Does it display when I've read their message.

18:12.380 --> 18:14.720
Does it display when it's been sent.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.050
What happens when these things fail.

18:17.060 --> 18:21.920
Now a good developer will look at this and say this is the the functionality said that I would suggest

18:21.920 --> 18:27.170
because there's a package out there that I can install for you and it makes it very simple but it's

18:27.170 --> 18:31.660
always good that you check into this and you think about it as much as possible.

18:31.820 --> 18:37.640
So we use a screen with the message other I'll go back and be true to the functionality we said before

18:38.150 --> 18:44.600
and what this essentially entails would be we go back to the last page and describe the button the message

18:44.600 --> 18:53.050
button message button at the bottom that populates e-mail worst dating app ever.

18:53.120 --> 18:58.020
But it doesn't matter we're just going over this to give you guys the gist of what we're doing.

18:58.370 --> 18:59.090
OK great.

18:59.090 --> 19:04.480
So when you go to make your page ascription make sure to pull up this lecture look at this right here

19:04.490 --> 19:09.410
make sure that you cover all your bases make sure that you have your function list done before you do

19:09.410 --> 19:09.590
this.

19:09.590 --> 19:11.890
Otherwise it's going to be way too complicated.

19:12.020 --> 19:15.110
And if you've already on your wireframe That's great actually saves you time and time.

19:15.140 --> 19:23.240
Wireframe also if you kind of get burnt out on this stuff doing just text wireframe can be very very.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.210
I find them fun because it's visual.

19:25.220 --> 19:29.710
It's like you're painting a picture but except the pictures are a very ugly web site.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.180
I would suggest go to that if you get to a point or you're kind of stuck.

19:32.180 --> 19:46.700
Do you have any questions just post in the group discussion and I'll get to them so the next lecture.
