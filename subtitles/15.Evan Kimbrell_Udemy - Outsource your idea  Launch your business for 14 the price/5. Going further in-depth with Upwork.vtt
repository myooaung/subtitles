00:05.710 --> 00:07.390
Messages they just have a message section.

00:07.390 --> 00:15.850
I don't like how it's separated out because on here it's like it separate it out to where you have to

00:15.850 --> 00:18.570
go to your messages section to message them.

00:18.570 --> 00:20.950
And every time they message you it shows up in your message section.

00:20.950 --> 00:23.650
It just doesn't make sense to me that's separate separated out.

00:23.980 --> 00:31.990
But one advantage though is that you don't have to go through finding your project finding the person

00:31.990 --> 00:33.420
finding the screen.

00:33.790 --> 00:37.810
Send them a message you can just do this and send it to whoever you want.

00:37.810 --> 00:42.660
Or you know someone that you've hired in the past or someone you've communicated with in the past could

00:42.700 --> 00:52.650
just send them a message get to work etc. etc. that can be a little bit helpful.

00:52.850 --> 00:55.420
It's similar to L.A. and what is in this out as well.

00:55.430 --> 01:02.170
You have the ability to search for freelancers in jobs that kind of the same logic applies to you Lance

01:02.200 --> 01:04.880
freelancers great if you want to search for individual people.

01:05.080 --> 01:11.440
So like we used an example before let's search for Twilio in your search for jobs you can do the same

01:11.440 --> 01:18.490
thing and you can borrow their their specifications or adopt some of the things they use that you like.

01:18.490 --> 01:25.300
I like the ability to drill down on oDesk a little bit more than Elance and I'll show you why they just

01:25.300 --> 01:29.260
give you a lot more control so I can just do a slider and how much I want to pay if they don't want

01:29.260 --> 01:37.810
to pay more than $20 an hour and my hours build I can set how long they've you know how many they've

01:38.000 --> 01:39.160
they've built.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.490
This is a big one for me.

01:41.950 --> 01:46.820
You can ask by When's the last time that they logged on to oDesk and did something you can't do on elance

01:46.840 --> 01:47.960
you can't do on a freelancer.

01:48.080 --> 01:53.770
So because oDesk tracks their movements a lot more than the other two you can make sure that this person

01:53.770 --> 01:55.470
is active on their system.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.750
You might think that's you know why would I want to know that.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.460
It's actually quite important.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.520
Someone who is active on the system is going to be more responsive it's someone who's not going to disappear

02:03.520 --> 02:08.110
on you and someone you know that when you message at 10:00 p.m. They're gonna respond by 11:00 p.m.

02:08.980 --> 02:12.780
on elance you don't know if that person made their account it hasn't checked it in six months.

02:12.850 --> 02:15.640
It's kind of impossible to tell sometimes.

02:15.790 --> 02:19.080
And this is also a really cool benefit.

02:19.120 --> 02:25.510
This new contact them they have the green and the yellow and the red dots next to the contact.

02:25.510 --> 02:32.590
So like if I wanted to contact this guy or Rob for it you can see that he replies within a day.

02:32.590 --> 02:37.690
That's awesome for me because I know maybe if I want to hire today or tomorrow I know that I can go

02:37.690 --> 02:40.150
out and recruit people directly.

02:40.300 --> 02:45.760
And I know that they're going to apply roughly within this time and so typically when I go and I recruit

02:45.760 --> 02:52.660
people to my job I will look for the people that have green stars and I just skip all of that.

02:52.660 --> 02:57.720
Well the yellow and the red unless they have really specific to what I need.

02:57.910 --> 03:00.830
But I can save a lot of time doing that.

03:00.850 --> 03:05.010
This is the way that you message people and recruit people.

03:05.170 --> 03:09.640
I always suggest that when you do a job posting and we'll do this later when we do the dry run when

03:09.640 --> 03:16.820
we go through and make an entire application I like doing this or I can message them and invite.

03:16.960 --> 03:23.140
In this case I can create a job specifically for them and if I had a job that was active it would give

03:23.140 --> 03:27.190
me a screen asking to invite them specifically to it.

03:27.220 --> 03:31.270
ODesk Lummis how many people you can invite to your job.

03:31.270 --> 03:33.490
I think it's like 20 a day.

03:33.540 --> 03:36.210
So but that is quite nice.

03:36.220 --> 03:40.240
Just remember to log in every day and get your 20 done because that's dramatically going to increase

03:40.240 --> 03:43.550
the participation for people in your project.

03:43.580 --> 03:44.440
But this is kind of nice.

03:44.440 --> 03:48.160
I can send this person a specific job just for him see what he says.

03:48.180 --> 03:51.780
If he accepts it see if he denies it.

03:52.170 --> 03:52.480
All right.

03:52.480 --> 04:01.360
So the last thing I want to show you is just how you can how Odets streamlines all the information per

04:01.360 --> 04:06.460
freelancer so you can kind of keep track of everything about that person and your relationship with

04:06.460 --> 04:07.100
them.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.860
And I typically find this to be quite useful.

04:11.650 --> 04:16.830
So for me again I to look for old jobs because I have not been using oDesk.

04:17.290 --> 04:23.890
But here is an example of someone that I hired to do kind of as needed fixes you can tell the guy was

04:23.890 --> 04:26.900
$13 an hour he bills a lot.

04:26.940 --> 04:29.240
He's.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.200
He's outsourced.

04:31.240 --> 04:35.800
I can give you the contract that I had with that person and this is great when you know taxes come around

04:35.830 --> 04:38.660
and you need to keep all your documents together.

04:38.710 --> 04:39.740
But I could see right here.

04:39.850 --> 04:42.940
Here's the feedback that he gave me.

04:42.940 --> 04:48.850
I thought I'd given him feedback as well and I can go through all of our messages and it kind of this

04:48.850 --> 04:50.050
is how much I pay to him.

04:50.080 --> 04:54.850
And you know this is when I did the contract with them I can send him a message I can throw them a bonus

04:54.970 --> 05:00.500
and I can see now I love this it can actually tell me what time it is where they are.

05:00.700 --> 05:05.410
Some are on air it also shows you when the last time you logged in was which is quite helpful too because

05:05.410 --> 05:08.810
lot of times over freelancers they say oh I haven't seen it.

05:08.830 --> 05:12.520
The message you sent them and you can also check and see that they've already logged in so that's not

05:12.520 --> 05:13.870
true.

05:13.870 --> 05:15.770
So yeah this is oDesk.

05:15.850 --> 05:20.130
It's definitely something you should add to your lance typically like it's better but a lot of people

05:20.140 --> 05:25.480
have had a really good experience with the oDesk still big wide range of freelancers on here.

05:25.570 --> 05:26.710
I don't think you really go wrong.

05:26.710 --> 05:31.300
Typically though when I look for freelancers I'll post on plants and oDesk use them in tandem.

05:31.330 --> 05:34.740
Makes sense considering they're actually one merged company.

05:34.870 --> 05:36.880
But yeah I think it's something we're checking out.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.200
Some of you like it more than Elance.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.080
So the next one or good idea we're going to freelancer.
