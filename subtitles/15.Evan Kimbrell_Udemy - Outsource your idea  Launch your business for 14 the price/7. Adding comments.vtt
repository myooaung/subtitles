OK and the last section comments this is the section where you quite literally will put any odds and

00:11.130 --> 00:18.300
ends you can think of that are important you know my favorite things to put in this I always like to

00:18.300 --> 00:24.350
mention in the comments how exactly the project is going to work when I'm going to start.

00:24.780 --> 00:28.220
You know how fast you any deadlines.

00:28.230 --> 00:32.770
I like to just let them know for instance what's the status of the design.

00:32.910 --> 00:37.590
If you're reading this for a designer then you need to let the designer know what the status of the

00:37.590 --> 00:39.390
development is.

00:39.660 --> 00:45.090
You need to let them know for instance if they're supposed to work on one section first then another

00:45.090 --> 00:45.950
section.

00:45.960 --> 00:51.060
These are all areas where I would put into comments and comments you can talk about things like you

00:51.060 --> 00:53.640
know this section I'm not 100 percent sure on.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.050
I might change it.

00:55.080 --> 01:00.450
That's something that's worth saying because then the person who's looking at this needs will know to

01:00.450 --> 01:07.360
either change their estimation or program it or make it in a way such that they can change on the fly.

01:07.470 --> 01:10.050
Really anything you think of that can be helpful.

01:10.050 --> 01:13.210
Often times you can put requests in the comment.

01:13.260 --> 01:19.350
You can ask about a certain technology or technique or a suggestion for how to handle something really

01:19.350 --> 01:20.790
this is odds and ends.

01:20.820 --> 01:25.080
The entire point of this is that you want to put everything in here that you couldn't think of to fit

01:25.080 --> 01:31.950
elsewhere so that later on when and if you have a problem hopefully you don't always come back and say

01:31.950 --> 01:34.560
hey at least you were aware of it beforehand.

01:34.590 --> 01:38.160
That's typically what I like to use the comment section for.

01:38.160 --> 01:43.950
So try to cover all the details you can anything you couldn't fit in before that you think is relevant

01:43.950 --> 01:51.150
to the project to your relationship with the contractor and to the success of the project put in the

01:51.150 --> 01:51.630
comments.

01:51.630 --> 01:57.720
Now keep in mind this is not legally binding information but when the sense that you want them to have

01:57.720 --> 02:02.610
as much information as possible up front that's why you should spend some time putting anything into

02:02.610 --> 02:05.520
your comments it's always helpful also as you're going through this.

02:05.520 --> 02:10.710
You can always just think kind of you know on the side or even take notes on the side saying this is

02:10.710 --> 02:16.110
something I have a thought about or a question about and then I'm going to attach that at the end in

02:16.110 --> 02:23.340
the comments section because in the next lecture we're going to cover wire framing which is just as

02:23.340 --> 02:29.940
crucial as the spec sheet if not more I think we're getting to a point now where wire frames are more

02:29.940 --> 02:31.820
important than the spec sheet specs.

02:31.830 --> 02:36.660
It's a little bit old school but if you want to be as accurate and as successful as possible you want

02:36.660 --> 02:46.000
to do both of them so see in the next lecture.
