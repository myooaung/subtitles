00:05.710 --> 00:10.140
Of course this lecture we're going to go over and notations what they are.

00:10.140 --> 00:13.780
You should put it off and you should do it you a.

00:13.860 --> 00:15.550
You could do it all the time.

00:15.700 --> 00:22.320
And Haitians are incredibly important because when you pass on your modelling wireframe is there's always

00:22.320 --> 00:24.370
going to be a gap of information.

00:24.390 --> 00:28.280
Now why is it good explaining what does what looks like what.

00:28.310 --> 00:32.460
There's always gonna be something missing in nothing interactions.

00:32.520 --> 00:40.050
Why put something away if you try to make some good of this customer different than was usual was out

00:40.050 --> 00:40.990
of patience.

00:41.020 --> 00:49.730
Now the whole point is lecture's comments everything Fiocco indications Commons and I'm sure you have

00:49.860 --> 00:51.880
the appropriate way of doing it.

00:51.920 --> 00:59.220
Now it's important to understand how they work and how fast your ass works when you ask for your number

00:59.270 --> 01:05.120
to do it and then it's going to depend on who you're showing it to and what way you are showing what

01:05.420 --> 01:06.490
you show to you.

01:06.500 --> 01:12.920
Now wireframe that's different then if you have a show key and there's a different way to handle that.

01:12.930 --> 01:14.790
So with that being said.

01:15.120 --> 01:21.810
So now keep in mind that when you're putting notations comments all extra side notes aren't particularly

01:21.810 --> 01:24.650
helpful when you're showing them to a customer.

01:24.780 --> 01:28.330
A customer is not really going to be interested in that.

01:28.590 --> 01:33.390
They really just want to look at it you don't need a physical description next to it it's really hard

01:33.390 --> 01:38.130
to balance that especially if you're someone who's not used to looking at these what you typically will

01:38.130 --> 01:45.120
use these for would be for instance like showing your developer a page and something you were able to

01:45.120 --> 01:46.410
replicate something.

01:46.470 --> 01:51.780
So what you'd want to do is add a comment or some type of postscripts so they can read about it and

01:51.780 --> 01:57.810
read and see what's changed now if you look at any of the wireframe that I've made I always put columns

01:58.410 --> 02:00.090
where I put text in it.

02:00.090 --> 02:03.060
Now I do that with balsamic and I would do what I usually do.

02:03.060 --> 02:07.740
So if you skip ahead and look at the bosonic lectures what I do is I just add a comment on the side.

02:07.770 --> 02:14.000
Now that's something that's works in balsamic but that's because bosonic really only exports to a PTF

02:14.170 --> 02:18.080
you I really like when I use a bosonic you're just going to have a piece of paper that you show people.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.690
Now what Pinocchio that's not really how they roll.

02:20.970 --> 02:25.650
They've made their entire system so that when you display it to someone you can simulate it being on

02:25.650 --> 02:31.410
a page simulate it being on a phone and trying to make it look is exact to what it how it should fit

02:31.470 --> 02:33.510
on a phone how it should fit on a web page.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.070
So you can't really do things like that.

02:35.090 --> 02:38.940
You put a big block on the side and everyone just knows there's side comments.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.070
Different way of doing it.

02:41.100 --> 02:44.130
Most Whyfor tools have their own way of handling this.

02:44.130 --> 02:46.490
This is just the specific one to Pinocchio.

02:46.530 --> 02:50.150
So the way that you want to do this is pretty simple.

02:50.550 --> 02:56.270
One way of doing it is you go up to your actual page and it's literally right here.

02:56.460 --> 03:01.520
So you put your notes here and this is where I like to list out things that they need to be aware of.

03:01.530 --> 03:05.680
And trust me if you're not putting notes then you're not thinking this through correctly.

03:05.740 --> 03:08.670
One I would like to explain what's going on with that logo.

03:08.670 --> 03:17.460
I could say I created a sketch of the logo and then I could describe what it is I like about that kind

03:17.460 --> 03:21.020
of scatch what I don't like about it what were my ideas for it roughly.

03:21.060 --> 03:33.930
So I imagine the logo having something to do with beer and having initials.

03:34.700 --> 03:38.900
Were open to ideas.

03:39.520 --> 03:39.780
OK.

03:39.790 --> 03:42.440
So that's helpful specifically for the graphic designer.

03:42.440 --> 03:46.050
It will be helpful for the developer just to see what's coming up next.

03:46.120 --> 03:49.350
Here is where you could do is you could explain some interactivity.

03:49.450 --> 03:56.770
You could say you know I could say for instance that form on the right hand side depending on what pages

03:56.770 --> 04:02.430
are coming from should have different letters or different questions or something like that.

04:02.530 --> 04:06.850
Or maybe I could say like the phone number should validate in a specific way.

04:06.850 --> 04:12.100
Now what do you mean by validation validation is like when I go to the input for phone number and I

04:12.100 --> 04:19.120
type in you know 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 and I put an extra number what it's going to do is it's going to look

04:19.120 --> 04:21.490
for a typical phone number format.

04:21.580 --> 04:25.450
And if I don't give it that that it's going to say something's wrong.

04:25.450 --> 04:30.250
So what it does is it forces your users to not give you fake information.

04:30.250 --> 04:34.920
It also makes it really helpful because your users might typo so it stops them from typing.

04:35.230 --> 04:38.130
If they type on their phone number it's a worthless entry.

04:38.260 --> 04:39.430
So that's a side note.

04:39.440 --> 04:47.430
But what I could say is we use a phone number for Keeshan.

04:47.830 --> 04:52.770
Now these notes what they're going to do is they're going to show up on the export.

04:52.780 --> 04:58.390
So when I export this in any different way depending on which one I choose these will show up in the

04:58.390 --> 04:59.930
document next lecture.

04:59.920 --> 05:05.080
I want to show you how we do exporting really kind of cool different ways that you can do it.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.950
One of the expert techniques.

05:07.060 --> 05:08.500
We'll send it to PTF.

05:08.500 --> 05:15.580
And in that PTF it has all sorts of organisation and Mark Mark markup showing your developer any comments

05:15.580 --> 05:17.380
or anything that's going on.

05:17.410 --> 05:20.230
So it creates a package for users really helpful.

05:20.650 --> 05:21.050
Yes.

05:21.050 --> 05:26.080
Anyway I would put really anything that I thought was useful I might mention that the submit button

05:26.080 --> 05:28.300
should have round corners or something like that

05:31.130 --> 05:32.860
obviously you can make those.

05:33.010 --> 05:38.630
So all you have to do is use a different static stencil to use this eclipse and then you change the.

05:38.850 --> 05:46.880
You use this button right here to change the rounding of the corners anyway so use these as much as

05:46.880 --> 05:50.480
you can put as much detail as you possibly can.

05:50.540 --> 05:55.580
Take a second look at your page and look for things that you are assuming are going to happen that are

05:55.580 --> 05:57.900
in your head but are not physically on the page.

05:57.980 --> 06:00.920
Now you're not always going to be talking to the person you show this to.

06:00.920 --> 06:07.730
So you want them to be able to look at it later and know exactly what's going on and not have any gaps

06:07.730 --> 06:11.210
in their understanding because it'll frustrate them they'll stop looking at it you're not going to get

06:11.210 --> 06:16.130
the feedback you want another way of doing it is to literally use the quote go in the core stencils

06:16.190 --> 06:19.390
and there's a section called Calment.

06:19.590 --> 06:22.180
I literally just put it right there and it looks like a sticky note.

06:22.460 --> 06:26.550
So you know it's you could say really anything.

06:27.200 --> 06:39.680
I would say let's say that they're welcome text is dynamic text based off of keyword word that's gibberish

06:39.730 --> 06:42.640
but that would be something maybe I tell a developer.

06:42.640 --> 06:47.470
So I'd like put it right there so they know that that right there is dynamic.

06:47.890 --> 06:50.380
I don't typically like using these last.

06:50.380 --> 06:57.830
For some reason what's happened is I've created entire wireframe I've x4 to send it to them that questions

06:57.830 --> 07:03.080
and it's supposed to like explain to them in text what I could do is physically paste this over or whatever

07:03.080 --> 07:06.130
they have questions about and say you know this is what I need to change.

07:06.130 --> 07:07.680
This is what I was talking about.

07:07.910 --> 07:13.600
And so realistically you'd have like tons of these just stuck on here pointing out things they're kind

07:13.600 --> 07:18.760
of annoying because they cover up what you're looking at but they're one of the many ways you can do

07:18.760 --> 07:24.790
it the last way of doing it is kind of similar to the way you'd mark up something in like preview on

07:24.790 --> 07:28.550
a Macintosh in OS 10.

07:29.140 --> 07:33.490
What I do is this is actually what I do which is kind of goofy.

07:33.490 --> 07:39.760
I don't always do the right things so don't follow me to the t create or figure out whatever works for

07:39.760 --> 07:40.250
you the best.

07:40.270 --> 07:43.900
This is what I like doing so if I send a wireframe to say developer and they have all these questions

07:43.900 --> 07:50.260
that for some reason it just didn't explain very well what I'll do is I'll pull these over and I will

07:50.260 --> 07:52.670
go ahead and change the color so they stick out.

07:53.640 --> 08:02.780
So I could pick semitransparent and put the borders you know something that sticks out is orange or

08:03.210 --> 08:04.360
something like that.

08:05.050 --> 08:09.640
So there isn't a white semitransparent is because if I want to stick it over something you can see what's

08:09.640 --> 08:10.260
going on.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.980
So I could use this as a focus point.

08:11.980 --> 08:16.090
So if they're asking a question they don't clearly understand what button number fering to or something

08:16.090 --> 08:24.550
like that I can do this and you know say grow it so it covers whatever I'm talking about.

08:24.550 --> 08:28.390
Stick it there then I'll put text right next to it.

08:28.420 --> 08:31.290
Similarly what you can do is just use a white background

08:34.900 --> 08:44.420
you go and literally just paste text on top of it put in an arrow to point to whatever I'm talking about

08:44.470 --> 08:48.700
or paste text inside of a.

08:48.770 --> 08:50.500
So I'd say like fix this

08:53.730 --> 08:55.990
and this is a easy way of entertaining.

08:56.280 --> 09:00.530
This is typically how you would do it in Preview but it's very very basic.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.300
And so whenever I export that that is going to be you can't ignore that.

09:04.740 --> 09:07.140
Literally what I would do.

09:07.560 --> 09:11.460
You also use this as a helpful tool say for instance if you want to emulate another Web site you could

09:11.460 --> 09:16.620
use the background technique we learned in the previous lecture and then put little dots and arrows

09:16.620 --> 09:18.540
pointing to what you like why you like it.

09:18.540 --> 09:20.770
That's actually a pretty interesting way of doing it.

09:21.150 --> 09:24.270
But for the most part here it's just helpful for marking it up.

09:24.270 --> 09:26.220
I don't use this for like revisions.

09:26.220 --> 09:29.970
I put the majority of your side comments somewhere else.

09:30.240 --> 09:34.830
And if you for instance are letting someone access your account what you could do is turn this into

09:34.830 --> 09:38.130
its own layer and then just have a layer called comments.

09:38.130 --> 09:44.950
That's one way of doing it a little Geto but that's kind of the thing with low fidelity wireframe that

09:45.120 --> 09:47.130
it's all kind of hacked together.

09:47.130 --> 09:53.720
We just want to focus on getting it done getting it done quickly in the next lecture I'm going to show.

09:53.820 --> 09:59.250
So in the next lecture I'm actually going to spend a little bit of time and create a really simple mockup

09:59.310 --> 10:03.910
for the happy hour mobile app that we talked about.

10:03.930 --> 10:08.880
And then I'm going to use that to show you how these simulations and the exports work on go to see what

10:08.880 --> 10:10.140
options you have.

10:10.140 --> 10:17.310
I'm not going to show you simulates simulations exports and sharing through this little scratchpad that

10:17.310 --> 10:21.380
I threw together because it'll just look ridiculous and not really going to get the point across.

10:21.390 --> 10:23.790
So I'd like to actually build something from scratch and then show you it.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.870
So see in the next lecture.
