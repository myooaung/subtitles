WEBVTT

00:05.630 --> 00:09.420
Of course in this lecture collaborators and reviewers.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.980
Now this is a really important feature.

00:12.060 --> 00:13.710
Why.

00:13.870 --> 00:20.480
A of reasons why people go to show me you'll be able to collaborate with other people share and get

00:20.600 --> 00:22.720
immediate feedback and.

00:22.910 --> 00:29.950
That's a really really cool feature and one of biggest reasons I do use bosonic is the main one now

00:30.160 --> 00:35.750
uses effectively I think everyone has their network friends or family or colleagues who will look at

00:35.750 --> 00:37.660
this and get some feedback.

00:37.650 --> 00:41.300
Keep in mind Sachi kind of cool it's an interesting novelty.

00:41.300 --> 00:47.960
There's a lot of different ways that you can export what you're doing and it ends up being a really

00:47.960 --> 00:49.130
kind of a cool effect.

00:49.130 --> 00:55.060
Now if you're going for instance a patient you could send a mobile application by letting the person

00:55.070 --> 00:56.720
look at on the phone.

00:56.720 --> 01:01.590
You don't need to look at it when it's really really helpful.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.210
And of course you need to be constantly looking for feedback.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.180
Every time you build something you have access to something give you feedback.

01:10.220 --> 01:11.770
Please go ahead and do it.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.830
You guys are coming for my audition.

01:13.890 --> 01:20.210
Of course it's really important to use things like five second test to show people what they look what

01:20.220 --> 01:28.070
you look like and see who gets to take these with a grain of salt know a member of the daily sketches

01:28.070 --> 01:31.450
are just challenges you're not supposed to look exactly like you should.

01:31.670 --> 01:36.170
Everyone has a work in progress but it's an immensely powerful tool.

01:36.170 --> 01:36.710
All right.

01:36.710 --> 01:42.980
I want to go to the screen test that is pulled open the web prototype that we had created earlier to

01:42.980 --> 01:44.660
show you how these things work.

01:44.660 --> 01:48.980
So first off we're talk about simulate this button right here.

01:49.010 --> 01:50.740
This is mainly for your purposes.

01:50.870 --> 01:54.610
You want to see how this is going to look in a browser.

01:55.180 --> 01:59.210
And that's important because you need to make sure that you're not for instance designing things that

01:59.210 --> 02:03.890
are outside the boundaries of a browser or designing things that are too large or too small for your

02:03.890 --> 02:04.690
browser.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.820
Now obviously you set your canvas size the way that you would imagine a browser being but that can create

02:10.820 --> 02:13.690
problems because you're not always exact.

02:13.700 --> 02:20.480
And a lot of times you might design for one browser and it just doesn't look right or you know you can't

02:20.570 --> 02:22.970
make something that just looks correct and everything.

02:22.970 --> 02:24.960
It's great for tweaking.

02:25.020 --> 02:29.240
So over here what you do is you go up assimulate and you have three options simulate scatch simulate

02:29.240 --> 02:31.130
sketch comics and simulate pain.

02:31.340 --> 02:36.260
The difference here is it's going to simulate all of these designs in a different way.

02:36.260 --> 02:39.760
Now if you simulate plane it's you know look the same way that you see it right here.

02:40.220 --> 02:41.420
The other ones are scatch.

02:41.420 --> 02:48.920
Now we talked about this previously what sketch designs do and when you use sketch designs it makes

02:48.920 --> 02:54.410
it kind of look it looks like Scatchard it looks like someone took a pencil and drew this in and they

02:54.410 --> 02:56.000
purposely make it look sloppy.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.060
Now the reason why they do that is because we talked about this previewer previously.

03:00.190 --> 03:01.980
It's called user feedback bias.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.510
Now the crappier it looks and the more it looks like you didn't put a lot of time into it then the user

03:08.510 --> 03:16.280
or the person looking at it is going to judge it's more so on content layout structure and less so on

03:16.280 --> 03:17.390
the actual design of it.

03:17.390 --> 03:22.670
It's kind of a subconscious reinforcement that this is not polished and is not finished please only

03:22.670 --> 03:27.410
give me feedback on the limited amount of information you see.

03:27.410 --> 03:30.410
Please don't say oh it's ugly because it's not supposed to look pretty.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.960
So I can show you really quickly what that ends up looking like.

03:32.990 --> 03:35.570
So we'll look at plain.

03:35.620 --> 03:41.380
This is redundant because it's going to look exactly like you just saw it but it's be placed in a browser.

03:41.690 --> 03:42.410
There you go.

03:42.490 --> 03:48.070
It put bounding boxes here so you can kind of see where the canvas starts and ends.

03:48.220 --> 03:53.270
So this is a simulation you don't really get rid of that but what you can tell here is wow look that's

03:53.290 --> 03:54.280
the bounding box is.

03:54.280 --> 03:55.930
We should increase the width.

03:55.930 --> 03:59.520
I mean we might as well design the page for the entire page itself.

03:59.830 --> 04:03.880
And it's not responsive you'll notice it just kind of nothing moves.

04:03.940 --> 04:06.730
That's because this is just a flat design.

04:06.730 --> 04:09.940
Ok so now we can look at sketched aerial.

04:09.970 --> 04:10.480
There you go.

04:10.480 --> 04:15.340
And what it does here is that it even gives you a little bit it's like paper in fact just again visually

04:15.340 --> 04:19.740
reinforce that this is like a scratch pad like I sketched this together.

04:19.810 --> 04:20.800
The other one is sketched.

04:20.800 --> 04:27.130
And this is with comic sans So this takes like friends and see here how it loses some of its fidelity

04:27.820 --> 04:29.890
doesn't touch the text.

04:29.980 --> 04:35.470
Well because typically when you write in text in paedo codes and Aeriel anyway so this is think of this

04:35.740 --> 04:36.760
kind of a spectrum.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.230
This is the most accurate based on your wire frames.

04:39.300 --> 04:46.690
This is in between and this is going to be super sloppy and ghetto.

04:46.790 --> 04:53.090
And here you go this is comic sans I don't usually use Comic Sans But if you understand the reason why

04:53.090 --> 04:56.100
you scatch then you might have a reason for using this.

04:56.330 --> 05:00.980
This almost just looks entirely too bad so don't send it to anyone who you're trying to impress.

05:00.980 --> 05:07.640
I usually go with this option but it's up you can always leave comments here to you can leave a comment

05:08.990 --> 05:17.450
and you can kind of like for instance here what you can do is you can say a comment fixed this and then

05:17.450 --> 05:27.290
I'll say implemented and I'll post it and like to say so what you can do is you can just say what changes

05:27.290 --> 05:27.980
you've made.

05:28.010 --> 05:29.080
I can post notes

05:32.940 --> 05:35.220
this is great for internal conversations.

05:35.220 --> 05:39.320
It works great for you because then I can go back and I can see this.

05:39.330 --> 05:40.850
I left a comment.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.420
I can double click it and it gives me some info about it.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.940
And then you can drag and drop it wherever you want.

05:47.940 --> 05:50.570
So theoretically you could this anything anywhere you want.

05:50.700 --> 05:55.520
If I wanted to leave a comment about say the home button I could do that.

05:58.090 --> 05:59.530
And then I can put it on the home button.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.320
OK.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.900
So that's helpful visual reminders don't these too much because you'll get in the way.

06:05.390 --> 06:07.750
So we go back to the page now.

06:07.760 --> 06:12.920
The other thing is sharing sharing is incredibly helpful.

06:13.000 --> 06:13.990
And Prisco.

06:14.120 --> 06:18.860
Now what you can do is you can do viewing reviewing and collaboration.

06:18.860 --> 06:21.720
Now there's there's three different things and they're just different.

06:22.010 --> 06:23.700
Sending a view invitation e-mail.

06:23.720 --> 06:28.550
What that does is it sends to someone Hey come look at my wireframe.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.070
It's just flat.

06:30.080 --> 06:34.600
It's it's like when you use Google documents and you share something with someone and you say anyone

06:34.600 --> 06:35.850
at this link can see this.

06:35.870 --> 06:36.760
That's it.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.270
Now review is different.

06:38.290 --> 06:40.710
You're going to get the link to see your wireframe.

06:40.730 --> 06:44.840
And there are going to be able to add in comments and I'll show you what this looks like in just a second.

06:44.870 --> 06:49.520
That's helpful if say you have some people on your team that you know show this to you or some customers

06:49.520 --> 06:51.420
that are following you along.

06:51.500 --> 06:57.500
You can send them something they can review it tell you how they think and that's incredibly helpful.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.500
Now with wireframe that's not really really super helpful.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.290
It might be helpful if you say for instance send this to your graphic designer.

07:03.290 --> 07:09.170
They can say hey somebody lay out lay out don't look that great why don't we try something else or developer

07:09.170 --> 07:09.860
or something like that.

07:09.860 --> 07:14.720
I wouldn't necessarily send wireframe to a client for review again because when they're reviewing it

07:14.780 --> 07:17.570
they might be confused as to what exactly they're reviewing.

07:17.570 --> 07:22.960
When you go ahead and create a high fidelity prototype this can be incredibly helpful.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.370
Just keep in mind this will kind of make you want to create more iteration cycles so if someone says

07:28.400 --> 07:32.630
hey something's screwed up or ugly or change this you're going want to go back to your designer or go

07:32.630 --> 07:37.340
back to the Paducah and change it and that will add some significant time.

07:37.340 --> 07:38.600
So be aware of that.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.000
Collaboration is a little bit different.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.560
Collaboration is if you wanted to create a wireframe with someone else or a prototype so you could send

07:45.560 --> 07:46.750
someone a collaboration link.

07:46.760 --> 07:52.820
That means they can log on just like we are now and they can edit things and Paducah will keep a running

07:52.820 --> 07:54.590
log of all the edits that people make.

07:54.590 --> 07:55.910
And you can add comments.

07:55.910 --> 07:59.930
This is great especially if you're not in the same office working with someone you can create a version

08:00.070 --> 08:02.260
of someone they can create a version send it back.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.350
That's very helpful.

08:03.350 --> 08:08.840
That's one of the big reasons why pick Padalka because it has these features right here.

08:09.140 --> 08:14.790
This also is another reason why they have the mobile app invitation email that's incredibly helpful

08:14.840 --> 08:19.400
because what's going to happen is if I create a mobile app I want people to be able to view it on their

08:19.400 --> 08:20.130
phone.

08:20.150 --> 08:23.540
So what I would do is I would send them a mobile app invitation email.

08:23.600 --> 08:28.070
They're going to get that e-mail and they click this link to download the app how it works actually

08:28.460 --> 08:30.430
is it just to display it like a web page.

08:30.520 --> 08:31.810
So we're going to send them the link.

08:31.850 --> 08:36.560
They're going to open it and it's going to pop up on their page and it has kind of a simulation like

08:36.680 --> 08:39.080
a mobile application later in the course.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.250
I'm actually going to demo this.

08:40.250 --> 08:44.720
And so you're going to see it but I'm going to do that in the prototyping phase and I get to show you

08:44.720 --> 08:46.650
how we actually get that on your phone.

08:46.670 --> 08:48.610
It's actually quite cool.

08:48.830 --> 08:52.310
And this is the last one it's called Get a link with this prototype that's just you know if you want

08:52.310 --> 08:56.040
to be flexible you just want to link us in that link to people.

08:56.040 --> 09:00.950
And with that link they can view it is the same thing like this button maybe you don't want to have

09:00.950 --> 09:06.020
to insert everyone's email say you want to post this just on a page or something like that.

09:08.310 --> 09:08.580
OK.

09:08.580 --> 09:16.460
So I will demo really quickly what a review e-mail looks like it's going allow you to set all the information

09:16.460 --> 09:17.990
and send it to however you want.

09:18.020 --> 09:19.360
Doesn't particularly matter.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.640
And then we can pick which one we want we're going to pick.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.330
Ariel

09:29.170 --> 09:32.390
get here we are this is all the information that I put in it.

09:32.400 --> 09:36.770
I didn't put any information on it but if you put in text it actually display this text right here.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.930
And then it just gives me a link.

09:39.410 --> 09:39.750
OK.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.640
And so it looks roughly the same.

09:41.640 --> 09:45.980
The only difference here is that they can see all of these comments.

09:46.380 --> 09:50.030
Now if you only allow them to view they wouldn't see any of this.

09:50.030 --> 09:54.480
Did you see the image now review reviewer what they can do is just add comments and they can participate

09:54.480 --> 09:55.860
in these threads.

09:55.910 --> 09:57.380
I don't like this

10:02.530 --> 10:04.450
fix this part.

10:05.890 --> 10:08.420
I could say post it.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.710
See now it's gonna be associated to my e-mail address and then I can.

10:11.710 --> 10:14.500
But I want it to be like this.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.720
You put it up.

10:15.730 --> 10:17.050
You can see that I fix that.

10:17.470 --> 10:18.260
OK.

10:18.640 --> 10:19.310
OK.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.530
Last but not least I'm going to show you a little of the exports.

10:23.530 --> 10:28.190
So before we just looked at viewer review collaboration these are how all of these work.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.010
They all have different use cases.

10:30.010 --> 10:34.210
I will show you the mobile app invitation email how that works in the future collaboration.

10:34.210 --> 10:35.700
You can basically understand it.

10:35.720 --> 10:39.440
It makes you create a video co account and then you can log in and edit it.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.010
Same way we are x4 it the last option.

10:42.010 --> 10:45.630
Now this is you know for different use cases you can do HVM export.

10:45.690 --> 10:50.140
That's going to do is just download an email file with a folder or attach the images in it.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.710
This is great if you have your own web site and you want to post it to your Web site and share it that

10:53.710 --> 10:54.400
way.

10:54.400 --> 10:59.020
I don't do that because it has made it simple enough that I can share over here.

10:59.590 --> 11:01.950
You can do it as a vector graphics export.

11:01.960 --> 11:06.460
That's great for a graphic designer because they can just toy with it whatever they are they want but

11:06.460 --> 11:08.050
it's really not particularly different than the other ones.

11:08.050 --> 11:12.660
PTF PMG these are just flat standard images.

11:12.700 --> 11:16.320
You can do it as a word export that comes out a little bit weird.

11:16.390 --> 11:19.870
I wouldn't necessarily use that if you have graphic images in here.

11:19.870 --> 11:25.930
I wouldn't use that if if your layout is important to you and then screen flow if you want to export

11:25.930 --> 11:28.500
the screen flow we created previously.

11:28.510 --> 11:33.940
One thing worth pointing out is when you do like a PDA for PMG export or even HDMI out you can export

11:33.940 --> 11:39.750
these in groups so I can include discussions page details like an inside layer is all that stuff and

11:39.760 --> 11:42.600
I can export all of these together if I wanted to.

11:42.810 --> 11:44.520
And this is what a PDA fax part looks like.

11:44.530 --> 11:50.500
It's kind of cool because it will create a front page for you if you have multiple pages it'll list

11:50.500 --> 11:52.690
out all of the different things on here.

11:52.700 --> 11:59.140
I just export the screen flow to the screen close shows that sitemap that we created previously if I

11:59.140 --> 12:00.470
wanted to just explore

12:04.060 --> 12:11.880
just my basic actual wireframe so I could just do this.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.990
OK so that's a brief review of simulate share and export.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.370
There's a lot of functionality there and I think that's one of the things that separates POKO from the

12:19.370 --> 12:22.970
rest of the wire framing prototyping tools.

12:22.970 --> 12:25.780
So make sure that you get these to good use.

12:25.820 --> 12:29.870
Make sure that you're sharing with your friends getting their feedback adding collaborators when you

12:29.870 --> 12:30.750
can.

12:30.980 --> 12:33.070
And also deploying on mobile applications.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.730
But I'll show you later how we do that.

12:35.830 --> 12:36.950
Did you guys have any questions.

12:36.960 --> 12:40.490
Always post in the group discussion or send me a private message otherwise I'll see you in the next.
