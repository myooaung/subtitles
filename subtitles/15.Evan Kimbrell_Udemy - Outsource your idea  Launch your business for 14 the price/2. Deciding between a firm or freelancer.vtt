00:10.730 --> 00:16.540
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about determining whether

00:16.540 --> 00:20.460
or not you should work with an individual freelancer or a firm.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.070
That's probably something you hadn't actually thought about.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.900
What difference does it make right especially if you're new to this.

00:25.900 --> 00:31.600
But let me tell you it actually makes quite a big difference and it really kind of depends on your type

00:31.600 --> 00:36.640
of situation your experience with outsourcing and what exactly you are outsourcing.

00:36.730 --> 00:40.930
So the reason why I bring this up at this point in the course is because probably at this point you

00:40.930 --> 00:47.410
might've been following along and building out your project and listing it and soliciting some people

00:47.410 --> 00:53.610
to build or do whatever it is you're doing and you might have run into a problem which is that you're

00:53.620 --> 00:58.990
looking at bids say you're using up work or E into the platforms or any of the other sources that we

00:58.990 --> 01:01.270
covered for finding contractors.

01:01.270 --> 01:06.070
You might notice that some people speak a little bit differently sometimes they say we and sometimes

01:06.070 --> 01:12.130
they say I might have also noticed that some people in their profile picture it might be a logo or it

01:12.130 --> 01:13.350
might be a person.

01:13.430 --> 01:17.420
So determining whether or not it's a company or a freelancer that's generally pretty easy.

01:17.590 --> 01:19.090
If they send you a logo.

01:19.180 --> 01:24.190
Typically a company now that's not 100 percent true all the time but 99 percent of the time they're

01:24.190 --> 01:25.060
sending you a logo.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.250
They're a group of people.

01:26.350 --> 01:29.920
If they send you a profile picture then they're probably a freelancer.

01:29.980 --> 01:37.180
As a side note to getting a picture of a person as a freelancer one thing that you should always avoid

01:37.180 --> 01:42.370
is if you have a contractor who is probably on the other side of the world and they send you a photo

01:42.370 --> 01:47.020
of someone that doesn't match what you would assume is their ethnic profile or it looks like it's a

01:47.020 --> 01:54.240
stock photo looks like way too perfect or too planned.

01:54.250 --> 01:59.080
Please avoid that person it's a very strange thing that contractors often do.

01:59.110 --> 02:03.520
I've had contractors on the other side of the world send me stock photos of people and it turns out

02:03.520 --> 02:05.620
that they're celebrities and they didn't even realize.

02:05.620 --> 02:06.910
So avoid that.

02:07.060 --> 02:11.520
But another way you can obviously tell whether or not it's a firm or freelancer look at their language.

02:11.530 --> 02:14.280
They say we or did they really say I.

02:14.290 --> 02:19.910
Now if you used another way of sourcing this then look for whether or not they say attached a resume.

02:19.930 --> 02:22.440
Typically a freelancer is going attach a resume.

02:22.450 --> 02:28.120
A company is probably not going to do that both on a list of portfolio.

02:28.570 --> 02:31.290
And honestly if there's no other way you can tell.

02:31.390 --> 02:34.810
Try to go to if they have a personal web site.

02:34.900 --> 02:36.970
You go there you can tell very quickly.

02:36.970 --> 02:44.110
So let's talk about the pros and cons of using a firm first so let's talk about why you would use a

02:44.110 --> 02:49.000
firm and what are situations and scenarios where you really wouldn't want to use a firm.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.050
First off what's the first pro when it comes to hiring a firm.

02:53.230 --> 03:00.070
Well one pro that I think a lot of people don't actually realize is that groups and firms are typically

03:00.070 --> 03:01.450
more capable.

03:01.870 --> 03:06.400
So now you might think to yourself what does it matter I'm only hiring one or two people at that firm

03:06.440 --> 03:08.110
and actually matters quite a bit.

03:08.140 --> 03:13.780
In most cases where you're contracting out work whether it's a mobile application or whatever typically

03:13.780 --> 03:16.840
it's going to involve multiple expertise.

03:16.840 --> 03:21.760
And what I mean by that is like say you're building on a mobile application you might need someone who

03:21.760 --> 03:28.900
understands how to work with swift or Java so they can program it for say IRS but you also might need

03:28.900 --> 03:33.760
someone who can deal with the graphic interface of the actual application itself.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.800
Now often that someone can do both.

03:35.800 --> 03:41.020
That is true but it's also often the case that those are two separate expertise.

03:41.020 --> 03:49.120
So now our group is more likely to have both those expertise within their actual staff.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.460
And that actually is an important distinction.

03:51.460 --> 03:57.130
So outsprint cak we get asked to do projects all the time that have multiple expertise let's say an

03:57.130 --> 04:03.140
application that incorporates some other specific or obscure framework or technology.

04:03.460 --> 04:08.110
We're actually in a better position than a freelancer because we have other people who work for the

04:08.110 --> 04:14.410
company that have expertise in some of those other sections so when we run into a problem we can always

04:14.440 --> 04:20.710
access that other person and get a quick on the spot consultation groups have that advantage.

04:20.770 --> 04:24.970
Now rarely is the case that you have something that only has a single expertise.

04:24.970 --> 04:29.860
But it is possible it is possible that what you're doing is small enough that that person probably has

04:29.860 --> 04:36.160
all the skills you need and so you don't benefit from this from a group but in most cases this is helpful.

04:36.160 --> 04:41.410
The biggest thing is it makes it such that your project will go faster because when they run into a

04:41.410 --> 04:47.110
roadblock they can get past it faster and they're more likely to figure it out where a lot of times

04:47.170 --> 04:51.640
the freelancer they might not actually know how to solve it or another pro about groups is that they

04:51.640 --> 04:55.630
can actually shift the load of work as they're working on your project.

04:55.620 --> 04:59.620
So say that you hire them to build out something for you.

04:59.710 --> 05:06.280
Now they might assume or a sign of one person as your lead developer that person is dedicated to your

05:06.280 --> 05:08.730
project much like a freelancer would.

05:08.770 --> 05:15.910
But what happens if the person say get sick well with a group there's a very good chance that they can

05:15.970 --> 05:19.900
offload work they can shift the load if anything comes up.

05:19.900 --> 05:26.650
So let's say the person working on their project gets sick gets you know injured anything just doesn't

05:26.650 --> 05:28.590
show up there's a problem.

05:28.630 --> 05:33.220
There's a very good chance that someone else is ready who can pick up the load.

05:33.220 --> 05:37.980
That's just a thing with groups especially with development groups web development and design groups.

05:38.320 --> 05:43.950
There's always someone who has some extra time because projects don't fit together perfectly with the

05:43.950 --> 05:46.100
40 hour week schedule.

05:46.100 --> 05:49.650
Someone's always available to pick up slack if it's the case.

05:49.640 --> 05:57.520
Now the biggest pro for working with the firm is actually what's called a management law here.

05:57.610 --> 06:00.180
I'm sure you might be familiar with what I'm talking about.

06:00.180 --> 06:07.120
What I mean is that when you hire a firm there's going to be some sort of a project manager or a business

06:07.120 --> 06:08.100
manager.

06:08.140 --> 06:12.520
Typically the person you reach out to you probably wasn't the person who is actually going to be doing

06:12.520 --> 06:17.740
the work it's the person who's in charge of customer client satisfaction.

06:17.740 --> 06:22.750
It's the person that does probably deals with finding leads and processing the accounts.

06:22.750 --> 06:27.100
Now what does that mean for you and your project that means that when you work with the firm There's

06:27.100 --> 06:33.040
always going to be someone that is looking over the project keeping tabs on where it is.

06:33.040 --> 06:38.140
It means that there's someone there who's probably in charge of keeping the quality high and making

06:38.140 --> 06:41.840
sure that your deadlines get done on time if something goes wrong.

06:41.890 --> 06:45.160
Say one of your workers is just behind schedule.

06:45.160 --> 06:50.260
You have recourse for that you could always point that information towards the person who's in charge

06:50.260 --> 06:54.940
of the project or the business manager and that's a way that you can apply pressure to speed things

06:54.940 --> 06:58.050
along or kind of voice any concerns that you're having.

06:58.150 --> 07:04.420
Management layers also provide quite a bit of guidance a lot of them will give you insight and expertise

07:04.420 --> 07:08.410
that you wouldn't necessarily have if you're just working with the individual person that's doing your

07:08.410 --> 07:09.180
work.

07:09.190 --> 07:13.690
They also allow you to spend less time on your project.

07:13.840 --> 07:19.450
You hire a freelancer you're going to need to do your check ups yourself you're going to need to work

07:19.450 --> 07:24.760
with them to make sure that they hit deadlines make sure that the quality is high and check in with

07:24.760 --> 07:27.060
them from time to time and that falls on you.

07:27.070 --> 07:32.680
But with a group that has a management layer you have to do less and less so if you're more comfortable

07:32.680 --> 07:33.980
doing less work.

07:34.210 --> 07:39.450
I would say that probably going with a firm is is is a more advantageous situation for you.

07:39.450 --> 07:42.390
Now let's talk about the cons of working with a firm.

07:42.610 --> 07:47.200
Now the cons of working at the firm are actually it's kind of the flip side of the pros that I just

07:47.200 --> 07:52.780
introduce So we talked about how they can offload work in times of need.

07:52.780 --> 07:57.700
Well often what happens with the firm is that they will do that and you will not be aware of that it's

07:57.700 --> 07:58.780
happening.

07:58.780 --> 08:05.200
There's a certain temptation with groups to shift the load around to wherever it's convenient to make

08:05.380 --> 08:10.960
room for more important clients or make room so that they can close sales with other clients.

08:10.960 --> 08:16.060
Now that is usually a detriment to your project and you might not be aware of it happening now if you're

08:16.060 --> 08:20.830
doing a web or mobile application typically are going to have what's called a lead developer a lead

08:20.830 --> 08:23.310
developer is going to be the person who owns your project.

08:23.310 --> 08:24.330
They know everything about it.

08:24.340 --> 08:27.650
They understand every single piece of your codebase.

08:27.670 --> 08:33.490
Now if a firm is tempted to offload work they might switch that person off to another project and have

08:33.490 --> 08:34.650
someone fill their shoes.

08:34.690 --> 08:40.660
That is almost always a problem for your code quality and your project quality because the person coming

08:40.660 --> 08:47.500
in cannot possibly know the project as well as the person who just left because firms and projects typically

08:47.500 --> 08:53.650
will work with some kind of a specialist model where someone is the specialist on your project or the

08:53.650 --> 08:56.100
lead on your project.

08:56.140 --> 09:01.810
Then when they offload or they shift work between employees or staff members that can actually be a

09:01.810 --> 09:02.710
problem.

09:02.720 --> 09:07.840
So obviously the way that you remedy this is you look for your people are thorough when you look at

09:07.840 --> 09:11.780
their portfolio and you look at the final kind of in piece.

09:11.830 --> 09:17.380
So he's obviously helpful to talk to people directly to talk to the clients that these firms have worked

09:17.380 --> 09:17.650
with.

09:17.650 --> 09:20.160
But it's something to keep in mind that this could happen.

09:20.170 --> 09:24.700
Now another con of working with the firm is that you might not get the individualized attention that

09:24.700 --> 09:26.730
you need for your project.

09:26.950 --> 09:31.480
You might also kind of have an issue where the people that you talk with directly who probably the project

09:31.480 --> 09:37.300
manager or the business manager might not understand your project on a technical level as well as they

09:37.300 --> 09:37.840
should.

09:37.840 --> 09:43.540
Now keep in mind project managers business managers they have to spread their time between you and probably

09:43.540 --> 09:48.550
a ton of other projects that have to keep the lights on at their firms so they can't be an expert in

09:48.640 --> 09:54.160
everything that you're talking about and they can't necessarily give you a large amount of their attention

09:54.190 --> 09:57.100
and time like you would usually expect from a freelancer.

09:57.160 --> 10:03.670
Now also it's kind of a difficult thing in the sense that because a project manager they might not be

10:03.700 --> 10:08.650
technical you could be the case that you might have some communication issues where you can't get the

10:08.650 --> 10:13.930
answers that you want from a business manager but you do didn't speak to the directly to the person

10:13.930 --> 10:18.460
that's doing the work either call in with working with the firm is that when you look at their portfolio

10:18.460 --> 10:24.100
it can be a little bit tricky because when you go and hire them for a project you're not a hundred percent

10:24.100 --> 10:31.290
guaranteed to the employee that you saw are associated with one of their portfolio items so say there

10:31.300 --> 10:35.680
is a Web site they built that thing is just beautiful and you make your decision to use them based off

10:35.680 --> 10:36.930
of that portfolio item.

10:36.940 --> 10:41.410
Now the person who made that it's very possible that they're not even at the firm any more.

10:41.410 --> 10:45.790
They could be long gone or they could be there and you might not get access to them.

10:45.790 --> 10:51.970
Now keep in mind firms have to on board new users new designers developers whatever it is that you're

10:51.970 --> 10:52.990
using.

10:52.990 --> 10:57.730
So there's a varying degree of veteran Sea and expertise in the groups.

10:57.730 --> 11:00.300
You don't always know exactly what you're going to get.

11:00.310 --> 11:05.470
Now here's the biggest con of them all firms are more expensive.

11:05.470 --> 11:09.400
They're inherently more expensive because of the biggest pro that we mentioned.

11:09.400 --> 11:14.980
They have a management layer those people you deal with project managers business managers they have

11:15.940 --> 11:17.380
their own salaries.

11:17.380 --> 11:23.530
So when you get a project estimate or even a per hour estimate baked into that cost will include some

11:23.530 --> 11:29.200
management cost labor but also you need to keep in mind that since it's a business they are doing it

11:29.200 --> 11:34.090
for some reason and there's probably a profit margin included in that.

11:34.090 --> 11:40.000
Now it's impossible to tell how much of your estimate is a profit margin but safe to say that at least

11:40.000 --> 11:41.890
some of it is actually their margin.

11:41.890 --> 11:47.030
Firms have to advertise themselves firms often have very large marketing budgets.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.680
Those things get paid for by raising the price of the actual work they end up doing.

11:51.730 --> 11:57.490
So inherently firms are going to be more expensive and like any contract relationship there's going

11:57.490 --> 12:02.260
to be a negative incentive where the contractor is going to want to cut costs.

12:02.260 --> 12:07.330
The biggest difference between a freelancer cutting costs and a firm cutting costs is that firms can

12:07.330 --> 12:12.670
cut costs in many different ways that you would not even be aware of because you don't even know exactly

12:12.670 --> 12:15.070
what goes into the price that you're giving you.

12:15.070 --> 12:18.850
So they could very easily cut costs in areas that you are not even aware of.

12:18.850 --> 12:21.180
So that could be an issue.

12:21.220 --> 12:26.320
Typically transparency is harder with a firm now freelancers on the flip side of this.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.100
There are a totally different beast.

12:28.210 --> 12:32.230
A freelancer really is as good as your relationship with them.

12:32.500 --> 12:37.540
Now finding someone whos capable is just as important as finding someone that you can communicate with

12:37.810 --> 12:38.600
effectively.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.780
But the pros are a freelancer.

12:40.920 --> 12:44.880
Theyre probably what you think with a little bit of surprises.

12:44.890 --> 12:49.720
Now the pros of working with a freelancer are very similar to the opposite of what you'd expect with

12:49.720 --> 12:51.670
a firm now with freelancers.

12:51.670 --> 12:53.290
They are inherently cheaper.

12:53.290 --> 12:55.280
You are only paying for them.

12:55.330 --> 12:57.800
And what exactly they think their time is worth.

12:57.850 --> 13:02.620
The pros also are that if you look at their portfolio you know exactly who made that.

13:02.620 --> 13:05.450
So when you hire them you know exactly what you're getting.

13:05.470 --> 13:09.100
Another pro is that freelancers are easier to haggle with.

13:09.100 --> 13:12.190
Firms have kind of a set in stone way that they work.

13:12.190 --> 13:16.990
They usually just have a price that they charge and it's very hard to get them to move because they

13:16.990 --> 13:18.500
have to pay for so many different things.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.390
But a freelancer you really can work with them.

13:21.430 --> 13:28.180
And typically if a freelancer I'd say had 40 hours a week of work they would charge a lot less than

13:28.180 --> 13:33.760
what they're quoting you but they quote you that because they simply do not work 40 hours or work 40

13:33.760 --> 13:37.530
hours a week with billable hours they might be working 40 hours a week.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.450
But it's not always going to be paid.

13:39.460 --> 13:40.870
Now obviously that's a generalization.

13:40.870 --> 13:46.900
Some freelancers are very popular and very well established and so maybe they're overflowing with work.

13:46.930 --> 13:53.140
But it's typically the case that they like to compensate for the time they are not getting paid by raising

13:53.140 --> 13:55.710
the price during the times in which they are getting paid.

13:55.720 --> 14:02.590
So there's always a little room to wiggle because for them it's not worth spending time closing deals

14:03.010 --> 14:05.770
talking about contracts talking about money.

14:05.920 --> 14:10.780
They don't make money when they're trying to fish in contracts and really make money when they're actually

14:10.780 --> 14:12.670
doing them and getting paid for them.

14:12.670 --> 14:18.520
Another pro is that in general they're less busy just in general and that's simply because someone is

14:18.520 --> 14:19.510
a freelancer.

14:19.510 --> 14:24.460
They spend most of their time and they try to spend most of their time working on whatever it is they

14:24.460 --> 14:27.620
are an expert at whatever it is that they do freelance work for.

14:27.640 --> 14:32.620
Now a firm again could have someone that's literally dedicated to finding projects.

14:32.620 --> 14:35.880
So in general a freelancer is getting a lot more flexible.

14:35.900 --> 14:39.880
They generally have pockets of hours that are available all the time.

14:39.880 --> 14:44.640
That means that if you have more of a loose project timeline much easier to work with a freelancer.

14:44.680 --> 14:48.220
Now the cons are obviously related to what we said kind of previously in the firm section.

14:48.250 --> 14:52.380
Now a freelancer one of the biggest cons is what happens if they get sick.

14:52.450 --> 14:56.950
What happens if they disappear what happens if they lose motivation they're only one person so if that

14:56.950 --> 14:59.530
happens your project could literally come to a standstill.

14:59.530 --> 15:05.200
Another con is kind of related to what we talked about as a benefit to a firm and that a freelancer

15:05.230 --> 15:08.410
could run into a problem that they cannot solve.

15:08.440 --> 15:14.350
Freelancers do not always have extensive networks from people they can get consulting from people they

15:14.350 --> 15:16.470
can ask for help when they hit a snag.

15:16.630 --> 15:23.110
Again a lot of projects require multiple expertise so a freelancer is more likely to run into something

15:23.110 --> 15:28.930
they do not know because again there are only one person that can mean for your project slower delivery

15:28.930 --> 15:33.400
times and potentially they could run into a problem that's completely unsolvable.

15:33.400 --> 15:37.010
So those are the pros and cons working with a firm working with a freelancer.

15:37.060 --> 15:39.370
They do actually end up making quite a big of a difference.

15:39.370 --> 15:45.130
I think the biggest thing you should pay attention to freelancers are cheaper firms are more expensive

15:45.310 --> 15:48.360
freelancers going require a lot more time for you.

15:48.370 --> 15:51.320
Firms are going to require a lot less time for you.

15:51.370 --> 15:57.310
Typically this is not always true but if you had to go for an average firms do deliver better work on

15:57.310 --> 16:03.450
average because they have management layer and they also have more expertise spread than a freelancer.

16:03.490 --> 16:08.270
And that obviously is how they justify how much they charge it is usually more than a freelancer.

16:08.290 --> 16:12.930
So there are some general questions that you should ask yourself when you're trying to determine what's

16:12.940 --> 16:14.950
a better fit for you firm or freelancer.

16:14.950 --> 16:18.020
So first off is your project time sensitive.

16:18.040 --> 16:23.290
Now you're listening before you can probably figure out which one is better for that because firms can

16:23.320 --> 16:24.510
shift load.

16:24.540 --> 16:31.000
And because firms have larger reputations they're probably a better choice if you are very time sensitive

16:31.000 --> 16:31.800
project.

16:31.810 --> 16:35.920
What I mean by that is if you have a project that you needed by a certain date and it's not ready by

16:35.920 --> 16:41.630
a certain date how big of a pain or a pain event or problem are you going to have.

16:41.710 --> 16:45.970
Now if you have a looser timeline something you want to build that you don't need to launch it right

16:45.970 --> 16:48.140
this second or get it done right this second.

16:48.190 --> 16:51.440
Freelancers are going to be a much better option for you.

16:51.460 --> 16:53.020
Now the question you should ask yourself.

16:53.140 --> 16:55.750
Have you contracted out work before.

16:55.750 --> 17:02.430
How experienced are you working with contracted firms that are outside of your core unit.

17:02.500 --> 17:08.950
If you have more experience you're probably going to be able to handle more of the management and deal

17:08.950 --> 17:12.820
with more of the issues that come up as you go along through the process.

17:12.850 --> 17:18.010
That means that you are probably more fit to work with the freelancer now if you're less experienced

17:18.020 --> 17:22.150
if this is the first time you've ever contracted something out it might be the case that you want to

17:22.150 --> 17:25.450
work with the firm because of that management layer that we talked about.

17:25.450 --> 17:29.560
Another question you ask yourself how big is your budget if you have a healthy budget.

17:29.560 --> 17:36.130
You have a budget that is well over what some people have been estimating or ballpark for you then it

17:36.130 --> 17:39.240
might be the case that you can you have the luxury of working with the firm.

17:39.250 --> 17:44.410
Now if you're on a budget that's more tight or maybe you just don't want to spend as much than a freelancer

17:44.410 --> 17:46.480
is probably the better option for you.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.970
Another question you should ask yourself how complicated is your technology.

17:50.020 --> 17:53.740
Does it bring in multiple expertise talked about this previously.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.250
Firms are better at managing multiple expertise.

17:57.370 --> 18:02.650
A lot of times you might want to build something that has different pieces of it that are completely

18:02.650 --> 18:04.330
different technologies.

18:04.360 --> 18:08.010
That's typically the case for our forms firm's going to perform better.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.840
Now that's not to say a freelancer can't do it.

18:09.850 --> 18:14.160
It just means it might take them more time because they may have to learn something along the way.

18:14.170 --> 18:15.590
I'll give you an example.

18:15.610 --> 18:22.750
We've built a social networking app that's on your phone and it had a very large module where you could

18:22.750 --> 18:25.240
take photographs and apply filters to it.

18:25.240 --> 18:32.530
Now the standard expertise for building an iOS application it's not related to doing say core changes

18:32.590 --> 18:34.090
to your camera.

18:34.480 --> 18:39.730
That's actually something that's called core image core image is something that a developer might specialize

18:39.730 --> 18:44.000
in but it's not something you should expect that every single iOS developer should know.

18:44.020 --> 18:47.980
And the last thing I think you should ask yourself is how involved in the project do you want to be.

18:47.980 --> 18:51.670
Do you want to have formal meetings or informal meetings.

18:51.670 --> 18:58.000
How often do you want to check in with your freelancer or your firm or whoever is doing your project.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.900
Freelancers are such the case that they are actually burdened by having constant formal updates.

19:04.990 --> 19:10.290
You check in with them three times a week to see a significant slowdown in your project.

19:10.330 --> 19:15.610
Now firms with the other hand have people who are dedicated to keeping you up to date with what's happening

19:15.610 --> 19:19.310
so you can use as much time as you want from those people.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.470
Really it's up to you.

19:20.500 --> 19:25.690
It's up to your comfort level it's kind of actually up to what you expect to come out of the project.

19:25.690 --> 19:31.450
So hopefully now have some kind of an idea of why someone needs a firm and why someone is a freelancer

19:31.450 --> 19:37.810
and you should have a decent indication of where your project lies within the kind of continuum and

19:37.840 --> 19:41.290
you should be able to make an educated decision as to who to go forward with.

19:41.290 --> 19:48.670
All right I'll see in the next lecture.
