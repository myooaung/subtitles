00:10.700 --> 00:11.900
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

00:11.900 --> 00:16.370
So in this lecture we're going to talk about another common scenario that could happen in the worst

00:16.370 --> 00:17.670
case scenario.

00:17.820 --> 00:23.060
This is when you have a freelancer or a contractor or outsource firm and they're consistently missing

00:23.060 --> 00:24.010
deadlines.

00:24.020 --> 00:28.670
Now in general if you're outsourcing that you need to know that you should be at least a little bit

00:28.670 --> 00:31.450
flexible with your deadlines.

00:31.820 --> 00:37.190
And if you're really a stickler for time and when things get done then you need to be working with someone

00:37.190 --> 00:41.170
you at least have a rapport with or someone you know shows up on time.

00:41.360 --> 00:48.410
Typically when you do the $50 test I like to give freelancers a real small segment of things to work

00:48.410 --> 00:55.790
on just too many other things test to see how quickly they can get it done whether or not they can match

00:55.790 --> 00:58.280
the deadline that they themselves have made.

00:58.280 --> 01:03.860
So if you followed the $50 test you'll probably know whether or not this person hits their deadlines

01:03.890 --> 01:04.790
or not.

01:04.790 --> 01:10.580
Now of course it can always happen that you know the did perfectly on the $50 test but then later they

01:10.580 --> 01:16.370
have family issues or something else is happening that creates some tension with the deadlines.

01:16.370 --> 01:21.150
So first off you understand if they are missing their deadlines there's typically only three things.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.900
In my experience that are happening.

01:23.930 --> 01:31.100
One is that they are having something like a personal emergency or they're having to spend a lot of

01:31.100 --> 01:32.750
their time elsewhere in life.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.200
It could be another project.

01:34.310 --> 01:39.470
It could be moving it could be traveling it could be something else that's sucking up their time.

01:39.470 --> 01:43.810
The second thing could be that they have overextended themselves in terms of the project.

01:43.810 --> 01:46.630
It's a lot more complicated than they thought.

01:46.760 --> 01:50.360
And they're finding or that they're finding it's a lot more tedious than they thought.

01:50.360 --> 01:56.450
So their previous estimates of their timeline might be inaccurate because they're finding out that it's

01:56.450 --> 02:02.060
a lot harder and the last thing is that you might just have a freelancer who is not particularly motivated

02:02.060 --> 02:04.430
to finish your project on time.

02:04.460 --> 02:10.040
This is the least likely scenario because if you did a good job of looking at their past work vetting

02:10.040 --> 02:15.500
them assessing them and making a good decision about a freelancer and you did the $50 test you should

02:15.500 --> 02:20.240
know whether or not this person is mature and whether or not they're going to run out of gas halfway

02:20.240 --> 02:25.370
through their project or just from the get go not be serious about delivering on time.

02:25.430 --> 02:31.070
So the likelihood that it's just an amateur freelancer it's possible if you pick someone who has no

02:31.070 --> 02:33.210
reviews they have no skin in the game.

02:33.210 --> 02:37.250
There might be even just testing out this whole freelancer thing and they realize halfway through that

02:37.250 --> 02:39.140
they just can't do it anymore.

02:39.350 --> 02:42.710
The best way to get around this is just to do some basic vetting.

02:42.710 --> 02:47.090
Make sure you have lots of beer on your bids and your projects and make sure you pick someone who has

02:47.090 --> 02:51.630
a track record now dealing with someone who has an external life event.

02:51.770 --> 02:53.640
That's a lot trickier.

02:53.660 --> 02:58.670
You need to basically have an open communication with them if they're missing deadlines to figure out

02:58.670 --> 03:03.870
what it is that's causing them to miss the deadlines and they do tell you that it's a family issue.

03:03.890 --> 03:06.940
Make sure that you're skeptical when I say skeptical.

03:06.950 --> 03:12.410
I mean it is very plausible that they have family issues that does happen quite often.

03:12.410 --> 03:18.260
However those things typically don't just come up out of the blue and if they do and the person is a

03:18.260 --> 03:23.810
good freelancer they would have told you every step of the way they wouldn't just tell you after you

03:23.810 --> 03:26.250
asked why are you missing your deadlines.

03:26.270 --> 03:28.640
Let's say you're freelancer's wife is having a baby.

03:28.670 --> 03:33.590
They would probably tell you up front when that's happening that they're pregnant.

03:33.590 --> 03:38.060
They're expecting they might even tell you a couple of days afterwards.

03:38.060 --> 03:41.090
The point is they will tell you you don't have to ask.

03:41.150 --> 03:46.490
Now if they keep telling you oh family event Oh family event it might be the case that they're just

03:46.490 --> 03:51.170
using that as a cover all excuse to cover the fact that they're just missing their deadlines.

03:51.170 --> 03:56.600
A lot of times they'll use it to cover up what's happening which is that they're spending time on another

03:56.600 --> 03:57.480
project.

03:57.710 --> 03:59.950
What you need to do is you need to be frank with them.

03:59.960 --> 04:04.760
And if it is the case and you're getting a repeated excuse saying I have a family event or a family

04:04.760 --> 04:10.310
problem you need to say to them Are you missing deadlines because you have other project work.

04:10.310 --> 04:15.530
Explain to them that you understand that freelancers take on multiple projects at once and then just

04:15.530 --> 04:19.790
ask them the question if it is the case that they are working on other projects that you need to make

04:19.790 --> 04:25.560
sure that they understand that they misrepresenting themselves upfront.

04:25.670 --> 04:33.500
You need to make sure that they understand that this is not OK and that they should have told you beforehand.

04:33.680 --> 04:39.880
In general you should always make sure that the person is responsive and the person is not overly busy.

04:39.920 --> 04:45.320
And we deal with that previously in the course by looking at things like responsiveness by looking at

04:45.320 --> 04:50.700
reviews looking at their track records giving them small pieces of things to work on.

04:50.720 --> 04:55.970
And if you do that you can just figure out very quickly whether or not there's someone who does take

04:55.970 --> 04:58.610
on other projects that they don't tell you about.

04:58.610 --> 05:02.850
The point here though is that you need to facilitate communication as much as possible.

05:02.930 --> 05:07.580
If you do run into a landmine like this they're not doing their delivery deadlines and they admit to

05:07.580 --> 05:12.560
you that they have another project and you to have a frank with them about rescheduling your deadlines

05:13.400 --> 05:19.550
and potentially having monetary damages you might need to explain to them that every time they miss

05:19.550 --> 05:27.350
a deadline this is what it costs you and use that as a basic way of incentivizing them to re prioritize

05:27.350 --> 05:28.960
your project over the other.

05:28.990 --> 05:34.750
Now there's really not a ton you can do if this is the case that they have another project and you're

05:34.760 --> 05:39.380
in it for the long haul you're in a project that's long term really you can just try to make sure that

05:39.380 --> 05:45.710
they de-prioritize the other one or at least understand when they're done with the other one or why

05:45.710 --> 05:49.680
they thought that they could handle two at the same time but they can't.

05:49.680 --> 05:54.700
And then just try to re correct your course being flexible being communicative.

05:54.710 --> 05:56.740
Those are the things that are going to help you get through this.

05:56.740 --> 06:00.680
There are also the things that are going to help you prevent this from or from becoming a big problem.

06:00.680 --> 06:06.590
Now the other scenario was that they found out this is a lot more complicated and that's not something

06:06.590 --> 06:08.360
that's going to pop up very quickly.

06:08.360 --> 06:12.740
It's usually something that if they've missed a couple deadlines you need to ask them why they're missing

06:12.740 --> 06:15.040
them and you need to understand what's happening.

06:15.200 --> 06:19.700
And a lot of times they explain to you upfront that these sections took a lot longer and always try

06:19.700 --> 06:26.030
to play them down and say oh it's just because of this one section yada yada yada I'll be on schedule.

06:26.030 --> 06:31.080
Going forward you need to explain to them that it's not necessarily that they hit their deadlines.

06:31.190 --> 06:36.980
You know when they're going to be finished again don't ever try to outsource when you have hard core

06:36.980 --> 06:40.720
deadlines meaning if you miss a deadline the whole ship falls apart.

06:40.940 --> 06:42.920
Your entire company collapses.

06:42.920 --> 06:47.540
You need to always outsource when you have a least a little bit of flexibility or a really strong rapport

06:47.540 --> 06:48.940
with the person you're working with.

06:49.010 --> 06:53.960
So as long as they understand that it's not about deadlines it's about when you should expect the work

06:53.960 --> 07:01.840
to be done then you can open up that kind of communication about readjusting your deadlines readjusting

07:01.850 --> 07:06.850
your expectations and then that should be the case that it should become easier.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.970
The only downside to this is you might just have to downgrade your expectations as to how fast your

07:10.970 --> 07:12.050
project gets done.

07:12.230 --> 07:16.280
And to be honest this happens all the time in projects all the time.

07:16.280 --> 07:20.870
People jump in and they realize there's a lot more complicated than they thought and it might take an

07:20.870 --> 07:23.040
extra week two weeks or even a month.

07:23.150 --> 07:30.070
Web projects online projects a lot of times they are very very hard to predict upfront how hard it's

07:30.080 --> 07:34.130
going to be you just don't know how complex something is going to be and that's how you spend a lot

07:34.130 --> 07:34.990
of time with it.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.750
So try to be flexible.

07:36.860 --> 07:43.070
Try to establish as much communication as you can try to figure out what exactly is causing the delay

07:43.790 --> 07:45.140
and then try to limit it.

07:45.140 --> 07:50.630
Once you've figured out what exactly the problem is if it's something that's unfixable Well then you

07:50.630 --> 07:56.570
probably saw this coming down the road and you probably if you've used a milestone system have prevented

07:56.570 --> 07:58.640
yourself from taking a large hit on it.

07:58.700 --> 08:03.050
But the vast majority of cases it can be fixed it can be remedied.

08:03.050 --> 08:06.730
You might just have to downgrade your expectations about when the project's going to be done.

08:06.740 --> 08:09.800
