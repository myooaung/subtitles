WEBVTT

00:05.580 --> 00:13.900
Structure we are going to get into you know we're now at the phase we're building to sell all our life

00:13.900 --> 00:18.650
right now we're our local deli wireframe section.

00:18.670 --> 00:26.550
Now into some of the heavier tools I'm introducing you to the best wireframe tool because of this feature

00:26.540 --> 00:28.650
set top box.

00:28.700 --> 00:34.590
Right now we're just going to focus on JoCo this lecture I'm sure you see how it works you know roughly

00:34.590 --> 00:37.710
where do you find your pages and your canvas.

00:37.920 --> 00:44.040
Just trying to get oriented where you're not going to learn anything substantial of selection.

00:44.550 --> 00:50.400
You should open up perfectly fine with what you write to not just get in there it's hours trying to

00:50.700 --> 00:52.740
tinker around to show you what you need.

00:52.740 --> 00:53.930
All right.

00:54.270 --> 01:00.450
OK so let me show you Peter Oko and give you a very basic kind of overview of how you would get into

01:00.450 --> 01:08.290
the service and how you would use it to make your rapid prototypes or to make your wireframe.

01:08.370 --> 01:13.770
Now keep a minimum keep in mind I'm picking this because it's the most versatile of the wire framing

01:13.770 --> 01:16.080
prototyping tools out there.

01:16.080 --> 01:20.730
There's other ones that are better in certain categories this is the best because it has the best features.

01:21.030 --> 01:26.880
Now you can sign up with a free trial the 30 day price is not particularly expensive I think it's only

01:26.880 --> 01:31.560
like $12 a free trial out of credit card so you can try it out for 30 days.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.950
Again if you check something else out there that's perfectly fine.

01:34.950 --> 01:41.480
It's helpful to sign up if you want to follow along on this these lectures at the same time whatever

01:41.480 --> 01:47.440
I'm teaching you in Tokyo it's pretty much valid with any other one any other prototyping or wire for

01:47.440 --> 01:47.690
me.

01:47.700 --> 01:52.690
They all kind of use the same techniques and the same basic kind of understanding's.

01:52.740 --> 01:56.880
So you would just sign up giving them your email address but I've already signed up so what you generally

01:56.880 --> 02:02.730
just do is you go to my prototypes OK so they'll hit you up to sign up.

02:02.750 --> 02:03.500
But here we are.

02:03.500 --> 02:09.530
So basically just like any other web service I can create web prototype create a mobile prototype and

02:09.530 --> 02:13.800
then create a project folder if I want to be able to store my prototypes together.

02:14.030 --> 02:18.980
They use prototype as a generic term meaning what basically it means that you can add interactions you

02:18.980 --> 02:27.710
can add basic designs and you can make it easy you can easily move from page to page but you can also

02:27.710 --> 02:30.550
make a low fidelity wireframe tool.

02:30.560 --> 02:37.520
Same exact process so different from creating a web and mobile is that it's automatically going to start

02:37.520 --> 02:40.140
you off with what they call stencils.

02:40.160 --> 02:45.740
So in balsamic they're literally just called like elements in this they call them stencils and a stencil

02:45.740 --> 02:51.980
is just any type of element that you would use to show a button or show a page show a box show tax those

02:51.980 --> 02:53.780
are all stencils.

02:53.780 --> 02:58.910
They give you a different stencil set immediately but you can always access both stencil sites and then

02:58.920 --> 03:07.460
when they start you off with a smaller screen so they automatically put the screen or the canvas size

03:07.640 --> 03:10.630
to what your wireframe should be.

03:10.640 --> 03:15.170
That's helpful because you don't have to like look up or you know exactly what the resolution for your

03:15.170 --> 03:17.150
mobile app is.

03:17.150 --> 03:24.780
Keep in mind this doesn't actually work for every single mobile in the sense that you know Samsung Galaxy

03:24.800 --> 03:27.200
want is a different size and an iPhone 4.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.360
It's just going to start you off with a generic size.

03:29.480 --> 03:34.520
So we can always just we can take a cruise with the web prototype version.

03:34.520 --> 03:39.100
Now what's interesting about JoCo And another thing I like about it is that it's all web based.

03:39.170 --> 03:44.900
Meaning that you can so long as you have your laptop or anyone else's computers only have access to

03:44.900 --> 03:50.370
the Internet you can work on your prototypes and your wireframe but one of the downsides of both Somma

03:50.420 --> 03:55.970
and I know that they just did release a online version is that they have to download it onto your computer

03:55.970 --> 03:58.120
and it's only Mac.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.290
So this is the way that it works.

04:00.620 --> 04:05.590
When we create a page you would call it a page.

04:05.630 --> 04:10.280
Now in like other ones you might just have a gigantic canvas you might just throw everything on there

04:10.280 --> 04:12.770
and save it as one PTF and then move on to a new tab.

04:12.780 --> 04:14.310
Then you're just going to call pages.

04:14.310 --> 04:15.990
So this is what a page looks like.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.480
So a page this is the standard page.

04:20.780 --> 04:26.480
It looks like the grid paper that we used before when we are sketching them out physically it automatically

04:26.480 --> 04:32.500
just shows me a common resolution for web and mobile browsers.

04:32.510 --> 04:37.010
Keep in mind obviously someone on a Mac Book 11 inches going to have something different than someone

04:37.010 --> 04:38.810
on a Chromebook PC.

04:39.170 --> 04:41.270
But it's a good starting point.

04:41.450 --> 04:45.140
So I'll go back to the editor and we're going to jump into this in just a second.

04:45.170 --> 04:47.220
But that's what a page looks like.

04:47.270 --> 04:50.520
Literally once I start creating a page here that's what I would call page.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.740
I want to start from scratch.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.350
Could another one just create another page.

04:54.350 --> 05:00.470
OK so here is where you would list start your folder so say I was making a prototype and it had multiple

05:00.470 --> 05:05.180
pages I could create a folder and put all of those in there and that's a great way of organizing your

05:05.180 --> 05:05.780
stuff.

05:05.780 --> 05:10.370
Keep in mind guys if you do multiple ideas there are multiple prototypes and you throw them all together

05:10.370 --> 05:15.390
if you're not labeling properly you can get very confused as to which ones go to where.

05:15.470 --> 05:19.550
Because you know if you're making two different web sites you might have a log in page for each single

05:19.550 --> 05:25.100
one and you might forget to label that specifically to which project it's.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.130
So screen flows.

05:27.560 --> 05:34.370
What those are are they're used to take all of your pages up here and then to visually display them

05:34.400 --> 05:40.890
on a board and then you draw arrows between the two or between all your pages a show or relationship.

05:40.910 --> 05:43.420
It's very similar to creating a map.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.870
Later we're going to create a site map but I'm going to show you how I do it because the assumption

05:47.870 --> 05:53.150
is by the time you make your sitemap have all the other pages made you do your sitemap at the beginning.

05:53.150 --> 05:55.310
You can do at the end doesn't really matter.

05:55.310 --> 05:57.630
Screenplays are very helpful for developers.

05:57.680 --> 06:04.370
They're not particularly helpful for designers although you know more information is always better but

06:04.550 --> 06:11.810
typically the screenplay is just literally like a representation of pages or floating in space with

06:12.080 --> 06:13.380
arrows pointing to them.

06:13.460 --> 06:17.710
It helps to like things like users sign up for instance if I'm signing up to a page where I can do is

06:17.730 --> 06:20.670
like a show page one being my log in page 2.

06:20.690 --> 06:26.010
Now that I'm logged in my options page 3 if I click on this where does it take me to.

06:26.060 --> 06:28.730
It seems very useful for things like firearms as well.

06:29.030 --> 06:30.790
No layers.

06:30.960 --> 06:36.710
All the right tools will operate in a layer system if you use balsamic.

06:36.710 --> 06:41.480
You'll notice that they don't label layers they just have them automatically stacked and then all you

06:41.480 --> 06:47.060
do is push things down and up through layers like this one that you have the option of creating layers

06:47.840 --> 06:52.160
and creating a system called Global layers and I'll explain that to you later on as we dive into the

06:52.260 --> 06:54.080
editor global players.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.430
In general though what that means is you can create a layer and it has stencils.

06:58.430 --> 07:04.460
Basically that means if I created a bunch of objects on a page I could decide that those are actually

07:04.460 --> 07:11.630
a layer then I can very easily use those layers later on different pages custom stencils.

07:11.630 --> 07:15.590
This is also something that's specific to Oko.

07:15.590 --> 07:19.560
You can create your own stencils and I'll show you later how you can do that.

07:19.580 --> 07:23.400
It is quite helpful if you really want to have a customized set of stencils.

07:23.590 --> 07:28.970
If you know you have to make 30 pages of an application and you know you're only using the same say

07:28.970 --> 07:32.580
like 15 things over and over again you can create custom since.

07:32.630 --> 07:34.250
It'll save you a lot of time.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.410
OK so I will dive right in the editor.

07:36.800 --> 07:41.750
OK so the editor looks pretty much like any other wireframe thing too if you have to use them.

07:41.750 --> 07:48.110
Here is nice save the bread crumbs and bread crumbs means as it shows the trail through the screens

07:48.110 --> 07:48.920
that you're going through.

07:48.920 --> 07:54.260
So if I wanted to go back I could very easily just go back to my prototype here and I'm again looking

07:54.260 --> 07:59.390
at that screen and we're just at and then I can jump right back into my page.

07:59.390 --> 08:04.030
I suggest that you always always label every single page you make.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.010
And so what you can do is just double tap.

08:07.110 --> 08:09.230
So I could say test page.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.150
This is always very very helpful.

08:11.150 --> 08:14.850
Please don't get lazy it will come and bite you later.

08:15.350 --> 08:16.660
But you know this is usually how this works.

08:16.670 --> 08:23.650
This area right here is called the canvas and a canvas is you know it's kind of it's an art term.

08:23.660 --> 08:28.400
But designers use it all the time it's whatever you're painting on it's whatever you're designing on

08:28.400 --> 08:31.170
or whatever you're writing on that is your canvas.

08:31.280 --> 08:31.510
OK.

08:31.520 --> 08:35.590
So on the left hand side we just have a column and these are the stencil.

08:35.600 --> 08:39.580
So before if you didn't know what I meant by sensel these are what they are.

08:39.860 --> 08:45.180
You have coarse stencils static stencils and then icons stencils and other things.

08:45.190 --> 08:49.350
Here's where we will create custom stencils of show you that in another lecture.

08:49.550 --> 08:55.340
But essentially what these are things that I can literally pick up and grab and move on to the canvas

08:56.000 --> 09:00.590
and that's how I'm going to visually put together my wireframe so that the question itself is helpful

09:00.590 --> 09:05.770
because these are things that every single page has every single page is going to be taxed.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.380
So I can throw text on here and I can edit it

09:11.500 --> 09:17.560
and here what I want to do is since this is just text what they mean is that you want to use this any

09:17.570 --> 09:21.730
time you want to make custom text you know anytime you want to use something that you don't want to

09:21.730 --> 09:25.280
be specific about how long it is how short it is what font it is what color it is.

09:25.360 --> 09:29.610
This is what we're going to use here constantly reaching up and grabbing this.

09:29.680 --> 09:33.400
But if you want to be more specific and say you want to put a paragraph of text you can do things like

09:33.400 --> 09:40.150
this automatically creates you a text block and then you can shorten it if you want it to be shorter.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.270
And it's a good time saver.

09:43.270 --> 09:46.690
Now you might think oh well that saved me was like 10 seconds.

09:46.690 --> 09:50.770
Trust me it adds up when you're wyer framing and same similar.

09:50.770 --> 09:56.680
Here we have things like headlines and I can pull in a headline and this is automatically set to a size

09:56.680 --> 10:04.600
that's helpful for me so if I'm making a landing page I can use a headline right here and like say put

10:04.600 --> 10:10.430
it up at the top right here and then headline two is easy because that's almost always a subtitle.

10:10.510 --> 10:21.200
So I can always make my subtitle like this or maybe even use a headline theory.
