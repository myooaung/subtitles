So you might be thinking that the criteria that we went over in a previous lecture about how to pick

00:11.350 --> 00:17.230
a good freelancer you might think that that is not bulletproof and you might still have a little bit

00:17.230 --> 00:23.830
of anxiety around picking someone and giving are growing a large amount of money and you're not even

00:23.830 --> 00:26.530
sure whether or not they're going to be able to produce what you want.

00:27.580 --> 00:31.600
At first I say go offer those five criteria I had listed before.

00:31.780 --> 00:33.580
That's never going to let you down.

00:33.700 --> 00:38.640
But there is one way that you can take this validation to the next step.

00:38.650 --> 00:43.710
I call this the $50 test because it costs about $50 or $100.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.890
It's a very small amount of money.

00:45.910 --> 00:51.210
Now what you want to do and this is a tactic that's worked for me many many many times.

00:51.250 --> 00:57.790
This is actually how I've developed some of my longest lasting contractor relationships is once you've

00:57.790 --> 01:02.800
whittled down your list down to a very short list maybe you're talking two or three people or firms

01:03.160 --> 01:10.950
try taking off a very small side task and assigning it to them and then paying them for it.

01:10.960 --> 01:17.440
Now the whole idea behind this is you just want to validate how they actually operate.

01:17.440 --> 01:22.690
Once you are a client now a lot of people are really good at pitching themselves and selling themselves

01:22.690 --> 01:28.750
and of them have really flashy portfolios but you can never be 100 percent sure until you actually work

01:28.750 --> 01:29.800
with them.

01:29.800 --> 01:36.130
Now if you just pick something really simple I suggest once you pick your graphic design what you can

01:36.130 --> 01:41.620
do is you can take that graphic design and in a lot of cases it's just going to be an image like a photoshop

01:41.620 --> 01:47.620
file or you bought a template and you have an aged him file what you can do is you can assign them a

01:47.620 --> 01:48.690
very small task.

01:48.690 --> 01:54.380
So if it's a photoshop file just an image tell them that you want this to be converted into H.T. amounts.

01:54.420 --> 02:01.470
SS That is a relatively cheap task that shouldn't cost you a ton of money.

02:01.660 --> 02:06.480
And if you have an H DML template send it to them and say I want to change something about it trying

02:06.520 --> 02:07.610
to change something.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.140
Really anything.

02:09.430 --> 02:14.680
Say you know changing the width of something or changing the look around something.

02:14.680 --> 02:21.190
The point is is that once you give them a small piece to work with and then you can see how well you

02:21.190 --> 02:23.220
actually operate together.

02:23.290 --> 02:30.980
Whenever I do this almost invariably 50 percent of the people I give this tiny little $100 $50 test

02:30.980 --> 02:36.040
to they end up just failing all of a sudden the responsiveness changes all of a sudden I notice that

02:36.040 --> 02:42.250
there's a much larger gap in our communication than I thought before a lot and all of a sudden I find

02:42.250 --> 02:47.650
out that they don't really have the same design sensibilities that I previously thought they had or

02:47.650 --> 02:51.450
what was implied by looking at their portfolios.

02:51.460 --> 02:56.380
So in short give them the ultimate test if you're not sure if you want to work with them or you have

02:56.380 --> 03:00.880
a bunch of freelancers that you rate them all kind of equally and you don't know which way to go.

03:00.970 --> 03:03.540
Try tearing off a tiny little bit of work.

03:03.550 --> 03:06.000
Give it to them and then see how they operate.

03:06.010 --> 03:12.130
I guarantee you one of them will stick out way above the other ones and I'll make a decision so much

03:12.160 --> 03:13.070
easier.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.180
$50 or $100.

03:15.190 --> 03:20.920
It's not a lot of money when you consider how much money you could be spending on this person.

03:20.920 --> 03:27.090
And also think about whether or not your application actually takes off gets a lot of users gets lots

03:27.100 --> 03:27.940
of attention.

03:27.970 --> 03:32.740
You're going to want this developer to be in it for the long haul in case you need them.

03:32.830 --> 03:39.040
And so you're going to kick yourself in the head if you don't do a really simple validation trick and

03:39.040 --> 03:44.170
later down the line you find out this person is a lot more flaky than you thought you find out that

03:44.260 --> 03:52.320
they are not nearly as good at design or understanding what good web development standards are.

03:52.340 --> 03:56.980
You know there's a lot of different red flags that will come down later and you just want to make sure

03:56.980 --> 03:58.060
that it's not too late.

03:58.060 --> 04:08.380
When you notice them and this is hands down the best tactic I've ever used.
