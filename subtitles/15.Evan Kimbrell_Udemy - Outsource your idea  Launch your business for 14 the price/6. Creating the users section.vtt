WEBVTT

00:00.940 --> 00:04.370
OK so we're going to talk about the description of users section.

00:04.410 --> 00:06.930
You guys can call this really whatever you want.

00:06.930 --> 00:08.790
This section is entirely optional.

00:08.990 --> 00:14.560
This is something that in my experience your developer will love you if you do make.

00:14.650 --> 00:17.460
I mean if you don't make it it's not really a big deal.

00:17.490 --> 00:23.450
The entire point of this is that it's supposed to be helpful to understand the entirety of the application.

00:23.490 --> 00:28.680
It can help designers or developers think through the specific problems as they relate to your users

00:28.710 --> 00:34.620
and allows them to relay feedback back to you specifically saying hey this might not work or maybe you

00:34.620 --> 00:36.200
should think about adding this.

00:36.240 --> 00:43.560
So the way that I typically do this is I just try to imagine who is this app for and who's going to

00:43.560 --> 00:48.780
be using it when you came up with the idea for the Web site or the mobile application or whatever it

00:48.780 --> 00:49.750
is that you're building.

00:49.800 --> 00:53.840
You probably had some type of an idea of who it was for or who's going to be using it.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.120
Now this could be front facing customers.

00:56.130 --> 00:59.540
This could also be an internal application for employees.

00:59.700 --> 01:05.260
But the point here is to list out all of the types of people you think are going to be using it.

01:05.550 --> 01:09.120
And then just kind of describe them very quickly.

01:09.150 --> 01:14.400
It's really up to the developer designer or the contractor or whoever you're working with to take that

01:14.400 --> 01:16.770
information and do what they can with it.

01:16.860 --> 01:22.430
But it kind of helps because they might have actually gone through the entire description and thought

01:22.470 --> 01:24.030
this was for someone else.

01:24.060 --> 01:28.140
So the way they usually just do this is I just really like to list it out.

01:28.230 --> 01:34.890
I'll just list out say like one two and three if I can think of three types of users you get to be two.

01:35.400 --> 01:41.760
And then I like to just list out who I imagine using and I focus on distinct differences between user

01:41.760 --> 01:48.210
groups so I don't want to say for instance I'm not going to cater this to a college student who lives

01:48.210 --> 01:50.760
in a dorm or a college student who lives at home.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.630
Those are very these are too similar.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.830
I really want to separate this out by big differences.

01:55.830 --> 02:03.840
So in the case of the lovely application that we're using as an example I wouldn't want to say you know

02:03.840 --> 02:11.100
a 35 year old who lives in the ER in a big city and is frustrated with other applications.

02:11.130 --> 02:14.220
So try your best not to double up on these.

02:14.220 --> 02:17.510
Just try your best to think of what user groups you can.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.760
So I'll walk you through how I would do it for the lovely application.

02:20.760 --> 02:25.980
And you can kind of make your kind of piece it together for whatever you're building.

02:25.980 --> 02:31.000
So in this case we're building a deeding application in this theoretical spec sheet.

02:31.020 --> 02:35.540
So one thing is that one group is going to be female and one group is going to be male.

02:35.550 --> 02:36.030
Right.

02:36.060 --> 02:39.630
That's a big enough difference to list these as two separate users.

02:39.630 --> 02:53.550
What I would say is a male and I'll put the age range of say whatever it was 30 to 40 with some familiarity

02:54.240 --> 03:00.370
with web tools and other dating applications.

03:01.790 --> 03:11.670
Well say have smart phone not an expert at it.

03:11.720 --> 03:17.470
So that is pretty much the main user in this description of this theoretical model.

03:17.480 --> 03:22.760
There really aren't a wide variety of different types of users in other applications there's a lot of

03:22.760 --> 03:25.560
different types of users you could possibly think of.

03:25.700 --> 03:30.590
In this case it's actually quite simple but I'm just going to show you this that this is typically how

03:30.590 --> 03:31.820
we kind of list them out.

03:31.970 --> 03:36.710
I say familiarity with web tools because it's always helpful to let the developer know how familiar

03:36.800 --> 03:37.700
or the designer.

03:37.700 --> 03:41.040
How familiar are they with using basic web applications.

03:41.060 --> 03:44.200
You know most people use Facebook now.

03:44.210 --> 03:51.110
Not a lot of people use Facebook as well as say yik yak or any of the more popular applications that

03:51.110 --> 03:54.240
haven't yet gotten mainstream adoption.

03:54.290 --> 04:00.020
So I say that and I say familiar with other dating applications I could even say you know familiar with

04:00.020 --> 04:05.120
specific types of dating applications and they say have a smartphone that's helpful because they're

04:05.120 --> 04:06.610
building this as a web site.

04:06.710 --> 04:11.800
And you say they have a smartphone than you might think about making sure that this is smartphone friendly.

04:11.810 --> 04:15.800
Now if you said that they had for some reason your building application for say like a feature phone

04:16.010 --> 04:18.570
well then they need to build this entirely differently.

04:18.770 --> 04:23.840
But then I say not an expert at it and kind of what that means is that we should probably focus on things

04:23.840 --> 04:28.970
that are buttons and processes that are more common.

04:29.090 --> 04:34.590
They're simpler they're easier to understand not using for instance intuitive gestures.

04:34.610 --> 04:39.920
A lot of these newer applications that go after younger user base bases Well you know you open it with

04:39.920 --> 04:44.570
Sabai swiping your finger or you use finger gestures to control information.

04:44.570 --> 04:49.510
Now people who are not great with their phones a lot of them struggle with that.

04:49.520 --> 04:56.750
I you know I'm in my mid 20s and I even struggle with some of these applications that just assume that

04:56.750 --> 05:01.830
everyone knows what three lines are the grab three lines that means a tray opens.

05:01.850 --> 05:06.020
These are examples that people use that not everybody understands but you have to understand what your

05:06.020 --> 05:07.550
user group is going to look like.

05:07.730 --> 05:09.920
And writing this out definitely helps.

05:09.920 --> 05:16.580
And then here honestly I would just say female and then same thing but I might change a little bit of

05:16.580 --> 05:29.360
it so I could say female age range 30 to 40 30 to 40 some familiarity as well.

05:30.600 --> 05:35.910
But no familiarity with other dating sites.

05:35.940 --> 05:38.810
Now why do I put this so theoretically in your head.

05:38.820 --> 05:44.700
You might be thinking to yourself I'm going to go after a group of people that has no familiarity with

05:44.700 --> 05:49.380
other dating sites meeting like maybe you're not going to go run ads on OK Cupid.

05:49.380 --> 05:55.610
In this case you know we're trying to think of things that are completely unrelated as advertising channels.

05:55.770 --> 06:00.750
So in that case you don't know if they have experience with other dating sites so it's helpful to assume

06:00.750 --> 06:01.600
that they don't.

06:01.740 --> 06:08.400
In that case that means we're not going to be using the developer should know not to use defaults or

06:08.550 --> 06:13.320
type of our concepts that are used in other dating applications that wouldn't make sense outside of

06:13.350 --> 06:15.940
dating Web sites or dating mobile apps.

06:16.200 --> 06:22.570
So that I could say has a smartphone and is an expert with it.

06:22.770 --> 06:29.040
OK so now we know we have a mixed user base or whatever it is you can swear up male and female trying

06:29.040 --> 06:31.950
to say that females are better or smartphones.

06:32.280 --> 06:37.170
And then the last thing you could say you could probably try to characterize a different user group

06:37.440 --> 06:44.620
and say and they're free to use some of their concepts ideas and techniques in your application.

06:44.640 --> 06:49.560
It also means that if they're using multiple ones that kind of opens the door to whether or not you

06:49.560 --> 06:53.910
want to use integrations whether or not you think that you could integrate some other application into

06:53.910 --> 06:59.450
yours maybe they can log in with the information from the other application or import that information.

06:59.460 --> 07:13.140
We could say something like male or female already has a mobile application datings it interested and

07:13.140 --> 07:17.800
using multiple at once ONCE.

07:18.020 --> 07:23.270
OK so what would a designer developer contractor use with that information.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.610
They might just assume when you see this that means that they already have familiarity with other applications

07:28.610 --> 07:33.770
so they should take a look at the other applications to see what they do well or have some type of interaction

07:33.770 --> 07:34.380
with it.

07:35.520 --> 07:35.830
OK.

07:35.860 --> 07:40.950
And so here are some questions as you're writing the section that could help you kind of get a jumpstart.

07:40.950 --> 07:45.690
So who's going to use this application what users are going to be the first to use it and who are the

07:45.690 --> 07:51.390
first or advertizements So that's a helpful way of teasing out who your potential customers are Who's

07:51.390 --> 07:55.020
to be the first to do you imagine the first group using it as well.

07:55.180 --> 07:59.940
Often when you're building an application or a business there are multiple groups that are going to

07:59.940 --> 08:04.560
find it appealing but there's you know one group that finds the most appealing and often that group

08:04.560 --> 08:08.760
is smaller than the other ones but those are your initial user base.

08:08.760 --> 08:14.910
So it's helpful to plan for that user base sometimes and then later plan to expand it as it goes into

08:14.970 --> 08:16.760
other types of groups.

08:16.790 --> 08:21.510
There were the first year advertisements Now think about how if you did plan to advertise and promote

08:21.860 --> 08:26.760
who is who are you going to go after who is what group is the easiest to reach and who do you think

08:26.760 --> 08:29.500
you're going to be effective in advertising to.

08:29.610 --> 08:34.890
You should probably consider that group and consider what their needs are and what their capabilities

08:34.890 --> 08:35.690
are.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.410
Do you have multiple distinct groups now that just means.

08:38.410 --> 08:41.400
Try to think about if there are big differences between the groups you see.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.270
You should have at least two user types.

08:44.430 --> 08:51.150
You know a lot of times you have 10 different types of users and you can honestly divide them up by

08:51.150 --> 08:54.830
job type income.

08:55.170 --> 09:00.680
You can even do ethnicity and race you could say familiarity with Web sites.

09:00.780 --> 09:01.660
You can even.

09:01.770 --> 09:07.830
It's important to say things like internet connection to the building a web application and it's a going

09:07.830 --> 09:09.870
to be going after an international crowd.

09:09.870 --> 09:13.260
Keep in mind that not everyone has the same speed on their computer.

09:13.260 --> 09:19.320
So image heavy Web sites for instance have a very hard time taking off.

09:19.320 --> 09:24.170
In countries of slower Internet these are all things that you should take into consideration.

09:24.420 --> 09:28.050
And when you list out these users it kind of helps you map this out.

09:28.080 --> 09:35.640
And it should help a good developer designer understand what are kind of the no nos should do and what

09:35.640 --> 09:37.530
are the best practices.

09:37.830 --> 09:43.080
Other things to look at or think about how Internet and mobile phone savvy are they kind of covered

09:43.080 --> 09:43.650
that before.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.010
How busy are they.

09:45.180 --> 09:49.680
Now if you expect to have a user base that's very busy then you might want to have an application that's

09:49.680 --> 09:56.940
very simple very easy to use if you have what's called a captive audience a group that is very invested

09:56.940 --> 10:01.200
in what you're doing maybe you're selling something that's very expensive or takes a lot of time to

10:01.200 --> 10:02.010
get into.

10:02.130 --> 10:06.780
Well then you can raise the level of complexity because those people are more invested in figuring out

10:06.780 --> 10:08.090
how to use your application.

10:08.130 --> 10:11.670
But if it's something that's free that you just want to give to as many people as possible you might

10:11.670 --> 10:17.640
want to consider how busy they are and how invested they are and then if they are very busy and minimally

10:17.640 --> 10:19.200
invested you need to make it simple.

10:19.220 --> 10:23.790
Otherwise they're not going to stay in the app or come back to it.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.770
How often do you think they'll check into the app.

10:25.770 --> 10:31.830
That's helpful because that will help you kind of plan future feature sets but also understanding things

10:31.830 --> 10:37.200
like server load it helps you understand kind of what are the basic needs.

10:37.230 --> 10:41.880
How often are things updated etc etc..

10:42.380 --> 10:47.700
And the last thing they familiar with similar apps if they are familiar similar apps that means that

10:47.910 --> 10:53.250
you can always go and look at comparable applications or borrow what they're doing and if they're not

10:53.310 --> 10:57.900
then you're kind of starting from scratch so you're going to have to use basic web conventions and best

10:57.900 --> 10:59.590
practices.

10:59.600 --> 11:04.520
OK so if you guys have any questions clarifications for this section of the spec sheet post in the group

11:04.520 --> 11:05.030
discussion.

11:05.030 --> 11:07.700
You can always just message me otherwise I'll see you in the next lecture.
