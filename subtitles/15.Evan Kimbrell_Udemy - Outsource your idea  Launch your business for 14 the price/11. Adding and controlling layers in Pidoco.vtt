You guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture I'm going to show you how to use layers to save

00:11.880 --> 00:15.030
you a lot of time keep yourself organized.

00:15.180 --> 00:19.270
And I'm sure you kind of some scenarios where you actually would find this useful.

00:19.350 --> 00:24.690
So if you spaced out before on a talk about layers and layers work are just imagine putting paper on

00:24.690 --> 00:26.110
top of paper.

00:26.670 --> 00:30.410
So what that means is like right now I only have one layer.

00:30.450 --> 00:34.090
You can tell it's selected called the welcome's green and green.

00:34.320 --> 00:40.410
And so basically everything that's on the canvas exists on one layer they're all equal in terms of the

00:40.440 --> 00:43.230
way that the computer or their application sees it.

00:43.230 --> 00:49.530
Now if I add a new layer then all of a sudden I'm opening up another layer where I can put icons on

00:49.530 --> 00:55.830
top of that and they'll not only overlap the other ones but then I can control them as groups.

00:55.830 --> 00:57.920
So why would I want to do this.

00:57.990 --> 01:05.070
Let's say I'm making a web site and every single page except for a couple have this upper little header

01:05.100 --> 01:06.230
bar right here.

01:06.330 --> 01:11.260
And I honestly don't want to spend tons and tons of time recreating it.

01:11.250 --> 01:15.590
And let's imagine that I put a lot more time and effort into it.

01:15.630 --> 01:24.730
Let's say I put a you know a search bar up here and I'll put a search for it here.

01:25.040 --> 01:32.010
And so I don't really want to spend a lot of time over redoing everything from wireframe to wireframe

01:32.270 --> 01:35.710
what I could just do in this case and it's a little wonky how they do this.

01:35.730 --> 01:40.340
But you know it's like every wire framing tool they have these strange work arounds.

01:40.380 --> 01:44.670
So what I would do is if for some reason I wanted to group all of these together now in bosonic you

01:44.670 --> 01:49.940
just group them and they don't use layers Lares what I would do is pretty simple I say new layer.

01:50.160 --> 01:55.110
Now they're going to call a global layer and what they mean by global is global in a programming sense

01:55.350 --> 01:58.430
means that it applies to every single thing.

01:58.620 --> 02:02.710
It's the opposite of local So if you had something that was only on this page you'd call it local.

02:02.730 --> 02:05.190
They call it global because it's supposedly going to be everywhere.

02:05.290 --> 02:05.910
Does it really matter.

02:05.910 --> 02:07.430
You can rename it whatever you want.

02:07.500 --> 02:12.240
And I suggest that you do that you like change it to Hetter.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.530
Now as you can tell this is green meaning I'm selecting the header.

02:15.540 --> 02:19.950
That's why this is all blurred out because you can see I can't touch anything because nothing's on this

02:19.950 --> 02:20.540
layer.

02:20.550 --> 02:24.390
Now if I wanted to be able to edit things I have to go back to the original layer the welcome screen

02:24.690 --> 02:27.820
which is separated out because it's the original layer.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.160
It's kind of like the base.

02:29.160 --> 02:35.580
Then I can select everything the way that I would move things from this to that is pretty simple so

02:35.640 --> 02:39.230
I would say here I'd select the entire header.

02:39.480 --> 02:47.450
I would get cut go to the head or select it and paste that is quite literally it saves you enormous

02:47.450 --> 02:51.280
amount of time because if for instance I was going to now clone a new page.

02:51.290 --> 02:54.420
All right so let's clone our page like we did before.

02:54.620 --> 02:55.680
Reclose.

02:56.150 --> 03:02.590
OK now let's pretend like this page is something that wouldn't have a header let's say payment accepted.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.360
Let's say it was a page where we had accepted payment.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.720
So what I would say is payment accepted.

03:07.760 --> 03:14.960
And then what I would want to do is I want to modify the local elements and I do want to get rid of

03:14.960 --> 03:15.880
the header.

03:16.040 --> 03:20.990
So there you go now it's gone and enough to select the whole thing and delete it and then later as I'm

03:20.990 --> 03:22.590
making it I can just add them.

03:22.610 --> 03:30.410
This becomes really helpful as I create lots and lots of chokes and snippets because I can just pull

03:30.410 --> 03:33.800
them in and pull them out as I need them.

03:33.800 --> 03:41.030
So say if you have a recurring element that throughout your page you have a form that's always on the

03:41.030 --> 03:47.540
right hand side but it's only there sometimes just depending on the page depending on what the page

03:47.540 --> 03:49.820
guidelines call for.

03:49.850 --> 03:59.100
So we'll make this really simple call it you know input we'll call it just so it helps you understand

03:59.100 --> 03:59.670
what we're doing.

03:59.670 --> 04:00.420
First name

04:05.040 --> 04:08.970
same phone number.

04:09.250 --> 04:09.890
OK.

04:10.620 --> 04:13.510
So no we don't a space it out.

04:13.950 --> 04:16.730
So I'm slightly OCD about these things.

04:16.730 --> 04:17.240
OK.

04:17.610 --> 04:20.870
So let's say we have this form over here.

04:21.270 --> 04:32.580
And then we give it let's say like go back background placemat.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.720
So remember how we put this behind it.

04:34.730 --> 04:38.620
We go and sit in the back we go OK.

04:38.810 --> 04:45.230
So let's say that like this forum occasionally would pop up on the sides of pages or at the bottom or

04:45.230 --> 04:45.710
anything.

04:45.710 --> 04:51.260
I mean it's really popular now to have these just pop up in the middle of your page to ask for your

04:51.260 --> 04:53.760
e-mail address if you've seen those.

04:53.840 --> 04:58.000
What I could do is I could create a new letter or layers or.

04:58.490 --> 04:59.780
And we'll call this one.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.720
Side form

05:05.380 --> 05:05.730
OK.

05:05.730 --> 05:15.500
And then what I would do you remember go back to this page select all cut and paste.

05:15.790 --> 05:20.950
So now I automatically have all these things set up that I can use if I didn't one of the side forms

05:20.970 --> 05:22.790
pop and pop it off.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.340
And so any page I'm on.

05:24.350 --> 05:30.190
I'll have this side layer makes it really easy to just add things mess with things.

05:30.190 --> 05:36.190
Keep in mind though if I do say put this on the local lair on the page and I go to a side form and then

05:36.190 --> 05:43.140
I start messing with this layer because it's global it's going to change it and all the other pages.

05:43.150 --> 05:49.690
So if you want to take this and modify it you have to do is remove it from this side.

05:49.690 --> 05:57.620
So what I would do personally I would copy it so I will copy it we'll drop with the side forms.

05:57.630 --> 06:01.470
It's not displaying go back to the original layer and paste it back in.

06:01.470 --> 06:02.210
There you go.

06:02.520 --> 06:02.820
OK.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.850
So you'll notice like it doesn't you can't see you want to add it on.

06:05.880 --> 06:12.920
But now if I change something and let's say instead of this sort of phone number it's e-mail.

06:12.930 --> 06:17.270
Here we go.

06:17.940 --> 06:20.350
What would happen see how now it's going to.

06:20.670 --> 06:21.260
Right.

06:21.420 --> 06:22.900
Oh I see.

06:22.920 --> 06:29.460
So if I went to side form right and so that's how I would change it.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.860
You actually cannot see this when I toggle it.

06:31.870 --> 06:38.490
Nothing happens because this layer is actually underneath the layer that I just made before.

06:38.650 --> 06:46.480
But if for instance I were to delete what I just wrote it actually would go back.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.660
Now it's displaying this one because it's checked you go.

06:49.890 --> 06:50.260
OK.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.170
So that is how you use layers.

06:52.240 --> 06:58.070
Incredibly helpful but one of those things it just doesn't really make that much sense at the very beginning.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.760
That's really all you need to know about them.

06:59.760 --> 07:04.150
They're just used to create little miniature templates within your wireframe so you can apply them through

07:04.150 --> 07:05.880
each individual page.

07:06.220 --> 07:10.930
Saves you a ton of time surprisingly especially if you're doing or wireframe correctly and if you're

07:10.930 --> 07:14.140
taking my course you'll be doing them correctly right.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.360
So keep in mind it's just a tool.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.310
Helpful.

07:17.390 --> 07:20.320
There's a lot more things you can do with it and I can show you to do.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.730
But again these are things that you really shouldn't concern yourself with.

07:23.740 --> 07:27.940
You can get 80 percent of the functionality out of the system with Again 20 percent of the effort.

07:27.940 --> 07:32.260
So it looks like we're going to talk about how you add annotations.

07:32.260 --> 07:32.950
So in the next lecture.
