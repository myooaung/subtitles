Hey guys.

00:11.070 --> 00:12.870
Welcome back to the course in this lecture.

00:12.870 --> 00:19.800
We're going to talk about a very common kind of phenomenon you'll see on these freelancing platforms.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.930
And that's the beard and disappear.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.910
So this is a question I get all the time.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.340
Someone bid looks like a great bid.

00:26.460 --> 00:30.300
Even what they describe might be spot on or you might be interested in the price range.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.380
But then they disappear immediately.

00:32.400 --> 00:38.340
Honestly what you have to understand is this is this is the case in a lot of projects in the vast majority

00:38.340 --> 00:40.370
of projects I've ever run.

00:40.380 --> 00:42.910
They've been at least one or two people who have done this.

00:42.930 --> 00:48.890
This is why it's important that in any project you run the vetting process with multiple people.

00:48.890 --> 00:51.220
Don't put all of your eggs in one basket.

00:51.330 --> 00:58.110
If you do a project you get 18 bids and you only pick one person to actually go into in-depth process

00:58.110 --> 01:02.030
of discussing the project and doing some vetting with them.

01:02.130 --> 01:07.290
You're going to set yourself up for failure because a lot of times the person will disappear.

01:07.290 --> 01:09.960
Now it doesn't happen with every single person you've met.

01:09.990 --> 01:13.710
But when it does happen it makes it such that you just wasted a lot of time.

01:13.740 --> 01:17.660
So make sure you do this with lots of different people.

01:17.730 --> 01:21.770
In general the reason why this happens is one of two things.

01:21.900 --> 01:26.230
One the person who bid on your project it's also bidding on other projects.

01:26.400 --> 01:32.280
And what probably happened is they probably got selected for a different project and all of a sudden

01:32.310 --> 01:34.740
their entire free time is now gone.

01:34.740 --> 01:41.370
Freelancers in general will bid for 10 20 projects at a time just knowing that that's not realistic

01:41.370 --> 01:47.610
that they take on more than one or two of them but they're not going to win 90 percent of the projects.

01:47.700 --> 01:52.620
This is just how most freelancers work and it's something you have to accept because they need to make

01:52.620 --> 01:53.340
a living.

01:53.370 --> 01:59.580
And so many people bidding on so many projects means it's it's kind of a roll of the dice whether or

01:59.580 --> 02:00.930
not they get selected.

02:00.930 --> 02:06.180
So that's the most likely scenario is that they disappear because another project sucked up their time.

02:06.180 --> 02:09.360
The more polite freelancers will tell you that.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.960
And if that's the case they'll tell you that ask them for a referral.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.670
Move on to the next candidate.

02:14.700 --> 02:21.210
The other scenario of them disappearing is simply that they change their mind about your project.

02:21.210 --> 02:23.780
This is less likely but it does happen.

02:23.790 --> 02:26.600
So what will happen is you know they see the project description.

02:26.610 --> 02:27.690
They bid.

02:27.690 --> 02:31.080
Once they start having a discussion with you they realize that they don't want to work with you or the

02:31.080 --> 02:33.550
project is different than what they thought.

02:33.630 --> 02:36.750
If that's the case a lot of them just cut ties and disappear.

02:36.780 --> 02:41.610
They don't explain that it's confusing me and explain what is confusing but you need to understand that's

02:41.610 --> 02:43.450
essentially what they're signaling towards you.

02:43.500 --> 02:48.750
If this is happening to you repeatedly once or twice or three times in the same project you need to

02:48.750 --> 02:52.600
stop and understand what exactly is making them disappear.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.470
Is your project too confusing.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.750
Are you presenting your project as smaller than it really is.

02:57.780 --> 03:01.770
Are you presenting it as simpler than it really is and then once you start actually talking to people

03:01.770 --> 03:03.710
they realize it's a lot more complex.

03:03.840 --> 03:08.460
If that's the case you need to go back and assess what it is that you're misrepresenting about your

03:08.460 --> 03:09.230
project.

03:09.240 --> 03:14.040
Think of it as a good thing it's a signal to you that there's a mismatch between what you're saying

03:14.040 --> 03:20.210
about your project and what the person who's actually going to build it kind of realizes about it.

03:20.250 --> 03:24.420
Now if they'd realized later once you started the project you'd have a serious problem.

03:24.450 --> 03:27.720
But the fact that they're realizing upfront that's a good thing.

03:27.750 --> 03:33.090
Follow the other lecture where we talk about rapid cycling posts and what you can do is you can slowly

03:33.090 --> 03:39.900
modify over time adding more information as freelancers ask more questions that'll make it more realistic

03:40.050 --> 03:45.480
upfront so that every time you post a new job posting and has more information it'll slow down your

03:45.480 --> 03:51.060
vetting process but also catch you kind of up to speed with what the real expectations your project

03:51.060 --> 03:51.720
should be.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.400
So if it happens don't worry.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.060
Happens all the time.

03:55.110 --> 04:00.900
You just need to understand why it happened and understand it's never anything personal but it could

04:00.900 --> 04:05.520
be something wrong with your project if that's the case then you need to take a hard look back at it

04:05.520 --> 04:07.230
and you need to ask them for feedback.

04:07.230 --> 04:07.440
All right.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.220
See in the next lecture.
