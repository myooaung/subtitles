00:05.650 --> 00:10.540
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about bit rate we're going

00:10.540 --> 00:13.900
to talk about what you should be looking for with price.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.590
Now it obviously depends on the context of your situation.

00:16.600 --> 00:21.190
But in this case I'm going to give you some guidelines and some things to look for that can at least

00:21.250 --> 00:27.060
guide you towards who's giving you an accurate price and who is not giving you an accurate price.

00:27.070 --> 00:33.400
This will help you vet your group help you whittle down to a shortlist makes the process a lot easier

00:33.400 --> 00:34.330
going forward.

00:34.330 --> 00:39.340
Then you can use the other techniques we talk in other in other lectures to finally narrow it down to

00:39.340 --> 00:41.110
the contractor that you want to work with.

00:41.370 --> 00:41.730
OK.

00:41.770 --> 00:43.240
Let's go to screencast.

00:43.240 --> 00:43.500
All right.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.270
Let's talk about BYD rate.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.050
So I know a lot of people who are brand new to this.

00:48.070 --> 00:52.650
What's the first thing they need to pay attention to is the rate that people are getting.

00:52.900 --> 00:56.170
And a lot of people make their decisions based off of price.

00:56.170 --> 01:01.090
And we've talked about previously when the lecture we called the Goldilocks syndrome that you really

01:01.090 --> 01:04.400
shouldn't make your judgment based off the price alone.

01:04.450 --> 01:10.630
You need to decide who is a good candidate first just from a personality standpoint expertise standpoint

01:10.870 --> 01:17.740
then you need to determine whether or not the price matches up with how well of a fit they are on the

01:17.830 --> 01:19.160
other criteria.

01:19.420 --> 01:26.230
But there are a couple of things that you can use and look for that can be very helpful in determining

01:26.230 --> 01:28.310
what's a good bid rate in general.

01:28.310 --> 01:32.860
I'm not saying what's the best bid right for you but there are some ways that you can sniff out things

01:32.860 --> 01:34.300
that are just wrong.

01:34.660 --> 01:41.080
So the first thing I like to do when I'm trying to think about the rates that are being proposed is

01:41.080 --> 01:47.200
to look for what we call big mismatches what a bid minutes mismatch means is that a lot of times people

01:47.200 --> 01:53.050
will give you an explanation for why something cost a sum a certain amount and then they'll give you

01:53.050 --> 01:56.890
a final estimate and a final estimate does not match what they said.

01:57.220 --> 01:59.200
So that happens.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.710
And what that means is that they're sloppy.

02:01.810 --> 02:05.770
They don't pay attention to details where something else is going on.

02:05.950 --> 02:10.270
It might mean that they have some internal communication issues maybe someone submitted the price differently

02:10.270 --> 02:12.520
than the person who wrote the description.

02:12.520 --> 02:17.530
And those are things that you really really need to sniff out and that's just usually a bad thing it's

02:17.530 --> 02:21.520
going to create a problem down the road because you don't know what price you're signing up for.

02:21.520 --> 02:27.450
You also don't know how well they understand your application if they themselves are confused.

02:27.490 --> 02:28.770
So here's an example.

02:29.080 --> 02:34.220
This smart data enterprises gave us a bid and what you can see down here is they say as per your detail

02:34.220 --> 02:38.620
shared the total estimated hours of the whole application will be approximately 360 hours.

02:38.640 --> 02:39.260
OK.

02:39.330 --> 02:40.240
You know that's great.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.180
I mean they give you a big price.

02:42.190 --> 02:46.100
We want to get separated into sections so that's a negative thing.

02:46.150 --> 02:50.110
But then look at their price right here they say 4000 $680.

02:50.110 --> 02:52.890
OK well you wouldn't assume that that you know is a bad thing.

02:52.900 --> 02:59.340
But then look at their per hour rate so it's $15 an hour for 360 hours.

02:59.410 --> 03:05.590
So you can just you pull out your handy dandy calculator and just look up does that actually square

03:05.590 --> 03:05.830
up

03:09.830 --> 03:11.770
so this is one of the weirder ones.

03:12.080 --> 03:19.960
They're saying that it should cost more than what they're actually telling you which is a little odd.

03:19.970 --> 03:21.360
Usually it's the other way around right.

03:21.380 --> 03:26.510
You usually get someone who tries to give you a lower price and then inside the message tries to raise

03:26.510 --> 03:27.010
it.

03:27.020 --> 03:31.130
Something happened here and they're clearly confused and that's something that I would immediately message

03:31.130 --> 03:32.990
them with had they passed.

03:32.990 --> 03:39.050
The other kind of criteria used to determine what a good bid is but this is a great example of a big

03:39.140 --> 03:39.830
mismatch.

03:39.830 --> 03:41.330
Something else is going on here.

03:41.330 --> 03:47.360
So to give you an example of someone who got the bid rate correctly we can just go up with the person

03:47.360 --> 03:50.130
that we ended up working with which was Nick and right here.

03:50.150 --> 03:53.930
He answered every section or here says a hundred 400 300.

03:53.930 --> 03:56.980
And then all adds up to 1800 was exactly what you'd expect.

03:56.990 --> 04:02.420
You know 80 percent of the time or 97 percent 70 percent of the time people will have their estimates

04:02.420 --> 04:03.280
add up correctly.

04:03.290 --> 04:07.960
But 30 percent of the time something is wrong and they'll give you something completely different.

04:07.970 --> 04:13.220
Sometimes they'll give you a bid amount and in their message will specify what it is but then they'll

04:13.220 --> 04:17.510
say like they're not completely sure and the bottom will put proposal not specified.

04:17.540 --> 04:23.270
Again you want someone who sure of what they're doing you don't want to have to spend time with every

04:23.270 --> 04:26.300
single freelancer trying to get a more detailed estimate.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.920
Now the second thing you want to look for is that once you start getting proposals you'll notice that

04:30.920 --> 04:34.190
there's a general theme to the price ranges.

04:34.190 --> 04:41.690
So and then there is a problem because a lot of times freelancers can see other people's bids and they

04:41.690 --> 04:43.220
then will bid accordingly.

04:43.220 --> 04:47.290
So the first person will bid you know high the next personal bid low.

04:47.450 --> 04:49.770
And then typically all the other bids are going to come.

04:49.780 --> 04:52.780
Usually within that range or very close to it.

04:52.870 --> 04:59.030
But we can tell from this right here and even on the plants they'll calculate it for you.

04:59.030 --> 05:06.590
For the most part the low bids are around 1900 and the high bids are around 35 hundred or 3000.

05:06.590 --> 05:17.470
So you know example would be this guy was 1300 and give you example of a five thousand thirty one hundred.

05:17.490 --> 05:18.900
This is a low.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.560
This is another high one.

05:21.180 --> 05:24.610
Hi again low.

05:25.050 --> 05:25.410
OK.

05:25.410 --> 05:31.430
So what we can tell is actually it's probably more on the 1800 to say 4000 range.

05:31.430 --> 05:35.730
You want to look for things that are immediately not within your range.

05:35.780 --> 05:41.180
Typically you want to give more scrutiny to both the person who bids the most which I believe was this

05:41.180 --> 05:46.820
person they bid forty nine hundred and the one who bids the least in this case we had a lot of people

05:46.850 --> 05:49.870
who tied for least amount with 5500.

05:49.940 --> 05:54.740
You need to give those people more scrutiny because either they did something wrong in their estimation

05:55.220 --> 05:59.660
or they are trying to artificially subsidize their price in some way to either appear as if they're

05:59.660 --> 06:07.490
better or appear as if they are the obvious cheapest source that you can use so typically try to pay

06:07.490 --> 06:08.090
attention to that.

06:08.090 --> 06:13.400
In this case we don't actually have a great example of a really inappropriate bid.

06:13.520 --> 06:18.860
But anybody who has posted a job posting probably does now an inappropriate bid might be someone who

06:18.860 --> 06:21.920
bids $8000 or eight hundred dollars.

06:21.920 --> 06:26.810
Now if you look at that estimate on it's by itself an $800 bid that might be fine.

06:26.810 --> 06:28.220
You'd have to look at how they justify it.

06:28.240 --> 06:34.840
But the fact that we've had 18 proposals and all of them are roughly within the same range and an eight

06:34.870 --> 06:40.680
hundred bid is not even near any of that or an $8000 bid not near the range.

06:40.820 --> 06:45.110
Really you kind of have to go with the group consensus the group consensus is that a realistic price

06:45.110 --> 06:47.660
is going to be somewhere between 1500 4000.

06:47.780 --> 06:54.430
Anything outside of that range is is probably incorrect or there's some shenanigans going on.

06:54.500 --> 06:58.730
Now another thing that you can look for is what we call a timeline mismatch.

06:58.730 --> 07:07.250
That's when you have someone who says we don't have a great example in this one but say they say I will

07:07.250 --> 07:11.350
take me a month to complete and I cost $15 an hour.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.120
OK.

07:12.260 --> 07:16.250
Well if that's the case you take a month you're going to assume that they work 40 hours a week.

07:16.250 --> 07:17.780
That's kind of the standard.

07:17.840 --> 07:24.650
That means 160 hours is roughly what they're saying it should take in 160 hours times 15.

07:24.710 --> 07:29.780
You should expect that it's going to take $2400.

07:29.780 --> 07:34.490
Now if they bid something different than 2400 dollars that means that they think they're going to be

07:34.490 --> 07:39.880
working part time or overtime or something is wrong with their proposal.

07:39.890 --> 07:45.010
Either way it's something that's not immediately obvious and it's a issue of transparency.

07:45.020 --> 07:51.680
So try if you can when they give you an estimate for time to sniff out whether or not their time estimate

07:51.680 --> 07:58.340
matches their per hour and then be able to tell whether or not they're actually changing their price.

07:58.340 --> 08:04.280
The last thing I think you should look at when looking at bid rates is see if their rate does not match

08:04.280 --> 08:05.210
their area.

08:05.210 --> 08:08.020
Now this is not an absolute statement.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.290
This is a relative statement.

08:09.290 --> 08:11.120
Now what do I mean by that.

08:11.220 --> 08:16.070
Typically if you listen to the previous lectures or we talked about pricing and how that relates to

08:16.070 --> 08:17.900
what area you're getting bids from.

08:17.900 --> 08:22.260
There are certain areas that should be cheaper and there are certain areas that should be more expensive.

08:22.310 --> 08:29.520
Now if you have an exception to this rule where you know we have a relative price range of 1300 to 4000.

08:29.630 --> 08:34.850
Now if someone's outside of that range say they like more expensive then you probably expect them to

08:34.850 --> 08:41.600
come from an area that's more expensive you would not expect that to come from an area that is cheaper.

08:41.660 --> 08:42.890
So I'll give you an example.

08:42.950 --> 08:44.420
So give you an example right here.

08:44.450 --> 08:45.710
This person is from Vietnam.

08:45.740 --> 08:48.650
Traditionally a cheaper country to hire from.

08:48.710 --> 08:52.070
However their bid is above our range that we've established.

08:52.070 --> 08:59.120
So either they're charging you extra or what's more realistic is that they clearly think this is more

08:59.120 --> 09:05.030
complicated than what everybody else thinks that could mean that they just are not confident in their

09:05.030 --> 09:05.890
ability to build it.

09:05.900 --> 09:08.480
It could also mean that they're less efficient.

09:08.480 --> 09:14.030
So if you have a relative range and there's a price that's above that you should expect higher prices

09:14.030 --> 09:19.160
that come from higher priced areas and you should expect lower prices to come from cheaper areas.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.300
If you see a mismatch something could be wrong.

09:22.430 --> 09:27.330
This is a great example Vietnam giving me one of the highest bids I've ever received.

09:27.350 --> 09:33.020
Now on the flip side I have someone who bid from the United Kingdom on the lower end of the range that

09:33.020 --> 09:34.250
would be also an exception.

09:34.250 --> 09:40.580
What I would suggest is you ask them look at their estimate and see whether or not it makes sense in

09:40.580 --> 09:41.080
this case.

09:41.090 --> 09:47.450
It did make sense because he explained that he actually has a full time job and he works on these after

09:47.450 --> 09:50.550
his job so I'm not paying for full time rate.

09:50.570 --> 09:55.550
I'm only paying for a part time rate if I'm ok with the fact that they're only dedicating four hours

09:55.550 --> 10:00.470
a day to the project or three hours a day then I can get a significantly lower price.

10:00.470 --> 10:04.170
There's also the implication that this person is more efficient at it.

10:04.190 --> 10:10.390
They have more experience with the application and that means that it's going to take them less time.

10:10.400 --> 10:10.770
OK.

10:10.790 --> 10:17.480
So when you look at your bid rate try to keep in mind that there could be mismatches and try to spell

10:17.480 --> 10:17.960
those out.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.280
Try to look at the rate that they're publishing.

10:20.300 --> 10:26.080
See if that matches that the bid they're putting also look to see if the time line plus the rate matches

10:26.080 --> 10:27.540
the total price that they're putting.

10:27.550 --> 10:34.210
And then last thing is try to establish a relative range in your group look at where most of the bids

10:34.210 --> 10:37.600
are happening and then assume that is the rational range in this case.

10:37.600 --> 10:43.660
We had 1500 to 4000 and then look for any bid that's outside of that if it's too low it's probably unrealistic

10:43.660 --> 10:45.860
if it's too high it's probably unrealistic.

10:45.940 --> 10:50.200
You should obviously message them and see what they say when confronted with that.

10:50.320 --> 10:56.500
But keep that in mind that this is probably less likely to be a good candidate for building your project.

10:56.500 --> 11:03.040
All right see the next lecture.
