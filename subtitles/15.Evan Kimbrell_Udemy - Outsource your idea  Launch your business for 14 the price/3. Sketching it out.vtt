WEBVTT

00:05.730 --> 00:06.210
All right.

00:06.210 --> 00:08.230
Welcome to the course.

00:08.380 --> 00:12.810
Sorry no have the lab notebook out and I want to kind of walk you through really what the first steps

00:12.870 --> 00:16.700
are to putting your idea onto their paper.

00:16.710 --> 00:22.380
Now ideally what you should have is you should have your scope document open and next to you.

00:22.380 --> 00:27.360
And I usually would pull that up on the computer over here just so I can look up and see if I'm missing

00:27.360 --> 00:28.110
anything.

00:28.240 --> 00:33.930
Well keep in mind it's a scope document so you're not going to be putting in every single feature because

00:33.990 --> 00:40.230
we're doing the structure and the structure is more just roughly like where landing page tax should

00:40.230 --> 00:46.740
go whereas the welcome headline roughly where the contact us what columns should we be using things

00:46.740 --> 00:47.480
like that.

00:47.610 --> 00:51.380
This is really the least sophisticated version of it possible.

00:51.430 --> 00:57.750
Now I'm using a and that's because I you know like to live on the edge and I like to use things that

00:57.750 --> 01:00.880
are permanent but also means that I end up throwing paper away all the time.

01:00.900 --> 01:05.850
I suggest using a pencil personally and then going over it with a pen because with a pencil if you make

01:05.850 --> 01:07.440
a funky edge you can just go over it.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.750
But then again guys it just really doesn't matter as long as you can understand it.

01:10.890 --> 01:13.640
And as long as you show it to someone they can understand it.

01:13.650 --> 01:19.920
So let's say that we are making a web project and I typically like to label up at the top whatever it

01:19.980 --> 01:25.110
is and then say something like whatever page it is so you can just say

01:31.770 --> 01:34.880
one way to say Oh hey

01:40.560 --> 01:41.380
OK.

01:41.650 --> 01:46.710
And that's just reminding me of what it is that I'm doodling on again typically what I do is I would

01:46.760 --> 01:52.840
quite copy over here and I would just draw over here to mark out my thoughts.

01:52.890 --> 01:57.960
Now the easiest thing to start with by far is you're looking at this page and you're like I don't know

01:58.170 --> 01:59.610
what to do or do I start.

01:59.730 --> 02:02.180
That's the first thing to do would be to decide what you're making.

02:02.180 --> 02:07.740
Weber mobile if it's web or mobile draw the bounding boxes if you're doing mobile I suggest using the

02:07.780 --> 02:13.920
templates but if you're drawing web just draw a browser around and try to make it look roughly what

02:13.920 --> 02:17.340
you remember about it looking like that will help you kind of get in the mood.

02:17.340 --> 02:21.330
Understand Oh right this is what if you look inside a browser.

02:21.390 --> 02:28.150
So I would just draw a rectangle.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.880
You're a little more spaced don't worry about personality.

02:31.950 --> 02:33.890
The resolution you know deal with that you're

02:38.820 --> 02:44.780
right as you tell the boundary you don't even really helped me that much but you can only imagine how

02:44.780 --> 02:49.550
bad that would be if I was doing it on an ungraded page and then I'll just pretend that it's like a

02:49.550 --> 02:50.430
browser.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.730
We'll pretend this is chrome

02:58.010 --> 03:03.810
I'm someone that has tons and tons of tabs open all the time with the search bar here.

03:05.920 --> 03:15.100
Search bar icons and they usually have a bottom bar.

03:15.350 --> 03:15.830
So there you go.

03:15.830 --> 03:20.390
Now we have a very very basic image of a web browser.

03:20.690 --> 03:25.580
Now it's helpful because now I know whatever I'm drawing is occurring in this space.

03:25.580 --> 03:30.590
One thing that can help you quite a bit is if you draw this outside border like your browser or your

03:30.590 --> 03:36.650
mobile phone if you draw it with a different color jersey you can focus on those layers.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.550
Don't go crazy with it.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.670
Otherwise it looks like a popsicle.

03:39.680 --> 03:44.440
And it's hard to focus your eyes but that's one technique if you use something that's a little bit different

03:44.450 --> 03:48.080
the NSA like blue blue and black are usually easily easy to look at.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.810
I would suggest using purple rather than green.

03:50.930 --> 03:56.000
Keep it keep it a way that people can actually look at it and not go crazy.

03:56.240 --> 03:56.510
OK.

03:56.510 --> 04:02.930
So this is the way that I always start a browser up and you'll see this later when we create our first

04:02.930 --> 04:05.360
wireframe I always start with the same thing.

04:05.390 --> 04:11.690
So the first thing I always do is I almost always put my logo up at the top left and then I draw a navigation

04:11.690 --> 04:11.870
bar.

04:11.870 --> 04:15.230
Now not every single web site does that the same way anymore.

04:15.290 --> 04:19.170
There's a lot of other ways you can look at navigation bars.

04:19.400 --> 04:24.260
And later we'll use some navigation bars and what they look like and the whole different ways of doing

04:24.260 --> 04:24.850
it.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.860
Here it doesn't really matter.

04:26.870 --> 04:28.460
I mean again or just looking at structure.

04:28.460 --> 04:33.460
So I would first decide whether I want to have a traditional web site where I have a logo right here

04:33.560 --> 04:37.400
and then every single page here and then a footer.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.940
Chances are you're always going to have a footer and it's always a good idea to have a footer not just

04:40.940 --> 04:48.170
for SBO purposes but for navigational purposes and you X you don't always have to have a navigation

04:48.170 --> 04:52.190
bar at the top a lot of people have like long form pages now and they just kind of like scroll all the

04:52.190 --> 04:53.480
way down.

04:53.540 --> 04:57.560
And again if you're building an application page then you wouldn't have that right.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.390
You build out the application.

04:59.390 --> 05:05.210
For instance I would put on the left hand bar a bunch of buttons where I can move around you know or

05:05.240 --> 05:10.900
maybe I put it up multiple navigation bars and one up here one over here and one down here.

05:11.180 --> 05:15.860
But so if you're making a normal web site what I always get this is how I always like to start it.

05:15.860 --> 05:25.650
So I just put a box here called Logo OK and then navigation bar will go here up do you not want it.

05:25.660 --> 05:30.430
But I like you it don't be redundant don't put home a navigation bar member you always click on the

05:30.430 --> 05:31.160
logo.

05:31.300 --> 05:34.960
So I would say oh wow

05:39.190 --> 05:44.120
prices about us now remember it doesn't matter.

05:44.130 --> 05:46.060
We're just trying to get the format done.

05:46.140 --> 05:48.050
The rest of it is just junk.

05:48.450 --> 05:54.110
So I'd say that and then well that I make a decision kind of like what kind of style that I want here.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.520
The next thing I do really quickly.

05:55.530 --> 05:56.690
I always draw for her.

05:56.910 --> 06:00.910
So what are really then what are you on here.

06:02.330 --> 06:12.640
And are I always just has like contact us and maybe the logo over here cetera et cetera.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.840
And then you can literally just put her.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.850
So remind yourself whoever is looking at you then you know it's just kind of the way you want to do

06:20.850 --> 06:28.050
it like let's say in this one I'm just to make a a basic kind of cover page design.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.280
A lot of people do that now.

06:29.280 --> 06:36.880
So what you would do is say you have a box like this OK and then it's up to you whether or not you specify

06:36.880 --> 06:38.730
the image in this box.

06:38.810 --> 06:43.540
But what I can say is I can do it like this I can say image.

06:43.790 --> 06:47.720
I can also just put image image image image over here.

06:47.750 --> 06:53.070
Typically what you do is you put some kind of image and then have a call the action button.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.850
If you don't want that and you just want an informational click the button out.

06:57.170 --> 07:01.520
Maybe you're creating a page for promoting a software application or something like that.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.110
So what you would do is you know you probably have like screenshots.

07:05.210 --> 07:09.190
So I would just make a very very rough estimation of what this is going to look like.

07:12.140 --> 07:22.230
OK so that's like a web browser in the back and then Mobile right here and then then mobile phone

07:29.510 --> 07:34.500
and then me I'd go for it.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.920
Now again we're in structure.

07:36.970 --> 07:43.060
So what's going to put right here it's if you were in the skeleton section I would suggest that you

07:43.060 --> 07:47.600
put the actual copywriting an actual slogan or tagline here it just does not matter.

07:47.830 --> 07:59.820
So what I'm just going to put is this is an online and then right here I mean to put you know some vital.
