00:05.680 --> 00:06.590
Welcome back to the course.

00:06.660 --> 00:08.720
So in this lecture give me real quick.

00:08.730 --> 00:14.770
I'm going to show you how you can use and handle images in your wireframe.

00:15.270 --> 00:17.460
Pinocchio makes it relatively simple.

00:17.460 --> 00:24.150
They use image handlers just the same way that Paul Sammak uses them the same way as pretty much any

00:24.150 --> 00:28.120
other prototyping wire framing tool I've used uses them.

00:28.440 --> 00:32.730
There's multiple ways of going about them and I'll show you really quickly how you would bring in some

00:32.730 --> 00:33.960
images into this.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.040
Now keep in mind when you're making low fidelity wireframe you're not really going to be focusing on

00:38.040 --> 00:39.660
bringing in images.

00:39.660 --> 00:42.780
I would only bring them in if you really thought they could help you.

00:42.790 --> 00:47.160
I really thought they could help explain what's supposed to go in an area otherwise typically what I

00:47.160 --> 00:51.470
like to do is just use an image placeholder and put text over it.

00:51.480 --> 00:59.130
So what I would do is say like logo and that is enough to convey to the designer or the developer what's

00:59.130 --> 01:00.620
supposed to go there.

01:00.870 --> 01:03.660
If you don't want to do that and you do you want incorporate something.

01:03.660 --> 01:09.060
Again I say be careful about this because if you bring in say like a well-designed logo into your logo

01:09.060 --> 01:13.200
spot in the rest of it has this weird sketch style people are going to have a very strange response

01:13.200 --> 01:18.420
to the wireframe so I usually you say pick one or the other low fidelity High Fidelity and stick with

01:18.420 --> 01:18.970
it.

01:19.020 --> 01:23.730
But if you wanted to do it for whatever reason there's one way of doing it you know you can take image

01:23.790 --> 01:29.400
out of your coarse pencils and the left hand side and right here this is an image placeholder so I have

01:29.400 --> 01:35.260
to do is double click it and then I can drag and put in really any image I want.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.430
I can keep it on this placeholder.

01:37.980 --> 01:43.190
I can say grab a picture of my face and use that.

01:43.190 --> 01:43.550
There you go.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.850
So now it's there and it then operates like any other element.

01:46.860 --> 01:55.260
I can tell it to be a clickable link to go somewhere else I can add a border I can mess with the sizes

01:55.270 --> 02:00.270
I can get a tool tip which can be rather helpful to remind you of what you're doing but also when you

02:00.280 --> 02:01.250
output this.

02:01.390 --> 02:06.900
There's several techniques for outputting your wireframe in the system where people actually be able

02:07.200 --> 02:12.650
be able to put their mouse over and see a tool tip you can leave notes here just for yourself.

02:12.870 --> 02:17.610
Then they can do pretty much anything else with it that I wanted to control the way or I can lock it

02:17.750 --> 02:22.350
locking it means that if I lock it it'll stop me from being able to move it.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.450
See all of a sudden it's baked into the background.

02:24.570 --> 02:25.520
Then I can unlock it.

02:25.530 --> 02:28.870
That's helpful if you're doing a lot of moving of elements.

02:29.130 --> 02:31.550
And a lot of copying and pasting.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.130
And you really don't want to mess with a certain section over and over again.

02:35.220 --> 02:37.380
And you know it's not going to change just lock it.

02:37.650 --> 02:41.080
OK so that's one way of importing images.

02:41.190 --> 02:45.830
Another way is by actually just going down to my images down here.

02:46.200 --> 02:51.150
And then you can just upload it that way and then all of a sudden you have all of these stored.

02:51.150 --> 02:56.620
So anything I've been uploading will have it easy access so for some reason I was really narcissistic

02:56.620 --> 03:00.160
and I want to put my face like everywhere I am.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.320
Trust me I'm not really that narcissistic.

03:02.460 --> 03:08.230
Then I would be really easy to just grab it over there and then see myself.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.840
There's another way of using images.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.680
It's a little bit different.

03:12.780 --> 03:19.800
And so if you wanted to say use a background image and you wanted that to take the place of this white

03:20.640 --> 03:27.840
grid system so what you can do is you can go up to the selector for your page and background image you

03:27.840 --> 03:31.470
select image what is going to do is it just a little going to pay something in the background.

03:31.470 --> 03:40.060
So what I did to explain this point would be like I use Yelp and I took a screenshot of Yelp and then

03:40.090 --> 03:41.770
I use that as my background.

03:41.770 --> 03:43.570
Now why would I want to do this.

03:43.570 --> 03:49.780
One reason why you'd want to do this is if you say we're making wire frames to explain changes to an

03:49.780 --> 03:54.310
already existing page you're making in that case what you do is you take the background you put it back

03:54.340 --> 04:00.640
there and then you put your elements on top of it to show like I'm changing this and you'd wiped out

04:00.640 --> 04:06.160
some areas you'd wiped them out by using basic rectangles and then white color with their border to

04:06.160 --> 04:07.960
cover them up.

04:08.020 --> 04:12.250
That's one way of doing it as opposed to like recreating the entire page to show that you're changing

04:12.250 --> 04:13.050
something.

04:13.060 --> 04:18.970
It's also helpful if you for instance have elements on a page that you want to use or say there's a

04:18.970 --> 04:21.660
lot of things about that Web site that you want to emulate.

04:21.880 --> 04:27.610
What I typically would then do is take the background put it in there you go.

04:28.420 --> 04:35.350
And now all of a sudden I have these like rough guidelines that I can use to make my wire frames.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.110
So to give you an example so I just undo a phone to get rid of that.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.260
Let's create a clone.

04:41.350 --> 04:49.480
Actually we will just create a new page up here go to pages new a new page and our new page will use

04:49.480 --> 04:51.860
the background.

04:52.330 --> 04:57.730
OK so now we have the background so let's say I wanted to copy something on here then or I could just

04:57.730 --> 05:03.360
do is start dropping elements into the page like logo goes here.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.400
I like you know the spacing that they use.

05:06.640 --> 05:16.350
I could then put Let's make a header at the head right here so I can match it exactly to the number

05:16.350 --> 05:17.550
of pixels they use.

05:17.580 --> 05:20.560
If it's going to automatically snap to grid lines.

05:20.640 --> 05:25.630
So if you want it to be more exact You're presuming it's just like Photoshop in that regard.

05:27.470 --> 05:27.920
OK.

05:27.990 --> 05:28.830
There you go.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.030
So then I'd like cover it up.

05:30.030 --> 05:35.150
You might have to zoom out to get the way over OK.

05:36.470 --> 05:41.780
And then obviously make sure that you put a note here like this is to match yelps Hetter.

05:42.320 --> 05:47.220
Then what I could do in order to see that logo you would just push this into the background.

05:47.600 --> 05:52.610
So I would make sure that you're selecting the right element that actually can be rather tricky.

05:52.610 --> 05:58.480
See what I'm doing is it's making me grab the background.

05:58.570 --> 06:02.190
So what I would do is like pick it up move it just ever so slightly.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.990
And you know you're using it smoothed back.

06:05.020 --> 06:06.610
That's going to put the other one in front of it.

06:06.610 --> 06:07.520
There we go.

06:07.870 --> 06:09.700
OK so now I have you.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.480
I've stolen the dimensions of you.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.730
Basically if that's whatever I wanted to do.

06:14.750 --> 06:22.610
But I mean I could also use it to help match this search style button style etc..

06:22.790 --> 06:30.310
Well like if I wanted to use that button style I just do this in Aetate it just ever so slightly so

06:30.310 --> 06:33.740
that I could literally just put the symbol over it.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.040
It's in the tool bar.

06:36.670 --> 06:38.350
You know something like that.

06:39.090 --> 06:47.070
And then you need to modify the size so slightly.

06:47.440 --> 06:53.890
So I guess going can be exact but remember this is the point of a low fidelity wireframe is not to look

06:53.890 --> 06:59.690
exactly what it's supposed to look like it's just supposed to be visual communication tool.

07:00.100 --> 07:04.450
And then honestly what you do is you annotate that and the next lecture also hated you our stations

07:04.780 --> 07:10.150
but that is one way that you would do it if you're someone who's really picky about the grid lines just

07:10.190 --> 07:12.010
when you worry about it.

07:12.160 --> 07:15.280
So that's another way of handling images.

07:15.310 --> 07:19.510
Those are pretty much covers pretty much anything you'd ever want to do.

07:19.510 --> 07:25.640
There's one other thing and I won't include it into the this lecture because I find this rather helpful.

07:25.850 --> 07:28.200
Let's go back to our welcome page

07:30.920 --> 07:35.660
what you can do as opposed to using say like an image placeholder and I found this pretty helpful instead

07:35.660 --> 07:38.870
of using that you can use this called this freehand drawing tool.

07:38.870 --> 07:44.840
Now what I would use this for in any situation where I think I have some rough idea of what it should

07:44.840 --> 07:49.970
look like is just drop it in here and then use my mouse to just sketch what I think should be in the

07:49.970 --> 07:50.810
box.

07:50.810 --> 07:57.410
Now that's really helpful because say I'm making a mockup and I have a name you know like my mobile

07:57.410 --> 07:58.860
app for happy hours.

07:59.210 --> 08:04.310
What I would guess is you know to give some kind of an inclination to whoever is looking at it this

08:04.310 --> 08:07.910
is my logo and I kind of have a basic idea of how I want it to look.

08:08.030 --> 08:12.170
I could attempt to make something here and scratch it in.

08:12.200 --> 08:17.390
And then your designer or whoever is looking at it later will take some inference from that and they'll

08:17.390 --> 08:22.040
say oh OK I see were roughly what they think I should go with in terms of the logo what it should look

08:22.040 --> 08:25.100
like should just be letters to be an icon should it be

08:28.220 --> 08:29.700
a beer mug.

08:31.670 --> 08:34.670
Oh there you go.

08:37.850 --> 08:41.100
That roughly looks like beer maybe.

08:41.200 --> 08:49.520
And you know I'm happy hours so something like that.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.420
I personally like that's a nice little touch.

08:51.420 --> 08:55.650
It's incredibly hard to draw with your mouse but sometimes that can be quite helpful.

08:55.650 --> 08:59.070
A lot of times you can't find an icon to or an image that works perfectly.

08:59.070 --> 09:03.080
You're kind of in a rush so you just sort up there scatter like kind of scratch it in.

09:03.090 --> 09:06.150
Remember this is a low fidelity wireframe so that's perfectly acceptable.

09:06.180 --> 09:10.380
And no one is looking at this thinking that this is like your finished final finished product.

09:10.380 --> 09:11.750
No one's going to really care.

09:11.910 --> 09:15.590
And it's actually quite helpful though when you do go get a logo designed.

09:15.720 --> 09:21.620
So yeah that's basically how you handle images backgrounds and freehand sketches in the next lecture.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.180
I'm going to talk about global layers.

09:24.180 --> 09:26.550
How do you use layers to save a ton of time.

09:26.670 --> 09:29.090
How to master that section.

09:29.340 --> 09:32.940
And then in the next lecture I want to show you how to do notation.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.400
So I'll see in the next lecture.
