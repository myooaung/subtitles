Hey guys welcome back to the course.

00:12.050 --> 00:18.710
So in this lecture I'm going to cover one of my favorite strategies for getting more out of freelancer

00:18.740 --> 00:20.470
and outsourcing platforms.

00:20.480 --> 00:27.320
So this strategy that it's often used by people who outsource all the time or are looking for freelancers

00:27.320 --> 00:28.020
all the time.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.960
Something that I use constantly when I'm looking for freelancers.

00:32.150 --> 00:38.270
What are the biggest issues you'll have is that when you post on freelancer or up work or Elance you'll

00:38.270 --> 00:45.380
notice a big spurt of activity usually within the first hour to two hours you'll get four to five bids

00:45.390 --> 00:48.920
within the first day you might get 25 30 40.

00:48.920 --> 00:53.720
Usually what happens is that in the next day you might only get two to three.

00:53.780 --> 00:55.550
The next day you might only get one the next day.

00:55.550 --> 00:57.890
You only get one and then the next day you get zero.

00:57.890 --> 00:59.150
Now why does that happen.

00:59.150 --> 01:05.930
The reason why that happens is because when you post a project they give you a lot of exposure really

01:05.930 --> 01:06.760
quickly.

01:06.920 --> 01:11.270
And what's ended up happening is that a lot of freelancers and a lot of freelance firms have adapted

01:11.300 --> 01:12.230
to that.

01:12.230 --> 01:18.380
So what they do is they actually build bots or they hire people who literally just look in the new section

01:18.650 --> 01:24.060
for projects that are popped up very quickly and that's all they do is they just troll those areas.

01:24.170 --> 01:30.290
Now one pretty much unavoidable problem of posting on some of these platforms especially on freelancer

01:30.950 --> 01:34.930
is that a lot of times people just post template responses.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.970
Now that's a reaction to a lot of different things.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.640
If you have a project that is very run of the mill If you're posting in a section that has a lot of

01:43.640 --> 01:48.440
competition and not a lot of supply you're going to get a lot of people posting template answers.

01:48.560 --> 01:54.500
As I've explained elsewhere in the course looking for a freelancer who actually respond specifically

01:54.500 --> 01:59.810
to your project and appears to be dynamic and thoughtful is incredibly important.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.790
So much more important than the price they pitch you.

02:02.960 --> 02:09.320
But what ends up happening a lot of times is you post a project and you get 25 bids and only one person

02:09.320 --> 02:13.770
maybe gives you a actually thoughtful unique response.

02:13.790 --> 02:20.030
So the way you get around that is a technique we just call rapid cycling posts and this is something

02:20.030 --> 02:25.940
that we do on freelancer a lot of the time on freelancer you get Honestly you'll probably get all of

02:25.940 --> 02:29.000
your bids within a couple hours and then nothing after that.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.750
So what you can do is you can post a listing post it see the batch you get if you do not find someone

02:35.810 --> 02:38.680
immediately who clicks you repost it.

02:38.780 --> 02:39.070
OK.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.040
How does that work.

02:40.040 --> 02:46.430
Well the way it works is pretty simple freelancers are only going to look at the content of your post

02:47.300 --> 02:51.800
and not necessarily any of the other unique identifiers in what you're putting up.

02:51.800 --> 02:57.290
So really all you have to do is slightly change the title slightly changed the description maybe delete

02:57.290 --> 02:58.640
a paragraph.

02:58.680 --> 03:05.000
What we often will do is do an attachment and on the attachment have all these actual information about

03:05.000 --> 03:06.010
the project.

03:06.050 --> 03:10.580
Also a good strategy because you want to make sure people open it and spend time reading it and we just

03:10.580 --> 03:14.720
move information in there and move some of it back into the project posting.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.520
That's all you really have to do.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.840
You do not need to pay to get featured.

03:18.920 --> 03:26.270
If you pay $25 you yes you might get 100 bids and that might be helpful but you can also do is you could

03:26.270 --> 03:31.310
use a rapid cycle of your posts post one way to our posts another way and our posts another and you'd

03:31.310 --> 03:32.900
get a hundred for $0.

03:32.900 --> 03:38.990
Now the biggest advantage to doing this is that when you actually are posting a project you posted projects

03:38.990 --> 03:45.410
in the past which you'll notice is that there's almost always an obvious answer to your freelancer especially

03:45.410 --> 03:48.060
if you've actually put some thought into the post.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.170
You know exactly what you're looking for and you're responsive.

03:51.170 --> 03:52.110
Now what I mean my response.

03:52.120 --> 03:57.020
I mean when you post it and people give you a bid you may immediately respond and ask questions to make

03:57.020 --> 04:01.370
sure that they're engaged and make sure that this isn't just a robot or a template response but what

04:01.370 --> 04:05.830
you can do is very quickly sniff out who are the good freelancers and who the ones are going to fit.

04:06.020 --> 04:08.750
And a lot of times you just will not get a winner.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.120
You might get someone you're not totally sure about.

04:11.240 --> 04:16.940
When in doubt repost posted all you have to do is change the title ever so slightly repost it.

04:16.940 --> 04:18.890
You don't need to pay for upgrades.

04:18.890 --> 04:23.490
This is especially helpful if you're trying to hire someone right now and you post and no one says they're

04:23.510 --> 04:24.400
available right now.

04:24.410 --> 04:25.210
Repost it.

04:25.220 --> 04:30.710
You'll notice that you'll get maybe 20 30 percent of the same people bidding but you'll get another

04:30.710 --> 04:33.200
fresh batch of 80 percent different.

04:33.330 --> 04:34.700
OK that's an advance tip.

04:34.740 --> 04:40.010
An advanced strategy you guys can try it out if it doesn't work for you or you didn't have a strategy.

04:40.010 --> 04:40.730
It's a little bit better.

04:40.730 --> 04:52.630
Just post in the group discussion private message me otherwise guys I'll see the next lecture.
