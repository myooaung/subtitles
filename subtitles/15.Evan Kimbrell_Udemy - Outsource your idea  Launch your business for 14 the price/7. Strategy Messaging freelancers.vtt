00:06.000 --> 00:06.320
Hey guys.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.600
Welcome back to the course so in this lecture.

00:08.640 --> 00:15.740
Just want to talk a little bit about a technique that is almost never used and it always drives me crazy.

00:15.780 --> 00:20.360
It's something that can really help you get a lot more bids for your projects.

00:20.490 --> 00:27.570
Every single system that we've covered in this course allows you the option to kind of turn this whole

00:27.570 --> 00:33.570
process upside down as opposed to posting a job profile and having someone find it and then send you

00:33.570 --> 00:34.520
a proposal.

00:34.590 --> 00:39.690
You can actually go and look for specific freelancers you think look interesting or look like a good

00:39.690 --> 00:42.060
fit and send them a message.

00:42.060 --> 00:45.280
So each one handles it a little bit differently.

00:45.300 --> 00:49.300
It's definitely something you should take advantage of.

00:49.380 --> 00:53.370
A lot of people don't do it because they think it's going to be onerous or it's going to take too much

00:53.370 --> 00:54.020
time.

00:54.030 --> 00:56.370
I'm telling you right now that's not really the case.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.730
Here's how I do it whenever I post a job.

00:58.740 --> 01:00.560
I'll just open up a separate document.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.810
And all right a quick message and I'll make this generic.

01:03.810 --> 01:05.960
This is what I'm going to send to the freelancer.

01:06.360 --> 01:19.520
I'd just generally say hey I was looking at your profile and you would be a good fit for my project.

01:20.070 --> 01:23.120
And then I can give some basic information about my project.

01:23.160 --> 01:36.300
My project is for and I know that you and you have similar skills for you if you're interested.

01:38.580 --> 01:48.810
And just let me hope to see you in the project judge something along those lines really it just needs

01:48.810 --> 01:50.850
to be generic.

01:50.850 --> 01:55.380
The idea is that you get to look for people who have the same skill sets that you want and then say

01:55.380 --> 01:59.700
something that makes it appear as if you've really looked in-depth at their profile.

01:59.700 --> 02:03.920
That's going to increase the chance chances the likelihood that they're going to bid on your project.

02:03.960 --> 02:10.230
Really this is enough to get you know if you send 30 messages you'll get 20 bids Unless of course you're

02:10.230 --> 02:11.280
an freelancer.

02:11.370 --> 02:16.520
In that case maybe you only get 10 but that's a significant amount of interest.

02:16.530 --> 02:20.610
It's also going to increase the quality of your proposals because the people who get a message from

02:20.610 --> 02:25.410
you who come to your project and bid they think they already have a leg up so they're going to spend

02:25.410 --> 02:27.800
a little bit more time on your project.

02:27.810 --> 02:31.840
So the way that I just go about doing it is I just copy it.

02:32.520 --> 02:37.980
So each one of them is a little bit different on elance as you can see right here for a page we made

02:37.980 --> 02:44.230
before on a page we made before here is invited.

02:44.250 --> 02:49.910
And you can see that I took advantage of this for a project that we were building before for our client.

02:50.010 --> 02:55.590
And as you can see over here I sent 28 invitations six accepted 14 declined.

02:55.590 --> 02:56.700
That's pretty good.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.500
That means they got six bids out of the 20 I sent.

02:59.640 --> 03:04.680
After you create a project on e Leonce what it does is it's automatically going to populate a list of

03:04.680 --> 03:08.040
people that have the skill sets that you set up in your project page.

03:08.190 --> 03:12.430
And then with one button you can invite Twenty four people or something like that.

03:12.550 --> 03:15.590
L.A. is going to limit you to messaging 30 people a day.

03:15.630 --> 03:20.820
So what you can do is just set an alarm and come back the next day 24 hours after you post it and just

03:20.820 --> 03:23.600
keep doing this until you get someone that you're really happy with.

03:23.610 --> 03:28.770
Now obviously keep in mind we have other techniques for figuring out what's a good bid and what's not

03:28.770 --> 03:29.310
a good bid.

03:29.310 --> 03:33.420
So you can quickly get rid of the ones that are junk and move through them more quickly.

03:33.420 --> 03:38.490
Otherwise if you invite 100 people you might get 80 bids and that might be overwhelming.

03:38.490 --> 03:41.490
So really all you do is you hire search freelancers.

03:41.490 --> 03:44.450
So right off the bat it just gives you a generic one over here.

03:44.460 --> 03:47.930
This is where you need to get detailed though you need to pick exactly what you want.

03:47.940 --> 03:53.610
You know if I'm building an iOS application I might pick my category is I.T. programming then I can

03:53.610 --> 03:56.930
pick my country and I can pick my skills.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.890
They even give you lots of stuff sufferer here.

03:58.900 --> 04:02.580
Number of reviews people who don't have enough reviews means they haven't been on the system long enough

04:02.580 --> 04:04.210
feedback same thing.

04:04.460 --> 04:09.390
You can only go for people who are higher rated typically don't mess with these hourly rate is worth

04:09.390 --> 04:13.710
doing and if you're very specific about that we can get very specific to what we think we need.

04:13.710 --> 04:18.900
Maybe I want only want an individual we want an individual who's an I.T. and programming.

04:18.900 --> 04:29.000
I only want them in a region let's say Eastern Europe and then I can say it with specific skills in

04:29.090 --> 04:33.260
Iowa us so we can just say Iowa development.

04:33.260 --> 04:33.910
There we go.

04:34.130 --> 04:34.400
OK.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.630
Now I have a pretty good list of people.

04:37.850 --> 04:38.060
OK.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.030
Now I have a pretty good list of people.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.280
All I have to do is go through and click hire me.

04:43.280 --> 04:48.920
And then what will happen is if I have a job posting that's active I'll just it says you invite them

04:48.920 --> 04:49.720
to a job.

04:49.760 --> 04:54.090
You invite them to a job you hit continue on the next message will ask you to send them a private message.

04:54.110 --> 04:56.010
That's right copy and paste the message.

04:56.060 --> 05:00.530
You can actually get a virtual assistant do this for you every single day and will cost you 50 cents

05:00.530 --> 05:01.690
a day.

05:01.700 --> 05:07.010
It's funny you can actually use emollients or oDesk or up works or to actually go and hire someone to

05:07.010 --> 05:08.520
do this for you.

05:08.540 --> 05:10.810
So in freelancer it's a little bit different.

05:10.820 --> 05:16.040
You just go to hire freelancers and then you go to browse directory.

05:16.160 --> 05:21.380
It works in a very similar way because then after that we're going to look at the criteria they use

05:21.380 --> 05:23.230
to narrow down the list.

05:23.300 --> 05:28.790
Over here you can pick your country you can look for keywords you can pick exams they've passed things

05:28.790 --> 05:31.230
like that it doesn't let you get too much in depth.

05:31.250 --> 05:35.480
So then what you would do is instead of cooking hire me because this will ask you to create a private

05:35.480 --> 05:41.220
project you actually click their name once you're actually into their page over here instead of putting

05:41.230 --> 05:42.890
hire me just drop this down.

05:42.950 --> 05:44.430
You say invite the project.

05:44.600 --> 05:48.930
So then I have a fake project I put up I can invite.

05:48.950 --> 05:51.920
So after you had invited I asked you to send a message and you're all set.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.220
So just go through as many as you can.

05:54.350 --> 05:55.640
They're going to limit you again.

05:55.640 --> 05:58.920
I think it's to 50 a day which is more than you would ever need.

05:59.040 --> 06:03.760
All right on up work you just go to freelancers and you're going to find freelancers.

06:03.860 --> 06:09.560
And then here you can search for specific skills or countries or you can go through a broader category.

06:09.560 --> 06:14.260
So maybe I'm looking for again an Iowa developer so I will go to mobile development.

06:14.590 --> 06:14.890
OK.

06:14.900 --> 06:20.630
And then right off the bat we can see here it populates the list and I can get more specific how much

06:20.630 --> 06:22.100
experience do I want.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.720
How much feedback Do I want.

06:23.780 --> 06:29.780
I can also pick pretty much everything that we've seen and the other one so uses get very specific.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.550
Invite as many people as you can.

06:31.550 --> 06:38.720
If you're not getting a bid that you like keep inviting people there's no reason not to max out this

06:38.720 --> 06:40.720
option whenever you can.

06:41.030 --> 06:45.140
Honestly this is one of the better things that will help you throughout this entire process and you

06:45.140 --> 06:47.870
can use this with a lot of different platforms.

06:47.870 --> 06:50.750
They open this up to you not enough people take advantage of it.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.240
It's really really simple.

06:52.310 --> 06:58.190
If you just write a template message it'll dramatically increase your bid rate the total amount of bids

06:58.190 --> 07:01.940
and it'll dramatically increase the chance that you find someone that you really want to work with.

07:01.940 --> 07:11.450
So I will see you guys in the next lecture.
