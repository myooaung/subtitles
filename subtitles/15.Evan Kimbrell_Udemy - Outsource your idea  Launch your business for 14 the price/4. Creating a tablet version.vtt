WEBVTT

00:04.350 --> 00:06.410
Get to the course.

00:06.420 --> 00:13.260
So in this lecture I'm just going to show you very quickly how we can put together a tablet version

00:13.290 --> 00:17.020
of our marketing access panel or portal.

00:17.140 --> 00:22.920
Tony I don't actually remember what the P stands for regardless so what you would just do is you would

00:22.920 --> 00:27.560
go back to where all the prototypes we've been creating is new prototype.

00:27.570 --> 00:32.820
Now here it's going to automatically set up what you want 7 inch 10 inch.

00:32.910 --> 00:40.860
It doesn't particularly matter a 10 inch is what an iPad would be and a 7 inch would be something more

00:40.950 --> 00:45.150
like one of those Nexxus tablets or something like that.

00:45.210 --> 00:48.930
We're going to go a 10 inch and it doesn't again really matter all they're going to do is change the

00:48.930 --> 00:53.180
canvas size for you and then we're actually going to change those.

00:53.190 --> 00:54.770
So pick that.

00:55.080 --> 00:58.130
OK so now let's label something similar.

00:58.320 --> 01:03.420
So call it a p tablet.

01:04.620 --> 01:11.500
Now all of my designs are currently in portrait meaning the iPad is sitting upright.

01:11.520 --> 01:14.580
It's has thinner with taller height.

01:14.670 --> 01:21.020
Some of you might get both those designs specifically Pinocchio handles that actually rather easily.

01:21.060 --> 01:25.830
I can show you how we can add a basic interaction to it and it allows it to do.

01:25.830 --> 01:32.760
Is that when we rotate the iPad or the tablet it will actually just shift the image so that it kind

01:32.760 --> 01:37.620
of does an imitation of what a portrait or a landscape layout should be.

01:37.620 --> 01:42.300
And for prototype purposes honestly that is really all you need.

01:42.300 --> 01:48.330
So start off with the home page and then we'll go in and set the canvas to whatever we want it to be.

01:48.330 --> 01:53.490
Right now it has its resolution at 768 by 12:28.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.530
Now if you want to know what the iPad screen resolution is it's very simple actually you could just

01:57.540 --> 02:00.350
Google it you just say iPad 2 portrait resolution.

02:00.540 --> 02:03.550
Look at the 7 6 8 by 10:24.

02:03.780 --> 02:08.850
So actually this is giving us a little bit too much height of course.

02:08.850 --> 02:14.970
It doesn't really matter what the height is because you know you might have a page that scrolls on and

02:14.970 --> 02:15.910
on and on.

02:16.080 --> 02:20.350
So there shouldn't really be a limit to how tall it should be.

02:20.400 --> 02:24.630
What will happen is that when you deploy it in your iPad you're actually just going to scroll through

02:24.630 --> 02:26.700
it like you would a page.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.470
So don't really worry about the height.

02:28.470 --> 02:30.480
Just make sure that you're getting the width correct.

02:30.480 --> 02:37.300
Now if you wanted to build this for say like iPad Mini you do the same thing and it's roughly There

02:37.320 --> 02:38.980
you go it's the exact same thing.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.720
You can check say the iPad 3.

02:41.790 --> 02:43.000
Same thing same thing.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.540
So not much has happened with those.

02:45.540 --> 02:51.650
You can probably check other things like the Nexus tablet or say the Nexus 7.

02:51.720 --> 02:57.420
See it gives us the Nexus 7 the Nexus 7 is thinner and not as tall would probably be the 7 inch that

02:57.420 --> 02:58.790
they're referring to before.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.860
We're not going to do this we're just going to focus on iPad OK.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.540
So we are all set on this side.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.240
Really all we need to do is just importer images.

03:08.530 --> 03:10.350
Now this is typically how I do it.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.960
Not always correct but that's how I do it.

03:14.230 --> 03:18.180
So just import it.

03:18.220 --> 03:19.820
This one's easy because it just fits.

03:19.850 --> 03:24.460
We don't have to do any of that weird modification to fit our browser size

03:28.040 --> 03:29.400
but other than that it looks fine.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.470
OK.

03:30.920 --> 03:37.820
So now what I get to do is that when I go back to multiply these now guys if you really kind of get

03:37.820 --> 03:40.740
the gist from here going on out you can skip ahead.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.140
You don't really need to follow along.

03:42.140 --> 03:47.060
All actually in the editing of this lecture skip ahead quite a bit.

03:47.090 --> 03:51.110
So you don't need to see every single step it's really the same thing I'm just using different images.

03:51.230 --> 03:56.560
And then at the very end will deploy all of them and will see how they look on actual devices.

04:00.130 --> 04:00.860
OK.

04:01.310 --> 04:03.290
So I could add the three main ones.

04:03.290 --> 04:09.420
Remember how we contact form and the Lightbox we just create them separately.

04:09.560 --> 04:15.000
I'm going to go ahead and add all of the action areas like I would.

04:15.650 --> 04:19.340
So this one always had back to the main page

04:26.630 --> 04:33.010
we will make this stack you will go to the stack.

04:33.030 --> 04:33.330
You

04:40.970 --> 04:46.450
and each individual one of these.

04:46.570 --> 04:49.860
Now I notice that it's cutting off the bottom of the page just slightly.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.370
So I'm going to add some high.

04:51.430 --> 04:55.920
See if I can recover that.

04:55.940 --> 04:56.580
There you go.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.450
Now that's actually what we wanted.

04:58.550 --> 05:02.330
Then we'll add this and all changes to a pop up

05:07.860 --> 05:09.990
OK so I added all the action areas.

05:09.990 --> 05:16.600
I will spare you guys watching me add every single action area but I'm going to put them all together.

05:16.710 --> 05:22.740
Now I'm going to show you really quickly how we can add the interaction such that when you tilt it will

05:23.550 --> 05:29.730
correctly read like change the layout so you can see it in landscape and portrait.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.950
It's actually a pretty cool trick.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.220
So what you do is you want to select the main image since it's all images.

05:35.220 --> 05:36.000
This is how you do it.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.280
Now if you add individual icons and elements on the page you want to select all of them and you probably

05:41.280 --> 05:44.300
just drag and drop like this inflect all.

05:44.310 --> 05:48.390
In this case I can just grab the whole image because that's the only thing I have and then I'm going

05:48.390 --> 05:54.110
to add interactions and list out all the interactions we already have.

05:54.120 --> 05:58.520
These are all clicks and clicks and clicks and it even tells me and I can delete them this way.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.180
So helpful.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.150
Going to new interaction.

06:01.370 --> 06:08.600
And then what I can do is I say so when the user and I have turns the device flips the device tilts

06:08.600 --> 06:11.430
the device or shakes the device.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.270
In this case you want it to turn.

06:13.280 --> 06:19.820
So as we turn it then it should be able to recognize that flipping it flipping it will do is we will

06:19.820 --> 06:22.320
want to display all the image upside down.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.350
It's up to you whether or not you want to display that.

06:24.350 --> 06:28.500
I typically just do turns the device so we'll turn this to landscape.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.240
OK.

06:29.270 --> 06:31.720
So that's really all you have to do it for somebody.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.700
It gives you problems you can make it redundant.

06:33.710 --> 06:36.410
You can say show this page.

06:36.410 --> 06:40.380
So usually it's just when this happens then this happens.

06:40.460 --> 06:47.170
So what I have is when the user turns that device and the direction they turn it to is turns to landscape.

06:47.330 --> 06:54.830
Then you show this page and then what all would have to do is change the orientation of the image and

06:54.930 --> 07:00.920
it will actually handle that for you if you want to have animation you can fade effect fade in from

07:00.920 --> 07:06.000
bottom whatever really you want doesn't particularly matter.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.910
You can Adoree action your reaction is after that happens you can have a chain of events that happen

07:11.780 --> 07:19.250
if you didn't wanted to say Read change the way it looks and then say it goes back or plays a sound

07:19.250 --> 07:22.950
or shows a system a letter or something or something doesn't particularly matter.

07:23.090 --> 07:27.800
You can really kind of cake on these interactions the way you get to interactions on anything is the

07:27.800 --> 07:31.000
same way you get to any of the modification information.

07:31.010 --> 07:35.750
You just go here and sort of properties to interactions new interaction and you can inspect them.

07:35.870 --> 07:36.260
OK.

07:36.320 --> 07:42.710
So I will spare you having to watch me do this but that is how you handle mobile and tablet versions.

07:42.740 --> 07:47.590
I will put together a portrait version of the mobile phone.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.720
We don't necessarily need to watch that.

07:49.940 --> 07:55.520
It's the same kind of concept and also the thing is that I don't believe that the horizontal will work

07:55.550 --> 07:59.860
because the same image cannot just be rotated with the mobile phone.

07:59.870 --> 08:04.520
So what we'll do with the mobile phone is just keep it portrait because I don't actually have any horizontal

08:04.580 --> 08:05.900
images for that.

08:05.900 --> 08:10.460
But if you're going to get this design did you really thought it was important to simulate rotating

08:10.460 --> 08:15.300
your devices than it's very important that you get multiple designs designed.

08:15.310 --> 08:17.350
Now it's not particularly expensive to do that.

08:17.350 --> 08:20.250
I wouldn't really worry about it you would just say hey I need a portrait.

08:20.270 --> 08:22.120
A portrait version for my mobile phone.

08:22.130 --> 08:25.060
And then once they make that you say OK well now I need a landscape.

08:25.150 --> 08:29.390
They're not really designing any new elements per se in some cases they might but in most cases they're

08:29.390 --> 08:34.190
just taking the buttons they have shrinking them resizing them and putting them in different locations.

08:34.190 --> 08:40.380
Now taking into consideration the different screen resolution so it shouldn't be too hard to do or expensive.

08:40.640 --> 08:45.860
I wouldn't really worry about it but this is pretty much the end of creating our prototypes now and

08:45.860 --> 08:51.710
the next lecture I will show you in real life what it looks like when I deploy it and we can kind of

08:51.800 --> 08:57.530
just demo it really quickly to show you the functionality and talk about kind of what we can use these.
