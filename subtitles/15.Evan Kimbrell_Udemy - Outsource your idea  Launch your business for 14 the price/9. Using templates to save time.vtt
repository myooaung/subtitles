Convert to the course I wanted to show you really quickly something that Paducah offers bosonic has

00:11.920 --> 00:13.290
the same thing.

00:13.360 --> 00:18.390
Same with if you ever wanna use kino and Kino topia they have template libraries.

00:18.400 --> 00:26.440
Now these are really helpful because a lot of people make specifics wireframe for Android Windows Phone

00:26.440 --> 00:30.910
Iowa us and they don't have all of the stencils you could possibly want.

00:30.910 --> 00:37.330
And so it's really helpful what you can do is you just go to these templates and get a lot of reusable

00:37.420 --> 00:38.800
elements that are really helpful.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.340
So for instance if I'm making an iOS app I can download it.

00:42.350 --> 00:44.340
I've already downloaded it.

00:44.650 --> 00:45.410
And here we go.

00:45.430 --> 00:49.350
I have a whole section of stuff I could use.

00:49.710 --> 00:56.050
I for instance this would be really helpful if I wanted to simulate the keyboard I could use a keyboard

00:56.320 --> 00:57.810
and insert that in.

00:57.820 --> 01:06.460
Now the way that you pull that into Paducah is pretty simple you just go to your web your prototype

01:07.360 --> 01:08.710
select any page

01:12.620 --> 01:15.740
and then it you literally just pull it in through my images.

01:15.740 --> 01:20.900
So I would say right here you pick something like this.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.470
There you go.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.180
Or keyboard.

01:23.180 --> 01:26.650
I want to add Qwerty.

01:26.650 --> 01:27.700
There you go.

01:27.710 --> 01:28.860
There it is.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.630
Now I can use that as I please.

01:31.640 --> 01:36.410
All this doesn't make sense because it's on a web format but that's how you would pull and specific

01:36.410 --> 01:37.550
elements.

01:37.700 --> 01:42.380
It's really helpful because it makes it look a little bit more realistic when you have all the standard

01:42.380 --> 01:45.490
stuff like Windows phone it can be very strange.

01:45.490 --> 01:49.670
So it's helpful as well because if you're building something that has a lot of social integrations they

01:49.670 --> 01:54.710
are not going to help you be able to imitate every single type of button that Facebook has or Facebook

01:54.710 --> 02:00.650
Connect or really any of the things that they could possibly use later in the course.

02:00.650 --> 02:04.430
I'm going to show you how to recreate Facebook and Pinocchio just as an exercise.

02:04.430 --> 02:06.170
You guys can get good at this.

02:06.170 --> 02:11.210
And I will use the stencil set because I can use some of the items in and it's sins of saving me a lot

02:11.210 --> 02:11.930
of time.

02:12.020 --> 02:17.090
Again if you want to make an e-commerce site use these two as well so check these out if you're doing

02:17.090 --> 02:21.350
mobile e-commerce and anything that does your Facebook can save you a decent chunk of time.

02:21.380 --> 02:22.250
Right so in the next lecture.
