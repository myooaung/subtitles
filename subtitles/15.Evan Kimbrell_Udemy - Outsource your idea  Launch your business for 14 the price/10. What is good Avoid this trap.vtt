00:05.580 --> 00:11.870
A little bit about the concept of what good is and how that applies to outsource labor.

00:12.130 --> 00:17.670
This is a concept that really helped me when I started to wrap my head around it.

00:17.860 --> 00:24.820
When I first started outsourcing it was very difficult as I noticed there were big differences between

00:24.880 --> 00:29.630
what the outsourced labor would say is good and what I considered good.

00:30.070 --> 00:34.520
At first I thought it was just this huge disconnect I just assumed that they were bad at what they did

00:35.440 --> 00:39.650
but actually what ended up happening was I kind of came to a little bit of a revelation.

00:39.670 --> 00:45.030
And ever since it's really helped me know what level of communication that I should engage with with

00:45.030 --> 00:46.080
private contractors.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.750
And for you the listener This is a side anecdote.

00:48.760 --> 00:53.950
But I think it's something that is essential to you understanding the perspective of the people that

00:53.950 --> 00:55.290
you hire.

00:55.300 --> 01:00.130
So this really only applies to when you're hiring someone from a country that is cheaper in terms of

01:00.130 --> 01:06.280
labor rates and that usually will mean that the country is significantly poorer than say a developed

01:06.280 --> 01:08.080
country at G-20.

01:08.320 --> 01:12.820
If you've never been to the country that you're hiring from whether it's you know Eastern Europe or

01:12.820 --> 01:18.940
specifically India or even you know Central America this is something that's very hard for you to understand

01:18.940 --> 01:24.950
because you assume we all use the same websites you assume that we all use the same design standards.

01:25.060 --> 01:30.760
You kind of assume that what I think is beautiful is what they think is beautiful and even Obviously

01:30.760 --> 01:35.000
there's differences between countries that are right next to each other and have same kind of socio

01:35.020 --> 01:36.760
economic level.

01:37.120 --> 01:40.210
Let's say that you hire a freelancer from India.

01:40.210 --> 01:48.640
You're thrilled because you have huge cost savings but you might have followed a less rigid schedule

01:48.640 --> 01:52.130
when developing the specifications for your application.

01:52.240 --> 01:57.670
You might have erred on the side of I think that the developer can interpret what I'm saying and I don't

01:57.670 --> 02:03.700
need to give every little bit of detail I don't need to say what style of button he should use and what

02:03.700 --> 02:09.630
color palette and what kind of interaction should happen when I touch things on the Web site.

02:09.730 --> 02:14.100
You kind of assume that all of that comes in tow that they just know that right.

02:15.030 --> 02:18.690
That is a false assumption when it comes to an outsource developer.

02:18.690 --> 02:25.440
A lot of them simply either one do not understand what it is that you want or do they understand what

02:25.440 --> 02:26.430
they think is good.

02:26.430 --> 02:32.850
And so they are going to strive to achieve a Web site or a design that they consider good.

02:32.850 --> 02:37.310
Now here's where the biggest discrepancy is if you've ever been to India.

02:37.350 --> 02:42.990
And I did end up living there for quite some time and I can use India as an example because this is

02:42.990 --> 02:44.930
the I.T. outsourcing hub.

02:44.940 --> 02:50.340
It's by far the biggest group when it comes to outsourcing and when you go and you start looking for

02:50.340 --> 02:55.590
freelancers you probably noticed you know 40 50 percent of them are from India India Bangladesh even

02:55.590 --> 02:56.760
Sri Lanka.

02:57.150 --> 03:02.240
But if you ever go to India you will just notice that and it's not necessarily the country itself.

03:02.250 --> 03:09.600
But if you just look at say a Web site or a billboard or a basic advertisement to you it just looks

03:09.600 --> 03:15.920
physically unappealing it looks like a design standard that to us was used in the 90s.

03:15.960 --> 03:21.750
I'm going to bring up a couple Web sites on the screen that you can see if you just go and look at say

03:21.750 --> 03:28.410
in the top 10 Web sites you can notice what they consider a top 10 Web site and then look at the design

03:28.410 --> 03:29.520
standard.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.070
And you'll notice that their design standard by what we consider good.

03:33.100 --> 03:35.480
That's what I would call subpar.

03:35.520 --> 03:43.440
They have designs that you would associate with the old version of e-bay or very flat basic design can

03:43.440 --> 03:50.100
pull up a logo here this logo as you notice it has that and gloss candied effect with a gradient that

03:50.100 --> 03:52.110
runs to the top.

03:52.110 --> 03:56.970
That was a design standard in the United States back in like right around the aisle when the iPhone

03:56.970 --> 04:00.070
was coming out like 2006 2007.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.180
We like to Candy everything.

04:03.330 --> 04:10.310
Since 2000 10 or 11 that stopped being considered by the general US population as a good design standard.

04:10.310 --> 04:16.920
And so we moved on then we moved on to like what we Apple would call skew morphic designs.

04:16.910 --> 04:21.860
Remember the old iOS Apple with the buttons that look like they're almost 3-D in a sense they look like

04:21.860 --> 04:28.250
they're actually physically there and in a sense with iOS 8 we've moved on to flat basic design and

04:28.250 --> 04:31.170
we're now shifting towards flat is beautiful.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.700
So you know I kind of described how the trends work in the United States.

04:35.700 --> 04:41.280
Other countries have different trends but specifically in India they're trends just typically a lag

04:41.280 --> 04:42.670
behind the United States.

04:42.690 --> 04:48.000
And so if you live in India and you're constantly consuming all of this advertisement consuming all

04:48.000 --> 04:53.970
these Web sites mobile apps and they're on a different design standard when you naturally and intuitively

04:53.970 --> 04:59.490
think of what is good and when you're making an application and you don't have directions as to how

04:59.490 --> 05:04.080
to make something work or make something look you're going to default to or try to achieve what you

05:04.080 --> 05:05.740
consider to be good.

05:05.940 --> 05:08.660
Now good is very relative.

05:08.670 --> 05:14.310
And that is where the biggest disconnect I've ever experience with outsourced labor is they don't understand

05:14.310 --> 05:18.870
what your level of good is and they're good for us is terrible.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.820
You know you could see these examples I brought up.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.960
These are just normal things that you see on an everyday basis.

05:23.970 --> 05:31.970
And again to us ugly to them totally normal it this is not to say that they don't have beautiful advertisements

05:31.970 --> 05:37.570
so they don't have beautiful Web sites clear trip is a great example of an Indian airline booking website

05:37.570 --> 05:38.610
that's fantastic.

05:38.710 --> 05:42.820
But then it links you to the airlines in India and their Web sites are just horrible.

05:42.820 --> 05:45.210
They look like front page from the 1990s.

05:45.640 --> 05:50.410
You need to keep this in mind when you are writing your specifications and when you're communicating

05:50.410 --> 05:54.220
with the developer do not assume they know what you want.

05:54.280 --> 06:01.660
Be as specific as possible especially be specific when it comes to things like the design and things

06:01.660 --> 06:04.140
like what type of javascript you should use.

06:04.180 --> 06:09.980
Now when I say design I mean show them a Web site and say I like the design from this.

06:10.060 --> 06:12.280
I want it to look like this.

06:12.280 --> 06:16.620
Ideally show them two or three if they don't know how to recreate that.

06:16.630 --> 06:18.930
They can use some basic kind of copying techniques.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.390
The point is you're setting a baseline for them.

06:21.400 --> 06:26.560
They just know the end of the day this is what it should look like and that's going to allow them to

06:26.560 --> 06:29.320
make improvisations on the spot.

06:30.830 --> 06:34.880
And then what do I mean by what type of javascript you should be using.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.190
I mean what interactions you should use.

06:37.190 --> 06:41.980
Go to our Web site and focus solely on what happens when you click things.

06:42.050 --> 06:44.050
What happens when you load pages.

06:44.090 --> 06:50.420
There are all sorts of intermediate pages that you just are not aware of because you're used to it.

06:50.540 --> 06:57.500
Like for instance if you look at the lecture I'm doing on e L'anse when I go and load my dashboard typically

06:57.500 --> 07:02.750
an Indian Web site will just leave it blank and then have something show up once it's loaded.

07:02.750 --> 07:09.800
Elance is going to show a spinning loader so I can know that unexpecting content to come in right now

07:09.800 --> 07:11.210
it's not ready to load.

07:11.240 --> 07:19.570
That's an intermediate page is what I essentially call it interaction things that move you need to be

07:19.570 --> 07:22.300
as specific as possible.

07:22.300 --> 07:27.370
The way that you can kind of avoid this good trap is through documentation.

07:27.460 --> 07:32.890
And when you work with your graphic designer sketch out all of the pages you want to design and then

07:32.890 --> 07:38.410
design an extra 50 percent Design intermediate pages design what a list looks like when it doesn't come

07:38.410 --> 07:44.410
up with something designed with the four or four page looks like design everything that could possibly

07:44.410 --> 07:50.950
happen every different color that could happen that when you're like highlighting taxed.

07:50.950 --> 07:54.590
Try to think of every single instance and design that.

07:54.640 --> 07:59.620
And that way when you use outsource labor you don't have to rely on them to determine in their head

07:59.620 --> 08:00.960
what good is.

08:01.090 --> 08:06.310
They can just follow your directions but then make sure that they have an example Web site showing what

08:06.310 --> 08:07.780
you consider good quality.

08:07.780 --> 08:13.930
So they take a look at those and then refer back to them in times when they're in doubt if you want

08:13.930 --> 08:15.700
to get deeper into this.

08:15.700 --> 08:22.330
Go to Lexa dot com site rankings and just look at some of the common countries that you outsource to.

08:22.420 --> 08:27.310
And then look at the Web sites that are in the top 10 typically on the top 10 you know obviously of

08:27.310 --> 08:29.170
those are the big ones like Google and Facebook.

08:29.350 --> 08:32.140
But look at the ones that are very specific to that area.

08:32.140 --> 08:35.770
Look at the bank Web sites look at the airline Web sites.

08:35.820 --> 08:40.320
Now you can start to get an idea of what they consider beautiful in terms of web design standards.

08:40.570 --> 08:46.030
And this will just give you an idea that there actually is a very big gap between what I'm talking about

08:46.030 --> 08:52.820
when I say good and what they think when they say good the way that you avoid this trap is you communicate

08:52.820 --> 08:53.310
more.

08:53.330 --> 08:59.090
You add more detail to your specifications and you cover as many bases as you can with the terms of

08:59.090 --> 08:59.840
screen design.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.460
When you're working with your graphic design.
