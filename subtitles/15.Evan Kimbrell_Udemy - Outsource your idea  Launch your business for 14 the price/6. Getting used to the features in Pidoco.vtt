00:05.780 --> 00:12.510
Of course so this lecture we're going to get a little bit closer although I'm going to show you how

00:12.510 --> 00:18.990
to use some of the other features every marketing tool has its own centricity is not different in that

00:18.990 --> 00:19.750
regard.

00:19.980 --> 00:24.840
The way that you handle certain things is just a little on your own.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.390
You waste a lot of time.

00:26.470 --> 00:29.840
I'm sure you know how you handle that.

00:29.890 --> 00:32.690
Now some of it is a little counterintuitive.

00:32.690 --> 00:35.000
It's helpful for this lecture.

00:35.040 --> 00:41.520
There is a lot going on in the long and you might not see that there's a ton of different things to

00:41.520 --> 00:42.240
use.

00:42.270 --> 00:44.170
You just have to know where to find it.

00:44.490 --> 00:49.170
And the more you understand about this tool and the more things you can do with it the better you're

00:49.170 --> 00:54.400
going to be with wireframe are successfully going to be pretty unbelievable.

00:54.420 --> 00:57.210
Easy to understand easy to communicate.

00:57.380 --> 00:57.730
All right.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.890
It's good to see.

00:59.370 --> 01:03.270
If you ever want to delete anything you just literally select it and just hit delete.

01:03.270 --> 01:05.880
You can also right click and hit delete.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.430
So another way of doing it.

01:07.530 --> 01:10.200
So then I got to do this I can just grab them and delete that.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.230
So this is pretty much your playground.

01:13.230 --> 01:18.610
This is where you grab things and throw them in here and you can move them around in this area.

01:19.220 --> 01:23.010
There's a lot of interesting interesting features in here and they try their best to simulate as many

01:23.010 --> 01:25.040
things as possible.

01:25.260 --> 01:30.720
So like for instance if you ever have sliders you know this would be something that someone would move

01:30.720 --> 01:32.520
with their mouse or move their fingers.

01:32.520 --> 01:37.500
More likely this is something you'd move with your fingers sliders in general and not use all the time

01:37.500 --> 01:39.480
with web browsers.

01:39.690 --> 01:44.760
You also have things like rating's So like where this is something that you would see on an app store

01:44.760 --> 01:52.890
or an app icon or an app page I mean you see those quite a bit you see the Yelp page that's promoting

01:52.890 --> 01:54.540
a business it cetera et cetera.

01:54.570 --> 02:01.070
These are all very common elements that you would use when making a web site text input.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.010
This is great if you're making a form.

02:03.060 --> 02:07.410
So you know I could literally just throw a bunch of these on and it has automatic grid lines see what

02:07.410 --> 02:13.020
that is what that does is it allows me to log in and have these line up on the fly because if I didn't

02:13.020 --> 02:20.240
have those I would constantly be off a pixel and visually I might not notice that but so I can make

02:20.240 --> 02:26.430
say a form and here what I would do is I'd use my custom text doesn't look like the right name so I'd

02:26.430 --> 02:35.370
say first name and then I can do is I can use the grid lines See I can match it up again.

02:35.470 --> 02:42.220
Now if I wanted to say modify the text here this dropdown gives me the options now options is pretty

02:42.220 --> 02:49.660
much the way that you modify any element that's on the canvas so I could see a big font and there you

02:49.660 --> 02:50.450
go.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.070
Notice what happened here.

02:52.100 --> 02:56.500
It's going to kick it down to a second line if you want it to keep it on the same line remember that

02:56.500 --> 02:58.630
these are your boundary boxes.

02:58.630 --> 03:01.450
Since this is tanks rolling into the old horizontal expansion.

03:01.450 --> 03:05.620
So if I want to just keep it on all mine I just have to pull it out and it's automatically going to

03:06.340 --> 03:07.590
put it back on the one line.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.790
Then all I could do is grab it wind it back up.

03:09.790 --> 03:10.570
There you go.

03:10.570 --> 03:13.300
So now it's visually aligned.

03:13.420 --> 03:19.300
You can tell that this is something that you type in to see as it has the icon that pops up when you

03:19.300 --> 03:21.600
put your mouse over it.

03:21.600 --> 03:26.170
And now this actually will have some functionality when you go to simulate this but we're going to talk

03:26.170 --> 03:28.510
about interactivity much later in the course.

03:28.510 --> 03:33.190
Right now we're just covering the basics how to use a canvas how to use the editor how to throw things

03:33.190 --> 03:39.220
on the page and put things together very quickly if you wanted to duplicate any element on the page

03:39.220 --> 03:43.500
without having to pull it over again say you typed out a paragraph early on to type it out again.

03:43.580 --> 03:49.860
All you have to do is just copy and paste and then I can would use is drag.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.140
See I have another one.

03:53.150 --> 03:58.200
Other than that you have pretty much a basic editor tools up here in the navigation bar.

03:58.250 --> 03:58.900
These are helpful.

03:58.910 --> 04:05.150
So like zooming in and zooming out so you can kind of see your relationship and space expert gives you

04:05.150 --> 04:07.070
a whole lot of options for how you want to show this.

04:07.070 --> 04:09.080
Off We'll get into that later.

04:09.080 --> 04:09.820
Same with Shell.

04:09.820 --> 04:16.040
We're going to cover a lot of these actual features later to show you how useful they are.

04:16.040 --> 04:20.000
Same thing with simulate one of the things that's great about Paducah.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.370
That other ones don't actually have is that you can do undo your last action if you're on a PC that's

04:25.370 --> 04:26.000
controls.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.440
If you're on a Mac it's commands.

04:27.550 --> 04:35.510
I can do this all day and it literally moves me back to the very beginning of my my wireframe which

04:35.510 --> 04:35.900
is great.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.370
And then I can literally go all the way back.

04:38.540 --> 04:41.630
So it's always going to remember every single thing you did.

04:41.630 --> 04:44.620
And that's one advantage of having this hosted in the cloud.

04:45.720 --> 04:50.610
So I can go all the way back to where we were that's great if you're someone who makes mistakes constantly

04:50.970 --> 04:54.030
like myself do that all the time.

04:54.030 --> 04:59.180
Now stepping back a little bit if you wanted to say modified the size of this page.

04:59.310 --> 05:05.070
Well you can do is you can come up and you can modify the actual test page page itself the way you do

05:05.070 --> 05:10.140
that is just simply by pulling down your options and I could just change the width to whatever I wanted

05:10.140 --> 05:17.640
it to make it a square.

05:17.690 --> 05:21.800
So now we have a really odd kind of square shape.

05:21.860 --> 05:26.240
Not sure what you would use this for but you can make it to whatever you want.

05:26.270 --> 05:30.290
There's a specific resolution that you're building this for I always suggest that you make it in that

05:30.290 --> 05:31.940
resolution.

05:32.010 --> 05:39.200
There are multiple ways of going about making pages and making mockups if you follow later in the course

05:39.210 --> 05:40.880
when I use bosonic as an example.

05:40.910 --> 05:47.060
What I typically do is I use one very large canvas and make multiple screens and then save those as

05:47.060 --> 05:48.220
one big image.

05:48.230 --> 05:53.660
Now with Oko you are definitely not inclined to do that because of the way they've set this up it's

05:53.660 --> 05:59.570
very easy to just create a new page as opposed to just copying pasting as putting it below it and then

05:59.630 --> 06:04.760
making ever understand that you'd have a really big image with all of your web pages on it the way that

06:04.760 --> 06:10.700
you would duplicate this is you literally just right click it or hit the options button and get clone

06:10.700 --> 06:12.200
element.

06:12.220 --> 06:16.590
OK so now I have a test page copy and it's the exact same if you've noticed.

06:16.590 --> 06:23.670
So just to make a difference we can throw in some elements here just to see that they're different and

06:23.670 --> 06:27.290
I can go back you can see test page copy test page.

06:27.460 --> 06:32.400
Remember always label your pages otherwise you'll go crazy.

06:32.410 --> 06:38.290
So yes this is my oath say it's the Coloe of last page.

06:38.590 --> 06:45.780
This is helpful if you are making wire frames of the same things over and over again.

06:45.970 --> 06:49.880
So let's say I wanted to start with a web page.

06:49.900 --> 06:55.420
And now keep in mind the resolution for this is not correct on a web page but I'm just going to illustrate

06:55.450 --> 06:59.630
my point with this weird resolution the way that you would do this.

06:59.770 --> 07:07.510
For instance I could just create a header and let's say put an image up here member your logo is pretty

07:07.510 --> 07:13.580
much always going to be at the top left that's one of the elements that people always use.

07:13.660 --> 07:14.970
I can put that up there.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.390
And let's see.

07:16.830 --> 07:24.280
I put a navigation bar think I could create a navigation bar by say just putting some tabs in a row.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.530
Now guys these are low fidelity wireframe so they're always going to look very ugly.

07:28.540 --> 07:32.370
Any designer or developer will know this is a navigation bar.

07:32.390 --> 07:40.000
If you really want to make them understand what you can do is you can say like add a rectangular space

07:40.000 --> 07:40.920
behind it.

07:40.930 --> 07:45.150
So what I would do is I get a static stencils pull this rectangle in.

07:45.520 --> 07:45.930
OK.

07:45.980 --> 07:49.410
And what I can do is I can see I can create a bar.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.860
It's a little janky but it works.

07:53.870 --> 07:58.510
You know what's going to happen is because the system uses layers when it moves over it's going to cover

07:58.510 --> 07:59.680
up my tabs.

08:00.070 --> 08:00.630
OK.

08:00.940 --> 08:07.840
The way that you fix this is I want to then tell this to go backwards the way I do this is I simply

08:08.080 --> 08:12.020
select the options for this element and then you have the option to say move it back.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.410
You also bring different.

08:13.520 --> 08:18.430
See what this means is that on the canvas that we're working on right now everything stacked basically

08:18.430 --> 08:19.510
on top of each other.

08:19.690 --> 08:24.520
And the system is keeping track of what's on top of what so that when they overlap it knows what to

08:24.520 --> 08:25.220
show.

08:25.390 --> 08:29.470
So what I would do is I'd give it a command to basically tell it hey I want this behind everything else

08:29.470 --> 08:31.970
so I just click that and there you go.

08:31.990 --> 08:33.300
Now you can see the rest of them.

08:33.360 --> 08:39.010
I could shrink it so it makes it look a little bit better or whatever.

08:39.010 --> 08:39.840
There we go.

08:40.090 --> 08:44.120
OK so there's my navigation bar so I could say like I'm

08:46.980 --> 08:50.080
say us

08:54.070 --> 08:57.800
stuff because that's the whole point of making websites right.

08:58.180 --> 08:58.550
OK.

08:58.590 --> 09:02.050
And so I'm a perfectionist.

09:02.320 --> 09:08.580
OK so now what I could do is say I created a page and that's my front first page is a page that everybody

09:08.580 --> 09:13.270
sees and I see my page and then they want to go to about us and I want to create the About Us page.

09:13.350 --> 09:21.480
What I could do is then instead of going and creating a new page I could just clone this one and then

09:21.480 --> 09:26.810
start from scratch and then just basically delete the elements I don't want and then replace it.

09:26.820 --> 09:33.040
So let's say that this was my welcome page so I could just say like you know welke

09:35.860 --> 09:37.920
and so will make that really big.

09:38.230 --> 09:44.920
OK so that's like my welcome page right now if I wanted to then create another sub page where I could

09:44.920 --> 09:46.570
do I could just clone this.

09:46.900 --> 09:51.060
So I go up here member clone element.

09:51.280 --> 09:56.140
So now I have a clone of last page copy and then I can change this to say about us and I'd fill out

09:56.140 --> 09:58.200
the rest of the page.

09:58.330 --> 10:01.510
Right now you change your bounding boxes.

10:02.220 --> 10:05.800
I guess I that if I wanted to go back I would just do that one.

10:05.950 --> 10:12.040
So you remember again remember to label these every time you create a clone Otherwise you get this thing

10:12.040 --> 10:12.480
where you're like.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.940
So it's going to say clone of last page copy.

10:15.030 --> 10:19.170
And if I do that over and over and be like clone of last page copy copy copy copy and I'm just no I

10:19.170 --> 10:20.960
can't remember which one is which.

10:21.610 --> 10:21.960
OK.

10:21.960 --> 10:26.410
And then the last thing I want to show you in this lecture is over here is where are you going to handle

10:26.410 --> 10:27.730
your layers in your interactions.

10:27.730 --> 10:33.010
We're going to cover interactions much later in the course but layers are the way that you could create

10:33.010 --> 10:34.500
things like global layers.

10:34.540 --> 10:41.620
I'm going to cover that specifically in the next lecture but this is where you would say create multiple

10:41.620 --> 10:48.010
layers and then activate them turn them off and create new ones delete them.

10:48.010 --> 10:52.260
And that's just a tool to help you save time as you're making more wire for it.

10:52.390 --> 10:56.220
OK so now you are familiar pretty much with how to get in here.

10:56.220 --> 11:01.900
Log in throwing stuff on the page and the next lecture we're going to cover a little bit more about

11:01.900 --> 11:08.200
how to get specific with specific skills and then later we're going to talk about for instance what

11:08.200 --> 11:12.390
are elements that you always want to start with how to get the creative juices flowing.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.750
Now we're pretty much just acquainted with how this works.

11:15.790 --> 11:20.530
What Broughton's do roughly what you should be able to get in here and start playing with it.

11:20.530 --> 11:25.150
But if you don't want to just jump in and start playing around for the next lectures and we'll start

11:25.150 --> 11:30.850
getting into specific skills that are relevant to creating your web markup and your mobile markup.

11:30.850 --> 11:31.810
All right so in the next lecture.
