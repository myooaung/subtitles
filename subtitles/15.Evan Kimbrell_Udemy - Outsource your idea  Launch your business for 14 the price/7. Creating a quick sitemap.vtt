00:05.850 --> 00:11.990
Of course in this lecture we're going to do something nice and to show you how you can make something

00:12.410 --> 00:14.590
a lot of ways you can do it.

00:14.610 --> 00:18.580
I'm going to show you all the different ways that you kind of choose which one you want to do.

00:18.660 --> 00:23.760
You can do your second half of the beginning and end up with a tool called free floating objects.

00:23.790 --> 00:30.780
We may actually just do it your own little wireframe can this incredibly useful help you understand

00:31.110 --> 00:38.610
is there isn't you know other people want to see your application and not accidentally get something

00:38.610 --> 00:41.260
later down the road and then they surprise.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.070
Well guess what.

00:42.060 --> 00:49.040
You totally forgot to make a page for users with their permission or blogging site.

00:49.140 --> 00:50.340
It's a really helpful tool.

00:50.350 --> 00:54.330
Most of the authors are going to want to look for a site if you're doing something that's small give

00:54.330 --> 00:55.640
you something that's not nearly.

00:56.020 --> 01:01.100
But if you're doing something that has some substantial size that's always helpful.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.080
This is optional.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.980
I think it's helpful.

01:05.220 --> 01:10.830
Right now there are two different ways of doing a sitemap and there's also two different times you can

01:10.830 --> 01:11.510
do them.

01:11.670 --> 01:17.640
You can make a site map up front and do that before you've created all of your pages and you can also

01:17.640 --> 01:24.000
do at the end after you've created your pages you can then go back and create a site map out of the

01:24.000 --> 01:25.710
pages you already have.

01:25.710 --> 01:33.770
Pinocchio makes this quite simple to do and they have the best tool I've seen for creating site maps.

01:34.110 --> 01:40.470
They're called Screen flows and so you can do it really either way you want if you're following the

01:40.470 --> 01:43.470
course when early and you don't want to make a site map right now.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.830
Skip over this lecture go to the next lecture.

01:46.050 --> 01:50.790
And when we get towards the end where you have a little bit more experience creating pages and you created

01:50.790 --> 01:57.270
multiple pages then go watch us lecture and make your sitemap at the end doesn't really matter how you

01:57.270 --> 01:58.290
do it.

01:58.350 --> 02:00.240
My preference is to do it at the beginning.

02:00.330 --> 02:02.310
Helps me organize my thoughts.

02:02.310 --> 02:09.840
I can also do it as I go through the mockup I can add pages as I think of them and that is also it's

02:09.840 --> 02:14.640
easy to do it that way because as you're designing pages you'll realize oh hey I added a button here

02:14.640 --> 02:16.050
this button has to go somewhere.

02:16.110 --> 02:17.830
Here's another page.

02:18.420 --> 02:22.500
But also it's helpful the very beginning because what we can do is we can always go back to our scope

02:22.500 --> 02:28.800
documents and look at what we possibly any of the functions we have and then think about how many pages

02:29.070 --> 02:32.880
we would actually need to fit all of that information into it.

02:32.880 --> 02:38.270
And then if you make a site map up front then you know exactly how many pages you need to create.

02:38.270 --> 02:41.160
You're not sitting there thinking about if you're missing pages.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.170
So regardless of how you do it I'm going to show you how.

02:44.190 --> 02:48.540
So in the previous lecture we just kind of did that all the way around and created some pages that show

02:48.540 --> 02:54.870
you how the editor view works and how you can edit things save them clone them etc..

02:55.020 --> 02:58.350
So now we're going to do is we're going to create a screen flow.

02:59.150 --> 02:59.530
OK.

02:59.540 --> 03:02.370
And so here you'll notice that you don't actually have a canvas.

03:02.580 --> 03:07.380
It's really the way you actually do this is this is your canvas and you're going to drag and drop your

03:07.380 --> 03:08.400
pages over here.

03:08.470 --> 03:09.690
This says welcome.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.190
Remember we didn't label these very well.

03:11.190 --> 03:15.510
So this could be again a problem another reason why we should label we have to do is drag and drop it

03:15.510 --> 03:16.780
on.

03:16.850 --> 03:21.540
I like to always start with my landing page or my welcome screen because everything else flows from

03:21.540 --> 03:26.580
there it makes more sense because then I look at the home screen see what buttons I have see what sections

03:26.580 --> 03:29.840
have already listed out for myself and then go accordingly.

03:30.030 --> 03:35.800
You can resize that if you want to make it huge or smaller or whatever.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.790
Now you'll notice that the elements on the page here are just a preview.

03:39.790 --> 03:44.300
They don't actually drag because the elements we made are absolute not relative.

03:44.320 --> 03:49.320
We put them specifically into some pixel space they're not going to move as we resize.

03:49.420 --> 03:54.110
So then what I do is I just pull in all the other pages.

03:54.270 --> 03:58.260
I kind of just throw them onto a smorgasbord and then figure it out from there.

03:58.270 --> 04:04.300
We didn't make much of a structure but this is kind of this is where you would then kind of figure out

04:04.300 --> 04:05.800
where everything went.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.810
Now it's up to you how you organize it.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.410
This is the traditional method of doing it.

04:09.430 --> 04:16.090
What people would do is vertically is the way that you handle process flows and horizontally is the

04:16.090 --> 04:20.650
way that you would handle kind of a hierarchy of pages.

04:20.650 --> 04:27.910
So for instance if I notice how on the welcome page and if you want to go back to the editor and you

04:28.030 --> 04:30.400
edit this I'd have to do is double click into it.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.080
There we go.

04:31.210 --> 04:36.290
You want to go back you sit back and notice how we have home about us and buy stuff.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.300
OK well this is the home page.

04:39.430 --> 04:44.950
Now we have an About Us page so that is actually on the same tier as our welcome page.

04:44.950 --> 04:45.890
Why is that.

04:46.120 --> 04:52.450
Because it's a separate page itself it's not a sub page of a sub page it's own its own navigation section.

04:52.450 --> 04:56.590
You can access it directly it's on the same level.

04:56.590 --> 05:01.690
Now if I had a page under about us where it said you know I had a link that said company information

05:01.690 --> 05:05.890
and I clicked that from this page that I would create a box down here.

05:06.040 --> 05:10.490
And the way that I create pages is I just hit pages drag and drop it.

05:10.510 --> 05:14.470
So I would connotate this as a sub page we're putting it down here.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.700
We'll just say

05:22.750 --> 05:35.660
company information.

05:35.810 --> 05:38.360
OK we'll go back and you can see that.

05:38.680 --> 05:38.970
OK.

05:38.990 --> 05:44.240
So I put this down below connotates that it's a process flow.

05:44.250 --> 05:50.390
Now if for some reason I instead wanted this to be on the level what I would do is I just pulled up

05:50.390 --> 05:51.050
here.

05:51.110 --> 05:56.170
So if that was the case then logically what I'd have to do is go back to my other pages and then add

05:56.170 --> 05:58.040
at that bar right there.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.170
So I'd have to add another tab that says company information.

06:01.310 --> 06:02.160
It's a little redundant.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.210
Typically company information is going to be under the About Us page.

06:05.670 --> 06:06.070
OK.

06:06.080 --> 06:15.740
So I would say that I'd put this underneath it and then just because I'm very specific about visuals

06:15.770 --> 06:17.320
I put them the same size.

06:17.610 --> 06:17.860
OK.

06:17.870 --> 06:22.000
And then let's pretend like there is a test form that came after the welcome screen.

06:22.040 --> 06:26.170
The other one was buy stuff so we can very easily just create an extra right here.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.670
And then I'd make this my stuff page

06:43.020 --> 06:46.980
I'm putting the text really large so that when I'm in the preview view I know exactly what the page

06:47.010 --> 06:47.550
is.

06:47.580 --> 06:48.430
There we go.

06:48.870 --> 06:49.080
OK.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.090
So that would be my stuff page.

06:51.090 --> 06:55.500
Now you're asking me you might ask yourself why am I doing this why am I just literally going through

06:55.500 --> 07:02.010
sticking to words of text on it and then organizing it it's because I'm creating my sitemap and I am

07:02.070 --> 07:08.010
putting placeholders for all the pages that I anticipate and then the way that I anticipate process

07:08.010 --> 07:08.860
flows working.

07:08.860 --> 07:11.900
I'd then just put them underneath.

07:11.900 --> 07:19.160
OK so now if you wanted to show the relationship between these two besides just as visual organization

07:19.160 --> 07:23.650
we made there are about three different ways you can do it.

07:23.930 --> 07:28.790
What I'm going to obviously focus on is the simplest easiest way of doing this.

07:28.820 --> 07:34.460
We're making a sitemap and a sitemap is something that should be able to be viewed on a PTF or on a

07:34.460 --> 07:35.570
piece of paper.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.310
So that's what's most important.

07:38.330 --> 07:43.880
There are other ways of linking interactions between these boxes and Fiocco helps you do that.

07:43.880 --> 07:50.630
But for our purposes we just want to do a quick easy simple way of just putting arrows to show what

07:50.630 --> 07:52.010
goes to what.

07:52.010 --> 07:57.770
So the way that you do that the way that I prefer doing it is to actually just select the page that

07:57.770 --> 07:59.400
you want to link over.

08:00.190 --> 08:07.280
And what happens is you see these little areas that light up and they're yellow the yellow areas.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.780
What that means is these are called linkable stencils.

08:09.830 --> 08:14.480
Now a stencil is just an element that we use on a canvas page and we talked about that in the last lecture

08:14.780 --> 08:20.420
but all you have to do is quite literally use some precision but grab the button that you're going to

08:20.420 --> 08:23.050
use and show where that leads to.

08:23.180 --> 08:27.600
So all you have to do is remember the about us is the first button.

08:27.650 --> 08:28.380
Is right.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.510
Oh the home is the first one it's checked.

08:31.550 --> 08:38.280
So grab the middle one and the middle one that I just drag over to the about us.

08:38.310 --> 08:43.930
OK so now I have an arrow so anybody looks at that knows that if I click this it goes over here and

08:43.930 --> 08:46.580
so then I can very easily connect the other ones.

08:47.530 --> 08:53.560
Do that over here and then you go what I would do actually in this case is you know just to save us

08:53.560 --> 08:58.600
some time because I just made a quick placeholder here over here I kind of neglected to use the actual

08:58.600 --> 09:00.970
clone technique we learned before.

09:00.980 --> 09:07.540
But what I can do is instead of using a placeholder like that when I can do is

09:11.440 --> 09:17.860
so I can hide the page and then instead what I will do is I'll take this.

09:17.860 --> 09:20.870
I'll use a context menu and I'll clone it.

09:23.910 --> 09:24.730
There you go.

09:24.810 --> 09:26.050
Now I put that over here.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.860
And then I can literally jump in and change the text.

09:32.090 --> 09:37.620
To buy stuff that's a little bit better of a way of doing it.

09:37.660 --> 09:45.520
But then I can grab this over here and draw it over now to show process flows what you can do is see

09:45.520 --> 09:50.980
this is just a test form we made like let's say that that for some reason clicking something on the

09:50.980 --> 09:55.410
home page Ledgett up form what I can do is I could add a button

09:58.700 --> 10:04.610
right here and it would just say submit information.

10:06.070 --> 10:12.750
OK and you need to resize that remember guys this is just for our purposes understand a screen for his

10:12.750 --> 10:15.220
work put that button there.

10:15.480 --> 10:21.720
Now one way that you can link between pages and I don't think this is particularly helpful but you could

10:21.720 --> 10:27.060
do it this way you can click this go to Target or target then click your page and remember we have to

10:27.060 --> 10:31.740
label our pages Otherwise you have no idea what you're clicking and doing it that way.

10:31.740 --> 10:35.700
The only difference is that when you then go to the screen flow you have to select the page in order

10:35.700 --> 10:37.150
to see the connection to other pages.

10:37.150 --> 10:41.650
So I like to make it as visually overt as possible.

10:41.970 --> 10:45.840
I like to make it very obvious because this is something that I get I want to be able to print out on

10:45.840 --> 10:49.040
2-D I don't have to load this in a browser to show what it does.

10:49.110 --> 10:52.020
So that button is now editable.

10:52.030 --> 10:53.600
I go over here and voila.

10:53.850 --> 10:58.110
So now I know that when you're on this page you click this it goes over here and I have a very basic

10:58.110 --> 10:59.160
screen flow.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.170
This is the way that you would connect to your pages.

11:02.430 --> 11:08.250
And if you're actually building out a large sitemap we would have many many many pages you know top

11:08.250 --> 11:14.310
level you might have five or six and then you might dive down on each other one vertically and you'd

11:14.310 --> 11:19.650
actually go through each page and you don't have a lot of times where you have multiple pages splitting.

11:20.160 --> 11:27.970
So to give you an example we could clone this element right here

11:31.700 --> 11:33.830
to clone it twice.

11:36.540 --> 11:42.430
Let's say that for some reason we had a form and it had two options.

11:42.690 --> 11:51.350
So let's say one of them was say one of them was here and you know was here.

11:51.620 --> 11:58.300
So one of them was submit another one was learn more.

11:58.340 --> 12:02.170
Now each one of these will actually lead you to a different page.

12:02.170 --> 12:06.810
And so it's important to then link that in your screen flow or your sitemap.

12:06.850 --> 12:10.630
So you actually know that there's a fork in the road.

12:10.630 --> 12:14.230
Users can code to go do two different ways.

12:14.230 --> 12:19.390
Now don't be lazy again with this like if you make a pop up and the pop up information is going to depend

12:19.390 --> 12:25.210
on what they click to begin with then make sure that you show that in your sitemap.

12:25.330 --> 12:30.520
Again if you get really detailed but you only go half way you're developers and your designers assume

12:30.520 --> 12:31.510
that you are literal.

12:31.600 --> 12:35.410
And then they're going to assume that you made a very bad sitemap and they're going to be missing things

12:36.040 --> 12:38.380
and that's going to be a problem down the road.

12:38.410 --> 12:43.690
So either be as vague as possible or be as specific as possible you obviously want to be as specific

12:43.690 --> 12:44.810
as possible.

12:44.830 --> 12:47.650
That's the entire point of taking the course.

12:47.680 --> 12:54.640
So here what we would do is we pull that over here and pull this one or here and there you go.

12:54.640 --> 12:58.440
So now I can see that there's two buttons a lead me down a different path and I can even go farther

12:58.440 --> 12:59.700
and farther down.

13:00.100 --> 13:00.400
OK.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.930
So in the upcoming lectures are going to talk about how you export these things how you share these

13:04.930 --> 13:06.370
things.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.960
This is the way that you create a site map up front.

13:08.980 --> 13:10.320
These are just placeholders.

13:10.330 --> 13:15.340
But for users who are not familiar with site maps now you know what a site map is this is helpful as

13:15.340 --> 13:21.220
a secondary document to help your developer understand the process flow to help your designer understand

13:21.220 --> 13:24.710
how many pages they have to design and how many unique elements they've designed.

13:24.790 --> 13:29.470
But also it's helpful for you to organize your thoughts and understand what all you have to wireframe

13:29.740 --> 13:34.060
if you don't make a site map is a very good chance that you will forget some pages and then later you'll

13:34.060 --> 13:36.420
be putting the application together and it's incomplete.

13:36.490 --> 13:38.650
Someone's going to notice it and it might be embarrassing.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.050
So all right guys I'll see.
