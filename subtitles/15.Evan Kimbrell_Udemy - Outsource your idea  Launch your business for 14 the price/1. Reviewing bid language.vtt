WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:00.720
All right.

00:00.720 --> 00:07.890
So we're going to take a look inside one of our actual projects that we ran just told you a little bit

00:07.890 --> 00:09.430
about what it did.

00:09.560 --> 00:14.790
But I can show you that we followed pretty much all of the guidelines that we gave you in this course

00:15.540 --> 00:21.270
gave a project description that wasn't overly wordy but it kind of gave you the 10000 foot description

00:22.140 --> 00:27.930
and then it gave things like perks like down here we kind of describe saying you know we have lots of

00:27.930 --> 00:30.420
projects this will be a long term thing.

00:30.420 --> 00:34.980
There's lots of reasons why you should be excited about this and then gave in-depth instructions over

00:34.980 --> 00:41.050
here in this document that we gave a nickname just for purposes of remembering it.

00:41.070 --> 00:47.370
So I want to talk a little bit about how to overview some of the language that you get in your description

00:47.400 --> 00:52.530
your proposals and a lot of times it's hard to read especially if you're not technical or you don't

00:52.530 --> 00:58.910
have a lot of experience looking over proposals specifically on these online platforms.

00:58.920 --> 01:04.890
You'll notice very quickly that there's a lot of themes that happen with people's messages.

01:04.890 --> 01:13.650
This is different then say if you had posted a project on Craigslist or saw or if you directly contacted

01:13.650 --> 01:18.870
a web development firm they would send you something entirely different it wouldn't look like this at

01:18.960 --> 01:19.900
all.

01:19.920 --> 01:24.300
So you'll notice that a lot of these messages have kind of conformed to the constraints of the actual

01:24.300 --> 01:25.740
platform.

01:25.740 --> 01:30.630
We can look it up work and freelancer as well but they're really the same thing.

01:30.630 --> 01:36.420
Elance is easiest to look at because people actually put time into their messages whereas you'll notice

01:36.420 --> 01:41.270
on up work and freelancer they pretty much devolve very quickly.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.000
So if you can sniff out a good proposal.

01:44.010 --> 01:48.430
Elance you can certainly find one in freelancer or upward.

01:48.630 --> 01:55.380
So the first thing you'll notice pretty much immediately is that you'll notice that the country will

01:55.380 --> 01:58.810
always match the way that they speak.

01:58.950 --> 02:04.100
And occasionally you'll find situations where they don't they simply just don't match up.

02:04.110 --> 02:10.440
This one says United States the man's name is Paul Matthews which is extremely American.

02:10.440 --> 02:13.000
It's almost as if you are imitating an American.

02:13.410 --> 02:19.200
But then when you read his English it actually comes off a little bit strange as if it was if it doesn't

02:19.200 --> 02:21.790
really come from a native English speaker.

02:21.990 --> 02:25.470
So that's typically something that you know you should be aware of.

02:25.470 --> 02:34.500
Some times people say things like United States but rather not say whether or not they're the exact

02:34.500 --> 02:37.720
same thing as hiring a Native American.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.960
That's you have to actually look at their proposal and make a better decision about that.

02:41.970 --> 02:43.930
I'll give you an example down here.

02:44.160 --> 02:50.800
We have someone called Sereny him which is definitely not an American name listed as the United States.

02:51.090 --> 02:57.000
And then he writes something down here which is just in one of the worst English you'll ever see.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.640
So you'll notice there's a lot of disconnects.

02:59.640 --> 03:05.430
This is something that's really bad on freelancer and it's really bad on up work a lot a lot of people

03:05.730 --> 03:09.990
will list themselves in a nicer country because they think that's going to allow them to raise their

03:09.990 --> 03:11.510
price.

03:11.910 --> 03:14.300
And if they think that it makes him stick out.

03:14.310 --> 03:19.790
But it's very obvious that that is not actually representative of them and where they're from.

03:19.810 --> 03:20.090
OK.

03:20.100 --> 03:25.530
So try to be aware of that these mismatches a lot of times you can very easily sniff out there's some

03:25.530 --> 03:31.500
kind of a disconnect going on here and use that as a way of discounting some of these proposals.

03:31.530 --> 03:33.630
So in this case we've got 18 proposals.

03:33.630 --> 03:38.490
I'm not surprised because it's this is a low for us because one we didn't invite a lot of people to

03:38.490 --> 03:44.490
it we only invited one group that we'd worked with before but also we are asking to use a service called

03:44.490 --> 03:50.670
Twilley which is something that manages S-M mass and it's just something that not a ton of people know

03:50.670 --> 03:53.580
how to use or have a lot of experience with it's very specific.

03:53.580 --> 03:57.540
So in those cases yeah you would expect to get fewer proposals.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.990
I'd say for a Twilio application 18 is pretty good.

04:00.990 --> 04:05.860
OK so after you have kind of look for immediate mismatches.

04:05.880 --> 04:10.060
And typically if I were doing this I would find this one.

04:10.080 --> 04:14.400
And I would almost immediately hide this person's proposal something is completely off.

04:14.400 --> 04:20.940
You'll notice this thing called Camel backing camel backing is not something you should ever do in your

04:20.940 --> 04:21.990
messages.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.020
It's when you put capitalizations randomly throughout your sentences and then the punctuation and then

04:28.020 --> 04:32.730
lack of capitalization that's usually quite obvious to look for.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.850
You'll notice that pretty much all over the place.

04:34.860 --> 04:39.850
If it's a message coming from India and they're doing Caml backing that's completely normal.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.580
You can see right here.

04:41.580 --> 04:47.010
Details for your Android iPhone taxi driver app to manage drivers.

04:47.010 --> 04:49.230
I don't know why that's capitalized.

04:49.350 --> 04:52.890
That is something that is one cultural thing.

04:52.980 --> 05:00.320
Indians will typically do that but also developers do that because developers have a tendency to Elize

05:01.040 --> 05:06.440
anything that they think would represent like a user or represent a variable because in their language

05:06.500 --> 05:07.620
they're actually programming it.

05:07.640 --> 05:12.120
They have a tendency to capitalise it to show that this is a separate entity.

05:12.170 --> 05:13.700
So when you combine the two.

05:13.720 --> 05:17.790
Yeah you end up getting these really kind of weird style messages.

05:18.050 --> 05:24.410
So after you look for immediate kind of mismatch it the second thing I like to screen over is to look

05:24.410 --> 05:29.540
for whether or not the proposal gets off topic very quickly.

05:29.540 --> 05:36.620
And what a kind of mean by that if they get off topic that means that they didn't read your your actual

05:36.620 --> 05:38.240
description completely.

05:38.240 --> 05:43.400
It means that they ran out of things to say and it means that they're probably copying a lot of information

05:43.580 --> 05:44.880
into their proposal.

05:45.140 --> 05:52.830
Now what does that kind of mean to me when I see a lot of template a lot of repeat of off topic discussion.

05:52.880 --> 05:57.100
Usually that means to me what we call message fatigue.

05:57.380 --> 06:04.280
So if you see message fatigue that just means that they are messaging tons of people and they've gotten

06:04.280 --> 06:09.840
to a point where it's not realistic for them to write a custom thing every single time.

06:09.890 --> 06:15.830
So you get a lot of copy and paste copy and paste and that just means that you know you're not going

06:15.830 --> 06:17.100
to have their full attention.

06:17.120 --> 06:21.860
That means there's there could be a potential problem that they pick up a project while they're working

06:21.860 --> 06:22.640
on yours.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.740
It's just not a professional thing.

06:24.740 --> 06:28.790
So that's something that we try to avoid and I'll give you an example of someone who goes off topic

06:28.790 --> 06:35.910
very quickly these first two up here you'll notice if you read their language this guy stayed Avid Technology

06:35.910 --> 06:39.060
stayed on topic the entire time.

06:39.110 --> 06:40.340
So hi there.

06:40.340 --> 06:45.860
I've seen your requirement for the S based application this is true with S M s talks about his experience

06:45.860 --> 06:51.230
in Twilio says what he programs and or what they program in which is you know this is fine.

06:51.230 --> 06:59.120
It doesn't really matter what you use with Tullio gave an estimate for time this we'll discuss later.

06:59.120 --> 07:03.920
Gave a link to their information and then right here gave an example of other things they've worked

07:03.920 --> 07:06.020
on so they stayed on topic the entire time.

07:06.020 --> 07:07.820
Not a fantastic proposal.

07:07.820 --> 07:13.640
Not a lot of information but at least you can tell that they probably do not have message fatigue.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.630
They're probably not building all over the place here.

07:16.640 --> 07:22.490
OK so here is an example of someone who stays on topic some of the time and off topic some of the time.

07:22.490 --> 07:26.920
So what you can see right here is he introduces himself My name is Paul mathies I'm an expert in Twilley.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.760
That's what's important.

07:28.760 --> 07:33.030
I'm a U.S. his head and with my office in Silicon Valley and have a development center in India.

07:33.470 --> 07:37.390
OK that right there has nothing to do with my project.

07:38.060 --> 07:42.920
And then this I just literally highlight all the information that has nothing to do with my project

07:42.920 --> 07:44.180
whatsoever.

07:44.180 --> 07:46.260
So right there is where he stops.

07:46.300 --> 07:50.660
OK then he actually gets back to the point he says it's about six years of asterisked and trick's box

07:50.660 --> 07:52.610
experience two years of Tulley experience.

07:52.610 --> 07:59.570
Then he gets off topic again and he says you know I'm one of the best people ever here he gets on topic

08:00.230 --> 08:03.230
and he lists out price time.

08:03.410 --> 08:08.950
He lists out one of the requirements was that I was looking for someone who lives locally in this area.

08:09.110 --> 08:10.300
So that's a plus.

08:11.980 --> 08:16.750
Right here he gives an example of a Tullio project which is good so he's topic.

08:16.990 --> 08:23.530
This section looks like he is not on topic but at the very end you notice that it involves phone call

08:23.530 --> 08:24.770
so he is.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.160
The job is completed in two days is completely worthless.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.990
It means nothing to me I don't know how big the project was here.

08:31.990 --> 08:38.560
He listed his sample work but he does a good job of only picking applications that involve s m s.

08:38.770 --> 08:44.230
A lot of people will give you their sample work and they'll paste it in the message and has nothing

08:44.230 --> 08:46.490
to do with it.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.580
There's absolutely nothing to do with whatever you're asking.

08:49.960 --> 08:54.610
So that's typically a bad thing if someone does that but it's good if this guy can honestly conjure

08:54.610 --> 08:57.870
up three to four examples of things he's worked with SML.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.050
That's a great thing.

08:59.110 --> 09:01.240
And then right down here this is where he deviates.

09:01.240 --> 09:09.080
He just copies and pastes some descriptions from testimonials which is fine.

09:09.100 --> 09:12.130
This is typically inappropriate for a message.

09:12.130 --> 09:16.760
You don't want to read all of this in your message unless it's pertinent to your project.

09:16.810 --> 09:20.610
You can put this in your profile information and I can find that they are.

09:20.670 --> 09:23.470
Trust me if I like what you say I'll read your profile.

09:23.470 --> 09:27.820
I don't need to read this and the message just again comes off like you're trying to cram irrelevant

09:27.820 --> 09:29.290
information into your post.
