00:05.680 --> 00:06.990
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

00:07.030 --> 00:11.300
So in this lecture we're going to go over titles in your job description.

00:11.590 --> 00:14.980
What's important in the title what's not important in a title.

00:15.130 --> 00:17.700
What are freelancers and contractors look for.

00:17.710 --> 00:21.150
What are they going to notice and what are things that just fall flat.

00:21.190 --> 00:22.690
Not important at all.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.390
We take a pretty simple approach to it.

00:25.600 --> 00:32.140
But there's a couple additional things that will dramatically increase the amount of project proposals

00:32.140 --> 00:34.520
that you get so see in the screencast.

00:34.630 --> 00:34.890
OK.

00:34.910 --> 00:39.260
And so to demonstrate how titles work how important they are.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.070
Just to show you what an L.A. post page looks like now.

00:43.110 --> 00:46.660
This is pretty much what is going to look like on all the other posting platforms.

00:46.780 --> 00:51.790
It is the first thing you do and it's always going to be limited to usually around 75 characters.

00:51.820 --> 00:56.110
The other ones are a little bit different but it doesn't particularly matter.

00:56.110 --> 00:58.720
Now why is getting a good title important.

00:58.720 --> 01:04.740
While it's not the most important thing in the world but if you get the wrong title what can happen.

01:04.750 --> 01:10.450
A lot of times you can have a false start with your posting if you don't label it correctly you can

01:10.450 --> 01:15.240
get a batch of people who don't understand what you're asking for and then they automatically bid.

01:15.250 --> 01:21.640
Now most of these posting platforms have a problem where people whenever they read a post they're almost

01:21.670 --> 01:27.240
automatically going to bid because they're trying to maximize the efficiency of their time.

01:27.310 --> 01:31.120
So a lot of them post and they bid pretty much everywhere.

01:31.120 --> 01:36.940
So you want to essentially block the people who are not capable of doing your job from ever clicking

01:37.030 --> 01:39.250
on your post at the same time.

01:39.250 --> 01:47.180
Also you want to use positive adjectives and positive descriptors to pull in the correct people.

01:47.410 --> 01:53.290
So titles are not particularly complicated and I not one of those things that I want you to completely

01:53.290 --> 02:00.760
over think but I want to give you some best practices that we use and then I can show you roughly what

02:00.790 --> 02:03.210
other people have done and what they do right.

02:03.220 --> 02:10.360
What they do wrong so I usually like to start off with a sentence of what it is and you could start

02:10.360 --> 02:11.080
with a verb.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.350
You can say need this done.

02:13.570 --> 02:16.140
Build this edit this.

02:16.150 --> 02:17.640
That's perfectly fine.

02:17.650 --> 02:19.480
Does it need to be in perfect grammar.

02:19.510 --> 02:24.970
The people reading it aren't going to have perfect grammar anyway so as an example we could say build

02:25.030 --> 02:28.680
a mobile app.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.950
OK so that's generic so build a mobile application now.

02:31.980 --> 02:37.820
Really mobile app right there that's going to limit how many people are going to see this.

02:37.860 --> 02:40.750
That's kind of the backbone of your posting title.

02:40.800 --> 02:41.370
OK.

02:41.370 --> 02:46.830
But after this this is when we start getting a little bit more specific and we start adding in extra

02:47.160 --> 02:52.290
adjectives and extra features so if I said build a mobile app OK well when someone reads that failing

02:52.350 --> 02:56.250
to make Web sites that don't make mobile apps they're obviously going to skip over it.

02:56.430 --> 02:57.390
That's good.

02:57.390 --> 02:59.670
But we want to get more specific.

02:59.670 --> 03:07.350
So one thing I always suggest doing in your titles is if you have any specific requirements for technology

03:07.500 --> 03:10.380
or skills put it in your title.

03:10.380 --> 03:12.030
Now a lot of people don't do that.

03:12.030 --> 03:19.000
And then they just change the category of work or they load in specific skills later in the job posting.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.200
But I prefer to make it that much more obvious so that someone who's browsing this from the browse page

03:25.440 --> 03:30.620
doesn't see your thing go in and bid when they're missing one of the crucial skills.

03:30.630 --> 03:36.140
So what I would do here is build a mobile application now build a mobile application could be there's

03:36.210 --> 03:41.490
multiple things it could be it's an iOS application is it Android is it Windows Phone.

03:41.610 --> 03:47.330
Is it a hybrid application that you use say like phone gap or something like that.

03:47.340 --> 03:55.080
Is it a web app a lot of people incorrectly label that phone call a mobile application when it really

03:55.080 --> 03:58.000
it's a web application that loads on your phone.

03:58.290 --> 04:03.570
So you have to kind of specify that whether or not it's native or whether it's a web application.

04:03.600 --> 04:08.940
So to get specific I would say I would want to go back and get a little bit more specific so I could

04:08.940 --> 04:16.060
say iOS mobile application and then I can append something like native.

04:16.230 --> 04:20.700
Now for those of you not aware are not familiar with mobile applications native means that it's written

04:20.700 --> 04:23.940
in the native programming language to iOS.

04:23.940 --> 04:26.110
You really don't need to concern yourself with that.

04:26.250 --> 04:31.950
But that is a feature that I would put if I was concerned with making an application for Aiwass that's

04:31.950 --> 04:34.600
not just a glorified web page.

04:34.800 --> 04:42.640
OK so now this is where I would add a little bit more information about what it does or what it's like.

04:42.660 --> 04:47.340
Now a lot of times people are going to make something that's a copycat of something else or it has similar

04:47.340 --> 04:49.660
functionality to something else.

04:49.920 --> 04:55.230
That's important because when you're looking for someone who has who is going to build your application

04:55.260 --> 04:58.480
build your job or to be a long term partner.

04:58.560 --> 05:03.780
You want to make sure that they have worked on something similar to this in the past so if you say it's

05:03.780 --> 05:08.300
like this Web site they can automatically know what functionality is in that.

05:08.340 --> 05:12.720
Like that comparable Web site what that comparable Web site does.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.790
And if they have a good understanding of what it is there's a very good chance they understand how it

05:17.790 --> 05:23.080
works and perhaps they've actually worked on something that has similar functionality.

05:23.100 --> 05:27.990
So if you're building a comparable application I always like to say like this you know something like

05:28.230 --> 05:31.660
a popular application so you could say like Uber.

05:31.790 --> 05:37.950
OK so if I said like Uber anybody who sees build an iOS mobile app like Uber knows what that application

05:37.950 --> 05:38.820
looks like.

05:38.820 --> 05:43.790
Now if they haven't used Uber they're much less likely to actually bid on your project.

05:43.800 --> 05:49.650
That's what we want and always keep in mind it's all about making a title that encourages people who

05:49.650 --> 05:55.010
are good applicants to apply and it discourages bad applicants from applying.

05:55.410 --> 05:59.520
Now if you don't have a comparable for the project that you're posting.

05:59.520 --> 06:07.090
Alternatively you could just describe kind of the theme or the Neech or whatever category it's in.

06:07.140 --> 06:14.650
So I could say and again you really need to care about grammar but I could say build an iOS mobile application.

06:14.820 --> 06:17.040
I could say real estate.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.590
Now why is that important.

06:18.750 --> 06:24.450
It's not really important but it's it's helpful for people to remember this job post as they're scrolling

06:24.450 --> 06:29.710
through lists and lists of projects they might see the word real estate and remember.

06:29.730 --> 06:34.200
Now if I just said built in Iowa mobile application they can very easily forget about it forget to come

06:34.200 --> 06:35.170
back to it.

06:35.190 --> 06:37.430
A lot of these people are going to be bidding.

06:37.500 --> 06:42.600
They read your application and then they save it and come back to it to write their proposal.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.040
Not all of them do that but some of them do actually put some time into this.

06:47.130 --> 06:52.080
So it's helpful to give them some kind of a career more they can remember what it is you know and so

06:52.130 --> 06:53.700
it could be really be anything.

06:53.700 --> 06:58.770
Build a dating iOS app real estate whatever it is that you're doing.

06:58.770 --> 07:00.030
What's the theme.

07:00.180 --> 07:04.770
Now that also is very helpful because a lot of people if I said say build a dating iOS Milwaukee and

07:04.770 --> 07:10.350
you might get some people who come in and say Hey I've worked on other dating Web sites or I've worked

07:10.350 --> 07:14.100
on clones that look like tender or whatever.

07:14.310 --> 07:22.260
And that's a huge leg up that's an advantage we always want to look for contractors who are familiar

07:22.260 --> 07:25.550
with what you're doing and and hopefully familiar with the space.

07:25.650 --> 07:32.250
OK so now that we've built kind of the core of whatever the title is remember you build the core then

07:32.250 --> 07:33.690
you add details.

07:33.690 --> 07:37.690
Now we're going to get to the last thing which is adding perks.

07:37.710 --> 07:43.980
Perks are very important perks are something that catches the contractor's attention something that

07:43.980 --> 07:45.550
brings them in.

07:45.570 --> 07:50.930
It's something that you can use to automatically kind of capture the people that you're looking for.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.170
So say you're building something that's really small.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.330
OK.

07:54.330 --> 08:01.920
It's often very helpful to say small in it if you're building something that should be done very quickly.

08:01.920 --> 08:06.650
It's very easy to say quickly or something short.

08:06.810 --> 08:08.340
Project something like that.

08:08.350 --> 08:14.850
Now what that does is it number one looks are people who are looking for a short project but also incentivize

08:14.850 --> 08:19.000
people to bid because they think oh this is something I can do very quickly.

08:19.020 --> 08:25.680
That's one of the problems in these posting web sites is when you post a big project a lot of people

08:26.280 --> 08:32.370
kind of they're discouraged from posting because they want to do things that have instant gratification

08:32.370 --> 08:33.930
they can get paid for immediately.

08:33.930 --> 08:39.150
But also one of the big concerns of contractors is that they build up their review base and a lot of

08:39.150 --> 08:41.690
them are not happy with the review base they have.

08:41.700 --> 08:47.500
So if they have one review two reviews they're not going to be interested in you know jumping on to

08:47.520 --> 09:00.180
a four month project that for the next four months they're not going to improve their profile anyway.
