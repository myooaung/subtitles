All right now that you've finished the lecture on how to use balsamic I can show you a real life example

00:12.750 --> 00:21.870
of a balsamic wireframe we use to launch a separate sub page for our our main Sprint kicked up com home

00:21.870 --> 00:22.720
page.

00:23.100 --> 00:27.450
So I built this in balsamic and you can see that has a lot of the same features that we just kind of

00:27.450 --> 00:33.090
went over and I can show you this is kind of you know the level of difficulty and the level of detail

00:33.450 --> 00:40.220
that I would expect someone to Bill who's building something on balsamic would would kind of go for.

00:40.940 --> 00:44.860
As you can see this is not particularly detail.

00:44.880 --> 00:52.490
We wanted to make a long landing page something that you could scroll down one of those long long pages.

00:52.860 --> 00:58.090
And we wanted to make sure that we could have one separate logo.

00:58.110 --> 01:02.160
So we kind of threw something together on balsamic This is the idea behind it.

01:02.160 --> 01:09.300
We wanted to do spirit kick developer on demand and this service was service we started about a year

01:09.300 --> 01:16.150
ago helping people staff their companies with contracted labor.

01:16.260 --> 01:21.070
And so basically what I just did is I took a picture of the art Hetter bar at Sprint.

01:21.090 --> 01:28.650
I copied that inserted as an image into balsamic so that you could see our top bar and I changed out

01:28.680 --> 01:33.670
just with X marks and Wolf shapes that I would use as a scratch out.

01:33.780 --> 01:38.850
And then I changed it to what I wanted it to say at the top and then pretty much everything down here

01:38.850 --> 01:41.100
it's all just kind of chicken scratch together.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.300
This is roughly the text that I wanted to put.

01:43.350 --> 01:48.590
This is roughly kind of the idea of icon design that I wanted to put together.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.970
Let's say we design pretty much each section out.

01:52.110 --> 02:00.070
And so as you can see it was super quick and easy put in pretty much every section.

02:00.270 --> 02:07.320
I thought I'd want you noticed that I kind of scratched it together it's very much a loose mock up.

02:07.410 --> 02:12.900
And then I just kind of give you an idea like you know put a picture of a human for a start up and three

02:12.900 --> 02:17.310
humans for a mid-sized company and multiple ones for enterprise and I locked it up with the graphic

02:17.310 --> 02:21.820
designer didn't kind of come up with an image that would match all of that.

02:21.960 --> 02:25.770
And then even like when you were in FNQ I don't need to write out every single piece of text.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.460
I can just put loosely what the format should look like and I'll show you what it ends up looking like

02:29.460 --> 02:30.670
at the end.

02:31.060 --> 02:37.770
So then the page ended up looking like I see that's that custom logo that we got done as the new header.

02:38.370 --> 02:42.150
Is that icon set that I previously talked about.

02:42.450 --> 02:44.970
And everything kind of worked out pretty well.

02:45.150 --> 02:50.390
This entire thing costs us about five hundred dollars.

02:50.510 --> 02:59.250
That includes the programming that includes the design includes even little inserting like little javascript

02:59.610 --> 03:07.220
plug ins that make it such that I can do all things like this and so not too shabby.

03:07.260 --> 03:10.360
You don't really have to break the bank to get things done.
