00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.940
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.250
Let's just do a quick walk through in terms of how to open up our environment once you've startup started

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.690
up the anaconda navigator.

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.080
You will come to this landing page.

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.880
The first thing to do is to change to the environment that you are using for your projects.

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:35.820
Once it is up and running I'M GONNA MAKE USE OF JUPITER THE instead of notebook and file that away and

7
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.950
give it a few seconds for to actually start up.

8
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.240
The reason that I prefer to use Jupiter lab instead of or ahead of notebook.

9
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:54.870
It's because of this additional features that allows me to view what file is the files I have in the

10
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.400
directory.

11
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.290
That's the first thing in the directory structure and as well as what notebook is actually running.

12
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.960
So right now I don't really need this Iris Project.

13
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.280
I'm going to close it off.

14
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.640
But you noticed this do running with it green dot there.

15
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:16.170
So I come to this second tab which tells me that I do have one kernel sessions running so I just click

16
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.150
the shut down to shut it down and come back here and coming back to this directory I can select Boston

17
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:33.240
housing doesn't show the full name because of the real estate issue and then I can control B to hide

18
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.100
that portion it will to show up here as an icon but it won't get in the way of what I am doing.

19
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.820
OK.

20
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.920
So in this example we're going to look at the regression specificly we're going to look at Boston housing

21
00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:03.660
price prediction in terms of the dataset you can come by here in google and type Boston housing dataset.

22
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.820
It is a fairly well known and common that dataset that is used for machine learning to for instructional

23
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.000
purpose.

24
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.280
You can see here that you can read it in medium.

25
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.520
You can actually find it in Cagle and the list actually does goes on a fair bit.

26
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.020
It is also available as a dataset in psychic land as well making use of the Boston Housing.

27
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.030
And that applies is not complicated.

28
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.170
It's very good for instructional pumpers but it is also complex enough to make it an interesting dataset

29
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.780
to make use of it can be really simple and it can be as complicated as you like it to be or complex

30
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.100
as you'd like it to be because of the underlying data behavior of the data and it is not linear.

31
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.570
Some of the columns or the features are fairly complex and it's did you know there's a lot of in there

32
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.780
to to to do like about the dataset itself.

33
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.130
So coming back to the actual dashboard of the Jupiter not book itself.

34
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.650
What we need is number nine spenders.

35
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.790
And we also need SCA Len also of course like Glen.

36
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:20.850
This is a library from Python or within Python itself it's created by the community.

37
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.370
I won't go into the history of it.

38
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.380
You can actually read about psychic land in a bit more detail as is created by Jack and a few other

39
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.980
collaborators.

40
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.810
It's a really easy to use API and fantastic for machine learning.

41
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.650
This is actually part of it.

42
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.440
That makes part of the one of the reasons why Python became such a popular machine learning language

43
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.990
or useful machine language machine learning simply because of how the ease of use with psychics.

44
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.120
So let's just run this and we should expect an error message as you can see on screen.

45
00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.710
Reason being we haven't installed this.

46
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.060
You've proofread the script this portion of the of the error diagnosis.

47
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.490
I want to live this they're here to help those who struggle with this when they get this kind of problem

48
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.140
pops up.

49
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.490
But if you are familiar with Python you're familiar with how to deal with error message then feel free

50
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.990
to skip this portion.

51
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.240
And so here what you can see here is that it says no module name psychic Len.

52
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.930
Hopefully you remember what we talked about in our earlier section that talks about how to deal with

53
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.600
error.

54
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.040
You can.

55
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.940
You'd have to read the error message and the error here basically tells you.

56
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.250
OK.

57
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.670
This is the line that's giving you the problem.

58
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.120
And what was the error.

59
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.050
No module name ASCII Len.

60
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:50.860
So we come back to our Anaconda navigator and you should be able to see this basic screen here.

61
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.200
We then go over to the environment and within the same environment make sure that you have the right

62
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.360
correct environment selected and go to not install and look for ASCII land.

63
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.450
OK it might not be in this spelling of this name.

64
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:16.440
So you have to look up the exact name which is just show Psychic OK so here psychic Deschler.

65
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:24.250
This is actually the exact and precise name of psychic land SCA land is the library name unfortunately

66
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.950
which makes it a little bit tricky when you do want to search for it but nothing that the Googling one

67
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.850
help you or won't solve it for you.

68
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.310
So just apply by clicking the button here and let the installation run it may take again a couple of

69
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.860
minutes.

70
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.670
I'm going to speak this portion of the video.

71
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.020
Welcome back.

72
00:05:51.020 --> 00:06:00.950
Now that this complete installation will come back to our the notebook lab and run this out again and

73
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.820
this time round the error message disappear altogether.

74
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:12.980
And that number count has gone up to two and let's run this and you can see the actual version of the

75
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:22.380
various type of BlackBerry that I'm using and I could learn is zero point two twenty one point three.

76
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.790
Having gotten that portion out of the way the next step then is to actually load the data you can of

77
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:34.960
course load these via the psychic learned data set as the library has a documentation here.

78
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:42.580
What I have done instead is actually stored the data for you in the actual data sub folder.

79
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.590
So if you look at the South folder I've already loaded the data here I've got there from the UCI website

80
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.670
and just really make your life easier.

81
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.380
And you can actually just referred to it right away.

82
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.380
So since I've downloaded it.

83
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.340
SS Yes we.

84
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:06.200
So we're going to just basically read it in using pandas as a CSB and we can look at the first five

85
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:14.570
rows of data as you can see here is that what we have is 14 columns of data and that's basically in

86
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.870
this kind of format.

87
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:22.250
And I've entered a code here to help you to understand what each column means.

88
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:29.780
No although right now I've given you the description there's no heading label or column label.

89
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.670
I have added this the role of code here a line of code here.

90
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.010
And with the name of crim Z and following this order.

91
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:46.120
And again the documentation is from the UCI machine learning repository.

92
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.240
And I just need to rename the columns.

93
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:58.390
And that should actually allow us to have clean up prepared data for our exploratory data analysis.

94
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:04.430
This is a fair bit of preparation work but we'll need to do this so that we know the data that we are

95
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.580
looking in or working with right now.

96
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:17.600
What would be a good exercise for you to do is 60 to read through each and every line or descriptors

97
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:25.250
or description of the actual column label to help you to actually get a sense and a few of what each

98
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:31.850
column signify or what kind of information is it supposed to provide in machine learning we call this

99
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.740
feature feature.

100
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:41.330
It is a form of descriptors or supposed to describe the actual data underlying data itself.

101
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.900
Some of it is useful.

102
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.970
Some of it is not.

103
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.660
But here is all the data that we have for us to work with.

104
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.190
And please do that.

105
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:56.570
And before we go to the next lecture Google around a little bit either read it in Kaggle or some other

106
00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:01.960
blogs or mediums that people have actually written about it and develop some intuitions.

107
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.950
Before we move on to the next portion I'll leave that with you as an exercise.
