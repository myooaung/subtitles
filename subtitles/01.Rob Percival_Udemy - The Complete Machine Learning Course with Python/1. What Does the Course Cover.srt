00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,800
Greetings Welcome to the complete machine learning course with Python.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,230
I'd like to thank you for purchasing this cost.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,670
I'm also so glad that you have just embark on this truly exciting journey.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,160
My name is Anthony Ng and I've been a senior lecturer in Singapore for the past ten years.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,320
My background is financial engineering by trade.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,470
I also hold a double degree an MBA as well as financial engineering plus a degree in I.T. and finance

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,910
to begin with I like to share with you this little secret.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,250
Please get your hands dirty to learn this course properly.

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:46,400
You do need to code along come into this cause with an attitude of curiosity and to explore hunger to

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,520
learn and apply what you've learned here to solve real world problems.

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:57,140
Now I'm sure you know by now in the past decades machine learning has really given us self-driving cars

12
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,740
speech recognition Google Translate effective web search house price predictions Netflix as well as

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,600
Amazon recommendations.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,670
And guess what.

15
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,160
There really only is just the tip of the iceberg of what's possible.

16
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:18,830
And this cause you are going to learn how to be a powerful machine learning model to solve any problems

17
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,040
you will go from a beginner completely novice to extremely high level competency and your instructor

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,840
will build each algorithm with you step by step.

19
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,060
By the time you've finished his course you will have trained machine learning and deep learning algorithm

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:44,390
to do the following classify flowers predict house prices identify hen writings or digits sentiment

21
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:52,430
analysis computer vision identify staff that's most likely to leave prematurely other things such as

22
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:59,150
conduct medical diagnosis such as detecting cancerous cells segment your customers and.

23
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:07,340
And identify those underserved profitable clients and of course much much more for this caused no prior

24
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,160
machine learning experience is required or the data says the source codes are available for download.

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,320
You'll get friendly support and a Q and A area.

26
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,560
I like to equip you with the skill sets to be able to solve business problems.

27
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,190
So let's get started.

28
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,950
Start learning and start applying everything you've learned.

29
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,110
I look forward to seeing you in class.
