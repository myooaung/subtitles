00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.770
Welcome back into session with a look at why now what's changed.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.350
What has actually transpired that led to the renaissance of A.I..

3
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.970
It's gone through two winters and this latest wave led by a few factors.

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.340
Number one is the computational power.

5
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:32.820
Now the main one is GP you the cost of training this neural network has come down so extensively especially

6
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.590
over the last decade decade and a half.

7
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:45.420
That's because of the advent of GPO which allows parallel processing and that really lends itself really

8
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.720
really well to deep learning and the cause of course have come down substantially.

9
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.230
And the next one is data.

10
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.420
Now I'm sure you've heard of Big Data.

11
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.340
The terms of big data big part of it is because of the Internet.

12
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.130
Another part of it is because of the availability of video data and the other third factor is really

13
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.870
is mobile.

14
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.880
Your mobile phone which you actually walk around with on a daily basis that you access your email send

15
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.930
your messages load up your pictures taking pictures you know.

16
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.020
So those are the many things that you interact with.

17
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:35.250
That allows the proliferation and explosion of data and all those data provides the actual data that

18
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.050
neutral network need to become more more accurate.

19
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.520
There are other factors too such as advanced advances in algorithms such as activation functions weight

20
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.570
initialization schemes as well as optimization schemes.

21
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.530
No these will all cover when you come back after you finish this course you will be able to understand

22
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.320
these really well.

23
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.530
And finally of course because of the success of A.I. there are more and more money pouring into this

24
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.490
space.

25
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:17.890
And that's really why we have a renaissance in terms of A.I. and once it start catches on it's a positive

26
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.370
loop because of the amount of money that's invested into it.

27
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.830
There are more use cases.

28
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.170
People get more excited and on goes to look again and again.

29
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.540
All right.

30
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.910
So that's really part of the reason why a really quick snapshot.

31
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.300
If you google around you'll see a lot more reasons and a lot more in-depth explanation of it.

32
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.760
I just want to give you a flavor of this so that you can understand what's changed.

33
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.910
Why is it that suddenly is so popular now.

34
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.200
All right I'll see you in the next video.
