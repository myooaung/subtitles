1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.420
OK.

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.660
Then our last lesson.

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:09.710
I asked you to try at this exercise to create a model to predict the median house price value using

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.370
these four parameters.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.090
All for features.

6
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.070
Well here's the how I would tackle it.

7
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.120
I am using the formula API and this is how I was model.

8
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:34.410
The formula would be equal to y with the approximate shine to crim plaza that implies CHF is plus NOx

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.940
and the as I mention this is the API that will call already imported the SNF earlier star which is the

10
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.370
first model formula dot API and then we would name it as s map rather than typing the full name.

11
00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.560
So the next thing then is to create an instance fitting the data and call it AML ice before and then

12
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.360
print the summary out.

13
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.160
And that's really the outcome of the actual model itself is actually substantially worse than before

14
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.420
twenty nine point five percent.

15
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.790
But nevertheless the purpose of this exercise is not so much for that is to get you familiar with the

16
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:25.040
API call itself so that you understand the actual procedures or how to code and extract the data.

17
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.670
And so that you can actually do some analysis and develop some understanding of the process to create

18
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.680
a machine learning model using a stats model

19
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.050
OK.

20
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.830
The there is one output I'm not too sure if you did actually pay attention to this no warnings here

21
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.750
which is a good sign but there was a warning here.

22
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.720
I don't know if you see this.

23
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.390
Number two the condition number is high one to the power of four tend to tend to the powerful.

24
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.340
And it actually gives you this indication.

25
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.990
This might indicate that there are strong multicolored minority or other numerical problems with the

26
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.370
underlying model that we use multicolored unity basically means that they are two or three features.

27
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.450
Basically we have features that actually are correlated with each other or closely correlated.

28
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.990
That would create a problem.

29
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.010
And basically you will create very unstable unstable estimation of our coefficient and that's not something

30
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.910
that you really want.

31
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.980
So having that warning which is this conditional number here means that we should actually drop in a

32
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.480
little bit the conditional number four this is substantially lower at 3 to 7.

33
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.340
So going back to the documentation that I provided earlier and this one is here this is a test for multicolor

34
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.270
annuity which is the conditional number.

35
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.150
Anything written 30 indicates unstable result.

36
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.910
So that's something that you do want to pay attention to.

37
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.120
So let's scroll down to how we actually deal with this.

38
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.200
You can use the correlation matrix.

39
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.630
It's something that we've seen before.

40
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.260
And what do actually we use this.

41
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.850
This is some way what we can actually use to helped in terms of identifying features that are closely

42
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:32.890
correlated on have multicolor unity problem and what we used to decimal place and create the so-called

43
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.330
correlation matrix.

44
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.770
And of course this is a little bit hard to read.

45
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:46.720
So I'm going to create a mask meaning anything that's actually less than points to X less than point

46
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.270
six or greater than minus point six.

47
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.860
We're going to make it zero.

48
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.590
So that does the math that I'm creating I'm just focused basically going to make them zero leaving the.

49
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.010
Anything that's graded in point six or less than minus point six are forced to study.

50
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:11.020
So we're going to dig into those with credit and point six or less ten minus zero point six.

51
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.980
Okay.

52
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.600
So run that again.

53
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.620
This is hard to read.

54
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:23.110
So I'm gonna create heat map they make it smaller so that we can actually visualize it in one screen

55
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.880
and here it is.

56
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.760
So you notice that they are low zero.

57
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.330
They are not actually zero.

58
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.970
They are those that's between minus point six and positive point six.

59
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.580
So everything in that range is being zero.

60
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.910
OK mate.

61
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.850
Now.

62
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.060
And as you can see here.

63
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:52.000
Whatever numbers left is one or graded in point six or less than minus point six and point six here

64
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.580
minus point six one minus points and five.

65
00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.400
So if we just look one side of this then you notice the index is actually quite closely correlated to

66
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.790
a few things set in is closely related.

67
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.660
I s cream is correlated to a D.

68
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.360
So these are the things that you probably do want to dig in a little bit more to develop further intuition

69
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.450
and understanding as to why it is like that.

70
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.240
There are other ways I'm going to show you another way which is using eigenvalues and what it shows

71
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.920
here is that not that index 8 which is highlighted here with the eigenvalues of zero point zero six

72
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.220
three five.

73
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:41.540
Well because I heavily said these two I just change this.

74
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.230
OK.

75
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.030
So just copy that on a code come back down here.

76
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.060
OK.

77
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.570
So that you can actually see the whole thing changed to for this market OK that's better because it's

78
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.650
near to zero or very small compared to others.

79
00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:02.610
Small value here really mean that there is a present of continuity.

80
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.220
What exactly is the number eight.

81
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.240
So you can see here that's there.

82
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:15.220
And likewise you can see index nine eight to have very high loading when compared against the rest.

83
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.140
So which one are these.

84
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:27.900
So let's begin there induce our I.D. and texts which we already identify here earlier in this text and

85
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.730
our I.D. though seems to be the troublemakers in all of these.

86
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.080
OK.

87
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:41.640
So essentially we can identify using either what I showed you earlier which is the hit MAB using correlation

88
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:51.600
matrix or using again vectors I get from I can vectors you can X picked it up those with small eigenvalues

89
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.980
or using I can vectors large I can vectors.

90
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.220
OK.

91
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.940
So those are the two ways of picking them up.

92
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:06.510
Coming from another angle we want to revisit the feature importance.

93
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:12.990
And as far as the extraction itself we can check for the direction of the coefficient and the.

94
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.360
Also the actual impact of the variable affect that on the model.

95
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.210
So we have these 13.

96
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:29.700
So if I plot these so-called tax and also plot the Nox itself there's something that should actually

97
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.200
stand out.

98
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.240
If you look carefully.

99
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.050
Number one.

100
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.430
When I plot the tanks you can see a range from 200 to 700.

101
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.810
If you look at NOx they range from point four to 1.

102
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:52.050
The scale of these two are really quite large and never suppress the core coefficient itself which is

103
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.180
not an ideal situation.

104
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.840
What we can do is actually standardize that variable.

105
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.130
Okay.

106
00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.800
That's one way to do it.

107
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:06.540
I'm going to quickly show you the outcome of this but not showing you how to do it.

108
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.540
OK.

109
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.740
But I will go through the how to standardize variable in future lesson.

110
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:18.990
For now we're going to use psychic land to Bute the model and we also are going to standardize our variable

111
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.790
so that it is between 0 and 1.

112
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.930
Okay so let's run these codes of sound so just trust me in this.

113
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.440
Okay I'm not going to talk through these because they're just far too much information.

114
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.470
I will go through them one by one with you.

115
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:40.500
But trust me that I will come back to this in the future lesson so that you actually get a better and

116
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.080
deeper appreciation of this.

117
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.580
Right.

118
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:54.810
Having run all that the coefficient of the so-called model comes out to be this.

119
00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:02.440
And one thing you probably won't notice is that the coefficient is a lot more uniform.

120
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.700
Now again it starts from zero point zero two to three point seven.

121
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.520
Not as bad as what we had before in terms of the beta.

122
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.380
Let me just try to go back there in terms of beta.

123
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.380
Let me just go back there.

124
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:25.260
So we look at the beta here it range from what is the smallest zero point zero zero nine three.

125
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.540
Yeah.

126
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:35.190
And all the way to 36 the range is substantially larger and wider than what we have here.

127
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.180
After your events you have actually standardize it.

128
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:39.580
OK.

129
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:48.750
So that's the one thing that I want to highlight Kaye in one of the last method that you can utilized

130
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:55.750
is to use our squares to identify the features that the core key features.

131
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.630
How do you do that.

132
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.270
This compare our square of the models against ICE square of models without a feature.

133
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.600
Okay.

134
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:09.420
When you have a significant change in our square basically does signify the importance of the variable

135
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.880
or the feature that is not present so the compare and contrast is useful.

136
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.140
We're going to do one example here with or without our test 80s.

137
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.970
So let's just run this.

138
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.500
Okay.

139
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:27.000
So when you actually take away our S.A.T. notice that there's a four here.

140
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.090
And what about if we x remove age.

141
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:37.580
Well when you remove age notice that from here to here there's no difference.

142
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.860
But from here to here there's a substantial drop in our stead then.

143
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:50.570
Is it still a significant feature or more significant feature when you compare that with age and likewise

144
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.100
it's pretty clear from what we have done before after the so-called standardized version you can see

145
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:04.320
the Alastair is the most significant of the lot versus age which is a very small part of the actual

146
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.330
model itself.

147
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.960
Well I hope that has been somewhat enlightening.

148
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.390
No there are a lot of information that has been gone through there.

149
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.950
You probably are feeling a little bit overloaded now which is totally understandable.

150
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:28.530
But I hope the step by step process helps you to actually get some grasp of the floor at the very least

151
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.400
and the approach as the second thing that I want to highlight to you.

152
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:43.160
And last but not least do practice I believe this is not there's no substitute to practicing so that

153
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:50.690
you actually have some appreciation of the steps to process and last but not least and I think is probably

154
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:58.490
one of the more important approach to learning machine learning is to actually play a role to play around

155
00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:59.660
with each of the features.

156
00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:07.490
So what I've illustrate to you is taking our step out taking age out try that with each and every one

157
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.030
of those variables and trust me in this.

158
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.690
The more you play with it the more intuition that you will develop and the better that you actually

159
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:18.310
understand how the whole system works.

160
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.190
With that I'm going to stop.

161
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.510
Thank you for watching.

162
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.130
I look forward to seeing in the next lesson.
