00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,320
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,100
So what exactly is a deep learning.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:14,110
Now before we embark into the details of deep learning I want to compare and contrast between the classical

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,690
programming and also machine learning now.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:26,110
Machine learning is a bigger space or a subset and deep learning is a smaller subset of machine learning.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:33,370
So the purpose of the next slide which is this one here is to help you to understand the difference

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:41,980
between what the classical programming versus machine learning is.

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,050
Now classical programming quite often requires a couple of things you need the data.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,970
And on top of it the rules.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,660
These are usually rules written by experts.

11
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,500
You can understand it as if then statements.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,380
So it could be a very very long if then statement.

13
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:10,470
And that's where you actually get the answer being provided to you the user of the system quite often.

14
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,660
These are called expert systems back in the 80s and even in the early 90s.

15
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:23,130
So basically the the idea of classical programming is that the S2 data come in the rules provided by

16
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:30,650
human which is converted into software codes will provide the answer to the user's now.

17
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,330
Machine learning comes from a different paradigm or angle.

18
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:46,170
It requires data just like classical programming but it dates not rules but answers answers can come

19
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,520
in the form of image or labels or Target.

20
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,090
So the answers provided to the machine learning algorithm as well as the data.

21
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:04,470
Now from there the machine learning algorithm learned the patterns and decipher it uncover the patterns

22
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,400
and generate those rules by itself.

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,670
Now this is where the human intervention part is not included.

24
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,290
The actual understanding and learning part is done by the machine learning hence the term machine learning

25
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,570
algorithm and that's the foundational idea and the difference between classical programming and machine

26
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:35,190
learning classical programming needs constant human intervention as the world that it actually deals

27
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:42,810
with evolves new rules need to be written whereby a machine learning because it's supposed more the

28
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:49,650
angle is to generalize once it learned for example the picture of cards it ought to be able to actually

29
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,930
identify cards even though it hasn't seen cards before.

30
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,210
The image of that or the type of this specific cat before a specific breed before it should be able

31
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:07,450
to and ought to be able to pick out that it is a cat and that's really where the exciting part of the

32
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:15,010
machine learning algorithm comes in is that it can and continue to evolve because of the generalization

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,770
that it has learned from previous data.

34
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,620
And the other part of all that's exciting about machine learning is that it can continue to evolve and

35
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,120
change and continue to learn as new data come in.

36
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,210
Of course you can have it learning all the time or learning on once a day learning on a monthly basis

37
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,830
so basic that those are the flexibility in terms of the production or goal life system by classical

38
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,550
programming.

39
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,510
It's not the same.

40
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,210
You will not be able to do that.

41
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,490
I just won't allow you to actually while constantly change that part requires the human intervention

42
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:59,730
to come in so there's the three key difference between classical programming and machine learning.

43
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,270
Now with that I'm going to stop this lesson in the next lesson.

44
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,850
We're going to go into the how does machine actually learn and we're going to talk about this concept

45
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,250
called Learning representation from data.

46
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,500
With that I'm going to stop here.

47
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,970
Thank you once again for watching.
