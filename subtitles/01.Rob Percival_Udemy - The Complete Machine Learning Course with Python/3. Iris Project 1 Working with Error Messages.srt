00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,780
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:10,330
In this lesson we're going to go in to the so-called machine learning per say but before we go into

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,780
that in depth we're going to start with again a little bit more of the familiarization of the Python

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,180
environment the drill bit and notebook really.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,230
And I'm trying to get you to be comfortable with the environment.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,430
We're gonna start with a project called Iris Project.

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:34,630
But before we started to the machine learning drawing into it I just want to actually explain to you

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:43,030
couple of libraries that we do that use of quite extensively as well as some of the data analysis that

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:49,810
you need to do before going in to full on into the machine learning modelling itself.

10
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:57,110
So let's just select this project Iris Project and get started of the type of this as Iris Project.

11
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,400
We're going to start with simple data exploration and analysis.

12
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:10,090
Couple of things that we're doing and also the school library that we make use of num pi is the first

13
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:16,090
one followed by panthers and by seaborne num pi is the numerical Python.

14
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:24,760
If I come here and say I'm pi there is actually a Web site dedicated to num pi and it shows you how

15
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,310
to make use of API what it is and how to utilize it fully.

16
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,240
So that's really the point.

17
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,240
So the documentation is very extensive.

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,740
It's really well supported it is mature.

19
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:44,800
It is a very mature library so highly encourage you to actually make use of it and become familiar with

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,850
it is really critical when it comes to bit data science data analysis analytics or even machine learning.

21
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,690
The second one is pandas.

22
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,840
Pandas.

23
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:00,670
We just put it up pandas lock the animal itself pandas.

24
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:08,590
It's really instrumental in propelling Python to become the forefront of data analysis.

25
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,320
So the it is an open source that is free for you to make use of.

26
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,660
And again this is a really well supported documentation is great.

27
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,740
And you can actually make use of it right now the version is to zero point to five it is due in the

28
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:30,180
beta stage not quite completely blow it up yet but this lot of functionalities that is highly useful

29
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,810
again this is good for performing analysis on tabular structured data.

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:44,460
So that's the python data Dennis's library and see Bowen is the third library that we can make use of.

31
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,230
And let me just put it up Seabourn is short for statistical data visualization because you can see very

32
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,980
quickly here it renders really beautiful chart and that's the reason why we are making use of it.

33
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,400
It's just really handy for this purpose rather than having to actually code it out.

34
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:12,390
The last library is the Met plot lit with social visualization library Seabourn is a high level library

35
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,970
which actually made use of met lib Maxwell.

36
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,900
It's been around for quite some time but it's useful it is highly flexible and extremely powerful.

37
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,360
The only problem with that is when ever you have anything that's highly useful or highly functional

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,410
and highly customization of all the low customization function day it gets a bit complicated to learn.

39
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,860
So let me just open this up plot lib so visualizations for plot as you can see this is under version

40
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:50,240
three point one point one is already mature is no longer a beta is for long for you two to be able to

41
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,810
use and c bond is two zero point nine OK.

42
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,710
So looking at this with the first few things that we're doing here is that we are importing pi and we

43
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:12,330
call it and the OK rather than typing num painfully we used the notation short Shorten notation Cor

44
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:21,210
MP so that is actually simplify it substantially and this is the custom notation panders is denotes

45
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:32,130
as PDC bonus s and s then we implement plot lib the PI plot the sub library S P L T and there's a few

46
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:39,010
of codes here just setting the actual default and plotting the main problem in line so that we can actually

47
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:49,480
see it within the the notebook itself as before we click play to run oneself OK whoops we have one problem

48
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,900
Mark this is part of the plan to show you how to actually deal with these things as and when it comes

49
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,100
up.

50
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:04,990
So what it says is this or the error is meant to be informative to a large extent if you get stuck you

51
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:12,220
can either google it to find out how to solve this problem or if you can understand English or what

52
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:18,170
the error message is trying to inform you then you probably can actually solve yourself as well right.

53
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:25,700
It says here module not found error traced back OK the transfer basically tells you which line of code

54
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,740
sixty is giving you the trouble so line one say is important umpire as a piece of basically it seems

55
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,780
that we don't have a more June and none pi now I'm gonna show you two ways to solve this I'm going to

56
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:46,420
copy this single cell come to Google and search right well I didn't really copy that I solved images

57
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,290
copy

58
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,740
to see that student the work I'm gonna have to move to the next.

59
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,050
OK.

60
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,920
There we go.

61
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,640
Control C import error.

62
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,300
No module name num pi.

63
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:08,930
So you can see quite often for open source library like mature library like Python pandas and its values

64
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,940
library you'll have people posting questions and steak on the floor.

65
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,590
And this is where you can find answers to this.

66
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,400
Basically no you follow.

67
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,640
This is probably super basic but I'm still learning things.

68
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,290
Okay.

69
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,920
Same here.

70
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,330
Check if there is a directory.

71
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,100
Blah blah.

72
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,380
And the next one is to give a you must download it install a new version.

73
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,730
None quite so very quickly just by reading this is already informing you that you need to install it.

74
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,820
If you don't have you need to install it.

75
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,100
You can either use this or this to install it.

76
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,270
Okay great.

77
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,560
All right.

78
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:49,530
So we'd roughly get an idea that okay we need to install this.

79
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,050
Okay but wait a second.

80
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,540
These answer were given quite a while back.

81
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,670
This is 2011.

82
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,180
This is 2017 2016.

83
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,680
So is there a newer answer.

84
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,200
Well did you answer is probably exactly the same.

85
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,580
OK.

86
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:10,880
There are some conditions to suddenly realize oh my goodness they are like it all for the same one question.

87
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,430
There are so many solutions to it and you have to get used to this.

88
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,020
This is actually a common phenomenon when you're actually dealing with open source library you need

89
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,590
to actually quickly sift through it.

90
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,940
Don't get all bombard.

91
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:31,490
I know you were in the beginning but as you do more and more you come to the realization that this is

92
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:38,990
some of the barriers that you have to get through or get passed to actually be comfortable with using

93
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,410
this open source library that is free up the road.

94
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,650
It does come at a cost.

95
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,930
OK so we're stuck here.

96
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,940
So what do we do.

97
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,850
That's the first way to do it is just to illustrate.

98
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,910
You stack overflow if you don't have any way of solving that problem.

99
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,660
Then follow some of the suggestions by the community.

100
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,510
Now those are all provided by the community.

101
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,060
Right.

102
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,060
Let me just switch back to Anaconda navigator.

103
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:13,090
If you do recall previously I did mention that you can actually tackle this and install it yourself.

104
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:20,320
So I'm going to go over the environment and go but to not install and search for non pi.

105
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,030
OK here we go.

106
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,100
I can't find none pi here.

107
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:34,860
So what I need to do is select Nan pi and then click apply and this is actually telling you install

108
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,790
package.

109
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,310
All right we'll go through this.

110
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:45,840
Blue Bar solving and all this falling package will be modified so it's doing that exercise of locating

111
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,810
it and downloading it and no one's actually asking you for confirmation to proceed to install.

112
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,980
So I'm gonna just click apply and now it's installing.

113
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:58,510
Okay.

114
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,910
As you can see is actually installing empire.

115
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,590
Let that run for a while

116
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,250
OK.

117
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,490
Well so far looks like it's OK and none pi is no longer showing as not in store.

118
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,680
If I switch over the install it is here OK.

119
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,710
It is already in store.

120
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,470
It's no price.

121
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,300
Let's go back to this.

122
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:28,240
OK so let's run this cell again one more time to see if we do encounter the same problem.

123
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,980
All right.

124
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:31,860
OK.

125
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,300
This time round is drawing out a different error message.

126
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,290
It seems like well this is one of those.

127
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,320
No news is good news.

128
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,410
It didn't throw out the fact that can't find no pi.

129
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,480
So basically that means at number pi has already been installed.

130
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,370
So that's why that line of code runs safely without any issue.

131
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,260
So that's really the lesson I want to actually cover today I know that for this portion I know that

132
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,690
this is quite a long lesson already.

133
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:08,420
To actually illustrate to you how to actually deal with errors and how to install this is a step by

134
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:14,450
step process I hope that you build me this ideally at some point you will be able to go through this

135
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,920
very quickly.

136
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,450
For now I'm going to leave you I'm going to install pandas seaborne met plot live the background and

137
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,260
you come back.

138
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,530
We should have run these cells without any issues at all.

139
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:33,710
I'll leave that to you as an exercise to actually install pandas Seabourn and Matt Pollard and I'll

140
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,930
see you next time.

141
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,430
In the next lesson.

142
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,220
Thank you for watching

143
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,900
installing pandas.

144
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,860
So right now we just come to not installed under the Environment and type pandas.

145
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,640
Okay.

146
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,390
And you can see here pandas.

147
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,600
That's really what we actually want to its store and our.

148
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,610
That also know that it's already dead.

149
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,610
So if I type pandas again you can see that it's been selected.

150
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,540
What else I want to install Seabourn.

151
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,030
All right.

152
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,140
Select that and then mint plot lib.

153
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,170
It's the third one.

154
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,290
All right.

155
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:22,330
So I have selected three soldiers apply this kind of search for pandas seaborne as far as I've met.

156
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:28,110
These are the three main ones that I wanted to install in one go rather than doing it three times.

157
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:36,420
OK so we can see that map lip Henderson seaborne soldiers apply this and let it install these

158
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,030
all right.

159
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:48,450
The installation is done so let's commit to install no problems there.

160
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:55,370
All right let's run this one more time and see if there's any errors being thrown up.

161
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,900
Let's play this

162
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:01,750
this time.

163
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,710
Oh good.

164
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,710
Finish running without any error being thrown out.

165
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,780
So we are good to go.

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,980
So let's have a look at a couple of things here.

167
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:15,880
I'm printing the actual version so that you can actually see which version of Python abusing which version

168
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,560
of numbers I am using pandas as far as the seaborne.

169
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:19,790
All right.

170
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,320
So as you can see here these are all the versions are being printed out.

171
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,060
OK.

172
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,480
Right.
