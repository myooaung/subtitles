00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:08.710
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:16.090
In this lesson what I will do is actually just to demonstrate to you how to create a new environment.

3
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.360
The reason I want to create the environment is to make sure that whatever that we create in our applications

4
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.080
for the purpose of in our case machine learning development we want to be have it self-contained or

5
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:39.430
the applications that we make use of it's not tarnished or being confused by other applications installation.

6
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.530
So in this case we're going to create a brand new environment.

7
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.040
So let me come to this screen here.

8
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.910
So this is the lending screen.

9
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.660
As soon as you start the navigator you come to this screen here.

10
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.380
And usually once you have a few environments you're waiting for you to switch.

11
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.230
Environment is just from this dropdown.

12
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.480
Notice that I have three environments here.

13
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.330
I'm not going to make use of any of these.

14
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.190
I'm going to create a brand new one in order to create a brand new environment.

15
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.070
What we do is that we come to the second tab here and just click on it.

16
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.830
Notice that it's highlighted in green in order to create a new environment.

17
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.190
We make use of this button down here called Create.

18
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.010
Notice that once you toggle your mouse over a mouse over the it's lit up in green.

19
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.760
So we'll click Create and this new environment.

20
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.130
I'm just going to code in Python something meaningful for myself so that I can recall what it is.

21
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.190
You can actually name it something that is relevant to you that you can remember for the purpose of

22
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.010
your project.

23
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.980
So the next thing is to go and select the actual package.

24
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.500
In our case we're going to make use of the latest Python Python three point seven.

25
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.950
Actually three points already out but for the purpose of this trip point seven is sufficient.

26
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.690
And the other thing to take note of is the location where this environment is being created.

27
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.170
And once you've actually taken all of all of that all you have to do is just click Create and usually

28
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.910
this process takes somewhere between three to five minutes to complete.

29
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.230
It's not too long if you want to feel free to go and freshen up get a drink or grab a cup of coffee

30
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.460
or something that or beverage that works for you.

31
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.280
Once that is done the progress bar will no longer show as it was installing you would have noticed the

32
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:44.020
progress bar was actually updating and what you have here is that this portion tells you the actual

33
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.440
environment that you are working on and this portion here tells you a couple things by clicking on this

34
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.970
dropdown.

35
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.110
It shows you the library that it's been installed.

36
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.930
What is in store what is not in store.

37
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.930
So do these other things that you can actually select.

38
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.680
I'm going to leave it to you to play around with that as and when we do need to for some of the library

39
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.070
that we need to make use of for the purpose of our lesson.

40
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.300
I'll show you how to install those once the environment is being created we come to the come back to

41
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.810
the home.

42
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.660
And this is not do take not the environment that we've selected now others but in our case we do make

43
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.660
use of this environment I've created recently.

44
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.430
And the next part is that I'm going to make use of Jupiter lab and maybe notebook as well to install

45
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.170
these too.

46
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.990
I can install within environments but in this case I'm going to install it here just using just clicking

47
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.110
on this install button.

48
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.640
Don't worry about the the the the core gooey little bit funny.

49
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.590
I'm not too sure why it's always been like that for Anaconda but doesn't actually do anything.

50
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.300
There's just not no damages here is just looks a little bit untidy unfortunately.

51
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.450
But once it's finished the store doesn't exit the impact on the overall in terms of the actual running

52
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.160
of the application itself.

53
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.310
So that's pretty much it.

54
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.590
Once they've installed there will be a blue box with the word launch and as your mouse over the whole

55
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:30.270
box is changed to the cut into the kind of blue so this portion here what we've to cover in terms of

56
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.900
this lesson is two things One is how to select the environment how to create the environment using the

57
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.670
second tap here and once basically click on Create and put in the name.

58
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.810
Select the python version and click the create button and after that I showed you how to install a at

59
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.030
the lab as well as notebook.

60
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.190
That's pretty much all that I want to cover.

61
00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.240
It is the shot less than just to actually show you how to HD get up and running really quickly for the

62
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.050
purpose of of learning and making use of any content from here.

63
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.950
So for that to stop right here.

64
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.480
Thank you once again for watching.
