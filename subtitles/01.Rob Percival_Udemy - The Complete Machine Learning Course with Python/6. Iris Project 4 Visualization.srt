1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,850
Now I just want to move on to cover visualization as well.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,930
Okay.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,760
The this part is a little bit more on the complex side if you're not familiar with it but just to bear

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,630
with me I just want to illustrate to you how you can actually very quickly conduct very beautiful plots

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:30,100
using seaborne for the purpose of analysis and quite often the low of these codes can be recycled.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,220
Right.

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,210
Remember that I reassessed our data set a couple of Paramount is that we can provide.

8
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,230
Excuse me.

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,350
There are a couple parameters that we can provide.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,410
So let's run this cell.

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,100
This is extreme performance pay plot.

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:48,780
Okay.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,350
Throw it away.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,460
I'm getting an error.

15
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:50,770
Okay.

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,250
Use a warning the size parameter has been renamed to height.

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,220
Please update your code.

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,610
OK.

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:08,060
So that gives me the information and OK to replace that run that again and

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,340
and wait for that cell to finish running we no longer get an error message.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,950
And we get this beautiful char All right.

22
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,210
It kindly also provides us with comes some color coding.

23
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,250
Blue is the toes.

24
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,770
This is orange color and green is Virginia Code.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,230
OK.

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,220
So very quickly you can see that this is in the form of a pair plot.

27
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,520
Let me see if I can actually minimize this.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:49,730
So you can see the whole lot OK not very ideal because it's a bit on the small side but there are labels.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,630
The good thing is that you have your own notebook for you to do in further.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,020
So I'm going to do in a little bit.

31
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,310
Now this is 100 percent.

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,700
This is several length plotting against several length.

33
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,780
So the diagonal is 60.

34
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,610
Plotting against itself when you are plotting against yourself.

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,890
What you see is actually the distribution.

36
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:23,940
This is the simple length distribution for stores are you can see this it also has the shortest simple

37
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,490
length the receipt color and Virginia Code.

38
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:36,250
These two is almost you can't distinguish them in terms of their dispersion or those separate for mistletoe

39
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,820
Tulsa you can come to the with you're barely perceptible difference there although you can see it's

40
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,600
also is a bit slightly on the fat side.

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,690
Now these are distribution.

42
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,880
OK.

43
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,270
What is distribution.

44
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:55,810
Again these are better built upon statistical understanding and foundation for machine learning.

45
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:05,010
You do need to actually refresh all of these basic principle and concepts in statistics.

46
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:12,420
Basically the this distribution plot is kind of like plotting it has diagram of all the possible data

47
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:21,250
that within the so-called variable itself and in our case if you look at pedal length you can see it

48
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,930
said Toys R is much much shorter in terms of distribution compared to the other two.

49
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,060
Delta is almost you can't tell.

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:42,040
They're almost basically a lot of overlap but for petal length of the torso you can see that is definitely

51
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,310
shorter than the other two.

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,900
Likewise with the all with as well.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,850
So that's what the column or the diagonal actually tells you.

54
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:59,680
Now if I plot simple with against simple length This is the information that they have.

55
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,510
It's a little bit hard to interpret that's for sure.

56
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:12,350
If I plot the largest say a pedal length against pedal with I can see that the toes out zone and zone

57
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,830
here there's some mixture.

58
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,170
I mean just blow in.

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,820
There's a mixture of the other two species here.

60
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,090
There's actually intermix here which is understandable.

61
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,240
So this is a two dimensional pot plot.

62
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,570
This is a single dimensional plot.

63
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,000
So with this I'm actually plotting the pedal length pedal with here and of course that gives me a little

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,040
bit more information as well.

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,630
In terms of how to distinguish them this is really a very quick visualization to help you to actually

66
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:52,230
get a preliminarily preliminary understanding of the actual underlying data distribution so that later

67
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,310
on when you do machine learning it gives you some foundations for now.

68
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,280
That's sufficient for what we actually want to do.

69
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,160
So continue on.

70
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:09,120
We can actually plot histogram as well so let's just run this and this is the histogram of the iris

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,340
data for all four of the numerical data.

72
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,140
So this is actually plotting.

73
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:24,300
You can see the pattern link with several length and with but this is actually combining all three species

74
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:31,770
together so you can't really tell which is which is just or the data is being plot right.

75
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:40,030
So let's the next one is actually plotting the spiral in plot so we have one two three four while in

76
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:47,650
plot plotting the actual sample length with simple pedal length with this well and looking at these

77
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,680
it will inform you very similar to these pair plot here except this slightly different in the form of

78
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,060
file and plot.

79
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:02,310
You can see that the parallel with for said Tulsa and the pedal length is definitely much shorter than

80
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,130
the other two.

81
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:16,340
If you drill into each of these the height dot that white dot there is to mean and then you have the

82
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:23,900
25th percentile the seventy fifth percentile that's the max test and then.

83
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,440
And the actual distribution itself.

84
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,350
There are a lot of information contained within the Bartlett plot.

85
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,620
So it pays to actually get comfortable with it as well.

86
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,320
Next one is box plot.

87
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,960
This is just really a quick illustration of the different types of plot that you can actually do with

88
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,680
the C bond.

89
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,340
So this is actually box plot.

90
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,140
Box box plot basically have looks kind of similar.

91
00:06:53,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Or rather they actually display similar information to the violent plot.

92
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:06,840
So if I dig in a little bit and take this for example the Green Line is the mean.

93
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,680
Okay.

94
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,480
This bigger box here.

95
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:16,500
This is a lower quintile upper quintile lower and upper is the 25th in 70 percent of the solar blah.

96
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,280
Here tells you the minimum and maximum.

97
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:26,400
And this is for one of the species which is Virginia provided here.

98
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,090
So again box block this is group by species so these are three different species here so that hopefully

99
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,760
provide give or provide you with some useful information to actually judge.

100
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,210
You can see that this 2 plots is actually sharing and favorable for them are actually sharing the same

101
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,050
y axis.

102
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:53,400
The 0 2 8 and you can see that this is actually squashed way by this is disputed out.

103
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,560
This is more squashed.

104
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,710
This is actually a little bit more widely distributed.

105
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,720
So clearly the pattern with is actually much much shorter as you read these chart.

106
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,860
Just be mindful that they are not quite in the same model or the violent plot you can see the step or

107
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,370
length here and in pedal length for this arrow length is on top followed by the simple length so that

108
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,860
they are in slightly different order so just be mindful of that right.

109
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:29,260
The next one that I want to show you is the scatter plot and also matrix similar information.

110
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,300
Probably not as useful as the pair plot.

111
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,750
It does have its own place to display different information.

112
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:43,310
Personally I prefer the purple partially because it's color coded of course to provide this species

113
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,590
to to allow the hue to be generated as well.

114
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:58,770
And finally just as the purple again but slightly different in that I want the diagonal to be KDE plot

115
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,060
which happens to be the same as before.

116
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,890
So that kind of defeat the purpose of where you can actually change a different kind of plot this file

117
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,570
to look up the actual API provided by Seabourn itself.

118
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,900
So that's pretty much what I wanted to cover in this lesson and a very quick look fairly.

119
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,200
Not really in depth fashion.

120
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:29,340
I'm mindful of that but just the purpose of this is not so much to teach you a visualization as the

121
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,640
purpose of it is much more to illustrate to you what the some of the possibilities that can be done

122
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,630
using the bond you can see here that you can actually plot really really beautiful which art which is

123
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:50,460
substantially harder to perform if you're using Excel so you can perform plot using providing a couple

124
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,670
parameters.

125
00:09:52,710 --> 00:10:01,740
Likewise you can see you do perform histogram while in plot box plot scatter as well as to get a matrix

126
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,160
plot.

127
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,370
And finally I would come back to PayPal again.

128
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,740
So that's really a fairly quick will win tool on what you can do with C.

129
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,790
I hope you found a useful and thank you once again for watching.
