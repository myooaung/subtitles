00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
Welcome to the first lesson of Elementor,

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:07.920
and let us begin the journey of creating awesome webpages and

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.245
pixel-perfect website without any coding using Elementor,

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:16.515
we will start with setting up the element or

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.980
4 first US and let us see some common settings.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.040
The first thing you have to do with Elementor is to click

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.010
on the Elementor settings from here and make sure you

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.590
uncheck that disabled default alerts and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.220
phones to enable the colorant phone settings using Elementor.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.684
Elementor is complete in itself to manage multiple settings.

00:00:37.684 --> 00:00:41.330
And so we do not want to use the Theme Colors index Phi.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.525
We are enabling the element or default settings.

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:45.530
Here.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.410
We will be setting up the global values for colors, typography and spacing.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.240
And that will be applicable for all the elements and pages on the website.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.975
It means we will be setting up the branding guide colors.

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:02.750
I'm folds here in Elementor to make

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.625
the website development process easy and consistent as part of our design.

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:10.535
Now, in order to edit the webpage,

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:15.125
we will click on edit and come to the Settings option again.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:18.755
Here, click on Edit with Elementor.

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:23.900
You will be redirected to this editing screen and the system main interface that

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.300
we have to understand in order to create an awesome website.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.290
So this is the editing interface for Elementor,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.580
and I must say it is very easy and user-friendly.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.670
You have all the editing options here on the left

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.745
paid and the editing canvas on the right.

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:46.295
There is a button to hide the editing pane,

00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:48.875
and this opens the preview page.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:55.085
The preview mode, you will not be able to edit the web page as you can only preview it.

00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:57.485
In order to get back to the editing pane.

00:01:57.485 --> 00:01:58.925
Click on this arrow again,

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:01.865
and you will get the editing options back.

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:06.320
Let us start the setup with the options available on the top.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.720
By clicking on the hamburger icon,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.090
you will get options for Site Settings,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.405
team builder, and manage user preferences.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:16.340
We will see them one by one.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.100
Let us click on Site Settings first.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.400
Here, you have to mention the colors that you have finalized in the branding guide.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.050
Click on the primary color here and type the hex code of your color.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.150
This is now saved in the color palette.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.510
You can also rename the category if required.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.500
In the same way, update the secondary text and accent

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.180
color with the brand colors that we have finalized in the branding guide.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.925
Even if you wish to add more colors to the palette,

00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:50.050
you can add them,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.080
renamed them, and also you can delete them.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.205
And if you want to remove a color or clear the color,

00:02:57.205 --> 00:02:58.975
click on this clear option here,

00:02:58.975 --> 00:03:01.540
it will revert back to empty.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.180
Grading. The colored valid is the first and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.945
the most important step of using eliminate or because it saves

00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:14.370
a lot of time by choosing the default colors with just a single click.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.335
Now go back to the previous menu by clicking here.

00:03:18.335 --> 00:03:21.454
Next is to set up the global phones.

00:03:21.454 --> 00:03:25.445
Here, you're going to assign the default typography settings for

00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:29.405
all the different types of phones like family heading, secondary heading,

00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:31.655
XT and XT and phones,

00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:38.165
assigning the global phone settings saves the style in the font-style palette here.

00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:43.010
And you will be able to easily assign this style with a single click.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.585
Clicking on the pencil icon will open the topography settings.

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:50.600
First option is to select the phone family.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.260
You will get Google phones to select from this drop-down.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.130
Make a selection of the Ford family as per the branding guide.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.024
Next option is to select the phone size.

00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:04.865
You can either scroll that wheel manually or simply enter the value.

00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:06.665
There are four units of measurement,

00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:08.840
but we will go with pixels.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.140
There is another thing to notice here.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.215
If I delete the value in phone size that it is restored to the default value.

00:04:18.215 --> 00:04:23.030
You must be wondering that if there is no value in the box, it needs it a 0,

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.005
but it is not like that in element or it will be 0 only if you mentioned 0 here,

00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:32.165
or else if you keep it empty,

00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:34.265
it will be the default value.

00:04:34.265 --> 00:04:36.095
This concept in mind,

00:04:36.095 --> 00:04:38.885
because it is going to help you a lot in the course.

00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:41.735
Our head next is the weight.

00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:45.485
This will make your text look light or bold.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:48.710
Then you can try that transform settings to make the

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.580
text uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.005
Next, you can make your text in italics from the style option.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:01.925
In decoration, you can insert headlines and what lines to the texts and

00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:06.995
even strikethrough lines that we can also adjust the line height.

00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:10.265
And let us be saying for the textContent,

00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:13.520
pay attention to the units of measurement and we have to

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.860
use the pixels unit for every measurement.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.540
I want to ask you one thing here.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.740
Do you notice this little screen icon after some settings?

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.800
Well, this icon represents that you can make

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.600
custom adjustment in this setting option for different devices.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.655
Like if you wish to assign a different value of phone size for mobile phone,

00:05:36.655 --> 00:05:39.474
you can click on this icon, select Mobile,

00:05:39.474 --> 00:05:42.865
and assign the different value that will be

00:05:42.865 --> 00:05:47.965
specifically for the mobile device and the same you can do for a tablet.

00:05:47.965 --> 00:05:51.700
Here, the website design helps you a lot because we had

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.180
already finalized with the phone size for every type

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.630
of device and we don't need to spend time in experimenting

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.600
with different Values at the development stage.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.805
Another thing, if you have to reset that complete typographic settings to default,

00:06:07.805 --> 00:06:10.310
you can click on this default button here.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.380
And once you are done that their Typography settings click on this pencil icon again,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.120
and it will highlight.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.155
In this way, you can save the global phones like daily.

00:06:21.155 --> 00:06:22.925
Let us now go back.

00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:25.010
Now click on typography.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.740
Here you can set up the typography for specific texts types like Heading 1,

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.795
Heading 2, up to heading 6,

00:06:32.795 --> 00:06:35.960
the paragraph foods and a link folds.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.070
These settings are applicable when you place a new text box or

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.675
Heading box or create a hyperlink in the editing campus.

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:50.795
Defining the values here can save time and adjusting the topography again and again.

00:06:50.795 --> 00:06:54.485
So now you will be able to make use of

00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:59.390
the global colors and global phones that we just said in the previous menu.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.920
And that will save a lot of time in the development stage.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.580
By the way, once you are done with the settings,

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.410
Clicking on the update button here at the bottom to save the changes.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.420
It is a good habit to save the work at least every five minutes.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.540
The next settings are related to the default button,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.610
images and form fields,

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.810
but we will see to them in the widget lesson first and then later if we require,

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.530
we can come back here to assign the default values.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.910
Below this, we have settings related to the site identity,

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.090
background, layout, and light box.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.809
We will set up the site identity first.

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:45.410
You can update the site name and description that is the

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.265
same as site title and tagline from here as well.

00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:52.805
Next, you can upload the logo for the website.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:58.625
Make sure you use the right dimensions so that the logo appears impactful in the header.

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:04.850
Next, you can upload the fairway can order site icon to display over here on the tab.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:10.355
A fav icon or cytokinin should always be designed in the ratio of what is to one,

00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:14.150
preferably 52 pixels by 500 pixels.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.030
Now, here is the page background setting.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.540
You can select from the classic ingredient options and

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.650
use some colored image or a gradient for the page background.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.130
So if you want to create a dark colored website,

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.145
you can select black colored as the page background.

00:08:31.145 --> 00:08:36.125
Assigning a page color here will apply the color to all the pages of the website.

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:40.055
If you wish to customize the background for some specific page,

00:08:40.055 --> 00:08:45.875
you will be able to do it from the Settings icon here on the individual page editing.

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:49.910
All right, now let us go back and select the layout option.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.214
Here you can have a look at the spacing, width and layout.

00:08:54.214 --> 00:08:59.525
These default settings work the best and there is no need to make any changes here.

00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:02.330
Just changed. Third, default page layout to

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.885
Elementor full width as we are not using the theme settings.

00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:07.085
That's it.

00:09:07.085 --> 00:09:10.654
Next is the default light box settings.

00:09:10.654 --> 00:09:13.339
By the way, what is the light box?

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:19.790
A light box pop-up is a window overlay that appears on top of a webpage like this.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.280
When a light box pop-up appears,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.495
the background is offered,

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:26.525
dimmed and disabled, meaning that

00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:30.725
the site visitors cannot interact with the other content on the website.

00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:34.234
This draws attention to the light box itself.

00:09:34.234 --> 00:09:39.095
So you will be able to adjust our default settings for the light bulbs from displays,

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:41.840
but it is not that important right now.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.290
Let us see if the changes we have made,

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.260
click on Update, and now let us go back.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.375
You can skip the Custom CSS.

00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:53.405
It is not for the non quarters like you and me.

00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:54.785
And if you know coating,

00:09:54.785 --> 00:09:59.645
then you can definitely make use of this feature by subscribing to Elementor Pro.

00:09:59.645 --> 00:10:03.470
I'm finally, you can click on the additional settings option to go to the

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.865
Elementor plug-in settings in the admin area in a new tab.

00:10:07.865 --> 00:10:11.510
Here, we have already made the setting at the start of

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.905
the lesson at dynasty only required setting that we needed to make.

00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:18.845
And if you're subscribed to Elementor Pro,

00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:23.960
you can upload the custom phones and custom icons from these options available heat.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.480
We will skip that team builder option here,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.760
as it is of liberal in Elementor Pro.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.430
And we will see to it later in the course.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.875
Let us see the user preferences.

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:37.775
Here, you will get the option to change the element or display.

00:10:37.775 --> 00:10:42.755
Currently, we are in the light mode and you can switch to the dark board as well.

00:10:42.755 --> 00:10:47.585
I know some of you will definitely light the dark mode as compared to the light mode.

00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:51.110
But let me continue in the light mode only in this course.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.965
You can manually adjust the paddle width also like this.

00:10:54.965 --> 00:10:57.080
And if you want to restore it default,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.550
you can enter some 300 pixels on.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.855
You can adjust the weight as per your preference.

00:11:02.855 --> 00:11:07.880
So we're done with the sector of Elementor for first use,

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.900
and we will continue learning the basics of Elementor in the next lesson.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.710
See you there.
