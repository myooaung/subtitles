00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
The main purpose of a landing page is to capture leads and get convergence.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.230
We can use the firm's budget of label in Elementor Pro and design

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.390
simple and beautiful and very effective forms that have minimum fields,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.700
cleared labels and clear messaging.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.565
But what are popups?

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:28.315
A pop-up is a small window that appears while browsing a website or on clicking a button.

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:32.870
Pop-ups are helpful because they simplify that decision-making process

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.340
for the visitor by increasing the visibility of the action step.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.500
So we can either use a form inline with the content by simply

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.200
placing the object or else we can assign a pop-up on the CTA button.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.885
When the visitor clicks on the button,

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:55.700
a small window will pop up and it will contain the form to capture the lead.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.500
This is the first thing.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.305
Let us see how you can create such a pop up using Elementor Pro.

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:07.415
Go to templates, click on pop up,

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:10.130
give it a name, and click Create.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.070
You can select some pre-designed pop-ups from

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.655
the library or else create one from scratch.

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:19.100
Let us create one from scratch.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.124
The first thing you have to do is to adjust the dimensions of this pop-up Canvas.

00:01:24.124 --> 00:01:27.680
To do this, click on Settings here at the bottom,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.635
and you will come to the pop-up settings.

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:34.279
Here, you can adjust the width and height.

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:39.305
Position enable disable the overlay and close button.

00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:43.565
You can also assign the entrance and exit animation.

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:47.465
Then come to the style tab and change the background color.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:50.330
You can adjust the opacity here to have

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.500
the transparent effect and show the landing page in the background.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.615
You can use the overlay as well and customize the close button.

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:01.430
In the advanced settings,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.870
you can set the time,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.895
enable and disable the closing on,

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:07.565
overlay or Escape key.

00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:11.330
The options are easy and I believe that you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.735
can now manage these things as per the requirement.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:18.125
Now designing the pop-up is again the same thing.

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:21.425
Click on the grid icon to go back to the widgets panel.

00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:24.920
Simply insert a section with a single column or

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.260
two columns and start adding the widgets as per the design of the pop-up.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.910
The most important widget to use here is the form visit.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.240
Setting up the form fields is as usual,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.400
but make sure you add that glues

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.870
pop-up action under the action after submit for this pop-up.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.025
So once a visitor fills out the form on the pop-up window,

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:51.335
the pop-up will close.

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:56.015
Now published the pop-up and do not add any condition or trigger.

00:02:56.015 --> 00:02:58.655
Simply save and close it.

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:03.855
Now come to the landing page and open the settings for the CTA button.

00:03:03.855 --> 00:03:06.130
Here in the link option,

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.005
click on dynamic tags option,

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.095
and select pop-up as the action.

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:13.719
By clicking on this wrench icon,

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.900
you can adjust the pop-up action to open

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.175
and then select the pop-up by searching for the name.

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:23.650
Once turn click on Update,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.155
you have successfully created a pop-up on the click of the CTA button.

00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:31.660
There is one more important thing here.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.410
Ideally, the visitors should redirect to the thank you page.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.480
After submitting the form.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.740
For redirection, You can add redirect in

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.495
the actions after submit and enter the thank you page URL.

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:50.740
So when a visitor clicks on the CTA button, a pop-up appears.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.130
The visitor fills out the form and when he submits,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.110
the pop-up is closed and the user is redirected to the Thank You page.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.775
On the thank you page,

00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:04.630
you can start the lead nurturing process and you can also place the conversion

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.265
tags to get the data of conversions in Facebook ads and Google ads.

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:14.650
You can use the same process for redirection for every lead capturing form,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.655
whether it is an inline form or a pop-up form.

00:04:18.655 --> 00:04:21.835
Well, we have some more types of pop up.

00:04:21.835 --> 00:04:25.090
The next type of popup that is important for us to learn for

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.680
landing pages is the exit intent pop-up.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.660
An exit intent pop-up is triggered when the visitor moves

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.310
the cursor near the close button or address bar of the browser.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.630
It is used to reengage their visitors before they leave.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.675
A well-timed pop up gifts you second opportunity to connect with the visitors,

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:51.755
effectively doubling the chances of converting them.

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:54.530
Let me explain you the process.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.955
If a visitor is not convinced by the content on the landing page,

00:04:58.955 --> 00:05:01.940
he will move the cursor towards the closing tag.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.150
What if you present them a pop-up ad this

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.540
moment with a clear messaging and lead capturing form.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.795
To give a second thought to the offering.

00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:16.325
You can even provide him some additional offered to encourage conversion.

00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:22.235
This type of popup that appears when a visitor tries to close the page is called less VD,

00:05:22.235 --> 00:05:24.500
the exit intent pop-up.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.455
And keep in mind that it is going to be very important for your landing page.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:33.979
If we see the content plan of the exit intent pop-up,

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.750
then it should have a CTA title that introduces the offer,

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.485
followed by CTA text to explain the offer,

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:44.450
then the lead capturing form,

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:51.440
it discouraging no option encouraging submit button text and image to capture attention.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.130
A close veteran and the size of the buffer is preferred to

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.690
be fullscreen with the mild transparent background.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.950
Keep in mind that this pop-up comes up and the visitor intends

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.925
to leave the landing page without filling the lead capturing firm.

00:06:07.925 --> 00:06:12.440
Now, to create an exit intent pop-up processes seem.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.885
You just need to adjust the pop of width,

00:06:14.885 --> 00:06:17.345
height, position, and other settings.

00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:18.410
Design the pop-up.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.865
As for the content plan,

00:06:19.865 --> 00:06:24.110
click on Publish, add a condition, Jew singular.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.935
Then choose pages and search for the landing page title.

00:06:27.935 --> 00:06:32.915
So this pop-up will only be displayed on this landing page.

00:06:32.915 --> 00:06:36.724
Click on Next, and we will get options to choose the trigger.

00:06:36.724 --> 00:06:40.325
We want to trigger the pop-up on exit intent.

00:06:40.325 --> 00:06:44.360
So enable the option on page exit intent.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.510
Click on Next and you will get more settings to

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.275
customize the trigger off the pop-up ang, segmentation.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:53.810
Click on Save and Close.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.905
That's it.

00:06:54.905 --> 00:06:59.285
You have created the exit intent pop-up for Lee capturing.

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:04.280
Well, there are other types of pop herbs that are triggered based on

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.830
time or scrolling activity or opt-in bars or interacting pop-ups.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.040
Although these are not recommended for the landing page,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.935
but you can definitely use any of the pop-up on

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:20.435
any page of the website as per the design and strategy.

00:07:20.435 --> 00:07:24.425
And the process to create a pop-up is almost the same.

00:07:24.425 --> 00:07:31.115
You can simply assign the conditions and triggered as per the pop-up type. That's it.

00:07:31.115 --> 00:07:36.650
Now, the next thing we have to learn is the e-mail automation process.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.265
I will give you a quick overview of this process.

00:07:40.265 --> 00:07:43.955
Once a visitor fills out the lead capturing form,

00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:47.555
his details will be received to you on the e-mail.

00:07:47.555 --> 00:07:54.710
But we also want to put his details in the audience list of our email marketing tool.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.950
By adding the visitor in the e-mail marketing tool,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.570
you can send them an automated e-mail just after the form submission and

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:08.330
even send them a series of emails as per the automation email sequence.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.085
Well, this can be done very easily using the Elementor forms.

00:08:13.085 --> 00:08:16.160
You can integrate the elemental forms with some

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.490
of the popular e-mail marketing tools like Mailchimp,

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.310
converted, drip, active campaign,

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.040
GetResponse or me LED light.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.855
The process is simple.

00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:29.720
You need to integrate the e-mail marketing tool with

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.450
element or by going to Elementor settings,

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.765
integrations and adding the API key.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:39.080
You can find the API key in the e-mail marketing tool

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.395
and add in the element or integration settings,

00:08:42.395 --> 00:08:44.810
then click on validate.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.815
Now, you can set an action after summit as Mailchimp,

00:08:48.815 --> 00:08:52.055
for example, and select the audience list.

00:08:52.055 --> 00:08:55.640
So whenever a visitor fills out the lead capturing

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.360
form has details are added to the Mailchimp audience list.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.505
And you can automate the process of sending e-mails by creating an email sequence.

00:09:04.505 --> 00:09:07.610
You are free to choose the required email marketing tool

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.700
as per the feature needs and your budget.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:16.670
Mailchimp is widely used convert good as preferred by bloggers and creators.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.445
File Miller Lite is the most economical one,

00:09:19.445 --> 00:09:21.739
but with a very good set of features.

00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:23.720
It depends upon your requirement,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.205
but make sure you use the e-mail automation process to nurture the leads.

00:09:28.205 --> 00:09:32.600
And VonMar saying, if you want to use some e-mail marketing tool

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.815
which is not available for direct integration with Elementor forms,

00:09:36.815 --> 00:09:42.200
then you can use Zapier and create the automation process.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.194
Feel free to explore Zapier.

00:09:44.194 --> 00:09:46.145
It is a very powerful tool.

00:09:46.145 --> 00:09:52.050
With this, I would like to end this lesson and we will continue in the next video.
