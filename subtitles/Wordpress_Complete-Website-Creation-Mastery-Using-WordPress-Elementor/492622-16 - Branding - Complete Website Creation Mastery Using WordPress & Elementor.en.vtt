00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Branding is very important for the website as it

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.890
helps in building a perception in the mind of the visitor.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.950
It creates credibility for you in the market and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.175
also supports the advertising activities.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:19.890
Branding defines who you are and what your business looks like.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.620
Now, there are several factors that play a role in conveying the brand's personality.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.705
But if I tell you the four most important factors for the website,

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:33.495
they are the logo of that website,

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:36.225
color scheme, type, biography,

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:38.814
and dawn of the content.

00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:44.150
If you maintain consistency in these four factors over the entire website,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.765
that the visitor will definitely get the sense of parenting

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.755
and develop a positive perception by browsing the website.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:54.500
Now there can be two scenarios.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.035
One, you might be just getting started and there is no brand history at all,

00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:03.620
means no logo, no brand colors, nothing.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.670
Second could be that you are making a website for

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.445
an already existing business that has some logo and even some old website.

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:17.420
For such a case, you can plan a rebranding process if required,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.390
or else you can use the same logo and come up with

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.579
the relevant color scheme and continue with the website design process.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.470
For the time being.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.660
I am considering that you are starting from scratch and we will start by creating a logo.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.905
We've already discussed the process to design a logo in the graphic designing lesson.

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:41.530
Always start with some raw ideas and create

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.145
multiple options as per the time and budget of the project.

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:48.685
Don't worry about the colors till the color scheme is finalized.

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:51.190
Simply give a black and white color to it.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.040
Just make sure you experiment with the phones and shapes

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.235
and come up with the most ideal logo for the website.

00:01:57.235 --> 00:02:00.445
Then you have to finalize the colored scheme.

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:04.555
This can be done by coming up with the preferred colors of the brand

00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:08.710
or by taking references from the colors of other brands.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.690
You can also make a Google search to know

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.155
the most trending color combinations for any industry.

00:02:14.155 --> 00:02:18.115
It is recommended to start by selecting the primary colors,

00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:23.495
which are going to be the dominant colors that is used in high volume on the website.

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:26.750
Then you need to select the secondary color that is used to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.334
complement the primary color wherever required.

00:02:30.334 --> 00:02:34.160
Then you need an accent color that is used to

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.480
highlight some extremely important sections like a call-to-action button.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.685
The accent color must stand out to give extra emphasis to the element.

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:47.570
Then you have to select the colors for typography.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.475
Always make sure you maintain

00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:53.645
a good contrast ratio between the heading color and the background color.

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:57.620
In fact, any text and the background color on the website.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.980
Typographic alerts will include colors for heading,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.670
subheading paragraphs and call to action button text.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.200
Finalize all these colors before starting the designing process.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.345
Once you are done with the color selection,

00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:14.015
it's time to put colors in the logo.

00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:17.105
Next, you have to select the phones for headings,

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:20.930
subheadings, paragraphs, and call to action button text.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.390
Come up with a complete list of styling options

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.790
like phone family for every type of heading,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.415
font size, and font weight.

00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:30.260
Again, you can experiment here with

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.145
different Google font options or take reference from some website,

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:36.860
or even made a Google search for the trending phones

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.025
to use on the website in some industry,

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:45.695
but do make the complete list of phones and styling beforehand.

00:03:45.695 --> 00:03:49.265
Next is to make some content strategy,

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:51.710
keeping in mind the values of the company.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.170
And accordingly, we need to adjust the tone of

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.265
the content and images that are to be used on the website.

00:03:58.265 --> 00:04:02.855
For example, the values of a brand may include optimism,

00:04:02.855 --> 00:04:04.805
Fun, and eco friendliness.

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:07.730
So you have to compose the content in a way that

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.065
represents that every problem has a solution that's optimism.

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:17.645
And also use some fun facts and show some care for the nature.

00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:20.915
Some brands showcase their trustworthiness,

00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:22.940
Some highlight their innovation,

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.570
and some wants to deliver a sense of personal touch.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.880
It is a broad marketing topic,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.160
but I hope you must have got some idea about the branding in terms of values.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.355
So to conclude, the branding topic here,

00:04:37.355 --> 00:04:41.105
always maintain consistency in colors, typography,

00:04:41.105 --> 00:04:43.970
and tone of the content on the entire website

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.315
and even on all other channels like social media,

00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:49.925
YouTube channel, and everywhere else on the web.

00:04:49.925 --> 00:04:51.530
In the next video,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.440
we will learn how to use a designing tool to create

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.430
the website design before moving on to the development stuff.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.450
See you there.
