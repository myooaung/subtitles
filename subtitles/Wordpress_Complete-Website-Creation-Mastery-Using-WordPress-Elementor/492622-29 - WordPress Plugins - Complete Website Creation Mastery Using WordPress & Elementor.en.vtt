00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.190
What if I ask you to use a smart phone without any mobile apps?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.450
The functionality of a smartphone is

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.930
enhanced with dedicated apps like an instant messaging,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.855
social media app, music player app,

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.095
email or video recording app, and lots more.

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:21.390
Without such special labs,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.450
a smartphone is of no special use.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.090
Similarly, in order to improve

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.935
the functionality and features of a website, they use plugins.

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:38.890
Overall, plug inside the main source of special functionality for our WordPress website.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.759
And there is a huge collection of plug-ins for every task on WordPress.

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:46.310
Like you have page builder plug-ins to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.460
design a web page using the drag-and-drop technique.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.474
You have header and footer customization plugins.

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:56.210
You have SEO plugins, image optimization plugins,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.490
cache management plug-ins and lots,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.810
lots and lots more plug-ins for every special function.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.060
You can also make a Google search for the most recommended plug-ins to have

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.010
on a WordPress site and even compare the different plugins before installing them.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.775
Now, although there are so many plugins available,

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:19.640
but we must use them smartly,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.850
it is recommended to use the least number of plugins to keep the website light,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.790
clean, fast and bug-free.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.015
And always ensure you install the plugins from

00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:37.700
authorized developers to stay safe from unwanted bugs and errors.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.715
At the time of common WordPress settings,

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:43.340
we had removed all the preinstalled plugins,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.835
and now it is time to discuss the most important plug-ins

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:50.930
that we are going to use in our website creation process.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.395
Let us have a look at them one by one.

00:01:54.395 --> 00:02:00.590
The first and the most important plugin that we have to use is a Page Builder plugin.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.864
A page builder is a plugin that helps us to design a webpage without the need of codes.

00:02:07.864 --> 00:02:13.865
It imparts drag and drop functionality to the website editing from the front-end.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:17.960
This helps us to focus entirely on the content and

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.265
design of the website without having to worry about the coding.

00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:26.360
It helps non coders like you and me create

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.470
a beautiful website and that to ingest no time.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.294
Let us get a bit clarity on the part of quotes.

00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:39.185
Using a page builder does not mean that your website has no quotes at all.

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:40.999
It does have quotes,

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.070
but by using page builders,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.130
via not required to write those codes,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.400
we have to just design the web pages and page builder

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.255
will automatically create codes for us. In the back-end.

00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:59.329
These peace builders have revolutionized web development in the past few years.

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.895
There are so many Page Builder plug-ins now available for WordPress like Elementor,

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:11.555
Beaver Builder, Devi, oxygen builder, breezy, Visual Composer.

00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:15.410
But they will be using the best one out of them.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.990
As per my experience,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.810
Elementor tons up to be the most effective Page Builder plugin for WordPress. Right now.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.855
It is the most advanced page builder with outstanding features and functionalities.

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:35.780
The courts in the back-end are also clean and help in faster loading of the website.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.960
And there are a lot of templates available for

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.025
Elementor to speed up the website creation process.

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:46.295
Let us see the process to install a plugin

00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:50.360
hover over the plugins menu and click on Add plug-in option.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.925
Now type element or in the search bar,

00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:56.030
and you will get that is also down here.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.290
Select the official Elementor plug-in and click on Install.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.554
While installing a new plugin,

00:04:02.554 --> 00:04:05.600
make sure you install the official plugin as there will be

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.830
so many different plugins available with similar names and extensions.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.404
Also, installing a plugin and WordPress is a two-step process.

00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:20.510
Now we have install elementor and weekend activate the plugin by clicking on this button.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.005
But wheat, I have one more plugin to install.

00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:29.120
This is a premium plugin and I have taken subscription of this for one year.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.040
It is Elementor Pro,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.110
and you will be able to download it from

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.370
the Elementor website once you have purchased the subscription.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.110
Well, I am using Elementor Pro because it enhances

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.260
the functionality and features of the free element or to a whole lot extinct.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.690
You get lot many features like the pop-up builder, the team builder,

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.510
around 13 more additional premium wizards to use when designing the web pages.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.670
It is a very powerful plugin.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.065
In fact, a very powerful paid subscription of the free element of,

00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:09.620
and I highly recommend you to use it if you want to

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.970
create professional websites for yourself or your clients.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.500
Now since I have downloaded the Elementor plug-in from the element or

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.330
website and I have to upload it to my WordPress.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.175
I will click on Add New,

00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:26.510
and click on upload.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.660
Once it is uploaded and installed,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.080
we can now activate both the plugins together.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.375
Hover over plugins menu,

00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:37.385
click on Install plug-ins.

00:05:37.385 --> 00:05:40.130
Here is the list of installed plugins.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.685
All right, So we're just having two plug-ins on this side.

00:05:43.685 --> 00:05:49.280
Let me show you another website that has more plug-ins to understand this process better.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.510
The plugins which are installed but not yet activated,

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.870
do not have this overlay color and blue border.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.259
Whereas the plugins that have been installed

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.145
and activated will have the overlay and blue border.

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:09.150
We need to select the plug-ins that are installed but not get activated.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.180
So here we have made the selection and now click on Bulk Actions,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.760
drop-down, select the Activate option,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.860
and click on Apply.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.300
That's it.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.370
We have arcuated multiple plug-ins and it saved our time.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.000
I'd recommend you to start the development process with

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.390
just the essential plugins and always make sure

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.140
you use the least number of plugins on the website.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.110
We will be installing the other ligands when we need

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.975
them one-by-one in our website creation journey.

00:06:40.975 --> 00:06:44.799
But I hope you are clear with the plug-in installation process.

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:47.470
Just like you receive updates for mobile lab.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.315
Similarly, you will be receiving updates for plug-ins as well.

00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:54.245
Wordpress plugin side now auto updated,

00:06:54.245 --> 00:06:56.720
but keep checking if any are betas mending by

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.420
going to the Updates option under dashboard.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.505
If you are using some premium plugins,

00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:04.760
make sure the licenses active to receive the updates.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.110
And one more thing,

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.865
let me deactivate the Elementor Pro plugin for now because it is a paid one.

00:07:10.865 --> 00:07:13.745
And I want you to get started with the basics first,

00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:16.985
that is using the free version of Elementor.

00:07:16.985 --> 00:07:19.384
That is it. For this lesson,

00:07:19.384 --> 00:07:22.350
we will continue in the next video.
