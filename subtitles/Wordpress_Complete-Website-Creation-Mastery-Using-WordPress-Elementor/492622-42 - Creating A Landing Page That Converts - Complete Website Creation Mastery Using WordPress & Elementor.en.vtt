00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
At the start of this lesson,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.605
I want to ask you,

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:11.115
what is the difference between designing a general web page and designing a landing page?

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:16.650
Well, obviously there will be differences in terms of layout and content.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.025
But keep in mind that the most significant difference is in purpose and action.

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:28.715
A landing page is the page where you sell products,

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:31.610
get leads AND gate conversions.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.950
Landing pages are focused to

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.885
specific actions and should have a clear messaging in the content.

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:44.435
The goal of a landing page is to move website visitors down the sales funnel.

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:47.480
Depending on the sales strategy it might

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.720
generate leads that the marketing beam can nurture,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.860
get users to start a free trial of the product or convert

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.705
visitors into prospects that the sales team can pitch.

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:04.115
So let us try to understand how you can come up with

00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:09.394
an effective landing page in the minimum possible time using Elementor.

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:12.980
The process of designing is almost the same as

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.125
a regular webpage using the same widgets, sections, and columns.

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:24.890
But what matters the most year are the fundamentals of designing the landing page.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.165
Keep in mind that you have just seven seconds

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:32.795
to impress the visitor and converting orders,

00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:35.675
you will lose a potential customer.

00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:41.510
So try to design the landing page that has a very strong first impression.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.109
Feel free to add social proof in the hero section above the fold, if required.

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.860
Always lead with action on a landing page,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.875
solve the visitors problem straight away.

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.720
You can also make an offer.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.785
They can't refuse, offer them deals, instead deals,

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:05.180
time-bound deals offered them discounts if good business model allows.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.735
But always keep and urgency factor or else the visitor may not take the action.

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:16.070
You can also educate the visitors in some meaningful way.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.800
Don't highlight the features in

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.810
stirred BM faces to the benefits that customers will get from your offer.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.705
And avoid too much information,

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:28.940
we need to convince them to take action,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.945
but do not extend the length of the page unnecessarily.

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:36.320
Do include social proofs as much as possible and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.385
provide a CTA after every step of messaging.

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:44.660
You can also try the concept of problem agitate,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.290
and solution in the main content section.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.535
Start with the customer's pain points or problems,

00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:57.590
then highlight how annoying the problem is and then P's them with the solution.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.430
After this section, you can come up with their transition section.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.900
It does that transition from the problem to the solution within offered.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.845
Do place the CTA here for the visitor to take action.

00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:11.810
Because if the visitor is convinced,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.530
you need to tell him how to get started on what to do next.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.940
That's it.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.475
Reduce any sort of complexity and friction in the contact forms.

00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:25.610
Tried to come up with simple forms with the clear messaging.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.099
Most importantly, make sure the landing page is optimized for different devices.

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.960
Well, I have quickly shared a lot of concepts and fundamentals.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.870
Now, you can experiment by applying these concepts while designing a landing page.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.105
For example, you can start a page with a catchy headline and sub-heading

00:03:47.105 --> 00:03:51.830
along with impactful image to have the first strong impression on the visitor.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.680
Tried to include as many social proof as possible,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.430
have a clear description with some offer and urgency element,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.635
along with a powerful CTA.

00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:04.100
You can highlight guarantee also if available.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.180
That's it.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.260
This could be the content plan for your landing pages.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.590
Now, let us see how to create a landing page in

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.595
WordPress using elemental processes, simple and same.

00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:18.410
Let us create a new page,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.940
give it a title.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.270
Now, we generally need to disable the header and footer for

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.175
the landing page as we don't provide much lengths to avoid distraction.

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:32.810
So you can disable them from the Settings menu here in the right,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.060
if the header footer are created using team or else you can add exclusion rule in

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.025
Elementor theme builder or

00:04:40.025 --> 00:04:45.215
header footer blogs plugin to hide the header and footer on the landing page.

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:48.785
Now, edit the page with Elementor.

00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:52.445
The designing process is same as a regular webpage.

00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:56.960
So simply use the element or widgets and design the landing page.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.315
Make use of call to actions,

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:02.090
foams, and timer if required.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.695
You can also make use of animations to emphasize some elements.

00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:10.370
And if you want to speed up the process of designing a landing page,

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.005
you can use the pre-designed templates that

00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:15.934
I've labeled in the element or Template Library.

00:05:15.934 --> 00:05:20.960
You can preview the designs and import the complete landing page with just a click.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.125
Simply make the required customizations in

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:28.070
text and graphics and your landing page is ready.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.760
Don't forget to integrate your e-mail marketing tool.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.664
If we are using burn with the Form Wizard to automate the e-mail marketing process.

00:05:36.664 --> 00:05:41.840
You can also create a reference library by taking screenshots of landing pages of

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.885
label on a variety of websites and platforms like Behance, Dribbble, and aborts.

00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:53.030
These references will help you in getting inspiration and ideas.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.305
You can also explored that template options of labeled at and UE2.

00:05:57.305 --> 00:06:03.275
So creating a landing page is an easy task for us now, using Elementor.

00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:05.030
Along with the landing page,

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.700
you must also create a thank you page.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.260
It is the page that loads up when the visitor submits the form?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.920
Yes.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.360
After submitting the form,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.270
the visitor shall be redirected to the thank you

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.019
page so that you can start the lead nurturing process.

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:25.400
You can also place the conversion tags on the thank you page to

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.545
fetch the data of conversions in Facebook ads and Google ads.

00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:36.485
The process of creating and designing the thank-you page with Elementor is the same.

00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:39.065
I believe you can easily do it now.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:42.065
So that's it to learn in this lesson.

00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:43.384
In the next video,

00:06:43.384 --> 00:06:44.645
we're going to see

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:48.800
two very important concepts that are related to landing page number one,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.460
using the pop-ups for lead capturing and integration

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.705
of email marketing tool with Elementor forms for automation.

00:06:56.705 --> 00:06:59.490
See you in the next video.
