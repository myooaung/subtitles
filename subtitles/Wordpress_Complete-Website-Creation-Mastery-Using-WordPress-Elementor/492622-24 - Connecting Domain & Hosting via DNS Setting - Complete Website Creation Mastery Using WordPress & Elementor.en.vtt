00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
After you have purchased the hosting plan,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.465
you have to make a very important setting to proceed.

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:09.630
You have to update the IP address or

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.605
the name servers of the web server to the domain name.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:17.325
Let us first understand why it is important.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:22.870
Whenever a user types the URL in the address bar of a web browser,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.260
browser knocks the door of the domain, not knock.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.190
Domain provides the IP address of the web server where the data of the website is stored.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.370
The browser Gonstead fetches the data of the website and presents it to the user.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.400
Now, if their domain name does not know

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.155
the IP address of the web server where the data of the website is saved,

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:53.015
then a web browser will not be able to pressing the web content to the user,

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:55.910
and the result will be an error page.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.715
The IP address or name server.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:05.165
Often web servers can be assigned to your domain name via the DNS settings.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.000
You have to simply locate the IP address or

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.330
the name server details provided by the hosting account.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.645
This is usually present in your service details or

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:18.170
even in the welcome e-mail sync by the hosting company,

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.010
simply copy the details and head on to the domain account.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.840
So let me login to the GoDaddy account and show you the process.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.320
After logging in, go to the product section where the domain

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.860
is listed and tried to find a DNS settings option.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.024
Look for the field called last name servers.

00:01:37.024 --> 00:01:41.030
Simply paste the details here and update.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.450
Keep one thing in mind that some hosting companies provide

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.170
name server details by some provide IP address.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.675
So if you want to update the name servers,

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:52.565
the process will be like this.

00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:54.935
And if you want to update the IP address,

00:01:54.935 --> 00:02:01.130
then look for the DNS settings and update the IP address in the a record field like this.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.130
Now simply save the settings and you have

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.475
successfully connected your domain name with your web host.

00:02:07.475 --> 00:02:10.040
It may take up to a few minutes or

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.640
some several hours to update the DNS settings worldwide.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.140
You can check the same by visiting Portsmouth DNS.net

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.880
or simply make a Google search for DNS propagation check.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.770
You will get the links.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.090
You can follow the same process to update name servers or IP address in Google,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.730
domains are named cheap or from whatever registrar you have registered the domain name.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.620
It works in the same way.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.335
All right, In the next lesson,

00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:43.955
we will login to the hosting account and learn how to use the cPanel.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.900
See you there.
