00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.840
to create a pixel perfect website that is beautiful and

design functional and use it optimized for

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.475
devices like mobile and tablet with a fast loading speed.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:18.765
We will achieve this by following the three-step website creation process.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:21.600
Keep in mind that your aim is to create

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.715
pixel-perfect websites quickly and easily without any coding.

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:30.480
The purpose of this course may vary as per your expectations,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.795
but I assure you that if you follow these steps,

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:36.480
your life can be transformed.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.490
A student can easily get a job or start freelancing after completing this course.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.330
A freelancer can provide website development service to clients.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.645
A working professional can start passive income,

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:53.450
and an entrepreneur can create a website for

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.890
his own business without paying huge money to any digital agency.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.165

Talking about the preparation for the course,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.585
I want you to set milestones.

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:17.690
The first milestone could be the discovered mastery,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.405
where you will be able to understand the target audience

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:23.900
and analyze the competitor websites effectively.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.775
Next milestone could be their design part that may take up some efforts,

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:31.235
but I'm here to help you and guide you.

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:34.235
Next milestone would be the development step,

00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:39.140
which is relatively easy once you are comfortable with the discovery design process.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.175
Wait.

00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:43.175
But what is the final milestone?

00:01:43.175 --> 00:01:50.705
The final milestone would be the application of whatever you have learned in this course.

00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:51.920
Yes.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.780
You will have to apply the concepts and complete a practice website.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.760
That will be a demo site.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.340
I will personally review that website and give you feedback about your work.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.700
So this is going to be a practical course and I will

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.955
help you in setting up a practice website for free.

00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:12.830
You will be using a free domain and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.890
a free hosting account to set up your practice website and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.350
feel free to experiment on that website

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.710
because it is going to be the learning ground for you.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.740
There were so many freeze in the past few sentences I spoke.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.640
So you are getting so many things for free. Feel good.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.540
The more you experiment on your practice website,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.655
the better will be your learning.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:41.600
Also, we will be using some tools for designing that.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.555
I will let you know step-by-step in the upcoming lessons.

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:47.720
So I believe we are all set to start learning.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.885
And I will see you in the next video where we will start

00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:55.459
the foundations and learn some basic concepts and theories.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.295
Did you say something?

00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:01.340
Don't elect theories because they're boring.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.300
Or I know it might be a bit hard on you,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.420
but these theories and concepts are the foundations of your success, right?

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.685
To enjoy them and deeply understand the concepts for better learning of this course.

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:19.110
See you in the next video.
