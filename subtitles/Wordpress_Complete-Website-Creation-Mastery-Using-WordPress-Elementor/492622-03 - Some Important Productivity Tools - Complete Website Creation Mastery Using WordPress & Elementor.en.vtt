00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.015
In this lesson, I want to tell you about some tools that can be used to make notes,

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:09.135
strategies, and planning your learning showed you.

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:11.280
This will help you a lot in organizing

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.955
the concepts that you're going to learn in this course.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:17.850
For example, let us see the concepts that we

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.120
discussed in the previous lesson in the form of a flowchart,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.915
a mindmap, in a list form,

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:28.575
or in some text editor app like Grammarly.

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:32.730
Let me give you a very quick overview of these tools.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.685
The first tool I want to tell you is draw dot io.

00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:40.100
This is used to create flowcharts and I use

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.655
it to organize my marketing plan and strategies.

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:47.090
It is free to use and it has an offline version as

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.095
well that you can download and install on your computer.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:55.789
This is the blank canvas and you can insert shapes.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.305
Insert text into those shapes by double-clicking at the center,

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:03.935
arranged them, and make connections.

00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:10.655
Feel free to add as many shapes as you want and arrange the chart in an organized manner.

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:14.840
You can play with this style and text settings to make it look beautiful.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.275
And you can also adjust the alignment of the shapes.

00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:23.150
Feel free to explore more shapes and add pages to your document.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
Once you are done, you need not save it

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.930
because the document is already getting auto saved.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.155
The next tool is mine, Mr.

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:35.165
It is a freemium dual,

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:39.365
which means it has a free version as well as a paid version.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:44.240
Here you can create mindmaps structures for brainstorming,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.295
notes, taking, project planning,

00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:48.800
and lots of other creative tasks.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.960
I use it to create syllabus and curriculum of my courses.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.810
The next tool is still low.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.735
It is used to create boards, lists,

00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:03.530
and cards to help you organize projects in a creative way.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.730
And it is a great tool to collaborate when you have a team of people.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.900
The last tool I want to tell you in this lesson is grammarly.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.560
It is a writing tool with the Writing Assistant that

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.520
helps you write clear and free from grammatical mistakes.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.880
I am telling you about gravity because it is the traditional form

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.135
of making notes by writing down whatever you have learned.

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:30.740
Obviously, you can use any other text editing tool like MS Word.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.620
But if you want a writing assistant to help you

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.890
with grammatical mistakes, then use Grammarly.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.360
Since you will be learning a lot many new topics and concepts,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.840
I want you to organize your learning so that it remains easy

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.725
for you to devise by just scanning a flowchart or a document.

00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:51.830
I hope these tools will be useful for you and

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.830
we will continue with the fundamentals of website in the next video.
