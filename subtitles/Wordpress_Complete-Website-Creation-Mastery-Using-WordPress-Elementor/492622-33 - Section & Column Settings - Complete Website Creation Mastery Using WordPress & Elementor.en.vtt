00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.505
Then we use are designing tool.

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:09.120
We can easily create a rectangle and place the content by a simple drag-and-drop.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.720
But arranging the information in such a structure on a webpage is a whole different game.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.715
You have to use sections and columns to manage the page layout.

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:24.280
So what does this section and what is a column?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.980
Section is the area of the page where you can

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.985
place columns to present the information in an organized manner.

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:36.305
And by column, we mean a vertical block of content.

00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:41.015
You may require multiple columns across the width of the page.

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:44.570
A section may contain one or more columns and

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.485
you can adjust the structured as per the design requirement.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:53.644
Let us see how to manage those sections and columns on a webpage.

00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:56.690
We know how to insert a new section.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.855
Click on the plus icon and select a structure.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:04.580
You can select a simple structure and we can obviously customize it later.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.430
A section is represented by blue border line

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.460
and column is represented by a gray dotted line.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.530
Now inside as section,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.445
there are columns to divide this section into 23 or whatever number of parts you need.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:24.950
In one section, there is compulsorily at least fun column.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.145
Another important point to note here is that

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:31.565
columns would only be added from left to right.

00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:36.455
It means columns are used to arrange rejects and horizontal form.

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:40.535
If you wish to add more area in vertical form,

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:45.830
you will have to use sections as it works from top to bottom.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.295
Let us have a look at the section settings.

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:54.065
Simply hovered over the top middle part and right-click on the dots.

00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:59.750
Now we can see the editing pane and left with settings having the three main tabs,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.375
layout, style and advanced.

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:04.850
Under Layout settings for a section,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.135
we have drop-downs like these.

00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:10.160
The main settings of label,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.460
our layout and structure settings with a left-click on the Layout tab and it will expand.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.845
We will be discussing the main settings that are useful in editing a website.

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:24.050
The first heading is content wit.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.015
It has two options to select,

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:27.830
boxed and full vector.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.000
By default, we currently have boxed selected and via

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.410
provided a scale to adjust the width manually as part of a requirement.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.495
You can scroll the scale left and right and decide the right weight for your section.

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:45.230
Also, you can put the value in the box provided.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.610
Keep in mind that we will be following the design that we have

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.770
already created in designing tool like Figma or Adobe XD.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.170
And we will be using all those dimensions and values here in Elementor.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.060
This is the development stage and we will be developing the page as

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.340
per the design that we have already created in their design stage.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.875
The value that you will put here in the dimension is in pixels.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.340
You have to make changes to the Width settings with a bit

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.610
of caution as if you have the smaller word,

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.710
it will affect the display on screens and your website will end up showing shrinked.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.370
And in case you wish to get back to the default value that

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.254
was available before manually adjusting the width of the section,

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:38.885
you just delete the value in the box like this.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:42.170
We know that deleting the value will not make it 0.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.795
In fact, it will restore it to default.

00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:47.690
Also, you can select the full-width option to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.005
expand the section across the entire screen,

00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:54.230
no matter how wide the screen is.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.240
In short, you can lock the content width by putting some specific dimensions or

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.370
else you can allow full-screen expansion by selecting full-width option.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.385
Next useful setting is height.

00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:11.105
Using this option, we can adjust the height of the section,

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:14.240
making it higher to cover the entire screen,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.829
or make it small,

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.380
or allow it to adjust itself based on

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.750
the height of the columns and widgets inside the section.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.550
You can also adjust the height of the section

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.105
manually by using the minimum height scale option.

00:04:28.105 --> 00:04:32.320
Let me tell you that proper heights election plays a very important role in

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.285
managing the whitespace and creating an engaging user interface.

00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:40.720
Now, next setting is column position.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.810
As we know that all sections have columns,

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.470
so it is possible to adjust the alignment of the columns to top,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.980
middle, or bottom as per the design requirement.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.940
Also, there is an option to stretch this section to make it

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.410
cover edge to edge while viewing the website on a wider screen.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.290
Next, let us explore settings under this tile tab.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.030
Usually the settings related to background,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.270
background overlay, border, shape, divider,

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.810
typography and colors are listed under

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.674
the style tab for the section columns and in fact for all the widgets.

00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:24.245
So let us start with the background settings.

00:05:24.245 --> 00:05:28.340
We can adjust the background for normal view and hover view.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.690
In the normal view,

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.945
you can select the background from four different types,

00:05:32.945 --> 00:05:36.889
classic, gradient, video and slideshow.

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.590
Let us understand the classic first,

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.625
you have an option to choose the colors as the section background.

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:48.755
So click on the Color window and the color palette will open in the color picker,

00:05:48.755 --> 00:05:53.075
you can scroll that wheel and choose the right set of colors for your project.

00:05:53.075 --> 00:06:01.205
But we have done this step already by saving the global color options.

00:06:01.205 --> 00:06:03.830
So we need to simply click on

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.500
the global color option here and pick the color as the background for this section.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.345
That's why I told you earlier that when you save the color palette,

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:16.745
you will save a lot of time.

00:06:16.745 --> 00:06:18.290
So in this way,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.010
you can set a solid color as your section background.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.245
Now, instead of a solid colored,

00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:26.330
you can also choose an image as

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.760
this section background hover over

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.210
the image box and you will find an option to Add Image.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.330
Click on it, and the image uploader will open,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.275
upload the image from your device and click on add.

00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:42.650
The image will be added to the background of the section.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.665
Adding an image to the background requires some decision and adjustments.

00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:50.480
Let us have a look at the same.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.939
Always tried to upload an image in their dimensions that are required.

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:02.225
It means editing and image beforehand to match the dimensions of the section.

00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:05.450
In this way, you will not face the problem in

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.095
cropping or magnifying the image in display.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.870
If the dimensions are not accurate,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.880
then after uploading they emerge,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.280
use the settings of labeled next,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.850
you can adjust the position of the image to center alignment options,

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.090
top alignment options, and bottom alignment options.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.450
There is a very cool setting and that attachment you can

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.410
select from the fixed option or the scrolling option.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.960
If the image size is small,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.789
you can select that repeat option to cover the section with repeated images.

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:41.720
And finally, you can try to adjust the size of the image using

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:48.230
some size settings in this that cover and contain options are the most useful.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.870
Now in all the settings,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.494
there is a default option.

00:07:53.494 --> 00:07:58.025
So in case if you get lost in the various settings,

00:07:58.025 --> 00:08:03.500
simply select default to get back to the original settings.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.175
The next type of background is gradient.

00:08:07.175 --> 00:08:10.760
A gradient is a fusion of two colors and you can mix

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.875
the two colors to create amazing color composition for your section back down,

00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:19.970
you need to select the two colors acted location,

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.950
adjust that type of blending and angles to match your requirement.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.920
The next type of background as video,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.465
it is a very good blend.

00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:32.660
You just need to enter the link of your YouTube or

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.185
Vimeo video or even your self-hosted videos.

00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:39.170
And it will be added to the section background.

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.225
To sell Foster Video,

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:44.405
simply upload the file in the Media Library.

00:08:44.405 --> 00:08:48.500
You can adjust the start time and end time settings and also

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.075
adjust the loop play options and playing the video on mobile.

00:08:53.075 --> 00:08:56.690
The video on mobile east to be taken special care as

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.245
the screen dimensions are different and the video may zoom up.

00:09:00.245 --> 00:09:02.090
So please pay attention to

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:07.910
the responsiveness settings if you are inserting a video in this section background.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.615
There is also an option for background fallback.

00:09:11.615 --> 00:09:16.115
It means you can select an image as the background fallback.

00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:17.585
Because in some cases,

00:09:17.585 --> 00:09:20.810
if the video is not able to render or play,

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.830
then there must be a backup image to show in the background.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.115
The last type of background type is a slideshow.

00:09:28.115 --> 00:09:31.205
It shows the different images in slideshow format

00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:34.730
and that keeps sliding aspect that time and speed.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:35.630
You mentioned.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:41.840
It is a very commonly used features and you can apply it easily using the Elementor.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.955
Simply select the multiple images and select the loop option with this button,

00:09:46.955 --> 00:09:52.865
you can make the slideshow fast or slow by adjusting the speed and milliseconds.

00:09:52.865 --> 00:09:58.940
There are a few transition effects and you can adjust the transition speed as well.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.470
The options of background size and background position is also useful in

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.570
case the dimensions of the image are different from the dimensions of the section.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.500
The Ken Burns effect is also a cool feature as it

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.985
gets a growing view or decreasing view of the image.

00:10:16.985 --> 00:10:21.005
These are the background options for normal view.

00:10:21.005 --> 00:10:24.425
Let us see some settings for the hover effect.

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:29.945
You can apply two types of background and overview, classic and gradient.

00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:33.034
The settings are the same as we learned earlier.

00:10:33.034 --> 00:10:37.610
Just the view of the background will appear while hovering.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.240
Next, let us learn the background overlay feature.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.385
You must have noticed the solid color overlay above an image like this.

00:10:46.385 --> 00:10:52.280
You can apply an overlay in the normal view as well as in the Harvard view.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.725
Let us learn them one-by-one.

00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:59.675
In addition to the standard editing options that we learned earlier,

00:10:59.675 --> 00:11:04.565
there is an option to adjust the opacity in terms of background overly.

00:11:04.565 --> 00:11:06.845
It ranges from 0 to one,

00:11:06.845 --> 00:11:10.220
with 0 being the minimum and one being the maximum.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.325
You can also apply the CSS filters and

00:11:13.325 --> 00:11:16.760
different blending modes as Marie or design skills.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:23.225
Try the settings for hover options as well as they are almost similar.

00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:27.620
Next setting under the style tab is adjusting the border.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.640
Again, it has the normal view and the whole overview.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.020
Under the Border Type,

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.535
you can select the solid,

00:11:34.535 --> 00:11:38.870
double, dotted, dashed, and groove type of borders.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.940
Once you select the border type,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.704
you will get an option to select the weight of the border and direct.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:48.620
Now, this box contains four values.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.290
Top, right, bottom and left.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.745
That is followed by a box that links all of them together.

00:11:55.745 --> 00:12:01.685
So in case you wish to assign the same value to all the four directions,

00:12:01.685 --> 00:12:04.145
first, check the linking box,

00:12:04.145 --> 00:12:08.135
or if you wish to provide variable are different values.

00:12:08.135 --> 00:12:12.950
First, uncheck the linking box and then insert the values in top,

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.979
right, bottom, and left boxes.

00:12:15.979 --> 00:12:21.335
Below that, you can select the color of the border from the same colored palette.

00:12:21.335 --> 00:12:24.605
Also, you can use the box shadow

00:12:24.605 --> 00:12:29.120
and you can also apply the border settings for hover effect.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.075
Next editing option is shape dividers.

00:12:32.075 --> 00:12:36.185
You can apply the divider to top and bottom parts of the section.

00:12:36.185 --> 00:12:39.830
It has so many creative types and I will suggest you to explore

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:44.375
the different types in both top and bottom parts of the section.

00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:46.805
Last option is topography,

00:12:46.805 --> 00:12:50.510
but we will not change the settings here as we will be doing

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.995
it individually for every text content that we add.

00:12:54.995 --> 00:13:00.275
Now, the next tab under the Settings is Advanced tab.

00:13:00.275 --> 00:13:05.884
It is a very important and very crucial when to understand and practice.

00:13:05.884 --> 00:13:11.210
And also let me tell you that the advanced settings are almost the same

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:17.660
for every section column and almost all the Elementor widgets.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:23.135
It means if you are able to understand these advanced settings once you can

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:28.984
apply it to all the sections, columns, and widgets.

00:13:28.984 --> 00:13:31.160
So what all it includes?

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.925
It includes the advanced settings motion effect.

00:13:33.925 --> 00:13:37.505
So responsive settings attributes and custom CSS.

00:13:37.505 --> 00:13:40.250
Let us start with the advanced settings.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.535
The first option is the margin.

00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:50.090
Margin for the section could be adjusted for top and bottom left and right is

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.195
disabled for the section settings as

00:13:53.195 --> 00:13:56.525
it is a district automatically based on the content vector.

00:13:56.525 --> 00:13:59.480
But you will get all the four directions,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.100
bottom, left, and right for the columns and widgets.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:10.145
Margin means the species outside the boundary of this section.

00:14:10.145 --> 00:14:11.945
Let me repeat it.

00:14:11.945 --> 00:14:19.145
Margin means the space outside the boundary of a section,

00:14:19.145 --> 00:14:27.650
whereas in binding, it is the space inside the boundary of a section for top,

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.260
bottom, left, and right.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:36.710
Clear margin means space outside the section boundary,

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:41.570
and padding means space inside the section boundary.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:47.270
You can smartly use the linking button to link the values together while adjusting,

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.270
adjusting the values for top, bottom, left,

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:55.295
and right is a very important practice and you will have to use this optional Lord.

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:58.130
So get familiar with linking the values and

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.070
linking the values and anchoring the values for top,

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.095
bottom, left, and right.

00:15:03.095 --> 00:15:08.990
Then that is an option to edit the Z index or index for the section.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.135
It helps you adjust the order.

00:15:11.135 --> 00:15:14.420
If another section overlaps,

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.965
then there are options to assign CSS classes ICSID,

00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:24.170
that are used for some specific purpose that we may discuss in the course ahead.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.555
Next is motion effects.

00:15:26.555 --> 00:15:27.934
As the name suggests,

00:15:27.934 --> 00:15:30.545
the setting has animation settings.

00:15:30.545 --> 00:15:32.870
You will get access to this cooling effect if you have

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.975
subscribed to Elementor Pro or else,

00:15:35.975 --> 00:15:41.090
you can only use the entrance animation option in the free version.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:46.040
Go ahead and give this a try as there are so many cool effects to use by

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.599
loading the section that responsive settings are also important.

00:15:50.599 --> 00:15:54.920
You're going to adjust the column position in a section for mobile and tablet.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.979
And you can rearrange them as per your requirement.

00:15:57.979 --> 00:16:01.730
Also, you can hide some sections or columns,

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.735
specifically for mobile, tablet or desktop.

00:16:05.735 --> 00:16:10.310
This feature is quite often used because you have some sections

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:14.479
that you have to display only on the desktop devices.

00:16:14.479 --> 00:16:19.520
And there are some sections that you have designed specifically for the mobile devices.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.435
So you can hide the sections and you can show the sections.

00:16:23.435 --> 00:16:26.165
It is very useful to use.

00:16:26.165 --> 00:16:30.455
So these are the important settings for a section.

00:16:30.455 --> 00:16:34.055
And if you are able to understand the concept still here,

00:16:34.055 --> 00:16:36.200
you will be able to adjust the settings for all,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.800
most of Aliyah that rejects while designing the web page.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.120
Now, let us also understand the settings for the column.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.135
In order to open the settings for a column,

00:16:47.135 --> 00:16:51.440
Harvard from the corner of a column and click on this pencil icon.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:57.035
It also has the same layout style and advanced steps in the layout settings.

00:16:57.035 --> 00:17:00.500
You can adjust the column width in terms of percentage.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.415
It is very useful when you have multiple columns and you want to

00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:08.450
assign the verdict to the different columns inside a section.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:13.325
And important setting is to adjust the visit space and it is anchored in pixels.

00:17:13.325 --> 00:17:18.545
If you remember, we entered 20 pixels as the default wizard space.

00:17:18.545 --> 00:17:21.320
Also, I would like to draw your attention here as

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:26.165
the value box is MD and this does not mean that it is 0,

00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:28.325
means that it is the default value,

00:17:28.325 --> 00:17:29.990
which is 20 pixels.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.910
If you wish to make it 0,

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.810
you can simply enter 0 in the box OT else,

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.485
if you wish to assign any specific spacing value, you can enter that.

00:17:39.485 --> 00:17:44.945
Go ahead and make some experiments that will help you become a good learner.

00:17:44.945 --> 00:17:49.250
The style tab and the Advanced tab has similar options,

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.990
just like a section.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.540
Feel free to explore them as well.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:59.375
So this is how you can manage the section and columns on a webpage.

00:17:59.375 --> 00:18:05.030
And vivant start learning the application of Elementor widgets from the next video.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.870
See you there.
