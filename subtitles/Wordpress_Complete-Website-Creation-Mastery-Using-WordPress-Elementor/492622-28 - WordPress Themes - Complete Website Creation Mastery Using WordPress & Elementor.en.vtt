00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.169
It is now time to start customizing the website.

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.955
You will be creating a site either for yourself or your client.

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:13.770
We will start with installing the theme of our choice.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.900
Let us hover over the appearance menu and click on Theme option.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.965
Currently that 2021 team is installed and it is the default WordPress theme.

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:30.600
By the way, what does a WordPress theme?

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.045
A WordPress team is a tool to change the layout and design of the website.

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:40.565
Themes customize the appearance of the website,

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:43.115
including the layout, typography,

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:46.190
color, and other design elements.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.665
A WordPress theme acts like an architectural structure for your website.

00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:57.155
It provides you the functionality to edit different parts of a webpage, lake header,

00:00:57.155 --> 00:00:59.570
main content or body area,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.860
footer, widgets, menu locations, and more.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.355
Choosing the right WordPress theme is very important

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:11.450
because it lays the foundation of the website design.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.230
So what happens when you change a team after

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.640
creating n number of pages and publishing content?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.995
Well, changing the WordPress team will not change the content.

00:01:24.995 --> 00:01:29.840
Pages, users or other information stored in the database,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.715
but the team changes how all that information is displayed to the website visitors.

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:41.810
If we make changes in the team after putting content,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.355
then chances are that the design will be altered as for the team,

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:50.135
and v may end up making n number of revisions,

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:53.314
rearranging the design of the website.

00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:55.100
So be very sure,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.765
does start in selecting the right team for the website.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:05.165
The team you select must load fast with optimized courts.

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:08.705
Have powerful design options like managing the layouts,

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:14.480
header and footer styling options support typography and colors for different elements.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.300
Seo optimized and responsive to work well with all the devices.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.505
There are again, thousands of free and paid themes to choose from.

00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:27.500
But based on my experience,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.245
I have shortlisted two to three themes that

00:02:30.245 --> 00:02:33.424
I recommend you to use on your business website,

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:36.050
personal website, e-commerce website,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.145
or in fact, any type of website that you wish to make.

00:02:40.145 --> 00:02:42.725
First one is Astra,

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:45.110
the other one is ocean WP,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.050
and the last one is Hello team.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.835
Astra and ocean WP are premium themes.

00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:56.660
It means they have a free version and they also

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.300
have the paid add-ons to enhance the functionality of the team.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.965
On the other hand,

00:03:03.965 --> 00:03:05.840
the Halo team is free,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.830
but it is a plain vanilla team and it is meant to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.585
be used with the Pro version of Elementor to make sense.

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:20.000
Now, obviously, you can start with the free version of the teams.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.105
I will recommend you to use Astra over

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:27.875
ocean WP as it is the most lightweight WordPress theme.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:32.660
And it works absolutely fine with all the popular page builders.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.245
So I will go ahead and click on the Add New button.

00:03:36.245 --> 00:03:37.850
Now in the search bar,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.800
I will type Astra.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.200
Here are the search results.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.565
Carefully select the Astra Theme and click on Install.

00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:50.195
So installation is in-progress,

00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:52.355
and here it is done.

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:54.785
As I had told you earlier,

00:03:54.785 --> 00:03:57.365
it is always a two-step process.

00:03:57.365 --> 00:03:59.630
So after the theme is installed,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.000
click on activate to make Astra,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.954
our working theme on this website.

00:04:04.954 --> 00:04:10.100
Make sure you enable auto updates for the theme as there are regular updates

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.470
provided by the creator and V must update it for performance and safety.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.530
In case there is some pending update,

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.830
please check the updates option under dashboard.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.635
Since you are just starting up,

00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:27.950
I will recommend you to install Ocean WP as

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.555
well to test the differences between the two teams.

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:38.075
And if you wish to buy some verb proceeds from Envato market or Envato Elements.

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:41.030
Make sure it is compatible with Elementor.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.035
Page builder we will be using to design our webpages.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:47.810
One more concept I would like to tell you,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.480
whenever we create a professional website,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.125
it is always recommended to use a child theme.

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:57.905
A child team is an extension of your primary theme,

00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:00.755
and it is used for some strategic reasons.

00:05:00.755 --> 00:05:04.010
It is a theme that inherits the functionality and

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.045
styling of another team called as the parent Team.

00:05:08.045 --> 00:05:10.670
Channel teams have recommended to modify

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.665
the existing teams while still maintaining their design and code.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:22.400
Let us suppose you have put some custom codes in your theme files and there is an update.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.560
When you install the update,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.270
your custom codes would be reset and you have to insert them again.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.780
So to stay away from such an issue,

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.485
we always recommend using a child team.

00:05:36.485 --> 00:05:39.140
Creating a child theme is very easy.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:45.380
Make a Google search for Astra team and click on this link by Astra.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.300
Here, give a name to this child team and click on Advanced option.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.285
You can also upload a thumbnail image to represent a theme and click on Download.

00:05:56.285 --> 00:06:00.710
Now you can upload this child team in WordPress and use it

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.690
along with the parent as sub-theme by installing and activating.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.920
That's it.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.800
Your child team is activated and remember,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.915
do not delete the parent theme.

00:06:11.915 --> 00:06:14.510
It is mandatory to have the parenting

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.904
installed in order to make the child team work for your website.

00:06:18.904 --> 00:06:21.950
That was all about the WordPress themes.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.029
We will continue in the next lesson and learn about the WordPress plugins.

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:27.810
See you there.
