00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
In this lesson, let us learn how to create a blog post and

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.349
how to design the single post page to create a new post,

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.415
hover over the post option and click on add new.

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:18.625
It is the same process as creating a new page.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:24.935
You can assign a title to the post and let us see the settings on the right.

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:28.415
First is status and visibility.

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:31.700
Here the options are the same and you have

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.080
an additional option to stick a post to the top of the blog,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.780
like a featured blog post.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.740
Next, you can edit the permalink or URL.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.340
This can be edited after publishing the post as well.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.655
Next, you can add categories and tags.

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:51.500
Do this post.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.250
Now, categories and tags are very important from a blog point of view.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.029
Let me explain it why categories and tags both help in structuring the content.

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:09.485
Categories, helped to broadly group the post topics,

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:14.090
while tax helped to describe the post in more detail.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.350
In short, categories are the most general method of grouping content on a WordPress site.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.860
A category symbolizes a topic or a group of

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.625
topics that are connected to one another in some way.

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:33.935
Sometimes a post can belong to many categories at the same time.

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:37.670
However, it is perhaps not the best idea to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.585
assign more than two or three categories to one post.

00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:44.960
The point here is to have your content neatly

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.745
organized in a way that makes accessing it easier for the reader.

00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:55.744
For example, a digital marketing blog can have categories like content marketing,

00:01:55.744 --> 00:01:57.710
SEO, social media marketing,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.770
web analytics, designing and board.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.525
On the other hand,

00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:08.675
tags are used to identify a piece of content by some specific keywords.

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:14.930
Simply pick a few words that describe a given post in the best possible way.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.015
The main difference between categories and tags is the way you use them.

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:25.189
The categories are meant to indicate the January of the post.

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.215
And tags, on the other hand,

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:33.170
go much more in depth and indicate the individual things that the post talks about.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.990
Therefore, you can use multiple tags with a single blog post.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.865
Keep in mind that categories and tags are

00:02:43.865 --> 00:02:47.960
represented by the term taxonomies in Wordpress.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.690
Next, you can add a featured image.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.615
And it is very important because it acts like a thumbnail in the blog archive page.

00:02:56.615 --> 00:03:00.170
Next, you can insert a post exert,

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.110
which is basically a summary of the blog post and it is

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.140
usually visible on the poster archive page.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.825
If excerpt is empty,

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:14.810
WordPress automatically creates an excerpt using the first 55 words of the post.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.755
The next options work the same as for a page.

00:03:18.755 --> 00:03:22.865
Now, designing the single post page is an easy task

00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:27.860
as you can use Elementor to design the page as per your requirement.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.560
However, there are some settings related to the structure of a single post page,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.195
which is not that easy with a free team like Astra.

00:03:38.195 --> 00:03:44.270
To customize it, we need to go to the customizer from the Appearance option,

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.415
select the blog option here,

00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:49.130
and select Single Post head.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.330
You can modify the structure of the single post using the theme settings.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.000
However, there are very limited options to customize the structure of the single post.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.440
Here, you will be able to adjust the vert and manage the order of

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.080
structured and metadata of the single post page along with the topography settings.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.670
That's it. And if you use Astra Pro,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.040
then you will get a bit more options like to enable or disable the author info,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.975
auto load previous post,

00:04:20.975 --> 00:04:23.345
adjust the size of the feature to merge

00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:26.825
the color of the title and spacing of the container.

00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:31.025
But still, you are not able to customize the featured image position,

00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:35.165
and layouts, as we see in modern day blog post.

00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:38.810
So these are the limited options you get to customize

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.295
the look and feel of the signal post using the theme settings.

00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:45.335
On the other hand,

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:47.615
if we are using Elementor Pro,

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:52.220
then you get more flexibility to design the single post layout.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.575
Let us see how you can design a single post with Elementor Pro.

00:04:57.575 --> 00:05:02.525
One thing here, before creating an element or template for single post,

00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:07.340
make sure you publish at least one blog post on the website.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.440
Hovered over templates option and select team builder or else

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.675
simply click on Add New and select Single Post as the type of template.

00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:21.260
Give it a name here and click Create.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.925
Now, you will have an option to juice some pre-designed template.

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:31.475
And these are some very beautiful up-to-date layouts that you can easily import.

00:05:31.475 --> 00:05:36.080
So simply click on Insert and it will be available to edit.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.170
And if you wish to create a template from scratch,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.625
you can definitely close the library and start designing the layout.

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:49.265
The basic structure of a block consists of the head section showing the featured image,

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.425
post title, author, NFO,

00:05:51.425 --> 00:05:55.265
and metadata like date, tags and categories.

00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:59.600
Make sure you have one blog posts published before creating this template.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.525
Now, click on the Preview icon here.

00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:06.065
The Ivan, and click on Settings.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:08.435
In the preview settings,

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:15.395
select Preview dynamic content as post and type the post title to select.

00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:18.530
Click on Apply and preview.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.274
Now here we will start designing the post from scratch by using sections, columns,

00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:27.395
arranging the content in the required design by making use

00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:30.845
of the dedicated post visits like post title,

00:06:30.845 --> 00:06:34.370
that will fetch the post title from the one we selected to

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.735
give us a preview while creating the template and others.

00:06:38.735 --> 00:06:42.620
You are free to design the poster template as

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.355
whether design requirement using the widgets and once done,

00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:50.809
click on Publish, add the condition to include it on post,

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:53.885
and finally, click on Save.

00:06:53.885 --> 00:07:00.305
The Post Template is created and now whenever you create a new single post,

00:07:00.305 --> 00:07:03.215
it will be displayed in this format.

00:07:03.215 --> 00:07:09.290
You can create separate templates for categories and authors if required.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.430
Elementor theme builder is very powerful and it gives you

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.380
lot many options to customize the look and feel without any coding.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.795
Once the template is complete,

00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:24.755
we need to focus on designing the content of the single post.

00:07:24.755 --> 00:07:31.800
So let us now discuss some trending design ideas to design the single post page.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.350
First is to make use of Broca's Caps.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.229
You can do this very easily in Elementor.

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:42.200
Select the text editor fade number tags,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.200
and select the drop cap option here at the bottom.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.085
That's it.

00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:49.130
It is a good way to start the post content.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.845
Next is to use the colored border.

00:07:51.845 --> 00:07:54.350
In fact, a singular colored border.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.040
It provides emphasis and it's great to use for

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.240
quotes are particularly important aspects of the content.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.570
You can insert it either using the blockquote wizard in

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:11.810
Elementor Pro Arte my grading a border only for the left direction of the section.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:18.260
You can also use the section background to lay emphasis to a particular piece of content.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.730
In fact, you should use a decent number of images and videos in

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.184
the body content as it enhances the engagement of the visitor.

00:08:27.184 --> 00:08:30.215
And we also know that the post,

00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:31.940
which is in the long form,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.835
that is between 100 to 2 thousand words,

00:08:34.835 --> 00:08:40.610
that delivers the best performance and the best engagement for the visitor.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.839
So make sure you include the images, videos,

00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:47.675
infographics in your post,

00:08:47.675 --> 00:08:53.720
and create an engaging and high-quality content for the visitor.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.205
You can also use image shadows to stylize the blog page.

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:02.075
It can be done under the style settings of the image widget.

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:06.620
Next is to make use of the star text just below the main title

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.805
of the post is used to give an emphasized start to the blog.

00:09:10.805 --> 00:09:14.015
Just insert a heading below the title.

00:09:14.015 --> 00:09:19.475
Next is to highlight the subheadings to appear creative and highlighted.

00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:23.690
It is useful in breaking down the monotony of convent reading.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.590
Make it appear creative by adding some background color.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:33.875
Also, make use of dividers in the content design by using the divider widget.

00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:39.050
Next option is to write a blog post title over a background image.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:44.225
Simply select a section background and place the heading widget on it.

00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:44.960
Next.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.795
And almost a compulsory style option is to use subscribed forms in the blog.

00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:56.525
It is important to build a mailing list and update the visitors about the new happenings,

00:09:56.525 --> 00:10:01.550
encouraging them to read the new blog post and visit your blog repeatedly.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:08.390
It can be done easily using the firm's Wizard of label in Elementor Pro. Next 10.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:14.000
Another important one is to have two actions in the post design,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.020
make it eye-catching so that you will get better conversions.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:23.225
There is even a dedicated budget to design call to actions and Elementor Pro.

00:10:23.225 --> 00:10:26.600
Next is to include social sharing buttons so

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.230
that a visitor can easily share the blog with this community.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.585
This can be done easily by using the social share budget available in Elementor Pro.

00:10:35.585 --> 00:10:39.455
Another factor to consider for the ease of navigation and

00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:44.075
SEO point of view is to create internal links in the body content.

00:10:44.075 --> 00:10:48.290
You can easily add links to the texts in the text editor and adjust

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:53.165
the settings to open it either in the same window or in a new tab.

00:10:53.165 --> 00:10:59.795
Lastly, always include the related post section at the end of the blog post.

00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:05.585
This can be done by creating a new section and adding a heading and subheading.

00:11:05.585 --> 00:11:08.030
Then place the post layout wizard and select

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:12.035

00:11:12.035 --> 00:11:16.265
So these are the tips and the design ideas that you can

00:11:16.265 --> 00:11:20.270
easily implement while designing the blog post.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.384
That said to learn in this lesson.

00:11:22.384 --> 00:11:26.435
And we will continue with the blog archive page settings in the next video.

00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:28.230
See you there.
