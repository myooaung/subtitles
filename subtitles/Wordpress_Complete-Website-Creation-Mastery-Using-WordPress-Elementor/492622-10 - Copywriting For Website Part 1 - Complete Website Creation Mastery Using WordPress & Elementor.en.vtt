00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.505
In this lesson, let us learn some super-effective copywriting strategies.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:10.590
The strategies that we are going to discuss is not limited to just a website.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.370
You can apply these types disease to write a video script,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.800
block post outreach, e-mails,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.160
YouTube video descriptions, podcast descriptions,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.354
social media post and add copies.

00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:28.590
Copywriting is the practice of writing text in order to inform,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.085
inspired, or persuade the reader.

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:35.160
Writing and engaging web copy is very

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.950
important because Internet is a highly competitive place.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.500
The visitor does not find value on the website.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.570
We all know what will happen.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.059
He will move away from the website.

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.510
And we never want this to happen with us.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.230
So for that, you have to write Diller headlines, subheadings, paragraphs,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.715
call to action lines,

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:01.580
articles and stories on the website so that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.720
the visitor is engaged and motivated to take action.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.254
Before starting the copywriting process,

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:11.225
you have to be cleared with the website objectives.

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:16.070
You must be clear with the one single primary goal of the website.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.399
What do you want the visitor to do after he reads the website content?

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.505
The better you understand the audience,

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:28.280
the better you will be able to, right?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.665
Also, you need a clear understanding of the product or service.

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:35.465
Know what it is,

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:39.395
how it works, and how it compares to the competition.

00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:45.005
Also, you need to learn about the audience thoughts, fears, and desires.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.490
Then only you can write a copy that speaks directly to them.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.095
Now, I want to share the seven most important strategies

00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:59.000
that are used to write a highly engaging website content.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.560
The first strategy is to use a slippery slide.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.080
Yes, it is the same slide on which children play in the park.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.490
The short sentences and very short paragraphs have

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.260
a slippery slide effect and it is very effective in web copywriting.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.760
We always want to make the visitor keep reading till the end.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.670
Let me show you an example for this.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.840
What is a sentences main job.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.465
Getting you to read the next one,

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:35.495
then the next one after that.

00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:39.454
That's the slippery slide concept in action,

00:02:39.454 --> 00:02:42.890
making it hard for people to stop reading.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.275
Next is a very famous strategy called as the aida formula.

00:02:48.275 --> 00:02:50.689
It stands for attention,

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.285
interest, desire, and action.

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:55.790
A-i-d-a, or Aida.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.585
You can see it works very well for the sales page copy,

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:03.260
social media post copy, and email newsletters.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.930
Let us see an example to understand this.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.570
The first line written here is,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.980
this is the most complete guide to landing pages online.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.140
This line creates a tension.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.835
Next, creating landing pages that convert super well.

00:03:19.835 --> 00:03:24.575
It is tapping on the desire to create landing pages that convert.

00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:26.405
Then in the line,

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:30.065
you will love the detailed strategies in today's guide.

00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:32.225
There is an interest element as well.

00:03:32.225 --> 00:03:35.210
And finally, a call to action by writing,

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.130
let's dive right in.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.390
The order is a bit upside down for the interest and desire in this example.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.860
But what matters is that you apply aida formula in the content.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.670
Next is to replace features by benefits.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.795
Okay.

00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:56.210
You didn't get what I mean, features benefits replacement.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.455
All right.

00:03:57.455 --> 00:04:01.459
I am telling you to remove the features on the website.

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.440
Yes, removed them and write the benefits in place of that.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.110
This is a very powerful strategy because it resonates well with the visitor.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.790
Try to talk in a way that the visitor is getting benefitted.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.950
Don't tell why you are good.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.940
Tell them the benefits they will get by using your product or service.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.990
After all, his game is your gain only, right?

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.310
All right.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.960
Next is to use strong and clear CTAs.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.750
You can place the CTA at every point

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.675
in the message we are a new information is presented.

00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:41.285
Nevertheless, an opportunity to convert.

00:04:41.285 --> 00:04:43.865
Also, your customers are busy.

00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:48.170
In fact, they are very busy and they don't know what to do next.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.165
So you have to tell them what exactly to do next.

00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:58.010
All right, next is to show social proof.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.725
It is a true magic in copywriting.

00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:02.615
Anyone can say on the website,

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:04.640
I can do this, I can do that.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.115
But if you can show that with data, testimonials, examples,

00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:13.415
case studies, reviews, statistics,

00:05:13.415 --> 00:05:18.065
you can really take the things to the next level and generate sales.

00:05:18.065 --> 00:05:22.775
It doesn't matter whether you have a long list of testimonials are just a few.

00:05:22.775 --> 00:05:26.180
You can show up that reviews about customers who are brilliantly

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.530
satisfied or transformed by taking your services.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.840
Whatever the strongest form of social proof available to you use that.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.765
Next is crystal-clear.

00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:40.039
Usp.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.685
Usp stands for unique selling proposition.

00:05:43.685 --> 00:05:45.515
It means to answer,

00:05:45.515 --> 00:05:48.605
why should someone buy from you?

00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:51.185
Maybe you have got the best prices.

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:54.005
Maybe you deliver faster than anyone else,

00:05:54.005 --> 00:05:56.390
or maybe you guarantee results.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.544
This is what makes you stand up from the competition.

00:06:00.544 --> 00:06:05.135
So make sure you highlight your USP in the content.

00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:08.539
The last is the sense of urgency.

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.260
It is used to make customers act right now.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.760
Yes, we want them to take actions and take it right now.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.370
Some of the ways to create urgency are like limited time offer sealants on Sunday,

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.770
don't miss out like this.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.540
It really works.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.340
Do give this a try.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.210
So these are some really powerful strategies and

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.245
try to make use of them in whatever content you can pose.

00:06:36.245 --> 00:06:40.309
Now let us learn some practical methods like how to write the headlines,

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:42.365
paragraph, and other content.

00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:44.900
We will start with the headlights in

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.895
the website Copy always tried to write irresistible headlines.

00:06:49.895 --> 00:06:54.965
The headline of the website is the first impression that your content is going to make.

00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:57.620
It is this headline that makes the person

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.890
decide whether or not he's going to stick around the website

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.650
and explore more information or else he will

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.530
simply leave your website and check Instagram.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.520
In the headline.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.405
You have to try to convince him that the content is useful.

00:07:14.405 --> 00:07:16.400
Tried to create an urgency,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.630
tried to show that the content is unique and ultra specific.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.775
Let me show you an example.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:27.710
You can also pause this video to read the examples slowly.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.070
So this is a headline for one of the articles and it is clearly

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.629
showing that the content is useful, unique, and specific.

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:38.315
Here is another example.

00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:43.489
This is how to write a super specific headlined.

00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:46.745
Now let me tell you some headline preferences.

00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:48.980
You can use numbers in headlines.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:55.234
You can also address to the reader or use how to headlines and question headlines.

00:07:55.234 --> 00:07:58.220
You can also create emotional headlines by

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.890
adding emotionally-charged words in the headline,

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.545
lake crazy now, fast,

00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:07.685
mistake, new, breakthrough, amazing, awesome.

00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:08.960
Alright.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.240
So the next concept to use and headlines is FOMO.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.010
Fomo.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.850
It is the abbreviation for fear of missing out.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.780
It triggers a very strong emotion in the visitors.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.670
You can use a phrase like limited time savings.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.945
It works brilliantly.

00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:31.010
Give it a try.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:36.800
Next, you can also use the concept of WIIFM.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.980
It stands for what's in it for me.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.180
It means we need not write headlines showing our experience.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.635
Instead, write headlines that answer the question in the mind of the visitor.

00:08:48.635 --> 00:08:53.510
Once again, I would like to repeat that these are the universal copywriting strategies.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.830
And you're free to use these strategies to write headlines for different web pages,

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.290
blog post titles, email newsletters,

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.635
social media post and add copies as well.

00:09:03.635 --> 00:09:06.650
Next is to write four paragraphs.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.500
It is also important because the first few lines decide

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.995
whether the visitor will lead to content or not.

00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:16.640
So it must always start with a hook.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.415
Let us have a look at this example.

00:09:19.415 --> 00:09:22.160
Here it is starting with a hook leg.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.360
The stats are in,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.415
the reserves are undeniable.

00:09:25.415 --> 00:09:29.900
Email is still the number 1 way to drive sales online.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.850
This is a hook.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.530
You can also use mini stories to start the paragraph, right?

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.055
A four or five lines story like this.

00:09:40.055 --> 00:09:45.860
Or else you can also complement the headline as visible in this example.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.795
Now, next is to use the rule of three in copywriting.

00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:53.225
What does this rule of three?

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:57.425
Try to highlight the three main steps in content,

00:09:57.425 --> 00:09:59.854
like showing three testimonials on the homepage,

00:09:59.854 --> 00:10:04.385
three examples for some concept or three main sections in a blog post.

00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:07.790
You could have easily gone with five steps or seven steps.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.830
But I want you to focus on the rule of

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.535
three because the convent appears like knowledgable,

00:10:13.535 --> 00:10:16.550
well-being, both simple and catchy.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.520
It is very easy to digest for visitors.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.460
There is some magic about the number 3.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.589
Yes, yes, yes.

00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:29.705
That's why I had divided the website cation process into three steps.

00:10:29.705 --> 00:10:33.990
Now you know my secret of writing scripts.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.975
Next is to follow a good structure for the web copy.

00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:41.690
If the content is one long point,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:46.460
break it down into subheadings to make it easy to read and logical to understand.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.265
Next is to write like you talk.

00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:52.565
It may not be completely applicable in a website copy,

00:10:52.565 --> 00:10:55.715
but try to use this hack in the email newsletters,

00:10:55.715 --> 00:10:58.640
blog post and social media post.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.565
Next is to use short sentences.

00:11:01.565 --> 00:11:02.480
Yes.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.610
Keep them as short as possible and apply the slippery slide concept.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:13.355
It will help the visitor to read more as short sentences are easy to read and understand.

00:11:13.355 --> 00:11:16.880
Next tag is to write for one person.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.670
Don't write content in a generic tone,

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.920
write it in a personalized tone as if you are talking to that specific reader.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.685
Next is to use active voice in copywriting.

00:11:28.685 --> 00:11:32.720
You will have to get back to the English grammar book if you have forgotten the concept

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.680
of active voice that you learned in fourth or sixth grade of schooling.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.195
But using active voice is very helpful in cooperating.

00:11:41.195 --> 00:11:44.720
Next is not to use big words,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.405
because if the words are hard to read,

00:11:47.405 --> 00:11:49.280
the visitor will not read it.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.070
Next is to write for schema's.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:56.150
Yes, the people don't read content online, they skim.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:01.280
So use lots of subheadings and break the bigger content into smaller chunks and

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:07.130
sections and always make use of the final takeaway lines.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:11.540
Now, the last thing I want to tell you in this video is that you have to

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.979
write not only for the visitors but also for the search engines.

00:12:15.979 --> 00:12:19.340
So always try to integrate the target keywords naturally

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.640
into the content so that your website gets high-ranking,

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.924
thereby leading to more traffic and sales.

00:12:25.924 --> 00:12:29.735
Here, we have completed the copywriting listen Part 1,

00:12:29.735 --> 00:12:31.610
and we have the part two as well.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.945
Stay tuned as we have to learn a bit more about the copywriting process.

00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:38.340
See you in the next video.
