00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.535
Let me tell you a fact.

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:05.580
People don't visit websites for the design.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.130
They visit websites for the content.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.980
But it is important to present the content in

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.140
a useful manner to engage the visitor and compel him to take actions.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.930
So website designing is all about making

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.710
the content look easy and attractive to the visited.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.815
We know that the header and the footer is going to be the same for all it is.

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:31.820
And we have to design the main content area for every web page.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.500
And to please the content,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.695
we use sections and columns in other page.

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:42.605
The arrangement of content in these sections and columns can be done in numerous ways.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:47.510
So let us discuss some effective website layouts in this lesson.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.585
The first one, a single column layout.

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:52.670
It presents the main content in

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.275
a single vertical column surrounded by plentiful whitespace.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:00.500
The schooling experiences smooth in this layout and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.950
you can use crisp and clear images in a large size.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.590
This layout is very comfortable for the visitors and it works well on all their devices.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.160
It is recommended to use this layout and personal blog,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.850
minimalist designs and mobile friendly designs.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.700
Next is two column layout.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.095
It is formed by dividing the section into two vertical columns.

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:27.785
The width of the columns can be split in desire to issue.

00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:31.250
It is recommended for pages that have two main pieces of

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.195
content that share an equal level of importance.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.910
What else you can place takes on one side with

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.390
an image on the other side to explain the content better.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.610
Next is a creative one.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.935
It is the asymmetrical layout.

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:51.665
It means to distribute content of different sizes unevenly throughout the page.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:55.190
It is recommended to use on websites that have

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.045
a wide variety of visual elements and content types,

00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:01.820
you might need to have several small items on

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.345
one side to balance a large object on the other side.

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:08.990
But be very careful in using this layout as you will have to

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.175
strike that right balance between the larger sections and the smaller ones.

00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:15.860
But once done, it looks very good.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.595
Also, you need to use elements with high color contrast

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:23.390
to add visual weight to specific parts of the design.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.510
Next is a fixed sidebar layout.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.630
In this layout, the sticky side bar containing

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.905
the Navigation Menu stays in the same position on every web page,

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:36.620
remains visible every time they use it,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.245
browse our schools down the page.

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:42.770
Next is full-screen media layout.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.855
It essentially means using a background video as the hero image.

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:52.715
It provides a very rich user experience and the impact is very high.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:58.940
It increases the visitors curiosity to scroll down and find out more about the business.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.220
Next is grid layout.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.580
A grid of cards layout is good for content

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.305
heavy sides that display lot of items with equal heirarchy.

00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:13.265
It is recommended for an organized looking archive page,

00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:16.970
Media Gallery, or a blog with a clean layout.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.415
Next is box layout.

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:23.165
This type of layout is often used on the homepage.

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:27.215
Here, the hero section is a large, full-width box,

00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:33.530
having image or video as the background and followed by smaller boxes directly below it.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.555
Ideally, the number of these small boxes should range between two to five.

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:42.830
It is an evergreen website layout and the elements guide the visitor

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.240
to more details and explanations by clicking on the boxes.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.910
These were the common type of Leodes and now let me quickly tell you some best practices

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.880
to attain some specific objectives while organizing the content in any of these Leodes.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.280
Many a times, you will need to make a section stand out from the rest of the content.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.955
Lake.

00:04:04.955 --> 00:04:08.540
You need to highlight the call-to-action button on the landing page.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.330
So you must use the whitespace.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.505
In fact, plenty of white space to make it stand out and highlight.

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:18.830
Because by removing distractions,

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.435
you can force the visitor to focus only on what is immediately visible.

00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:25.730
This is one very important thing.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.945
Do muster using the whitespace efficiently.

00:04:29.945 --> 00:04:32.915
Next is to play with size.

00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:36.455
Generally, people read bigger things first,

00:04:36.455 --> 00:04:41.030
proper hierarchy clarifies for the visitors the order of importance of

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.030
the elements and size is the easiest way to create a hierarchy between elements.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.920
If you wish to create an easy to scan layout for a content heavy page that

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.545
requires displaying all primary items with equal heirarchy apply the grid system.

00:04:57.545 --> 00:05:00.080
Grids can vary in size,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.540
spacing, and the number of columns.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.305
For example, let us have a look at the YouTube grid system.

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:10.205
It is very well organized and contains four columns.

00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:13.520
Another important practice is to keep the important

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.530
call-to-action or submission forms at the top or at the bottom of the webpage.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.854
As the westerners tend to remember,

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:23.705
the first and the last items better.

00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:26.480
The final factors I want to tell you in

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.305
this lesson is to divide the content into small chunks.

00:05:30.305 --> 00:05:34.190
Never show a big content all in just one block.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.665
Tried to divide it into smaller sections as it is easy to digest for the visitor.

00:05:39.665 --> 00:05:43.100
Easy, easy, and easy.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.770
Everything should be very easy and attractive for the visitor on the website.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.785
In fact, if you ask me to delete all the website designing concepts in two words,

00:05:54.785 --> 00:06:00.935
I would just say understand your audience well and make things easy for them.

00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:02.180
That's it.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.950
And I hope I am making the things easier for you to learn.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.350
Very good going till here.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.940
See you in the next video.
