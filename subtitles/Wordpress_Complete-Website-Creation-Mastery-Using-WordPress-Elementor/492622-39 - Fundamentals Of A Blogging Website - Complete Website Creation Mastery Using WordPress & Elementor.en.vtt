00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.070
So do you really want to become a successful blogger?

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.660
There isn't a personal blog that you want to write or is

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.935
it to support the business website or e-commerce store?

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:16.635
Whatever be the purpose.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.370
The concepts we're going to learn in this lesson are applicable to

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.455
both a dedicated blogging website or a blog to support the business website.

00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:29.765
Usually, we create a blog to provide fresh,

00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:34.100
unique, informational and engaging content to their visitors.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.105
Since the content we publish on a business website is static and not changing,

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:46.190
we need to have a blog section on the website to keep providing

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.895
the updating content so that the visitor is

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:54.665
tempted to visit the website again and again for the new information,

00:00:54.665 --> 00:01:01.790
a blog is a very good source of traffic and the repeat visitors on the website.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.735
So make sure you follow the concepts to set up a blog to support the business website,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.635
or set up a dedicated blogging website.

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:18.140
You can easily set up a blog by just following a few simple steps.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.010
Since you now already know the steps to buy a domain name,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.890
buying a hosting plan and installing WordPress.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.129
You also know how to install the themes and plugins.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:31.385
And themes and plugins are of use to you.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:36.080
Now, you have to just select the Add New boast option here,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.605
give a title to the blog post and start writing.

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:40.970
That's it.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.400
We haven't been learning more about the

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.920
blog archive page design and single post design in the upcoming videos.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.450
And in this video,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.795
let me tell you some fundamental concepts of becoming a successful blogger.

00:01:56.795 --> 00:02:02.090
The first step is to select the right topics for the block.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.325
It all starts with the topic research in your industry are niche.

00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:12.260
For this, I recommend you to stay updated on social media and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.885
make use of tools like Google drinks or exploring topics.

00:02:17.885 --> 00:02:23.030
You can also stay updated with Reddit or Cora to come

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.980
up with the latest consumer discussions, impressed and questions.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.490
You can also use tools like BuzzSumo to come up with a trending topics.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.594
By the way, what does a blog post?

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:41.735
A blog post is usually the long form of content.

00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:45.815
And there is a golden rule in the digital marketing industry that

00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:49.655
good content and great visuals together build

00:02:49.655 --> 00:02:55.175
a great long form post that is engaging for the visitor.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.760
So to write an epic blog post,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.980
you have to provide informative content that is valuable for the reader on

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.160
a page that is beautifully designed using the right colors, forms, and spacing.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.730
You can also include a table of contents to ease up

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.885
the navigation process and make a deliberate use of radios,

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:22.715
data visuals, and infographics to engage the visitors.

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:26.930
However, the biggest question for everyone who wants to get

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.240
started with blogging is how to make money with a blog.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.480
There can be multiple sources of revenue.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.120
But if I tell you that two primary ways to make money than these are number one,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.170
the ads and number two, the affiliate marketing.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.165
Ads are generally the banner advertisements that are shown on the blog post.

00:03:50.165 --> 00:03:55.115
And you can register for Google AdSense to show these ads on your blog.

00:03:55.115 --> 00:04:00.335
You can earn money either through CPC, that is cost-per-click.

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:05.270
It means you get paid for every click on the ad on your blog post.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.045
And the other one is CPM,

00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:11.075
that is cost per 1000 impressions.

00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:14.854
Here, for every 1000 impressions of the banner,

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:17.390
you will get paid a certain amount.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.029
Next is very powerful line or does the affiliate marketing?

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:28.580
It is the process of earning a commission by promoting other people's products.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.760
Just like you must have seen bloggers promoting

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.850
hosting services like Blue Host n-side grown,

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.260
and they provide you a link to buy the hosting plan.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.655
When a reader clicks on that link and buy the servers,

00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:48.195
the blogger gets a commission from the hosting company.

00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:53.305
So you can promote the products through text and adding

00:04:53.305 --> 00:04:57.790
a unique trackable link that is provided to you for the product.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.375
If a buyer clicks on the link and buy the product,

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:03.310
you will earn a commission.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.840
That is a very powerful source of making a very good income,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.780
as it is very exciting process to educate the customer and promote the product.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.560
It is a win-win situation for all the three people involved.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.230
Like you get an opportunity to create

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.790
quality content and educate the buyer about the most valuable products.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.365
The buyer gets complete information about the features and useful details.

00:05:29.365 --> 00:05:31.485
Comparison at a single page.

00:05:31.485 --> 00:05:35.780
If the buyer clicks on the link and complete the purchase,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.520
the company gets revenue.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.815
And so in return for your efforts,

00:05:39.815 --> 00:05:42.080
they pay you a commission.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.225
Trust me, it is a very powerful source of income and you can

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:52.280
promote products on your blog very easily by sharing quality content,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.665
educating the visitors, and providing links in the form of text and banners.

00:05:57.665 --> 00:06:00.260
In order to earn money via blogging,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.885
you need traffic on the website.

00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:05.465
So how to get traffic?

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:09.840
This is $1 million question.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.085
Let us discuss some ways to get more visitors to the blog.

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:20.330
The simple way to make sure that people visit your blog is to

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.205
make sure that they are aware that your blog exists.

00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:28.880
You can promote your blog on social media or via

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.105
paid ads on search engines and social media,

00:06:32.105 --> 00:06:36.395
or optimized the blog for searching and rankings and some other ways.

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:38.600
Let us start with social media.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.060
Social media interaction is important.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.630
You get an easy access to millions of people who in

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.710
turn may shared her blog post with their friends and family.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.010
All you need is to share quality content that is useful

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.355
for the readers and provide value to that knowledge.

00:06:55.355 --> 00:06:56.630
Ang time.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.395
Also, since you want them to know about you,

00:07:00.395 --> 00:07:03.680
you can make it easy to share your blog by placing

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.565
relevant social media share buttons on the blog post.

00:07:07.565 --> 00:07:09.230
That is a trick here.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.780
It is seen that blog post

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.960
between 100 to 2 thousand words gets the highest shared on social media.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.030
If you see it other ways,

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.620
this can be validated because

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.764
the more valuable and informative content you provide to the visitor,

00:07:26.764 --> 00:07:32.240
the better you will be engaged and encouraged to share the content.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.980
So tried to publish long-form blog post.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.190
You can also comment on related blogs.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.835
The key to this strategy is to make sure that

00:07:43.835 --> 00:07:47.870
your comment actually add something of value to the post.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.765
It works well when you're just getting started.

00:07:50.765 --> 00:07:54.980
And even the fewest of traffic is of value to you.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.530
Next are the paid ads.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.200
Paid ads are not the cheapest of methods,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.780
but sometimes it is the most straightforward way to get the initial traffic.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.080
Start running paid ads and make sure that people see

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.025
your blog when they search for certain terms and browse certain topics,

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:17.990
and don't forget to build the e-mail list by placing a subscriber form on the blog,

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.310
you will always want that repeat visitors on the blog.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:27.350
Email marketing campaigns can be a consistent reminder of your blog.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.480
Simply prepared a newsletter,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.280
send it out to the subscribers,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.545
and soon you will see a great increase in the number of repeat visitors.

00:08:37.545 --> 00:08:41.725
Now, you must be wondering how important is

00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:45.970
SEO or search engine optimization to get traffic.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:52.915
Yes, that is the most valuable source of traffic for a blog.

00:08:52.915 --> 00:08:55.735
So what is SEO?

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:59.740
It is the science of making sure that your content is visible

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.600
first on a search engine results page and via CEO.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.675
Because people tend to choose the top results,

00:09:07.675 --> 00:09:09.295
the higher you are,

00:09:09.295 --> 00:09:13.075
the more likely they will click on the link to your blog.

00:09:13.075 --> 00:09:15.490
And if you want to know how many people are

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.340
searching for the keywords related to your blog.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.920
Create a free Google Ads account to Keyword Planner and

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.165
explored the keyword search volume across the different countries.

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:29.420
This will give you a better idea about

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.920
the search volume and the probable traffic that you can get on the blog.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.305
And if I tell you some simple tips to optimize the blog for SEO,

00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:42.154
it will start with the keyword search only.

00:09:42.154 --> 00:09:45.080
You have to come up with a list of keywords that people are

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.160
searching related to the topic of the blog post you are writing.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.750
You can also come up with the list of high volume and potential keywords in

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:59.615
your niche on industry and write a blog post related to those topics.

00:09:59.615 --> 00:10:05.255
You have to make sure that you use these keywords in the content,

00:10:05.255 --> 00:10:07.430
in the headings, in the paragraphs,

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.860
and use it in the natural v.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.470
Du include the primary keyword in

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.825
the post title and in the first few lines of the content body.

00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:24.485
Also use related keywords and do not try to do keyword stuffing.

00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:28.220
Keep only the appropriate keyword density.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:33.755
You can also use LSA terms in the content to make it more relevant.

00:10:33.755 --> 00:10:38.390
Next is to optimize the Meta titles and Meta descriptions.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.270
These are the titles and descriptions that a visitor

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.705
sees on the search engine results speech.

00:10:44.705 --> 00:10:47.090
You need to make sure that you include

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.930
the primary keyword in the title and in the description.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.070
Here, you need to explain what your blog is about and

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.540
make it look attractive and valuable to the reader so that DEA,

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.670
tempted to click on it.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.490
You can easily assign the Meta titles and

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:09.305
Meta descriptions using the used SEO plugin for WordPress.

00:11:09.305 --> 00:11:16.685
You will find the settings for Yoast SEO on every blog post or webpage.

00:11:16.685 --> 00:11:23.090
Next, very important factor for blog SEO is the user experience.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:27.920
It is affected by several factors like the design and layout of the blog,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.910
navigation, loading speed, and responsiveness.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:36.140
Next factor is to analyze the competitors and keep a check at

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.790
the top ranking competitors and tried to understand what they are doing better,

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.900
you can get inspiration and ideas from the competitors.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:51.905
The last universal factor to success in the blogging is to deliver value.

00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:54.350
Whatever content you publish,

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.870
either on the website or the blog,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:03.380
it should deliver value visitor that is the eternal but to success.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.530
And you can also repurpose the content,

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.665
like if you have a distinct popular blog post,

00:12:09.665 --> 00:12:13.745
you can transform it to a YouTube video or a podcast episode,

00:12:13.745 --> 00:12:16.775
or presentation or info-graphics.

00:12:16.775 --> 00:12:22.295
Because it is validated that the topic and the content resonates well with the people.

00:12:22.295 --> 00:12:23.990
One more thing here,

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.560
you can share your blog post on Reddit and Quora as

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.600
world and try to make use of social media as much as you can.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.215
So that's it to learn in this lesson,

00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:41.370
and we will continue with more block settings in the next video.
