00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
Now, let us start creating the website from scratch and let us create the first webpage,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.455
hovered over the pages option and click on Add New Page.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:15.090
You can get rid of this popup by clicking anywhere in the open space.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.960
One important thing I would like to tell you is start the process of

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.400
adding pages and post is almost the same.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.055
So if you want to create a blog post,

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:29.790
you will have to simply select the Add Post option from here.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.095
But the rest of the process will be seen like reading a web page.

00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:39.485
Now, let us see the settings that we get by creating webpage.

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:42.515
Here at the top, you have the option to provide

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:45.965
title to the page like Home About Us products,

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:48.905
services, conductors, privacy policy.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:54.665
This title is important for users to recognize the information of label on this webpage.

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:57.635
Since we're just getting started with a website,

00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:00.350
let us create the most important webpage or

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.555
the default page that we call as the homepage in the title,

00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:08.090
let me type in home.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.395
Next.

00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:13.895
On the right, you will find several settings and options.

00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:17.555
Some settings and options are WordPress default,

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:21.080
and a few settings are added based on

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.980
the team or some plugins that we're using on the website.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.540
And let me tell you that we are using as thrity theme in this course.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.940
If I minimize all the categories,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.795
then you will get a clear look of all the options that are available.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:39.455
So we can manage the status and visibility here.

00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:44.465
But mulling featured emerge discussion page attributes and a team settings.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:45.725
For this page.

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:48.544
Let us see the options one-by-one.

00:01:48.544 --> 00:01:51.770
The status and visibility option allows to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.505
hide the page or locked up beach with a password.

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:59.330
If you wish to showed you the publishing of a page or a post,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.270
you can assign the date and time and the page or

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.559
post will be automatically published on schedule.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:09.500
Next, under the permalink settings,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.210
you can manage the slug of the URL Hall, right?

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.250
So what is a slug?

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.420
A slug is usually the title of the page or

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.910
post that is optimized for the better understanding of the visitor.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.705
It is the extension that is pleased after the domain name in the URL.

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:36.484
And if you wish to make any changes to the slug,

00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:40.235
you can edit it here from the permalink settings.

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:45.305
Don't get confused with the previous permalink settings that I told you.

00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:49.850
This permalink sitting over here for this page is to

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.145
edit the structure of the URL for this specific page only.

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:59.675
All right, The next option is to add a featured image.

00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:02.480
It is very useful for a blog post and acts

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.720
like a thumbnail image for the post on the archive page,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.860
and it is also displayed at the top of the single post page.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.260
Next, you can allow or disallow the comments under the discussion option.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.620
Next, you can use some layout or template for the page using the page attribute options.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.440
Here, you can also assign the parent category to

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.205
a page that is useful in optimizing the URL structure.

00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:30.875
It is a very useful feature,

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:33.965
commonly used in e-commerce websites to clearly show

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:38.059
that category and subcategory in the URLs itself.

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:42.605
Lastly, you have the team settings for the page.

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:47.990
Here in Astra, you have the options to show or hide the sidebar of the page.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.850
It just the content layout,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.100
enable or disable the header,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.500
page title, featured image and footer for the page or post.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.480
The other theme options like transparent header should be a distinct from the customizer.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.415
So we can skip it here.

00:04:04.415 --> 00:04:06.845
Once you are done with the settings,

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.330
you can click on Publish,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.950
and again click on Publish,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.145
and that's it, the pages created.

00:04:13.145 --> 00:04:17.225
If you want to disable this double-check for publishing,

00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:19.430
you can uncheck this option here.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.575
Now to edit this page,

00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:25.565
we are provided with a default block editor by WordPress.

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:30.365
And this is the editing mode to design a page or post.

00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:35.165
But we will be editing the page using Elementor,

00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:39.080
which is the world's most advanced page builder.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.315
Creating web pages using Elementor is a very exciting task

00:04:44.315 --> 00:04:49.070
and we will be learning about the basics of using Elementor in the next lesson.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.850
See you there.
