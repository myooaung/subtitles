00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.305
In this video, let us learn the step-by-step process to write

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:09.630
a high converting website copy for the homepage About Page,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.915
service and product page and contact page.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:16.590
It is very exciting to convert the blank page into

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.010
a highly converting content that generates leads subscribers and sales.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.945
The process starts with identifying the websites most important objective,

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:30.300
because we always create a website for

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.590
a specific purpose to get clarity on the purpose of the website,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.490
tried to visualize your customer's journey and come up with a call to action.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.795
Like if you have a service business,

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:44.735
you will want the visitors to fill out the lead form.

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:48.155
If you have a product business with a short buying cycle,

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:50.809
you will be seeking a direct purchase.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.274
If you have a product business with a longer buying cycle,

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:57.500
you might focus on email sign-ups so that you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.220
can engage leads in an e-mail nurturing process.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.390
Objectives can vary, but try to identify the van

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.190
single primary objective on the website of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.675
her goal should be to get visitors from arrival to action

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:19.790
as quickly as possible and in the most linear way possible.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.290
In order to do this,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.015
we want to minimize the number of pages involved in the customer journey.

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:31.175
So you will have three options to decide how to use the homepage.

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:35.180
Number one, if you offer a single product or service,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.725
you can use the homepage as the landing page for that product or service.

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:44.570
Number 2, if the primary website objective is email sign-ups,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.350
use the upside down homepage strategy.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.865
Number 3.

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:52.895
If the primary objective is anything else,

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:56.195
use the homepage as a brand building page.

00:01:56.195 --> 00:02:03.935
Let us learn what exactly is an upside down homepage strategy and a brand-building page?

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:07.685
The upside down homepage asks for the visitors

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:11.420
email at the top of the page rather than at the bottom.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.095
The structure could be like the hero section,

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:17.855
including a form for email sign-up.

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:21.245
Below the hero section shows some social proof.

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:26.225
If a label then tell a brand story that solves some problem.

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:30.845
And again, you can ask for the e-mail address in exchange for the solution resource.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:34.790
In this way, you can get maximum email sign-ups on

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.840
the homepage using the upside down homepage strategy.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.615
Next is a brand-building page.

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:43.804
It is a classic homepage.

00:02:43.804 --> 00:02:47.630
Here, you should not try to sell the products or service.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.960
Instead, tried to build a brand perception and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.190
then take them for the specific product or service pages.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.915
To build a brand,

00:02:56.915 --> 00:03:00.530
you have to write the brand value proposition that

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.090
tells via business exist and what is the core identity.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.620
Then you have to write the short brand story to describe the challenges or

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.150
problems that your brand wishes to solve and tell them how it is solved.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.985
Finally, show the visitors some proof to build credibility for the brand.

00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:22.880
After this, you can redirect the visitor to

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.485
the specific product or service page to take specific actions.

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:32.480
Also make sure you have enough call to actions in the web copy.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.205
This is how you can write content for our homepage.

00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:40.925
Now, let us see how to write

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:43.925
an About page and about pages

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:48.380
always there in the website because people expect it to be available.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.760
A large segment of visitors may even put off the idea of buying the service

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.175
from you if they did not find the about page on your website.

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:02.030
Visitors generally visit the About page to verify

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.005
whether the brand or person is genuine or not.

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:09.725
Also, they want to connect well by knowing the vision,

00:04:09.725 --> 00:04:13.025
mission, purpose, or the business background.

00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:15.590
And sometimes if they don't understand

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.725
your brand story at the homepage and want to know more.

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.945
They will visit the About page.

00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:25.340
For more specialized websites like a B2B website,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.915
they want to check whether you have the experienced background or naught or

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:34.970
heavy von any awards or certifications to make you stand out from the competition.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.790
While writing content for the About page.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.165
Always talked to establish credibility.

00:04:41.165 --> 00:04:45.815
Talk about what you have achieved and who you have worked with.

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:50.540
You can also start with the vision and mission before starting the brand story,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.405
you can always be honest and straightforward as visitors prefer clarity.

00:04:56.405 --> 00:05:00.665
And finally, conclude the About page with a CDA.

00:05:00.665 --> 00:05:05.885
Now, let us see how to write for the services page.

00:05:05.885 --> 00:05:07.985
Instead of a service page,

00:05:07.985 --> 00:05:10.520
we can consider this to be the landing page or

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.045
the sales page where we can provide an offer to the visitor.

00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:16.475
If you have multiple products or service,

00:05:16.475 --> 00:05:19.815
you can create separate pages for all of them.

00:05:19.815 --> 00:05:22.135
Talking about the content,

00:05:22.135 --> 00:05:26.545
you can start with the value proposition for the specific product or service.

00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:28.195
In order to do this,

00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:29.800
clearly defined the offer,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.765
specify who it is for,

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:33.760
and differentiate the value.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.760
After this, you need to explain the benefits of

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.035
your solution and then explain how you actually solve the problem.

00:05:41.035 --> 00:05:45.100
Here also provide as much proof as possible.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.935
Also tried to push visitors to contact you at every opportunity.

00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:54.070
Tried to include a CTA at any point on your page

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.370
where the reader might be in a mental position to click.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.870
You can design CTA buttons to scroll that the reader down to

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.700
n On page contact form instead of redirecting to a separate page.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.740
And if you are writing content for the product page in an e-commerce website,

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.850
then you must include the product images, product details,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.065
Add to Cart button,

00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:21.530
product description, product or brand history.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.550
You might also like section and the review section.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.965
Next, let us learn to write the web copy for a contact page.

00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:34.370
This is probably the simplest page of a website

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.715
as the visitor has already made up the mind to contact you.

00:06:37.715 --> 00:06:39.995
But if you want more leads,

00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:42.800
simply keep all the content above the fold.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.020
Leading to minimum scrolling.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.310
Include a short invitation addressing people to contact you.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.695
Provide as many options of labeled for a visitor to contact you like an inquiry form,

00:06:54.695 --> 00:06:57.635
email address, phone call, or Skype.

00:06:57.635 --> 00:07:01.430
Let us also learn how to write for a landing page.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.545
The sole objective of a landing page is to make the visitor data desired action,

00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:08.735
like signing up for a newsletter,

00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:10.130
starting a free trial,

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.945
or downloading an e-book.

00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:15.350
This can be any specific action.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.210
So on the landing page,

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.845
start with the headline that clearly shows the benefits for D will get,

00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:23.705
buy the product or service.

00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:28.910
Also have the social proof in the hero section itself, above the fold.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.945
Use whatever the most credible proof you have,

00:07:32.945 --> 00:07:37.235
like the places where you are featured or number of customers,

00:07:37.235 --> 00:07:40.910
or the names of big lines or whatsoever it is.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.140
But tried to include as much proof as possible.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.624
Then the main content area should follow the structure like problem,

00:07:49.624 --> 00:07:52.355
agitate, and solve formula.

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:55.475
Start with the customer's pain, point out problems.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:08:00.830
Then highlight how annoying the problem is and then tease them with the solution.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.480
After this section, you can come up with the transition section.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.200
It is that transition from the problem to the solution.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.815
But when an offer and do place the CTA here

00:08:12.815 --> 00:08:16.655
for the visitor to take action because if the visitor is convinced,

00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:20.825
you need to tell him how to get started or what to do next.

00:08:20.825 --> 00:08:22.250
That's it.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.980
To write content for a blog post,

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.045
you can start with writing and ultra specific headline.

00:08:29.045 --> 00:08:33.860
It gives clarity to the visitor what exactly is going to know in the post.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.380
The more specific you write the headline,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.360
the more clicks you will receive.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.600
Then start the paragraph with a shorter intro of not more than some eight lanes.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.175
In brochure prove that you can deliver on the headline from us.

00:08:49.175 --> 00:08:52.160
And also give a preview of what all they're going to

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.264
know coming into the main content area.

00:08:55.264 --> 00:08:58.085
The post should include actionable tips,

00:08:58.085 --> 00:09:02.195
techniques, and strategies that people can use right away.

00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:06.290
This can include content in the expanded list form,

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.585
case-study list of tools,

00:09:08.585 --> 00:09:12.575
the ultimate guide or the complete list Geyte.

00:09:12.575 --> 00:09:17.915
Use lots of examples to make the content easy to understand.

00:09:17.915 --> 00:09:21.740
And finally, give your visitors is CTA to take action.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.655
You can place some social proof for additional encouragement.

00:09:25.655 --> 00:09:26.870
That's it.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.500
So the copywriting lessons were a bit long,

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.460
but they are worthy because good copywriting is going to bring leads,

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.730
conversions, and sales for the website.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:43.110
We will end this lesson here and continue with graphic designing in the next video.
