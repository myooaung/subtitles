00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
We are using the Elementor budgets to develop

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.445
the webpages as per the design that we have created in the designing tool.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:14.055
It is an easy and powerful process to develop without any coding.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.725
Now, let us learn the usage,

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:20.970
often widgets every label under the general category.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.230
These budgets are actually just an extension of the basic widgets.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.495
Combining the different widgets into a common budget

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:33.155
to speed up the process of developing the webpage.

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:34.715
And along with that,

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:38.795
there are some more creative budgets as well in this section,

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:41.330
let us learn them one by one.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.365
The first visit of label here is the image box.

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:51.590
It is used to add an image box that combines an image with a headline and text,

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.585
which is often used in the feature section of the website.

00:00:56.585 --> 00:01:02.330
Simply chosen emerge into the title and description and you get the same set of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.790
settings like an image heading and description that we learned in the last video.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.590
Similar to the image box,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.294
we have the next widget called as the icon box.

00:01:15.294 --> 00:01:19.735
It is also commonly used to create the features section.

00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:22.150
It has all the same settings.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.415
Just you can use an icon instead of an image from the icon library or

00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:33.175
uploading custom SVG and adjust using the same set of settings.

00:01:33.175 --> 00:01:37.555
I'm not repeating that common settings again and again.

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:42.550
I hope you are clear how to use the settings for the widgets.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.435
Next visit is to add star rating.

00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:48.370
Now using this widget,

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.720
you can assign star ratings on the webpage.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.585
It can be used along with the testimonials and reviews.

00:01:56.585 --> 00:02:02.900
You can customize the star icon and a label for size, color, and topography.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.710
The content tab has settings related to the stars.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.815
The first option is to select the rating scale between 0 to five or 0 to ten.

00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:14.825
In the next option,

00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:18.530
you can assign value based on the scale.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.119
In the next option you can select the two versions of star icon.

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:27.484
One is via font-awesome and the other one from Unicode.

00:02:27.484 --> 00:02:29.720
Choose the one that you like.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.374
Next, you can select the unmarked style from solid to outline.

00:02:35.374 --> 00:02:38.990
You can even add a title before the star rating like

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.635
this and adjust the alignment by selecting left,

00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:45.920
center, right, or justified.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.110
Under the style tab,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.510
you can adjust the topography and color settings of title and start.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.990
Feel free to explore the remaining settings.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.904
It contains almost the same set of settings.

00:03:00.904 --> 00:03:05.495
Next wizard is to add image, get acyl.

00:03:05.495 --> 00:03:12.605
It helps in creating sliding image galleries to the page under the content tab.

00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:15.740
The first setting is related to image carousel.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.850
You can select multiple images by clicking on the plus icon.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.490
You can adjust the image size.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.385
And the next option is important.

00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:31.325
You can select how many images to show at a time and how many images to scroll.

00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:37.115
For example, if you selected three images to show and one image to slide,

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:39.350
it will look like this.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.560
And don't forget, you have to optimize

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.300
the settings for the mobile device and tablet as well.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.720
Then that is an option to stretch the image in

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.365
case the dimensions of the image are not in order.

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:56.840

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.030
you can select the arrows and dots.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.000
Only arrows are only dots.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.185
If you want to display the images in Lightbox Mode,

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:12.905

Then there are standard settings for caption,

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:03.440

The advanced settings contain the similar set of options for the colossal widget.

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:10.535

Setting options.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.329

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.510
The next widget is to add icon list.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.990
It is used to create an easy to manage list of

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.270
items with each item highlighted by its own icon.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.425
Let us start with settings under the content tab.

00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:48.110

Next visit is counted.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.385
If it is a cool one,

00:06:28.385 --> 00:06:33.425
it is used to add any metered numbered counter to the webpage.

00:06:33.425 --> 00:06:35.075
Under the content tab,

00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:37.325

You can also assign a title,

00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:02.750

The advanced settings are the same.

00:07:57.155 --> 00:08:01.610
Next widget is to add testimonial sections.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.135
It makes your task easy by combining the content

00:08:05.135 --> 00:08:09.275

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.250
The first setting under the content tab is for testimonials.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.235
You can write the testimonial content and

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:25.055

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.685
Next video is to insert tabs.

00:08:52.685 --> 00:08:56.015
It helps in dividing the content into tabs,

00:08:56.015 --> 00:08:59.345
either horizontally or vertically.

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:01.520
Under the content tab,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.680
we have settings for the tabs.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.480
You can create a list of tabs that the option to copy and delete a tab.

it means you can assign specific settings for the active tab that a user is accessing.

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:44.555
Guarantee. The advanced settings are the same.

00:09:44.555 --> 00:09:49.685
The next two budgets are almost common with the same purpose,

00:09:49.685 --> 00:09:52.640
but with a slight difference in their functioning.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.745
These are accordion and toggle.

00:09:55.745 --> 00:10:00.455
The accordion widget is used to display text in a collapsed,

00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:04.580
condensed manner and helps in saving the space.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.215
With the accordion.

00:10:06.215 --> 00:10:09.710
Visitors can scan the item titles and choose

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.774
to expand an item only if it is off their interests.

00:10:13.774 --> 00:10:17.210
As we see in an FAQ section.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.660
If we see the settings for an accordion,

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.234
it contains the list of items with title and description.

00:10:25.234 --> 00:10:27.920
It also contains icons.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.610
You can make the active icon different here as well.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:37.520
You can also assign the HTML tags to the title from the SEO point of view.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.800
The style tab contains the settings for a guardian border, ankles,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.470
the topography and color settings for the title, description, and Eigen.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.935
The advanced settings are the same.

00:10:51.935 --> 00:10:56.720
Now, when we also insert that toggle widget,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.980
it serves the same purpose but with a little difference.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.170
Vetted that toggle widget,

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:10.325
a visitor can see as many items as desired and all can be expanded at the same time.

00:11:10.325 --> 00:11:12.995
However, with the accordion widget,

00:11:12.995 --> 00:11:16.490
only one item can be expanded at one time.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.250
As you expand another recording I term

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.045
the previously opened item automatically collapses.

00:11:23.045 --> 00:11:28.325
So that's the only difference between the accordion and the toggle reject.

00:11:28.325 --> 00:11:33.680
The settings for the toggle budget are the same as the accordion.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.580
Next wizard is to insert the social icons.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:43.025
It helps in adding icon links to your social media profiles.

00:11:43.025 --> 00:11:44.510
Under the content tab,

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.405
you can make changes to the social icons list.

00:11:47.405 --> 00:11:52.340
You can adjust the icon and link along with options to edit the colors.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:57.515
You can select from a range of shapes like a rounded, square and circle.

00:11:57.515 --> 00:11:59.840
If you wish to stack it in lines,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.200
you can choose the number of columns and choose the alignment.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.120
Under the style tab,

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.505
you can make changes for the color.

00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:09.725
There are two options to choose,

00:12:09.725 --> 00:12:12.725
the official color and the custom color.

00:12:12.725 --> 00:12:15.200
Well, both are frequently used in website

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.380
designing and you can choose as per your design scheme.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.360
When you select the custom color,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.945
you can adjust the primary colored and the secondary color.

00:12:23.945 --> 00:12:30.290
Next, you can manage the size of the social icons by adding spacing and rows gap,

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.960
you can insert a border as well.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.630
You can also assign an emission effect.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.045
Do the hover over the social icons.

00:12:38.045 --> 00:12:39.755
This is a cool one.

00:12:39.755 --> 00:12:46.400
The advanced settings are all the same for the social icons widget.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.780
Next wizard is to add alert box.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.345
Come on, everybody be alert.

00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:58.460
It enables you to display a colored alert box to draw attention to

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:04.085
some important message and it disappears after the visitor takes an action on it.

00:13:04.085 --> 00:13:06.140
There are different types of boxes,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.949
just with different background colors, nothing significant.

00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:13.460
You can add the title and description of your choice here,

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.405
the close button and to hide the alert is also optional.

00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:18.905
Under the style tab,

00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:23.315
you can make adjustments for the color and border and for title and description.

00:13:23.315 --> 00:13:26.300
The advanced settings are also the same.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.315
The next video it is SoundCloud.

00:13:29.315 --> 00:13:34.204
It embeds audio clips from SoundCloud to the website.

00:13:34.204 --> 00:13:36.200
You can enter the audio link,

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.655
choose the player display,

00:13:37.655 --> 00:13:42.155
enable disable the autoplay option by like, download,

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.390
share button comments, accounts,

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:48.090
username, and control the colors.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.345
The next one is short code widget.

00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:55.975
So what is a short code?

00:13:55.975 --> 00:14:02.440
Is short code basically is a special tag that we enter into a page on

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:10.555
WordPress that gets replaced with the assigned content when we view the live website.

00:14:10.555 --> 00:14:12.730
Let me tell you an example.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:18.895
If you have to embed a form created using third party plugin like WP forms,

00:14:18.895 --> 00:14:23.470
then you need to add the short code to embed it on the web page.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:31.005
Is short code is also used to embed APIs and visits like a Twitter widget on the webpage.

00:14:31.005 --> 00:14:35.554
It saves time and helps in adding specialized content.

00:14:35.554 --> 00:14:41.885
In an easy, we simply type the short code in a given field and click on Apply.

00:14:41.885 --> 00:14:44.750
Your content would appear on the website.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.270
The advanced settings are the same.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:51.710
The next widget is to add HTML code to the web page.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.350
Just like the inserted a short code,

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.405
you can add an HTML,

00:14:56.405 --> 00:15:02.015
CSS, shortcodes, or JavaScript on the web page using this widget.

00:15:02.015 --> 00:15:05.780
Like if you have the HTML code for a form,

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.995
you can insert it here to embed the form on the webpage.

00:15:09.995 --> 00:15:14.569
The advanced settings are also the same.

00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:17.750
Next is the menu anchor widget.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.400
It is used to create a page with internal scrolling navigation.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.570
It means that if a visitor clicks on certain element here will

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.635
be automatically scroll to the other elements on the same page.

00:15:30.635 --> 00:15:34.384
It is used for same page scroll navigation.

00:15:34.384 --> 00:15:36.035
The process is simple.

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:39.875
Simply insert the menu anchor wizard to the top of the section

00:15:39.875 --> 00:15:43.640
where you want to scroll the visitor. Give it a name.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:50.675
Now, edit that clickable element that will redirect on clicking in the URL field,

00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:52.025
enter the same name,

00:15:52.025 --> 00:15:55.025
but starting with a hashtag, that's it.

00:15:55.025 --> 00:16:00.995
The menu and get is created and the advanced settings are the same as usual.

00:16:00.995 --> 00:16:04.745
Next visit is to insert a sidebar.

00:16:04.745 --> 00:16:11.360
It helps in adding any of the teams sidebars that we might have created into the page.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.020
You will be able to edit the elements of a sidebar either by going

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.785
to the Theme Customizer or element or team-building.

00:16:18.785 --> 00:16:24.065
By the way, adding sidebars to a business website is very rare nowadays.

00:16:24.065 --> 00:16:27.935
It is just commonly used in the blogging websites.

00:16:27.935 --> 00:16:31.055
Finally, there is a read mode wizard,

00:16:31.055 --> 00:16:35.615
but you can skip it as it is not that useful.

00:16:35.615 --> 00:16:41.735
So you have learned about the application of general widgets as well.

00:16:41.735 --> 00:16:47.225
And this is what all the gate with the free Elementor plug-in.

00:16:47.225 --> 00:16:52.520
These widgets are quite powerful and V are able to develop the webpage based on

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:59.299
