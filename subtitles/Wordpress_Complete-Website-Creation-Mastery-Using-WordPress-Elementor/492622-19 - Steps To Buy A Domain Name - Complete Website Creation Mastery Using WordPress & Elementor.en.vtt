00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.335
Let us now see the step-by-step process to buy a domain name.

00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:07.980
There are so many domain registrars available and you can

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.375
proceed with registering the domain with any registrar of your choice.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:18.135
However, some key factors to consider while selecting a domain registrar could be,

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:21.285
number one, the repetition of the domain that just rough.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:24.405
Number 2, the ease of purchase process.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:29.430
Number 3, the dashboard interface number for the TLD availability.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.040
And number 5 is pricing.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.035
I have kept surprising as the last factor because normally

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:42.260
the pricing difference is never too much between the different domain registrars.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.750
And although there is nothing much to compare between the different domain registrars,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.935
I personally recommend you to purchase a domain either from Google domains.

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:52.585
Good idea, named cheap.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:57.789
I personally prefer Google domains to purchase domains for myself and my Klein's.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.975
The reasons to prefer Google domains are the ease of use,

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:05.155
clean navigation menu, the reputation of the Registrar,

00:01:05.155 --> 00:01:07.060
and fixed pricing model.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.085
Another advantage is that Google domains provide free privacy protection,

00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:16.705
whereas GoDaddy provides it as an add-on and charges a small fee for it.

00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:23.545
Also, I can integrate the domain name easily with other Google services like the G Suite.

00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:27.785
In fact, the only significant difference between Google domains,

00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:31.775
GoDaddy and Name Cheap is the fixed pricing model.

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:37.175
Godaddy and named cheap offer discount deals on the first purchase of domain.

00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:39.980
But the renewal charges are somewhat higher.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.710
On the other hand, Google domains charge

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.885
a fixed price for the first purchase and also for the renewables are hit.

00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:51.245
So it is up to you to decide whether you want

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:54.605
a first purchase discount on GoDaddy or name cheap,

00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:57.800
and then pay a slightly higher fee on renewal years.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.945
Or you want to pay a fixed price Gately if you're registering the domain for one year,

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:04.550
and if you plug two,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.590
registered the domain name for say,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.240
five years or 10 years,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.425
please compare the price difference before taking the final decision.

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:14.779
There is one more difference.

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:20.059
If you want to buy a premium domain name that is usually available at a premium price,

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:22.490
then you must prefer GoDaddy because good ideas to

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.565
largest collection of premium domain names.

00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:29.300
Some domain names which are Magnus sold out,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.235
are also packed and available for purchase from resellers.

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:39.200
So if you have some preferred domain name which is being marked as sold,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.740
I recommend you to enter the domain and URL and do visit the site,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.595
wants to verify the availability of that domain name.

00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:51.290
Also, if you want to buy a domain at more economical prices,

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.840
then you can also explore hosting there.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.345
Some domains with extensions like dot tech or dot XYZ or dot site

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:04.925
out of level under rupees 100 or just one to $2 for a year at hosting it.

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:09.365
So if you wish to get a domain name for your practice website,

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:12.785
you can definitely buy one from hosting it.

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:16.745
If you're buying this domain for just a single year, it's fine.

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:19.280
But if you wish to renew the domain name,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.680
then do check the renewal pricing before purchase as there is a good play in it.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.535
Now, let us see the steps to buy a new domain name.

00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:30.395
Head onto Google domains,

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:33.770
or good idea named cheap by making a Google search.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.440
Let me take you to go Ready.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.720
Here on GoDaddy, simply enter

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.870
their desired name that you wish to purchase as your domain name.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.490
To check the availability.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.200
After clicking on search,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.285
you will get a list of domain names available in a variety of extensions like.com dot n,

00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:53.900
dot, dot, dot, dot, IU and mode.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.485
These extensions are called as TLBs.

00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:01.085
If the preferred.com is not available,

00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:04.115
you can choose from a variety of extensions.

00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:09.695
Feel free to explore and select a creative extension as it now works.

00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:14.510
Remember that three golden rules to select the right domain name for your website.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.220
Number one, try to choose the most relevant name that represents your business,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.980
brand, product, and service number to try to keep it as short as possible.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.615
Number 3, try to select a domain name that is very easy to remember.

00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:32.735
Once you have found a domain name of your choice,

00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:36.095
simply add the domain name to cart and proceed to checkout.

00:04:36.095 --> 00:04:40.460
The remaining process is as simple as placing an order on Amazon.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.600
You may be required to login or create a new account on GoDaddy.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.180
Simply enter the login credentials and you will be

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.390
offered some extra services along with your domain name,

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.879
which had basically the upsell services.

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.225
You can happily skip them and proceed to make the payment.

00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:58.130
Once the payment is made,

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.745
you will be able to access your domain name under the products lists.

00:05:01.745 --> 00:05:08.105
Congratulations, you have successfully registered a new domain name for your website.

00:05:08.105 --> 00:05:12.875

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:15.185
the processes almost the same.

00:05:15.185 --> 00:05:17.045
