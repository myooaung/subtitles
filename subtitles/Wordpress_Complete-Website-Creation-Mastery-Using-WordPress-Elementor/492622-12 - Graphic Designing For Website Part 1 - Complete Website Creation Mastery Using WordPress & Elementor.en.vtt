00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.365
Everyone is always excited for graphics and there is a very strong reason for it.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:11.055
And image is worth a thousand words.

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:13.560
And image can trigger perceptions,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.280
emotions, and actions quicker than text.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.385
So it is important for you to use graphics and images in the website to build

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:25.680
a strong visual communication with

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.705
the visitors and tanks to some awesome free tools like Canva,

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:34.360
creating graphics is now much easier than before.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.845
In this lesson, we will learn about the general process and fundamental concepts

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:45.275
of graphic designing that you can apply to edit images and create graphics,

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:47.000
not just for a website,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.880
but even for social media post YouTube,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.895
thumbnail, or any other graphic element,

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:56.570
as these are the universal strategies.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.305
So let me start by telling you the general process and steps to create a graphic design.

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:09.260
The first step is to note that required dimension or resolution of the graphic design.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.430
It is the size of the graphic in terms of width and height that is measured in pixels.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.795
Lake, if you want to insert an image in the hero section background,

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:24.110
then you have to create the graphic and 11 for 0 by

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.740
600 pixels to cover the screen above the fold.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.034
The dimension for an Instagram post is 1080 by 10 Hz little pixels.

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:39.230
And the dimension for an Instagram story is 0100 aids that all by 19, 200 pixels.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.740
So to use graphics in the website design,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.415
it is important to know the required dimensions.

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:47.570
First.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.340
To know the dimensions,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.900
you can use a Google Chrome plugin called as page to LA Redux to quickly

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.240
measure the dimensions on the screen of any section or column of the website.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.855
Next step is to select the right background.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:07.280
Your design converse would be a plane vite, empty box.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.220
And you can always start by putting up a background.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.920
It can either be a solid color or a gradient audit texture or an image.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.370
You can also use background overly vague.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.395
You insert a background over

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:27.530
already existing background and adjust the opacity to get an awesome blended look.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.710
After the background, you have to insert elements to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.565
the design in the form of text, images and shapes.

00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:40.610
You have to complete the skeleton or a simple structure first containing the content,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.995
and then you start working on the phones,

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.740
colors, spacing, and alignment.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.645
Once the graphic is ready,

00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:54.605
you can export the file and dark JPEG or PNG format to use on the website.

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:59.180
The JPEG format is the most ideal to use on website as it

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.935
is smaller file size and helps in making the website load fast.

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:07.685
But JPEGs do not support the transparent background.

00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:11.555
So if you have a graphic that needs a transparent background,

00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:15.260
you will have to use the PNG format to export the file.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.830
Although you will get the options in the graphic designing tool,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.025
it serves to export the file in smaller file sizes.

00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:27.035
But if you don't find such an option in any tool and you want to reduce the file size,

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:28.745
you can follow these steps.

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:33.230
First, make sure the image resolution is not over scaled as the

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.970
resizing the image to the required solution will reduce the file size automatically.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.540
Next step is to visit tiny PNG.com,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.990
upload the files and Download decompressed versions.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.080
This will help in reducing the file size,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.620
but always make sure you upload an image and the website in

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.555
the least possible file size in just a few babies only.

00:03:56.555 --> 00:04:02.030
Now, let us also discuss some fundamental concepts for good graphic designing.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.180
First concept is emphasis.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.300
It means to decide what is the first piece of

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.710
information that the visitor needs to know by watching the graphic.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.475
Next is to apply balance and alignment.

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:21.770
You can design a symmetrical or asymmetrical graphic.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.645
Just make sure that the graphic does not look condensed or uneven.

00:04:27.645 --> 00:04:33.235
Next is to ensure the right color contrast to make the elements pop.

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:36.520
Next is to use the concept of heirarchy.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.155
It is the arrangement of elements to draw attention to the key elements first.

00:04:41.155 --> 00:04:44.755
Next is to use lines and shapes in the graphic.

00:04:44.755 --> 00:04:50.365
Also, it is important to use icons to draw attention without much distraction.

00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:53.890
Next is to use the concept of repetition.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.530
You should not use different phones for every line in

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.830
the design as it breaks the consistency.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.680
Next is to maintain proportion.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.130
Proportion can be achieved only if all the elements of

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.915
your design are well sized and thoughtfully pleased.

00:05:09.915 --> 00:05:12.230
Once you master the alignment, balance,

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.310
and contrast, proportion should be visible automatically.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.410
Next is movement.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.230
Movement is controlling the elements in a composition so that the eye is led to move

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:30.680
from 1 to the next and the information is properly communicated to the audience.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.450
Next is to use the right colors to connect well with the audience.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.790
Next is whitespace.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.510
Whitespace is not sitting there doing nothing.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.885
It is grading heirarchy and organization.

00:05:44.885 --> 00:05:48.470
Managing the whitespace means to utilize the open space to

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.670
bring attention to the elements that actually matter in your design.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.100
Next is typography.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.474
Obviously, the words we use in our designs that important,

00:05:58.474 --> 00:06:03.605
but also the forms we use to communicate those words.

00:06:03.605 --> 00:06:07.880
And finally, I will recommend you to use a real images

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.840
of people as it helps in improving the conversion rate.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.505
Do give this a try.

00:06:13.505 --> 00:06:18.035
So these are the fundamental concepts that you can use to create

00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:20.990
a graphic design and vivid learn more about it in

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.065
the upcoming video that is graphic designing part.

00:06:24.065 --> 00:06:26.460
To see you there.
