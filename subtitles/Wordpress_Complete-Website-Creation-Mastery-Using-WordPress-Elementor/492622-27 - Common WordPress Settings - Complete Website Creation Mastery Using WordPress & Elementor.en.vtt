00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.315
I always prefer starting up the website creation process with the cleaning activity.

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:09.285
With cleaning, I mean to say that,

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:12.390
let us first remove all the unnecessary plugins

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.290
and teams that are pre-installed in our WordPress setup.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.785
Oh, what are these themes and plug-ins?

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.645
Did I forget to tell you?

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:24.045
No, I remember that.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:27.000
I have to explain these concepts and we will be

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.705
discussing the same a bit ahead in this course.

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:32.895
For the sake of this lesson,

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:37.270
let us hover over plugins option and click on Install Plugins.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.774
You will find a list of pre-installed plug-ins.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.655
Simply select the plugins by clicking like this.

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:46.970
And over here at the top and also at the bottom,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.445
click on the drop-down and select,

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.830
deactivate and click apply.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.659
In WordPress whenever you have to install or uninstall a plugin,

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.125
you have to activate or deactivate the plugin.

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:04.295
First. You can do this process for each plugin individually,

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:08.660
or you can select all the plugins and perform a bulk action.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.415
By the way, bulk actions really save a lot of time.

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:20.225
So the unwanted plugins have been deactivated and it's now time to uninstall them.

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.520
Follow the same process.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.750
Select the plugins I'm selecting all together this time.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.220
Click on Bulk Actions drop-down and select Delete option.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.725
Click on Apply.

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:35.300
Gone.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.375
All the unwanted plugins are now deleted and our Plugin Directory is totally clean.

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:44.900
Next, let us follow the same process for teams,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.465
but there is a twist here.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:53.165
It is not possible to delete all the teams present in our library.

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:56.435
We require at least one team to be active.

00:01:56.435 --> 00:02:01.895
So let us keep the active team and remove the unwanted ones from our account.

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:06.290
This we will have to do up one team at a time hall

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.400
that above the theme image and click on Manage on the bottom right,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.050
locate this delete option,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.885
click on this, and your team would be deleted.

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:19.430
Also, please note that an active team could not be deleted like this.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.500
If you wish to delete and active team first install a different theme activated,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.405
and then you can delete that team.

00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:29.315
Same process that we discussed right now.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:35.090
Come on, go ahead and delete all these unwanted teams one by one.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.750
Let us also clean the pre-existing sample pages.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.395
Hover over the pages menu and click on all pages,

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:47.945
select all these preexisting pages and follow the same process to delete them.

00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:51.575
Now do the same with pre-existing, post.

00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:57.260
Another thing, click on the Dashboard home option and you will find a screen options.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.465
But then here at the top right,

00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:02.750
this is sometimes not visible to a user,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.810
but you may find some settings here as well.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.180
And in fact, some important settings.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.405
So to manage the dashboard home,

00:03:11.405 --> 00:03:16.310
you can select what information boxes you want to see and what to height.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.495
In this way, you can clean up the dashboard home as well.

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:26.450
Also feel free to explore the screen options for other menu options in WordPress.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.760
Hooray, our website is now pretty neat and clean.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.955
Now let us do some basic WordPress settings,

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:38.585
hovered over the settings menu and select Burma lengths.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:44.000
By default, the option which is selected is not required to us.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.595
So out of the so many options of labor,

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:50.585
we have to select the option of post name and click Save.

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:53.720
By the way, what is a permalink?

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.055
A permalink is basically the URL of the web pages.

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:00.020
And with this setting updated,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.890
we can now make the URL's look more relevant and

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.465
easy to understand instead of the previous complicated structure.

00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:13.310
It is a very important setting and in case you miss it at the beginning,

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.660
then also no issues.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.745
You can also do it later on,

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:20.570
but never forget to update this setting ever.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.700
I always prefer to start my Wordpress settings for this only.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.090
Next common setting is updating the site title and

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.410
tagline in case you have not mentioned it at the time of installing WordPress,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.360
or if you wish to change it.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.150
The title and tagline is usually visible over here on the tab.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.110
Select the general option under settings and update the information.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.410
You also need to update the time to show the correct time.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.745
Do the visitors.

00:04:49.745 --> 00:04:52.684
If you wish to change the e-mail address,

00:04:52.684 --> 00:04:56.510
you can update it here in the admin email address.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.940
You will receive an verification e-mail to confirm the changes for email address.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.950
Once done, click on save changes here at the bottom to update the settings.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.340
Next, you can customize the visual display of

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.380
the WordPress dashboard by hovering over

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.650
the users option and selecting the profile option.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.810
Here you can change the colors,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.620
change the display and author name assigned a profile picture,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.350
and update the website login password.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.935
Once done, click on update profile to save.

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:31.730
Next, you can go to the reading option here and made sure

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.690
that discourage search engines option is unchecked.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.550
It is important to uncheck this because it can block the search engines from

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.175
crawling the website and your website will not be available on Google search.

00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:51.410
I'm finally, if you've won't be shared access of your website for editing purpose,

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.865
either with your co-founder,

00:05:52.865 --> 00:05:55.670
business partner, or any team member,

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.005
you must create a new user by going to add new user here,

00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:03.050
you can assign the username, email address,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.375
name, second, the login password,

00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:08.030
and assign a suitable role and click on add

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.195
new user to share the access to edit the website.

00:06:11.195 --> 00:06:13.670
There are 700 rule options available,

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.900
like an administrative will have access to all the features of the website.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.445
An editor can publish and manage post of multiple authors.

00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:25.325
And author can publish and manage his own post.

00:06:25.325 --> 00:06:29.195
A contributor can write the post but won't be able to publish it.

00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:32.480
And a subscriber can only read the content.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.110
Assigning the correct rules is important because a website is

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.805
your asset and you should never take any risk in terms of security.

00:06:40.805 --> 00:06:45.890
Never ever share the super admin login details with uneven.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.870
All right, one last thing here is managing the updates.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.550
You will receive updates on WordPress themes and plug-ins on a regular basis.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.700
Make sure you update all of them for safety and performance of the website.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.825
Although these are the common settings that we update at the beginning,

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:09.500
I will recommend you to explore each and every option available here in

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.729
the WordPress admin area to get familiar with the whole lot of options,

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.375
some of which will be used in the upcoming steps.

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:18.740
That's it.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.555
We're done with the most common settings for WordPress and we're good to go ahead.

00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:26.580
We will continue in the next video.
