00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
The header and footer are going to be consistent for the website,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.685
but the main content area is to be designed for every page.

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.000
And designing is very important for the website.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.580
You need to have a clear objective for the website and design each webpage accordingly.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.035
It is very important.

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.765
Otherwise, you will be lost in the designing ocean

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:24.885
and it will become quite a frustrating task for you.

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:29.550
So always plays an anchor before starting the design task.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.585
Always have a clear conversion goal for the website and design the web pages accordingly.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:41.995
It means deciding on the important actions that a visitor should take on the website.

00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:44.990
This can include making an inquiry on chat,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.725
sending an email, signing up for a newsletter, downloading an eBook,

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:50.180
starting a free trial,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.305
exploring more content on the website or any other important action,

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:56.735
aspart the marketing or sales funnel.

00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:58.520
Another reason to show

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.485
clear and specific information on the webpage is the Internet competition.

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:07.565
There are so many websites fighting for user attention.

00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:11.930
And the average time span of a website visitor is very short.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.305
Somewhere around seven to eight seconds.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:19.850
It means if a visitor visits your website and he does not

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.410
find it to be engaging or compelling enough to explore more content.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.200
Simply close the tab and move away.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.675
So it is very important for you to design the website that is visually appealing,

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:38.840
engaging, and usable to encourage visitors to spend time and take actions.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.180
If they take actions on the website,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.655
it will be considered as a conversion.

00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:47.570
Let us try to understand the process of designing a web page.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.820
It always starts by understanding the ideal visited.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.275
Come on, think about the visitor was going to visit the website.

00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:00.110
His expectations, his values,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.960
tried to simulate his interaction with the website.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.210
More Actions they will prefer to take.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.550
What type of content you will be interested in.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.280
Text, graphics, videos, how much time he will prefer spending on the website?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.470
How can you guide him to complete a desired action in the most easiest manner?

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.395
How can you motivate him to take an action?

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:24.320
Tried to set the benchmark for the overall quality of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.770
interaction between that visitor and a website.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.340
All this research will give you important feedback and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.194
data to help you plan the design of the webpage.

00:02:35.194 --> 00:02:40.205
Moving further, the designing process can be divided into two segments.

00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:44.885
One is user interface and the other is user experience.

00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:49.340
You start the designing process by selecting the colors, phones, images,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.200
graphics, and layout to make the website look beautiful and consistent.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.315
This is called as designing the user interface or UI.

00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:04.355
It represents the visual or graphical site of the website design.

00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:08.345
Next, you have to optimize the user interface design

00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:12.740
to enhance the experience of the visitor when they interact with the website.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.935
It is more or less a sense of fee.

00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:20.060
The visitor must feel comfortable while navigating the website,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.015
reading the content, watching the colors, videos,

00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:26.405
images, he must develop a sense of credibility.

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:31.610
You have to embed them the motivation he needs to take actions on the website.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.480
He must believe that he's getting value from the website.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.030
This is called as designing the user experience or UX.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.635
If I explain user experience to you in just two words,

00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:49.775
it would be an easy and pleasant experience

00:03:49.775 --> 00:03:52.640
for the visitor on interaction with the website.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.330
User interface is actually a part of user experience.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.485
So to ensure you're getting the best results from the website design,

00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:04.115
it is important to focus on both UI and UX.

00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:08.809
Focusing on UI will help to make the website look beautiful, land consistent.

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:14.960
Whereas focusing on UX will make the experience easy and enjoyable for the visitor.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.300
The three most important concepts to master in designing the user interface of

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.505
a website is to select the colors, typography, and layout.

00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:29.930
And we will be learning these concepts in the upcoming lessons.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.170
By the name, you can start thinking about the ideal visitor

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.620
of the website and tried to come up with market research.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.060
See you in the next video.
