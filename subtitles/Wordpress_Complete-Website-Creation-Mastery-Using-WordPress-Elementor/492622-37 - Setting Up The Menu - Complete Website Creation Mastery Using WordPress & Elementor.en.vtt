00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.655
Now, you know how to develop a webpage using the element or widgets,

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:08.625
and you already have the list of web pages,

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.670
it is not time to create all the pages,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.765
complete the development and come up with the navigation menu.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.770
The first thing you have to do is to go to the reading settings

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.030
here and assign the homepage and blog page.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:31.840
Select the static page option and assign the home as homepage and blog as post page.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.770
Click on save changes.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.165
Now hovered over the Appearance option and select menu.

00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:43.550
Here, you need to create a new menu by clicking on this.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.995
Give a name to the menu.

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:49.100
I am calling it primary menu because it is going to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.805
be the main navigation menu for this website.

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:54.845
In the menu settings,

00:00:54.845 --> 00:01:01.085
you have the option to automatically add a new page to this menu when created.

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:05.495
But we usually prefer not to do this automatically.

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:10.295
You can manually add pages to the menu as per requirement.

00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:12.905
So leave it unchecked.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:16.790
Then you have to choose the display location.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.745
Since we are creating the primary menu,

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:25.400
select the location as primary menu and click on Create menu.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.920
You can add pages, boast,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.335
and custom links to the menu.

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:35.660
Usually, you only need to add the pages and custom links.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.749
Under the pages option you have three tabs.

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:41.930
Most recent view all iron search.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.660
You can click on View All to get the list of all the pages that you have created.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.115
Now, select the pages that you want to add in the menu and click on add to menu.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.740
This will add the pages to the menu.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.120
And here you can arrange the order of pages.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.905
Simply click, drag, drag, drag and drop.

00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:09.440
The order is changed.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.495
You can easily adjust the order by drag-and-drop.

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:17.794
Now, how to create is sub-menu.

00:02:17.794 --> 00:02:19.730
To create a sub-menu,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.245
you'll have to drag the item a bit, right, and drop.

00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:25.700
That's it.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.385
Sub item is highlighted and it is now a sub-menu.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:35.420
You can even create more deep level submenu by dragging

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.770
the item more right below the submenu item like this.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.035
Once you are done with the ordering,

00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:46.290
click on save menu to update and publish.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.100
Next is the concept of custom lengths.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.060
We use a custom link to create a menu option that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.080
may have an external link leading to some other webpage

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.195
or to highlight a pop-up or just an empty link to organize the navigation menu processes.

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:14.795
Very simple. Simply give the link a title or entered the URL.

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:16.130
That's it.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.830
If you want to assign a blank link,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.800
then insert a hashtag symbol.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.345
There is one very important thing here in the menu setup.

00:03:26.345 --> 00:03:29.795
If you want to make a link open in new tab,

00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:32.690
how to do it, then?

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.155
I don't see any option anywhere here.

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:37.670
Okay.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.950
So how many of you have explored the screen options for

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.265
every setting option in WordPress admin, area, hall, right?

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:55.310
So here are the screen options to get the option of making a link open a new tab,

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.150
you have to activate the option by going to the screen options.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.140
I hope you must have now understood that it is very important to

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.205
explore all the options that are available on every setting.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:12.240
These from east to west to north to south.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.120
Spend some time exploring the WordPress admin area.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.800
You will enjoy it.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.655
Another thing here, you can create multiple menus to use on different locations,

00:04:25.655 --> 00:04:29.690
like in a footer or in some part of the webpage.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.370
So the processes seem,

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.525
go ahead and start making the menus as per the requirement.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.365
And in order to customize the styling of this menu,

00:04:39.365 --> 00:04:43.775
we haven't learned the settings for header and footer in the next video.

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.720
See you there.
