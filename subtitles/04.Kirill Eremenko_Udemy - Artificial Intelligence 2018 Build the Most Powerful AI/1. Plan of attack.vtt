Hello and welcome back to the course on augmented random search.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.590
This is Carol Eremenko.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.500
And in today's tutorial we're going to discuss the plan of attack for this intuition section of the

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.970
course.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.340
So is dicer into it.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.240
And this section will learn the following things.

7
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.960
First of all we're going to have a tutorial with an overview of augmented random search.

8
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.240
In fact this is going to be a great tutorial for anybody who has no prior experience with artificial

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.070
intelligence and we'll help you get up to speed with everything that we're going to be discussing further

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.620
down then we'll talk about the perception and we'll find out what it is and how it works and how it's

11
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.610
related to the arrest algorithm.

12
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.330
We'll talk about maximizing rewards and understand the principle or the main mechanic of how the augmented

13
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.790
random of search algorithm or any artificial intelligence for that matter actually is able to learn

14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.510
from its interactions with the environment.

15
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.710
Then we'll talk about the method of finite differences and the method of finding differences is the

16
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.870
method that resides at the heart of a virus.

17
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.470
And also in is eternal you find out why the augmented random searches actually called a random search.

18
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.000
It is an advanced tutorial.

19
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.070
It is a bit more complex than the rest of them.

20
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.920
So be prepared that there will be it will be a bit longer and it will be a bit harder to get your head

21
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.170
around.

22
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.980
But nevertheless we're going to power through it and you will understand everything by the end of it.

23
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.660
In any case then we will move on to understanding the augmented component of Erris.

24
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.030
So why is it actually called augmented random search and just random search.

25
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.110
What are the new introductions new ideas that were introduced in Erris.

26
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.940
And finally we'll talk about Erris and other artificial intelligence algorithms.

27
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.320
So Will how a comparison of the main distinct features of one versus the other in order for us to be

28
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.210
better versed in these terms in these in the way these things work and be more prepared for conversations

29
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.460
we might have about Arison other artificial intelligence algorithms and just have a better understanding

30
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.080
of why Erris actually stands out among the crowd.

31
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.850
So we go that's our plan of attack for this section.

32
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.860
I hope you're as excited as I am about the upcoming tutorials and without further ado let's dive straight

33
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.130
into it and learn everything about augmented random search.

34
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.780
I look forward to seeing you on the equitorial.

35
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.490
And until then enjoy AI.
