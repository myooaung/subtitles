00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.870
Hello welcome to this new tutorial and here we go with the next step.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.200
Gathering all the positive and negative rewards into one same list to compute the standard deviation

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.610
of all these rewards.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.670
So here we go.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.160
Let's introduce that huge list.

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:24.000
Well that's list of 32 words containing first the 16 percent reward and then second to 16 negative words.

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.540
So basically we're going to do a concatenation of lists and this list which I'm introducing right now

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:38.710
will be called all we want it and we'll get it by taking the non-pay library which has a shortcut and

9
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:46.200
P and then the trick is to use the array function because this allows to do a concatenation of lists

10
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.500
by just summing these two lists.

11
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.690
So by these two lists I'm talking of course about the list of positive words.

12
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.810
Let's take that first positive words.

13
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.530
Here we go.

14
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:06.240
And then here's what you can do you can do a plus and then add the other less you want to concatenate

15
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.780
the first list negative rewards.

16
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.840
Here it is.

17
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.040
And pasting here and there we go we have concatenated to previous list into a numb pie array.

18
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.220
So we have to understand that now we don't have a list like before but a number array but of one dimension

19
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.380
and therefore it is like a list.

20
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.820
But we wanted to convert that into a number array because then we're going to use the SDD method to

21
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.000
directly compute the standard deviation of all the values in this list integrated into a number.

22
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.420
Right.

23
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.350
So that's the purpose of doing this.

24
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.870
So I'm going to show you you take all three words and then just add a dot and then this s t d function

25
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.380
which will return you the standard deviation of all the values inside your list of other words positive

26
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.670
ones and negative ones.

27
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.130
And therefore since it returns the standard deviation we're going to introduce a new variable that will

28
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.960
be exactly this Sigma are variable.

29
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:15.600
That was the variable in the Date function because remember in order to do our one step of in the sense

30
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.080
we were dividing the learning rate here by little number of desperations times this standard deviation

31
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.800
of two words.

32
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.730
That's why we're getting it.

33
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.160
And therefore now that we've made and prepare this Sigma our Very well we'll be able to input it in

34
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.970
the arguments of the update function to make that one step of gray in the sense to update our policy.

35
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.110
All right so perfect.

36
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.050
Newstead done and now we're going to move onto the next step which will be something that we haven't

37
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.480
done yet any time with no function or method.

38
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.040
It is the sorting of the directions by the highest reward whether it is we were in a positive direction

39
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.600
or we were obtained in the opposite direction.

40
00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.760
So we have to do it.

41
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.740
It will be quite easy just taking three lines of code and then that will mean that we will have done

42
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.950
everything here you know from 1 to 6.

43
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.380
And so finally we'll be able to make that update step by applying this one step of gray in the center

44
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.260
to update the weights and direction that increases the we want which is the whole purpose of what we're

45
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.130
doing.

46
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.860
So let's do that in the next story all sorting the directions and then we'll make that a data step until

47
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.970
then enjoy.
