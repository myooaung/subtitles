Before we dive into that, quickly going through some alternatives.

2
00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:12.504
I think probably the most popular alternative in the Node world is MongoDB,

3
00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:14.144
which is really great.

4
00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:16.685
It natively speaks JSON, it's pretty fast,

5
00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:19.244
and there's no migrations because it's,

6
00:00:19.244 --> 00:00:26.746
obviously it's a NoSQL database and can sort of store document objects whose

7
00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:31.994
content can change without necessitating a database migration.

8
00:00:31.994 --> 00:00:36.347
Also Mongoose, as I mentioned, the ODM on top of MongoDB,

9
00:00:36.347 --> 00:00:39.915
is probably much better than any similar tool in Node.

10
00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:40.986
js right now.

11
00:00:40.986 --> 00:00:45.755
There's a lot more resources out there on how to use it.

12
00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:50.528
So, there is definitely that advantage.

13
00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:58.024
Using an ORM like Sequelize is definitely a choice that you would make if using

14
00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:01.164
a relational database is important to you for some reason,

15
00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:09.000
as it is for us, and if you like the features that Postgres offers, which are many and great.
