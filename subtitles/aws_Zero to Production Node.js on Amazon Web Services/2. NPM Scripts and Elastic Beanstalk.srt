00:00:03,942 --> 00:00:05,652
I mentioned this before,

2
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:10,265
but the npm scripts have a special relationship with Elastic Beanstalk,

3
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:14,780
which is going to be our deployment environment here this afternoon.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,952
The three npm scripts that Elastic Beanstalk cares about is npm start,

5
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:24,779
which is going to be the command that's run to actually

6
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,010
start up the web process that's going to serve requests on

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,497
your EC2 instance; prestart,

8
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:34,323
which is the command to run prior to the start; and poststart,

9
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:39,786
which, as you might imagine, is command run after the start command.

10
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:40,107
So,

11
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:44,278
wherever we have an npm start is going to be the way that

12
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:47,621
Elastic Beanstalk launches our Node process.

13
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:53,233
In our example, we're just launching our server process with the node command,

14
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:56,438
but you might imagine we could do other things like start it with a

15
00:00:56,438 --> 00:01:02,801
process manager like PM2 or nodemon or forever or something like that

16
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,611
rather than just using Node directly.

17
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:10,000
So this is the opportunity we have to kind of configure how our Node process is run.
