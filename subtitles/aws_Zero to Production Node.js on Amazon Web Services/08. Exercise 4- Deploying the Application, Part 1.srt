1
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:07,155
I think what we can do now is folks that want to take

2
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:09,438
the plunge can start doing that.

3
00:00:09,438 --> 00:00:14,545
I'll come around and help anybody who wants to go through

4
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:18,820
the actual deploy process and/or answer any questions about

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,225
anything else that we had today.

6
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:26,240
If you are planning on doing the Elastic Beanstalk deployment,

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,996
we just sat and did it for a good 30 minutes,

8
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:33,752
so that's probably about the budget that you would set

9
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:37,630
at this point for getting that going, which is totally cool,

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,863
and it's kind of why we're here, or one of the reasons why we're here.

11
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:44,641
So if you're down to give it a shot,

12
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:51,735
I will handhold all of your way through that process as best I can.

13
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:55,911
And you're planning on writing some documentation about this too?

14
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:58,724
Yeah, as part of the written materials,

15
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:06,299
I'd like to do some written stuff on this as well.

16
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,323
So all the stuff that was just deployed,

17
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:11,293
is that all free then to run, or is it hourly?

18
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:12,492
Is there any hourly?

19
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:15,293
All the stuff that I used was within the Free Tier,

20
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:17,937
like all of the instances were t2.

21
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:18,479
micros.

22
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,815
So yeah, this was within the Free Tier,

23
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:27,658
but you can sort of dial up any of the individual pieces to more expensive.

24
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:31,518
So you could run a ton of little application like this on Free Tier,

25
00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:33,379
and then it's just when you want to dial them up is

26
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:35,258
when the charges will start coming in?

27
00:01:35,258 --> 00:01:35,685
Yeah, yeah,

28
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:38,659
and I think like the Free Tier is --- my understanding is like

29
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,943
you have 12 months with it or something,

30
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:44,406
and then you start paying regardless.

31
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:46,765
It's --- but yeah, I think at this level,

32
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:50,269
and I think there might be limitations on numbers as well.

33
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:52,181
You can have 750 hours.

34
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:56,500
Seven hundred and fifty hours a month is the Free Tier limit.

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,373
So it's one instance in 31 days.

36
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:02,656
If you've got two instances, it's 15 days.

37
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,362
Of computer time essentially.

38
00:02:04,362 --> 00:02:04,947
Yeah.

39
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:09,140
Gotcha.

40
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,535
So you want to make sure you aren't just spinning these up all the time.

41
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:13,482
Not willy-nilly, no.

42
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:17,803
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have like a monthly like $15.

43
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:22,055
00 Amazon bill that I just have no idea like where I got it from.

44
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:24,285
That's what I'm afraid of.

45
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:27,019
You can just opt for the $15 thousand enterprise one.

46
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,286
Yeah, I don't know man.

47
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:28,792
But no,

48
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:33,324
I think I just have enough little stuff where I've ran out

49
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:37,736
of the Free Tier on a couple accounts.

50
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:39,529
For those of us that wanted to go through this,

51
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:43,450
I mean could you go through that list like slower,

52
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,264
the whole setup?

53
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:45,982
You went through it fast,

54
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:49,889
and I thought there was no way I could be here and watching at the same time.

55
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:50,333
Yep, absolutely.

56
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,444
I can definitely do that.

57
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:55,307
I can kind of go back into the environment that we just created and

58
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:59,086
show you some of the bits that we had to configure,

59
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:02,383
like kind of from the beginning, if that helps.

60
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:02,724
Alright,

61
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:08,533
so great request is to kind of retrace the steps of that deploy now that we,

62
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:13,483
like we --- there's a lot of down time in there where

63
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:14,924
we might have missed some things,

64
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:18,549
so I'll just go through and retrace the steps of the

65
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:23,457
deployment from top to bottom, or provisioning the new environment.

66
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:31,345
So the first thing that I did was here in the console I go down

67
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,889
to my Identity & Access Management interface,

68
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,301
and if I don't have one already,

69
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:44,062
I'm going to create a user for use in essentially deploying stuff,

70
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:48,633
like getting credentials to deploy stuff to Amazon.

71
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:54,663
So we create a new user with a username,

72
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:56,953
and I'll just delete that one right away.

73
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:58,385
So we create the user,

74
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:01,104
and then we download the security credentials for that

75
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:05,940
user so we can use that authenticate the Elastic Beanstalk

76
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,358
command line interface later.

77
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:13,137
After we create that user --- here I'll just --- I'm

78
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:16,264
going to delete that right away.

79
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:24,364
Alright, so after we create that user, we want to add that user to a group,

80
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:29,349
so we check that user, and then we say Add User to Groups.

81
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:37,682
I think I actually already added it to the only group that I had, like this one.

82
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:43,523
But if I do like â€¦ So how do you download the credentials?

83
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:47,663
After you create, I'll do it one more time,

84
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,393
so after you create the user,

85
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:53,836
there's a button here that says Download Credentials.

86
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:58,914
Okay, I was trying to get it from an existing user, so I have to.

87
00:04:58,914 --> 00:04:59,109
Yeah,

88
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:01,253
from an existing --- you only have one opportunity to download

89
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:03,793
credentials for a user after you create them; otherwise,

90
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:09,505
you have to like regenerate credentials for a user.

91
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:18,615
And then for a new user that's been created, you add them to group.

92
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:23,927
In my case, I only have one group, and that's like the super admin group,

93
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:26,371
so you would choose to add them to that.

94
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:28,021
Did you have to create that ahead of time,

95
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:30,161
or is that something that we'll have to do?

96
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:33,316
Yes, you will have to create that group.

97
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:42,079
So when you create the new group, you can say like,

98
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:54,969
you can call it SomeGroup, and then after you create the group,

99
00:05:54,969 --> 00:06:03,362
you can choose like a preset policy from a list that will apply to that group.

100
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,709
AdministratorAccess is the GodMode policy.

101
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,754
And then there are lots of other more granular

102
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:12,954
policies you can choose from as well.

103
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:16,033
So you create that group,

104
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:23,863
and then you can --- all the users you assign to that

105
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:28,790
group will have that set of permissions.

106
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,937
So it doesn't matter the name of the group really.

107
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:34,722
It just matters that that user is a member of that

108
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,786
group and that have admin privileges?

109
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:37,057
Yep,

110
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:39,223
and that they have whatever privileges on whatever

111
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:41,653
AWS resources they need to access,

112
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:46,847
and using the super admin policy means that they have everything.

113
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:50,272
So once you have a user created who's assigned to a group

114
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:59,000
with a sufficiently permissive policy, then you're ready to start cranking out some actual stuff.
