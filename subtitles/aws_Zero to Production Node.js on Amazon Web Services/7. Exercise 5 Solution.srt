00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:06,488
It looks like we have a couple pull requests in to

2
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:08,783
take a look at our two challenges.

3
00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:13,509
So, let's see what we've got, see if folks were able to crack this nut.

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:17,539
I did notice that we had one contribution that is what we're

5
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:22,378
looking for in addition to a couple stylistic fixes that I

6
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:26,909
had actually mentioned yesterday, so I appreciate the help there.

7
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:33,085
Well basically what we had to do to add the this Babel set

8
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:39,591
of presets is number one install the preset set as a

9
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:42,531
development dependency in our package.

10
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:45,471
json, which we did here.

11
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:49,561
So there are the ES2016 presets.

12
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:52,969
We also added the presets,

13
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,548
or we changed the presets configuration for babelify such

14
00:00:56,548 --> 00:01:01,017
that it would use both of those presets,

15
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,467
both ES2015 and ES2016.

16
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:05,953
So that is what we were looking for.

17
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:08,260
And now when we compile our JavaScript,

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,234
we'll have the ability to use those ES2016 features,

19
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:17,284
which I think there's actually only like one or two major ones,

20
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:18,779
in our Javascript files as well.

21
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,772
So we won't immediately put it to work,

22
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:27,475
but now our client-side JavaScript capabilities are just that much more elite.

23
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:34,989
So I'm going to go ahead and +1 this guy,

24
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:39,327
looks good to me, and I'm going to merge it down.

25
00:01:39,327 --> 00:01:40,279
So thank you very much.

26
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:42,976
Good work there.

27
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:52,866
Alright, we also have a pull request for the SCSS changes.

28
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:59,166
We have the font color defined as a variable here,

29
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:04,340
looks to be a gray, I'm sure it's perfectly readable,

30
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,481
and then we're changing the color of the h1 to that,

31
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:12,280
and then in the info we're actually changing all of the

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,506
color to that rather than just the anchors,

33
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:19,147
which I guess is fine.

34
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:19,966
That's pretty close.

35
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:25,674
I think what I was hoping for was we'd actually just get the anchors themselves,

36
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:28,057
but that's pretty close.

37
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:31,571
So, I'm going to say partial credit there.

38
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:33,334
The primary bit is here.

39
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:38,856
We define this shared color that we're then going to use two

40
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:45,000
different places in our CSS declarations. So that is definitely what we're looking for there.
