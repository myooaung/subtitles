1
00:00:04.093 --> 00:00:07.686
I think we'll go head and go over some of the results.

2
00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:11.491
It looks like we had folks step up to the challenge once again

3
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:15.314
with some solutions that are looking correct,

4
00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.302
like something we can ship.

5
00:00:17.302 --> 00:00:17.699
So,

6
00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:26.316
the first one I wanted to check was the pull request from Lucas here in the

7
00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:32.126
room that added the Uglify configuration to the application.

8
00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:36.841
So, what Lucas did here, bump that up a little bit,

9
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:41.240
so what Lucas did in the Gruntfile is he added a new

10
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.318
configuration for the uglify task.

11
00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:49.676
He created a target called my_target, not a super descriptive name,

12
00:00:49.676 --> 00:00:51.685
but I think it does work.

13
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:55.149
We can probably follow along and figure out something for that.

14
00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.458
I think in this case,

15
00:00:56.458 --> 00:01:00.334
maybe like dist or something like that would be appropriate.

16
00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:05.069
But in this case, we are going to be taking app.

17
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.917
js and writing it out to app.

18
00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:08.324
js.

19
00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:12.332
Now, in this case, I probably would've added like a.

20
00:01:12.332 --> 00:01:12.733
min.

21
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:17.321
js or something to the end to sort of specify it,

22
00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:19.898
that it would be the minified version rather than

23
00:01:19.898 --> 00:01:26.203
the regular uncompressed version, but that's generally what we're looking for.

24
00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:28.921
We need this file, which is public/app.

25
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.473
js to be uglified,

26
00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:34.692
and in this case we're actually renaming it --- or

27
00:01:34.692 --> 00:01:38.183
we're going to output to the same file.

28
00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:42.157
Probably we'd want to do a different file, but that's generally what we need.

29
00:01:42.157 --> 00:01:50.200
And then the --- we also have the uglify task loaded in from grunt-contrib,

30
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.866
which is exactly what we need,

31
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:59.403
and then we also add in the uglify task to the collect_static command,

32
00:01:59.403 --> 00:02:05.537
which was the desired enhancement that we had to the project.

33
00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:08.338
We also required the 2.

34
00:02:08.338 --> 00:02:12.568
0 version of Uglify, which I think sounds find.

35
00:02:12.568 --> 00:02:13.350
And actually,

36
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:21.023
here I just pulled down Lucas's branch locally so I could check it out.

37
00:02:21.023 --> 00:02:28.998
So if we run grunt collect_static, that's going to run our browserify task,

38
00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:34.528
and then we also see that we ran the uglify task successfully.

39
00:02:34.528 --> 00:02:39.992
And then if we look at our public directory,

40
00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:41.745
which is the desired output,

41
00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.620
we definitely have some uglified JavaScript in there.

42
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.516
So a couple of bits to tweak, but that definitely works,

43
00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:50.164
so like excellent work Lucus!

44
00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:51.412
Very nicely done.

45
00:02:51.412 --> 00:02:55.432
How did he know to get the version 2.

46
00:02:55.432 --> 00:02:55.879
0.

47
00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.219
whatever of Uglify?

48
00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:03.484
My guess is that what he did was do npm install --save grunt-contrib-uglify,

49
00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:11.474
which will add the latest stable version of that folder to npm,

50
00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:12.534
your package.

51
00:03:12.534 --> 00:03:14.123
json, excuse me.

52
00:03:14.123 --> 00:03:16.242
So that's totally good.

53
00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:19.691
I think we'll --- I may make a few minor

54
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:22.277
modifications before I push it into master,

55
00:03:22.277 --> 00:03:27.113
but that's what we need, so you definitely get the free taco there.

56
00:03:27.113 --> 00:03:27.926
That's a lie.

57
00:03:27.926 --> 00:03:29.282
There are no free tacos.

58
00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:31.846
I probably should've brought tacos.

59
00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:34.922
That would've been a good idea.

60
00:03:34.922 --> 00:03:41.148
Alright, so let's take a look at one of the other solutions that we had.

61
00:03:41.148 --> 00:03:43.814
So that was what we're looking for Uglify,

62
00:03:43.814 --> 00:03:51.291
and then we needed a npm script to actually run the migrations.

63
00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:59.305
So, we have one pull request for that, so let's take a look.

64
00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:04.243
Alright, this pull request also includes the Uglify solution,

65
00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:07.369
which is just fine.

66
00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:10.809
Usually, we want to keep one pull request to one issue,

67
00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:13.847
but I won't wrist slap very hard for that here.

68
00:04:13.847 --> 00:04:16.206
I appreciate --- It didn't originally.

69
00:04:16.206 --> 00:04:16.872
What's that?

70
00:04:16.872 --> 00:04:17.745
It didn't originally.

71
00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:19.783
I think he just forget to branch.

72
00:04:19.783 --> 00:04:20.512
It's okay.

73
00:04:20.512 --> 00:04:21.605
That's just fine.

74
00:04:21.605 --> 00:04:29.987
Alright, so the key bit that we have here is the migrate command was added here.

75
00:04:29.987 --> 00:04:35.889
Maybe it'll be a little bit easier if we actually, you know, view the file.

76
00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.448
So, we had this prestart command,

77
00:04:37.448 --> 00:04:41.351
and that's actually going to be executed on our Elastic

78
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:46.132
Beanstalk instance before the server process is started to

79
00:04:46.132 --> 00:04:48.240
run any pending database migrations,

80
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.473
but we also wanted to have like a custom script because that prestart could

81
00:04:53.473 --> 00:04:58.777
eventually do other things besides just run the migrations.

82
00:04:58.777 --> 00:05:01.316
So we created another task called migrate,

83
00:05:01.316 --> 00:05:08.225
which also used the local version of Sequelize to run the migrations.

84
00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:08.678
So,

85
00:05:08.678 --> 00:05:13.210
just for the sake of expedience I'll copy that just

86
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.848
to see what that's going to do.

87
00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:22.543
And the thing I was hinting at in the comments,

88
00:05:22.543 --> 00:05:24.266
if you were kind of reading through that thread,

89
00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:29.343
is that the way that you invoke like nonstandard npm scripts is slightly

90
00:05:29.343 --> 00:05:35.180
different than for those that you would run otherwise.

91
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.610
So if say like npm start, that's going to run the migrations,

92
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.802
and it's going to start up my development server ---

93
00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:49.195
my server process on port 3000.

94
00:05:49.195 --> 00:05:55.521
So npm already knows how to npm start, but if I say npm migrate,

95
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:58.243
it's going to say well, I don't know, I don't know what a migrate is.

96
00:05:58.243 --> 00:06:03.150
So it's not one of the sort of built-in commands that npm knows about.

97
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:12.220
So rather than saying npm migrate, I'm going to say npm run-script migrate,

98
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.887
and then that's going to run my migrations using the built-in Sequelize module.

99
00:06:17.887 --> 00:06:21.138
So if you add commands to the package.

100
00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:25.773
json that aren't part of the known set of npm commands,

101
00:06:25.773 --> 00:06:29.996
you do have to add in that extra run-script prefix

102
00:06:29.996 --> 00:06:35.000
before you can run those commands. So that was the bit that I wanted to point out there.
