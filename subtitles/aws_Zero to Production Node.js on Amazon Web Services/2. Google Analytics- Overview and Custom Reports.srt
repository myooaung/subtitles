1
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:07,056
So what I'm going to do is just hop into the Google

2
00:00:07,056 --> 00:00:11,444
Analytics UI and show you a few things.

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:16,420
My Google Analytics have been kind of broken on my personal website for a while,

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:24,395
so the dataset here is going to be a lot smaller than it should be,

5
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:27,253
and just nobody visits my website in general.

6
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:29,731
It's a very low traffic place.

7
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:31,383
I hardly update it.

8
00:00:31,383 --> 00:00:34,627
So, when you implement Google Analytics on your site,

9
00:00:34,627 --> 00:00:40,882
you'll have access to see some pre-canned reports just by

10
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:44,773
integrating the tracking code on your site.

11
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:49,835
You'll be able to see things like how many users or how many sessions are

12
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:53,919
being initiated on your site over a given time period.

13
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:59,107
And this date chooser up on the top right is constant across the custom

14
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:03,833
reporting interface and this pre-canned reporting interface.

15
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:09,690
So you can select the time scale for the data that you're looking at.

16
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,882
A couple of the pre-canned reports, which are useful,

17
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:20,200
are going to be the Content Drilldown, which is something that I use regularly,

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,636
especially the primary website that I work on at Twilio is the documentation,

19
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:30,051
so I'm very interested in which pages people are visiting most often,

20
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:33,095
which pages have the highest bounce rate,

21
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:36,310
which ones are the most popular landing pages,

22
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,917
that sort of thing.

23
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:38,276
So,

24
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:42,968
I will frequently just kind of come into the Content Drilldown and maybe

25
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:48,893
start at the root of the site and drill into these various areas to see

26
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:52,303
where people are navigating in the site.

27
00:01:52,303 --> 00:01:54,992
So for me, the most hits I have right now,

28
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:58,111
in terms of page views, are on the home page,

29
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:01,655
and then the about where the recruiters can get some

30
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,470
information to try to start to spam me,

31
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:12,579
and then some other odds and ends on my very poorly maintained personal blog.

32
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:15,455
The other bit that you're going to want to take a look at,

33
00:02:15,455 --> 00:02:19,263
which is part of one of the challenges that you can take on this afternoon,

34
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:20,582
is custom events.

35
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:25,391
And custom events allow you to track user interaction events in

36
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:28,871
JavaScript while somebody is interacting with the site,

37
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:32,003
so that if you are on frontendmasters.

38
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:35,445
com and the video browsing section or whatever,

39
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:41,391
you can fire off a custom event for a video play and understand how

40
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:45,401
many people are playing videos on a given page.

41
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:49,639
And the data that you can get in the pre-canned variety is going to

42
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,865
be down here in the Behavior section under Events.

43
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:57,456
If you go to Overview, you'll see a listing of events here.

44
00:02:57,456 --> 00:03:02,921
I'm not doing tracking on my personal website right now,

45
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:08,440
but the way that you'll track custom events is with a

46
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,851
category which consists of a family of events.

47
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:14,793
So if you're tracking actions on video plays,

48
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:19,371
you'll have a video category and then actions will be things like play,

49
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:23,957
pause, rewind, scrub on the video players,

50
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:30,505
and labels will be things like the actual title of the video.

51
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:34,734
And you can use these custom events in reports in GA.

52
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:41,231
Now the part you're going to probably use the most

53
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:44,479
frequently is a custom report.

54
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,781
And in fact, the newest version of the Google Analytics API,

55
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:51,265
which you can use today,

56
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:56,365
actually uses custom reports as the way in which you create a

57
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:59,638
filter for the data that you're fetching from the API because

58
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:02,970
actually creating a report ends up, in the GUI,

59
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,625
does actually end up being a little simpler than it is

60
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:10,485
trying to pull the same data out of the API.

61
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:14,621
So when you create a custom report,

62
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:23,026
you're going to be tracking metrics and across certain dimensions.

63
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:28,227
So, a metric in Google Analytics is something you can measure,

64
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,745
something that you can count.

65
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:36,241
So some common ones would be for behavior you have,

66
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:42,153
let's see, like the average time on page say.

67
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:45,672
So you can track how long people are staying on a page.

68
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:51,817
There's also things like the, oops, the bounce rate.

69
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:56,863
So when a user lands on a page on your site and then immediately leaves,

70
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:01,539
the percentage of people that do that make up the bounce rate.

71
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:07,004
And generally speaking, a high bounce rate for a page is not all that great.

72
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:12,732
So you can track a bounce rate for a page or other metrics that you care about.

73
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:17,585
The other bit that you probably are going to care about a lot is goals.

74
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:22,133
And I can show you that interface to create that

75
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,359
very quickly after I'm done here.

76
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:27,970
But in the custom report you can see how many people are

77
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,675
reaching certain goals within your application.

78
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:30,967
So,

79
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:34,765
if you have a page that a user can land on after they

80
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:36,544
successfully sign up for an account,

81
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:40,932
you can configure that as a goal and you can track how people

82
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:44,231
are reaching that account signup success page.

83
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:48,860
And you can start to slice and dice data based on that.

84
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:55,556
The dimension is going to be the other access of this report.

85
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:59,628
So if the metric is the thing that we want to count,

86
00:05:59,628 --> 00:06:03,770
the dimension is the unit that is generating the metric.

87
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,905
So for something like bounce rate or a goal conversion,

88
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:12,091
the dimension that that would map to is a landing page.

89
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:14,315
So, whichever page somebody comes to on your site,

90
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:15,927
I'll just search for landing page,

91
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:18,954
and there are lots of different dimensions you can use,

92
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:23,150
so we can run a report for every landing page,

93
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,170
which of them has the lowest bounce rate here.

94
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:36,496
So, you can also add filters to only look at certain section of the site.

95
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:40,724
So you can have a landing page filter where,

96
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:45,310
and I do this a lot, so in this case,

97
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:51,658
I only want to look at landing pages whose paths start with /docs.

98
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,224
So if you're only interested in running a report

99
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:57,903
for certain sections of the site, you can add a filter down there.

100
00:06:57,903 --> 00:06:59,951
But I will erase that for now.

101
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:06,083
I'll just add a few more metrics in here so we can see what they look like,

102
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:12,505
users, and then I can also look at say time on page,

103
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:15,101
average time on page.

104
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,226
So I have three metrics that we're going to track across all the

105
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:24,527
different landing pages on my piddly little website.

106
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,996
So here's our custom report,

107
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:29,395
and we can see the number of users total across all

108
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:31,659
the landing pages on the site.

109
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,126
So,

110
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:36,793
the landing page with the highest bounce rate is my

111
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,647
description of Twilio signal conference,

112
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:42,325
it has a very small amount of users that are coming there.

113
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:46,229
The home page has the most amount of users coming to it.

114
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:48,767
It also has a very high bounce rate.

115
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:51,590
But for folks that land on the about page,

116
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,003
that bounce rate is quite a bit lower.

117
00:07:54,003 --> 00:07:55,448
After they look at about,

118
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:59,441
they're much more likely to view a second page or a third

119
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:02,381
page on my site during the session.

120
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,789
So, not large numbers here,

121
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:10,828
but when you're trying to optimize landing pages for certain user goals,

122
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:19,000
creating custom reports like this can tell you how close you are to the mark and will let you track your progress over time.
