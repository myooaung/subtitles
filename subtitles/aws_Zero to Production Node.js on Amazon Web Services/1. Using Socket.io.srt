1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,085
The next challenge that we have is to start adding some real-time

2
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:17,807
user interface capabilities to the application.

3
00:00:17,807 --> 00:00:20,475
And I think we'll probably take this one and like work

4
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:23,307
into lunch if we're having lunch at noon.

5
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:27,465
So we'll talk about this and set up the exercise,

6
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:32,859
and then we can work on that kind of over lunch and maybe pick

7
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:38,277
back up again at like right around 1:00 p.

8
00:00:38,277 --> 00:00:38,879
m.

9
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,083
local time.

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,147
So, Socket.

11
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:46,998
IO is the one library I'll present here during the day

12
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:49,101
for which there is no alternate.

13
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:52,643
It's pretty much the de facto standard for adding

14
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:55,522
real-time capabilities to a node app.

15
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,296
There are a couple others out there that you can use, but Socket.

16
00:00:58,296 --> 00:01:01,384
IO is by far the most popular.

17
00:01:01,384 --> 00:01:02,449
And Socket.

18
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:06,174
IO essentially provides two things to your application.

19
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:12,385
It provides a client-side library that you'll load up in your HTML that will

20
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:17,292
allow you to communicate with the server over a WebSocket,

21
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:23,008
and it also provides a server-side API that you can use in your Node.

22
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:26,698
js code to push data to connected clients over a WebSocket.

23
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:31,763
And I think the best way to kind of go through this is to,

24
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:40,000
again, show you the sort of HelloWorld of Socket. IO, which is a simple chat application.
