00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.870
Okay my friends let us start this k means clustering implementation together.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.230
All right.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.790
So in the previous tutorial I think I asked you to try to implement the first phase on your own.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.910
I'm talking of course about data processing which indeed seems to be very easy here because we only

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.710
have to import the libraries and the dataset and it is even easier because we have well our data processing

6
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.420
template.

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.520
So the only thing that we have to do is just to copy paste these first two cells here and then.

8
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.490
Well let's see what we have to change what we should change to prepare our K Means Algorithm.

9
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.760
All right.

10
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.510
So we're going to stop by importing the libraries.

11
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.250
That's inevitable.

12
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.440
We should use the three of these libraries.

13
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.990
Maybe not.

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.160
By but definitely Matlock plot lib and benders.

15
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.300
But anyway let's just import them all so that we can make sure we have everything.

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:04.860
And now let's import the data set and I'm going to copy that cell right here and paste it in a new code

17
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.570
cell right here.

18
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.700
All right great.

19
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.330
So now let's see what we have to change.

20
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.130
Well we don't have to change anything here because we anyway want to have these free libraries.

21
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.440
And now when importing the data set.

22
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.340
Well the first thing of course is to change the name of the data is it here.

23
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.970
That was the template name of the data set and we need to replace this now by the name of the datasets

24
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.560
which is I remind more on this core customers.

25
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.440
That's yes.

26
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.550
So let's do this now on the score customers that see as V.

27
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.480
And now that's when things start to get interesting.

28
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.090
What did you do with these two entities.

29
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.810
You know x the matrix of features and y the dependent variable vector.

30
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.680
Well let's start with the matrix of features the matrix of features.

31
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.940
Here takes exactly all the columns except the last one.

32
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.530
Remember what we did here with that trick to go from the range of 0 in 0 up to minus 1 and minus 1 is

33
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.440
excluded.

34
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.010
Therefore we exclude the last column.

35
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.160
But let's have a look at our dataset again and actually let's imported here in order to have a look

36
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.070
at it here in a notebook.

37
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.090
So right now it's connecting to runtime.

38
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.720
I'm going to show the data set in.

39
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.640
Well we'll see if we have to exclude that last column.

40
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.340
Right.

41
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.110
So there we go.

42
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.710
Let's upload it.

43
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.840
So as usual I put the machinery it is at folder on my desktop.

44
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.770
Make sure to have it.

45
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.090
You know you can download it in the previous tutorial in the article.

46
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.860
So we're gonna go this time into port for clustering.

47
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.200
Then Section 24 came into clustering my friends were making great progress.

48
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.710
That's great.

49
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.680
We're almost halfway there and then we're going to go to Python.

50
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.770
And finally we're going to select and open the mall.

51
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.650
Customers that see as we found.

52
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.170
All right.

53
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.050
And now let's double click it to have a look at it.

54
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.120
It's simpler if it is in our notebook.

55
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.550
All right.

56
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.800
So the question is do we need to change anything here when creating that matrix of features.

57
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.630
Well obviously as we explained in the intuition lecture and in the previous toil there is not a dependent

58
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.380
variable a primary when doing clustering and especially caymans.

59
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.610
So here the last column of this data set the spending score is not the dependent variable it is actually

60
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.070
a feature which we will use as part of the other features to identify some patterns in the data.

61
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.760
And these patterns I remind are actually clusters or segments of data which will be gathered by similarities.

62
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.330
All right.

63
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.270
So there was an essential thing to understand and therefore I hope you did not exclude the last column

64
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.860
here.

65
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.520
So the first thing we would do is to just remove this minus one in order to take.

66
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.830
Indeed all the columns.

67
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.120
All right.

68
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.650
So if you already did that I'm really proud of you.

69
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.150
You did an amazing job but now I want to improve this.

70
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.490
Actually let let's remember that the goal here is to as we said identify some patterns or clusters in

71
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.840
the data by using all of these features here.

72
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.710
But do you think that among these features some of them well won't actually help much identifying these

73
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:26.310
parents and well the answer to that question is of course the customer i.e. the customer right column

74
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.500
is just giving an idea to each of the customers and therefore has literally no impact on whatever dependent

75
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.410
variable we will create in the future because I remind that the process the Caymans algorithm is that

76
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.400
indeed it identifies some classes in the data but also technically it will create a new dependent variable

77
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.150
where the values will be actually the clusters themselves.

78
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.180
And therefore since the customer idea is just a sum identification of the customers well we know for

79
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.750
sure that it is totally irrelevant here.

80
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.840
So we can actually exclude this column.

81
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.280
All right.

82
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.060
So if you did this that's even better.

83
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.330
There was an even higher level of the solution for what I wanted you to do.

84
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.820
OK.

85
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.310
So now that being said what else can we do.

86
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.450
Well all the rest the jar the age the annual income and the spending score seem totally relevant in

87
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.270
order to identify some parents in the data.

88
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.670
And so now from that point I didn't expect you to do much more to solve this exercise except of course

89
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.340
the final modification will do for that row.

90
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.160
But we'll come to that later.

91
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.960
However now for the matrix of features you know the columns that I want to keep in order to identify

92
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.610
these parents will only be actually annual income and spending score and that's only for one particular

93
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.130
reason which is mainly for teaching purposes.

94
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:57.150
Well at the end you know at the end of this implementation I indeed want to visualize with you the clusters

95
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.320
you know the clusters identified by the Caymans algorithm.

96
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.160
But in order to visualize them well we actually need a two dimensional plot.

97
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.480
Right.

98
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.540
We need a two plot where on the x axis we will have one feature and on the y axis we'll have another

99
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.570
feature and therefore in order to visualize the clusters we exactly need two features.

100
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.180
Otherwise you know if we get for example three or four features it will be very hard to visualize the

101
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.200
clusters because well we need one axis per feature.

102
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:35.450
It would be kind of possible in three dimensions but we'll have a much nicer graph in 2D and therefore.

103
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.940
And once again that's not what I expect you to do.

104
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:44.650
We're only going to keep these two columns the annual income and the spending score to identify our

105
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.270
clusters.

106
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.030
And of course I made this dataset so that we can indeed find some very interesting clusters.

107
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:57.300
Furthermore which is trying to of course get some insights from their customers and therefore now the

108
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.570
exercise and you can press buzz on the video to complete it is to change something here in the matrix

109
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:09.830
of features X in order to select only the annual income and the spring score among the features you

110
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.500
know among the variables which we will use to identify the patterns.

111
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:19.760
So please press pause and I'll give you the solution in a few seconds all right great.

112
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:20.920
Let's do this together now.

113
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.730
So the exercise was to only select the annual income column and the spending Score Column in our matrix

114
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.670
of features x.

115
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.650
So let's do this.

116
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.210
And well this time since we're selecting you know two particular columns.

117
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.730
Well we won't use a range to do this.

118
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.390
There is actually a better method.

119
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.630
We will select these columns.

120
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:45.340
You know the indexes of these columns into a pair of square brackets.

121
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.570
And that's the other way to select some columns with you know this I look.

122
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:56.500
Function it is with this pair of square brackets inside which you can include the indexes of the columns

123
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.550
you want to select.

124
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.580
And so now the question is What are these indexes.

125
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.960
Well let's see.

126
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.580
Remember that index is in both and start from zero.

127
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:09.050
So customer idea here hasn't ISRO Joy has index 1.

128
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:14.200
Has index 2 annual income hasn't x3 and spending score has next 4.

129
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.250
And therefore here in this pair of square brackets.

130
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:23.760
Well we just have to input three and then come up and four you know in order to select several indexes

131
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.920
you have to separate them with a comma and that's it.

132
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:33.820
That's how you create this matrix of features selecting some specific columns with which you will learn

133
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:40.460
some patterns in the data to identify some clusters through the K Means Algorithm.

134
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.120
Great.

135
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:47.620
So now that's done for the matrix of features but we're not done for the whole therapy pricing phase

136
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:54.580
and I hope you did the last necessary thing to do here in order to complete this data processing phase.

137
00:08:55.030 --> 00:09:01.450
So according to you what needed to be done here for this third row of important data sets you know for

138
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.100
this dependent variable.

139
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:11.080
Well I hope that you had the right reflex and that you very simply deleted this row because indeed as

140
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:16.290
we explained in the previous tutorial there is no dependent variable a primary.

141
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:23.160
You know before we created for the K Means algorithm it will come later when we train that came into

142
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.880
model on the data set.

143
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.660
All right.

144
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.790
And speaking of the set.

145
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.680
Well I just like to remind that we don't have to split the dataset into a training set Ed set because

146
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.970
having a training set and a test it implies having a dependent variable vector.

147
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.650
So actually here we're all done with the data repricing phase.

148
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.940
Congratulations.

149
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.630
So now we're going to run these two sales to make sure everything's OK.

150
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.020
Starting with this one empowering the libraries.

151
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:54.790
And now this one importing the data set and everything seems to be all good.

152
00:09:54.790 --> 00:10:01.660
We can now move on to the next step which will be to use the elbow method to find the optimal number

153
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.180
of clusters because indeed this will be absolutely necessary when training the Caymans model on the

154
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.600
data set because when building the Caymans model we will have to specify.

155
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:17.710
Well that number of clusters we want to choose for k means and we will want to choose of course well

156
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:24.370
the optimal number of clusters and it is the Elbow Method that will exactly tell us what is that optimal

157
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.390
number.

158
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.150
All right.

159
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.450
So whenever you're ready for that next step you know to smash that Elbow Method.

160
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.070
Well join me in the next tutorial to implement this.

161
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.980
And until then enjoy machine learning.
