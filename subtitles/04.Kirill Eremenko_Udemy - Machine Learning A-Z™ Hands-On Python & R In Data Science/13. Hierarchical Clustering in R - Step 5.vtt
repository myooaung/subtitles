00:00:00.750  -->  00:00:04.130
And here is our hierarchical clustering results obtained in our.

2

00:00:04.320  -->  00:00:08.310
So let's have a closer look at these Custers and understand what they are.

3

00:00:08.310  -->  00:00:13.320
Our first cluster is close to one which is the blue cluster right here and it contains the customers

4

00:00:13.320  -->  00:00:16.320
that have high income and high spending score.

5

00:00:16.620  -->  00:00:21.450
So that's an interesting cluster for them all because customers in this cluster have a high income and

6

00:00:21.450  -->  00:00:23.250
spend a lot of money in the mall.

7

00:00:23.250  -->  00:00:26.920
So this cluster would be a good target of the mall marketing campaigns.

8

00:00:27.120  -->  00:00:29.880
And so we can call this cluster the target one.

9

00:00:30.210  -->  00:00:36.720
OK now cluster to constitute contains the customers that have high income and low spending score.

10

00:00:36.870  -->  00:00:40.460
And so we can call these customers to careful customers.

11

00:00:40.710  -->  00:00:46.260
Now cluster three customers in this cluster have average income and average spending score.

12

00:00:46.440  -->  00:00:49.010
So we call this cluster standard cluster.

13

00:00:49.260  -->  00:00:55.050
Now cluster forecaster for the customers that have low income and low spending score.

14

00:00:55.230  -->  00:01:00.420
So that's basically sensable customers who pay attention to the money they spend.

15

00:01:00.540  -->  00:01:07.050
By paying attention to the money they earn and eventually close to 5 contains the customers that have

16

00:01:07.050  -->  00:01:09.480
low income but high spending score.

17

00:01:09.780  -->  00:01:17.370
So these are customers who are rather careless especially the 119 and customer here who earns a low

18

00:01:17.370  -->  00:01:19.220
income but spends a lot of money.

19

00:01:19.410  -->  00:01:21.790
So this one should particularly be careful.

20

00:01:21.930  -->  00:01:26.550
And actually this cluster five here could be a very interesting cluster for the market.

21

00:01:26.790  -->  00:01:31.760
If the latter has a social responsibility as it is the case for more and more companies today.

22

00:01:32.340  -->  00:01:37.560
All right so we are done with hierarchical clustering in our if you want to reuse this code for your

23

00:01:37.560  -->  00:01:43.290
business problem it's very easy you just have to change the name of the data set here then change the

24

00:01:43.290  -->  00:01:46.150
indexes of your columns of interest just below.

25

00:01:46.170  -->  00:01:51.050
However if you do clustering in more than two dimensions don't execute the last section visualizing

26

00:01:51.060  -->  00:01:56.190
the clusters because it's only for two dimensions but don't delete the section and leave it as comments

27

00:01:56.490  -->  00:02:01.170
because later in this course we will learn a super powerful technique called dimensionality reduction

28

00:02:01.470  -->  00:02:06.930
that will reduce the dimensions of your data to perhaps two dimensions so that you can use this final

29

00:02:06.930  -->  00:02:11.280
section visualizing the clusters to see your clusters in two dimensions.

30

00:02:11.790  -->  00:02:14.830
All right so that's the end of hierarchical clustering in our.

31

00:02:14.880  -->  00:02:20.160
And that's also the end of hierarchical clustering and then the next section we will recap everything

32

00:02:20.160  -->  00:02:22.010
we've learned in clustering.

33

00:02:22.620  -->  00:02:24.060
Thank you for watching this tutorial.

34

00:02:24.060  -->  00:02:28.530
I hope you are now more comfortable with doing clustering in our or Python.

35

00:02:28.530  -->  00:02:31.230
I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorials.

36

00:02:31.330  -->  00:02:33.120
And until then happy clustering
