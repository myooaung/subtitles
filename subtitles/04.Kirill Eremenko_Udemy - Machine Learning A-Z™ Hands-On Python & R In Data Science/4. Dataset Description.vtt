Hello and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.700
Okay.

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.150
We are almost ready to begin our journey of data repossessing.

4
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.000
But first we need to get the data set.

5
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.180
That's what we're going to do in this tutorial.

6
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.750
So let's do this right now.

7
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.250
And here it is just going gonna put the column titles in bold.

8
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.000
OK.

9
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.380
That's the data set.

10
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.600
So what is this data set about this data set contains four columns country age salary and poor chaste

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.150
and ten lines 10 observations.

12
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.930
And basically this contains informations of customers of some company and the first three columns are

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.140
informations of these customers like the country The Age and the salary.

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.360
And the fourth column purchased here tells if yes or no.

15
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.790
The customer but the product of the company.

16
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.420
So we have to distinguish something very important here that we will distinguish for the rest of the

17
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.550
course it's the difference between the independent variables and the dependent variables.

18
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.810
So the independent variables are the first three columns country age and salary and the dependent variable

19
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.210
is purchased here.

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.360
The fourth column and in any machine learning model we are going to use some independent variables to

21
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.460
predict a dependent variable.

22
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.800
So that means here that with this three first columns these three independent variables we are going

23
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.850
to predict if yes or no.

24
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.920
The customer purchased a product.

25
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.200
OK.

26
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.130
So that's the first distinction that we really need to understand.

27
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.600
And it's very important to do this section because the data processing steps that we're going to do

28
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.300
in this section we will have to do it for all the machine learning models we are going to make.

29
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.210
So it's really essential to know how to manage this.

30
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.180
But don't worry it's going to be very simple.

31
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.840
And besides I'm going to give you at the end of the section a templates that will allow us later to

32
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.700
prepay access to data and a flashlight for all the machine learning models we're going to make.

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.860
So I look forward to starting the steps with you.

34
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.480
And until then enjoy machine learning.
