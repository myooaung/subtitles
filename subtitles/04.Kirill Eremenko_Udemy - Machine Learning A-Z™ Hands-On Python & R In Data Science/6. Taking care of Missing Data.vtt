00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.180
Hello and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.160
Now we are finally going to start preparing the data so that our machine learning models run correctly.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.280
And the first problem that we have to deal with is the case where you have some missing data in your

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.470
data set.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.790
And that happens quite a lot actually in real life.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.060
So you have to get the trick to handle this problem and make it all good for your machine learning model

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.850
to run correctly.

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.610
So let's have a look at the data set here.

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.100
I'm going to make my Google Sheets tab OK.

10
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.150
So here is the data set.

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
And as you can see there is two missing data.

12
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.690
There is one missing data in the H column here for Spain and one missing data in the salary column for

13
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.690
Germany.

14
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.300
So how can we handle this problem.

15
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.530
Well a first idea is to remove the lines the observations where there is some missing data.

16
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.720
So what we could do is to remove this line and remove this line.

17
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.910
But that can be quite dangerous because imagine this data set contains crucial information.

18
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.060
It would be quite dangerous to remove an observation.

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.470
So we need to figure out a better idea to handle this problem.

20
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.700
And another idea and that's actually the most common idea to handle missing data is to take the mean

21
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.520
of the columns.

22
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.450
So here we are going to replace dismissing data here by the mean of all the values in the Column H.

23
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.870
And that's the same for every feature that contains missing data.

24
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.760
We replace this missing data by the mean of the values in the column that contains this missing data.

25
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.990
OK.

26
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.520
So let's do this.

27
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.400
First we need to take our data set.

28
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.810
So data set.

29
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.090
Let's start by taking care of the missing value in the age column.

30
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.810
So here we will need to take the H column and to do this and are we need to add a dollar sign here and

31
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.580
here we choose H.

32
00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.570
So by doing that data sets dollar age we're taking the column age of the dataset then we're gonna add

33
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.830
equals and then we're going to add an F else.

34
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.600
So I'm going to type if else here then parentheses in the if else function you have to input three parameters

35
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.730
the first parameter is your condition if condition.

36
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.420
The second parameter is the value you want to input if the condition is true and the cigarette matter

37
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.120
is the value you want to input if the condition is false.

38
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:30.060
So let's first input the condition the condition is going to be is that in a parenthesis dataset.

39
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:39.990
Dollar H and that's it is an A is a function that tells if the value in the function is missing or not.

40
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.040
So by putting is in a data set dollar age we are checking to see if all the values in the column age

41
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.140
are missing.

42
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.020
So this will return true if the value in the column age is missing and false if the value in the column

43
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.640
age is not missing.

44
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.910
Okay.

45
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.410
That's the condition.

46
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.820
And now the second parameter is the value that is going to be returned if the condition above is true.

47
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.410
And of course if the condition is true that means that there is a missing value.

48
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.740
And that means that we have to replace it with the average.

49
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.160
So here we are going to input as the second parameter the average of the column H again to compute the

50
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:25.750
average and R there is a simple way we can type a V then dataset assign age because we want to take

51
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.670
the column age then come up and then here we are going to add a function.

52
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.080
So we're gonna type a fund in capitals phone equals then function then function X. This is still part

53
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.240
of the R syntax we're just making a function here which is gonna be the main function and then we have

54
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.710
to specify what this function will be.

55
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.890
And so this function is of course to mean which is an existing function in R so here parentheses x come

56
00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:04.520
up and here we're just going to add an A that r m equals true and that means that we ask and that means

57
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.520
that we ask r to include the missing values when all will go through the whole Column H to compute the

58
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.670
mean of the values.

59
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.500
Now we still need to close the parenthesis here again then come out.

60
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.490
So that's it for the second parameter.

61
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.120
And now we need to add the third parameter and in European and what is it going to be while this third

62
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.980
parameter is the value you want to return if the first condition is not true.

63
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.010
That means that the value in the column age is not missing.

64
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.440
So that means that the value exists.

65
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.710
So here we are simply going to put data set

66
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.620
okay and that's done by typing this.

67
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.000
We replace the missing value in the column age by the mean of the column age itself.

68
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.240
So let's say like this and let's see what happens.

69
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.600
So command controls enter to execute and here it is and executed properly.

70
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.190
And now let's look at our data set by clicking on this tab here and good perfect.

71
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.890
The missing value that was here in the age column was replaced by the mean of the column.

72
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:07.400
Great.

73
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.590
So now let's do the same for the salary.

74
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.310
We're just going to copy this paste and we're just going to replace age by the salary.

75
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:30.720
Here here as well here as well and also here.

76
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.290
Great.

77
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.030
And now we have to be careful with something.

78
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.400
It has to be a line here.

79
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.750
So we just have to do this.

80
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.720
And same for here this.

81
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.200
Okay.

82
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.410
And now we're fine.

83
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.250
Now we're ready to select this code section here.

84
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.990
Press American shoppers enter to execute.

85
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.610
Here it is.

86
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.890
Let's check our data set and perfect the missing value in the salary that was here was replaced by the

87
00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.960
mean of the salary column sixty three thousand seven hundred seventy seven dollars.

88
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.500
Okay perfect congratulations.

89
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.000
Now you know how to take care of missing data in both python and R.

90
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.670
That's the end of the tutorial.

91
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.610
And I look forward to see you in the next tutorial.

92
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.460
The next material will be about categorical data.

93
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.910
So we will learn how to encode categorical data.

94
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.870
You will understand why we have to do this so I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.

95
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.780
And until then enjoy machine learning.
