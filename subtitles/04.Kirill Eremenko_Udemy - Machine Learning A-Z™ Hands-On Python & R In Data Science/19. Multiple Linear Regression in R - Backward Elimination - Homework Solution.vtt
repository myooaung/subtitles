00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:02.440
Hello and welcome to this art Torro.

2

00:00:02.790  -->  00:00:04.730
Well I hope the homework went well.

3

00:00:04.740  -->  00:00:08.260
I hope you obtain some interesting results.

4

00:00:08.460  -->  00:00:13.100
And without waiting I'm going to complete the backward elimination.

5

00:00:13.110  -->  00:00:17.940
Here are so that you can see if you obtained the same results as what we are about to obtain.

6

00:00:18.000  -->  00:00:23.140
And mostly so that you can see how we complete backward elimination on our up to the end.

7

00:00:23.370  -->  00:00:24.180
So let's do that.

8

00:00:24.180  -->  00:00:31.680
So in the previous tutorial we went up to building this regressors without the states independent viable

9

00:00:32.400  -->  00:00:37.170
and that's completed the step five here of the backward elimination algorithm.

10

00:00:37.170  -->  00:00:42.540
And so now we need to go back to Step 3 to look again for the independent variable that has the highest

11

00:00:42.670  -->  00:00:43.300
value.

12

00:00:43.470  -->  00:00:49.230
And then we need to compare it to the significant level to decide if we need to remove this independent

13

00:00:49.230  -->  00:00:50.920
variable with the highest P-value.

14

00:00:51.150  -->  00:00:52.170
So let's do this.

15

00:00:52.170  -->  00:00:54.150
It's actually already ready.

16

00:00:54.240  -->  00:01:00.100
We just need to select this and press command control percentage of execute.

17

00:01:00.120  -->  00:01:02.110
And here it is perfect.

18

00:01:02.130  -->  00:01:04.970
So let's move that up.

19

00:01:04.980  -->  00:01:05.720
All right.

20

00:01:05.910  -->  00:01:11.400
So as you can see here we have the new formula prophet expressed as a linear combination of all the

21

00:01:11.400  -->  00:01:14.460
independent variables except for the state.

22

00:01:14.520  -->  00:01:15.200
So that's fine.

23

00:01:15.210  -->  00:01:21.670
And here therefore we have the p values for the new team of three independent variables.

24

00:01:21.720  -->  00:01:22.120
All right.

25

00:01:22.140  -->  00:01:23.610
And now where do we see here.

26

00:01:23.650  -->  00:01:30.270
OK so we can see that of course the already spent is still highly statistically significant with three

27

00:01:30.270  -->  00:01:34.340
stars here and a very low P value and mostly what do we need to do.

28

00:01:34.340  -->  00:01:42.750
Now we need to look for the highest P value and that's actually this one 0.6 0 to 60 percent 60 percent

29

00:01:42.750  -->  00:01:48.060
is definitely a very high P-value way above the significance level of 5 percent.

30

00:01:48.060  -->  00:01:54.930
So definitely administration is not statistically significant that is Administration has no effect on

31

00:01:54.930  -->  00:01:56.440
the dependent variable profit.

32

00:01:56.880  -->  00:01:57.720
So great.

33

00:01:57.750  -->  00:01:58.840
That's pretty clear.

34

00:01:58.860  -->  00:02:03.750
We need to remove administration from our regression equation.

35

00:02:03.750  -->  00:02:04.950
So let's do this.

36

00:02:04.950  -->  00:02:14.540
As usual we're going to copy this copy paste and he will simply remove administration.

37

00:02:14.550  -->  00:02:15.380
There we go.

38

00:02:15.600  -->  00:02:17.930
And now we have our new aggressive ready.

39

00:02:17.970  -->  00:02:23.820
With only two independent variables composed of our band which we already know is highly statistically

40

00:02:23.820  -->  00:02:27.550
significant and the marketing spend marketing spend.

41

00:02:27.840  -->  00:02:29.800
So far the p value is 10 percent.

42

00:02:29.880  -->  00:02:32.080
Let's see what it will become.

43

00:02:32.070  -->  00:02:39.780
So I'm actually going to build this new model by executing this so command control and to execute.

44

00:02:39.810  -->  00:02:40.680
Here we go.

45

00:02:40.710  -->  00:02:46.670
And now let's find out about the statistical results of this regression model.

46

00:02:47.010  -->  00:02:50.400
Let's select this press command and control press enter to execute.

47

00:02:50.700  -->  00:02:56.460
And here are then used to DiCicco results with only the p values of the two independent variables already

48

00:02:56.530  -->  00:02:58.160
spent in marketing spend.

49

00:02:58.520  -->  00:03:01.830
OK so let's see well there is something interesting here.

50

00:03:01.830  -->  00:03:02.740
Can you see it.

51

00:03:02.940  -->  00:03:06.540
Well first R.D.Spend is still highly statistically significant.

52

00:03:06.690  -->  00:03:08.140
No surprise about that.

53

00:03:08.220  -->  00:03:11.150
But we actually have one surprise here.

54

00:03:11.160  -->  00:03:15.630
Remember the value of the marketing spend was 10 percent at the previous step.

55

00:03:15.720  -->  00:03:17.120
Now it's 6 percent.

56

00:03:17.520  -->  00:03:19.460
And actually we want a dot here.

57

00:03:19.590  -->  00:03:25.950
You know we jumped from this category between 10 percent and 1 to this category between 5 percent and

58

00:03:25.950  -->  00:03:26.490
10 percent.

59

00:03:26.490  -->  00:03:32.730
So we actually have a done now for this marketing spend independent viable Plus it's very close to the

60

00:03:32.730  -->  00:03:35.670
significance level it's very close to 5 percent.

61

00:03:35.760  -->  00:03:41.670
You know for example if our significant level was 7 percent we would have kept this independent viable

62

00:03:41.670  -->  00:03:42.800
marketing spend.

63

00:03:42.810  -->  00:03:44.730
So it's kind of arbitrary.

64

00:03:44.730  -->  00:03:50.820
You know we we don't know if we really need to remove this just because our backward nation tells us

65

00:03:50.820  -->  00:03:56.850
to due to the fact that we made an arbitrary choice of 5 percent for the significance level.

66

00:03:56.850  -->  00:04:03.150
So since this is a tutorial about backward elimination we will actually remove it but this will not

67

00:04:03.150  -->  00:04:08.820
be our final word because at the end of this part there will be this section about evaluating models

68

00:04:08.820  -->  00:04:16.080
performance and will actually add a criterion to make a better call at deciding if we really need to

69

00:04:16.080  -->  00:04:22.920
remove this marketing spend because right now the call to remove this marketing spend in the Bible is

70

00:04:22.980  -->  00:04:24.160
arbitrary.

71

00:04:24.270  -->  00:04:31.660
So we will remove it because we want to follow Thorley the backward elimination algorithm but keep that

72

00:04:31.680  -->  00:04:37.200
in mind that it's not a final word about deciding what's the final team is going to be and we will get

73

00:04:37.200  -->  00:04:43.380
back to this problem later in this course that is later in this part to make a better call about whether

74

00:04:43.380  -->  00:04:45.540
we need to remove yes or no marketing spend.

75

00:04:45.600  -->  00:04:47.250
So let's remove it for now.

76

00:04:47.400  -->  00:04:51.570
That's actually the final solution but it's really a good choice of yours.

77

00:04:51.600  -->  00:04:57.000
If you actually decided to keep marketing spend you will be proud of this choice at the end of this

78

00:04:57.000  -->  00:04:57.750
part.

79

00:04:57.780  -->  00:04:59.170
So congratulations.

80

00:04:59.220  -->  00:05:04.950
Anyway if you decided to keep marketing spend and of course also congratulations to the others who decided

81

00:05:04.950  -->  00:05:10.590
to remove marketing spend because that means you just followed Thorley the backward elimination algorithm

82

00:05:10.610  -->  00:05:10.740
.

83

00:05:10.860  -->  00:05:13.010
So congratulations to both of you.

84

00:05:13.200  -->  00:05:19.620
And let's finish this backward elimination algorithm because actually you know this is definitely the

85

00:05:19.620  -->  00:05:20.760
final step.

86

00:05:20.760  -->  00:05:26.070
We have only one independent variable left our knees bent and we already know it's highly statistically

87

00:05:26.070  -->  00:05:31.770
significant but it's actually made this model by selecting and executing this.

88

00:05:31.770  -->  00:05:32.520
Here we go.

89

00:05:32.580  -->  00:05:33.640
Model created.

90

00:05:33.810  -->  00:05:39.670
And now let's have a final look at the statistical information of our model.

91

00:05:39.810  -->  00:05:42.480
So let's press committer control pass and to execute.

92

00:05:42.720  -->  00:05:50.070
And here are the final informations of the final optimal team a team that is actually composed of one

93

00:05:50.130  -->  00:05:53.520
independent variable so that's actually funny to call it a team.

94

00:05:53.520  -->  00:06:00.600
But anyway that's just a team of one that happens but wait for the final part to see if a team of one

95

00:06:00.930  -->  00:06:02.640
can really be the best team.

96

00:06:03.090  -->  00:06:06.410
So that said we actually completed backward elimination.

97

00:06:06.450  -->  00:06:09.960
Our final model is composed of only one independent variable.

98

00:06:09.960  -->  00:06:16.050
The R&D spend and we can clearly see that this independent variable is highly statistically significant

99

00:06:16.350  -->  00:06:21.290
not only because we have three stars here but also because the P-value is really really small.

100

00:06:21.300  -->  00:06:26.960
So definitely that's a very precious information for the investors that should really look at this in

101

00:06:26.970  -->  00:06:32.520
the Benvar able to add another criterion into their investment decisions.

102

00:06:32.520  -->  00:06:39.360
So again congratulations to both of you who either found a final team of only one independent variable

103

00:06:39.720  -->  00:06:43.560
the only spanne or final team of two independent variables.

104

00:06:43.710  -->  00:06:45.830
The R&D spend and the marketing spend.

105

00:06:46.020  -->  00:06:51.000
And for those of you who found another team make sure to compare the steps that you did yourself with

106

00:06:51.000  -->  00:06:57.090
the steps that we did in the Statoil to spot which difference led you to different results you can always

107

00:06:57.090  -->  00:06:58.950
ask some questions in the Q&A.

108

00:06:59.040  -->  00:07:00.960
I'll be happy to help you with your model.

109

00:07:01.050  -->  00:07:06.480
But clearly the final team is either the R&D spend or the R&D spend plus the marketing spend and that's

110

00:07:06.480  -->  00:07:08.160
where we also obtain in Python.

111

00:07:08.340  -->  00:07:14.280
And that's what you will also obtain in some other programming language or machine or any package.

112

00:07:14.280  -->  00:07:16.020
So thank you for watching the Statoil.

113

00:07:16.020  -->  00:07:17.430
Congratulations again.

114

00:07:17.460  -->  00:07:19.350
I hope you enjoyed doing this homework.

115

00:07:19.380  -->  00:07:24.390
You will have some other homeworks in the other parts so you'll definitely practice which will help

116

00:07:24.390  -->  00:07:28.130
you shape your expertise in machine learning.

117

00:07:28.140  -->  00:07:31.850
And speaking of machine learning I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.

118

00:07:31.950  -->  00:07:34.120
And until then enjoy machine learning.
