00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:05,250
Hello and welcome back to the course on machine learning in the Bruce tutorials we learned quite a lot

2

00:00:05,250  -->  00:00:10,290
about the Kamins algorithm we talked about how it works in the background we actually performed.

3

00:00:10,290  -->  00:00:13,410
Emmanuel Kamins algorithm which was lots of fun.

4

00:00:13,470  -->  00:00:20,730
Then we talked about the random installation trap and what the Kamins plus plus is and it all the scenarios

5

00:00:20,760  -->  00:00:26,150
we kind of worked with a pre-determined number of classers where those two clusters of three clusters

6

00:00:26,670  -->  00:00:34,400
and we talked about somehow finding out the correct number of clusters for a given data size problem

7

00:00:34,400  -->  00:00:34,670
.

8

00:00:34,920  -->  00:00:41,190
In today's tutorial actually going to talk about the algorithm behind finding out the right number of

9

00:00:41,280  -->  00:00:42,060
clusters.

10

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:48,750
So we'll learn how to decide what number of clusters to input into your Kamins algorithm.

11

00:00:48,780  -->  00:00:50,550
So let's get straight into it.

12

00:00:50,880  -->  00:00:54,650
Here we've got a challenge or a design problem.

13

00:00:54,660  -->  00:00:58,320
Again we've got only two variables x and y coordinates.

14

00:00:58,320  -->  00:01:04,770
Just for simplicity's sake inreality can be any number of columns or variables and you have got the

15

00:01:04,770  -->  00:01:07,130
scatterplot for presenting our daughter said.

16

00:01:07,170  -->  00:01:15,690
Now if we are Iran the K means clustering algorithm on this dataset with three clusters or with K pre-determine

17

00:01:15,690  -->  00:01:19,480
to be three then the result will look something like this.

18

00:01:19,650  -->  00:01:24,840
And not just something like this but exactly like this we've got the three clusters that have been identified

19

00:01:24,870  -->  00:01:30,600
and we already know that we would need to run the Kamins plus plus algorithm just to avoid the random

20

00:01:30,600  -->  00:01:31,560
selection trap.

21

00:01:31,560  -->  00:01:35,390
But again for simplicity's sake which is going to call the Kamins algorithm.

22

00:01:35,490  -->  00:01:38,420
So we've got three clusters.

23

00:01:38,440  -->  00:01:39,020
No.

24

00:01:39,060  -->  00:01:44,340
In order to understand if for instance two clusters would have been better in this scenario or maybe

25

00:01:44,340  -->  00:01:46,320
10 clusters would have been better.

26

00:01:46,320  -->  00:01:54,300
We need a certain metric we need a way to understand or evaluate how a certain number of clusters performs

27

00:01:54,540  -->  00:02:00,220
compared to a different number of clusters and preferably that metric should be quantifiable.

28

00:02:00,330  -->  00:02:06,690
So what kind of metric can we impose upon our clustering algorithm that will tell us something about

29

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:07,800
the final result.

30

00:02:08,070  -->  00:02:12,510
And there is such a metric is called the within cluster sum of squares.

31

00:02:12,660  -->  00:02:17,700
Hence the WCR says on the left hand that is the formula how it's calculated.

32

00:02:17,700  -->  00:02:19,980
This is an example for three clusters.

33

00:02:20,010  -->  00:02:20,590
No.

34

00:02:20,610  -->  00:02:27,320
At first glance this formula might look a bit overwhelming or complex but in reality it's super simple

35

00:02:27,330  -->  00:02:33,720
so in line with our mission making the complex simple let's break it all down what is going on here

36

00:02:33,740  -->  00:02:33,890
.

37

00:02:34,020  -->  00:02:40,620
Well we've got the three elements and each has some so this symbol stands for some each sum is calculated

38

00:02:40,620  -->  00:02:45,980
for each cluster in fact it's calculated within that cluster hence the W at the start.

39

00:02:45,990  -->  00:02:47,880
So let's look at one of them.

40

00:02:47,880  -->  00:02:49,670
Let's look at the central one for instance.

41

00:02:49,710  -->  00:02:53,140
Here we are taking every point inside cluster 2.

42

00:02:53,290  -->  00:03:01,290
That's exactly what is written out here and this is not a valid way to write this obviously just write

43

00:03:01,790  -->  00:03:08,370
up P with the index eyes and cyclists or two and we go and take a summer across those points and what

44

00:03:08,370  -->  00:03:16,080
we're summing is a distance between each point inside closer to and the centroid of cluster 2 and then

45

00:03:16,080  -->  00:03:17,590
we squaring the distance.

46

00:03:17,700  -->  00:03:21,110
So we taking some of those squared distances.

47

00:03:21,120  -->  00:03:25,920
So now if we have a look at our chart I'm going to keep the WCR says on the left.

48

00:03:25,920  -->  00:03:30,690
So for instance we're closer to there it is we're taking the centroid and we're calculating the distance

49

00:03:30,690  -->  00:03:35,270
to every single point so to that point then we're square with squaring it to that point then risk wearing

50

00:03:35,270  -->  00:03:38,810
it to that point then we're squaring it to that point we're squaring it.

51

00:03:38,820  -->  00:03:40,230
And so on.

52

00:03:40,230  -->  00:03:47,580
So we take the square the sum of all the squares of all these distances and we're summing it.

53

00:03:47,700  -->  00:03:48,810
And then we're doing that.

54

00:03:48,810  -->  00:03:50,520
So we're doing it for the first cluster.

55

00:03:50,580  -->  00:03:55,860
We're doing that for a second closer and we're doing that for the third cluster as well.

56

00:03:55,860  -->  00:03:59,510
And so as a result we get this total of some.

57

00:03:59,520  -->  00:04:04,280
So the full sum and that is going to be our metric.

58

00:04:04,290  -->  00:04:11,520
And actually it's a quite a good metric in terms of understanding or comparing the goodness of fit between

59

00:04:11,700  -->  00:04:14,970
two different Kamins cluster rings and how do we know that.

60

00:04:14,970  -->  00:04:21,600
Well let's have a look let's rewind back to when we had one closer let's see how that metric WCA says

61

00:04:21,600  -->  00:04:25,950
it's going to change as we increase the number of clusters.

62

00:04:25,950  -->  00:04:26,220
All right.

63

00:04:26,220  -->  00:04:31,800
So there is our chart with just the one cluster as you can see that is our centroid.

64

00:04:31,800  -->  00:04:36,300
And for every single point we have to measure the distance between that point and the centroid then

65

00:04:36,300  -->  00:04:42,090
you have to square that distance and then we'll have to add all those distances up as you can see it

66

00:04:42,180  -->  00:04:48,780
will get quite a large value because this centroid is quite moved away from the points they all have

67

00:04:48,780  -->  00:04:50,640
to reach towards it.

68

00:04:50,670  -->  00:04:57,060
So let's just visually remember what this looks like and that will help us kind of remember what that

69

00:04:57,060  -->  00:05:01,220
distance is not in terms of absolute value but just what it feels like.

70

00:05:01,220  -->  00:05:05,430
It's quite a large distance right now so I'm going to increase the number of clusters to two and let's

71

00:05:05,430  -->  00:05:07,200
see how everything changes.

72

00:05:07,230  -->  00:05:08,730
So there we go that's two clusters.

73

00:05:08,730  -->  00:05:12,390
And as you can see now sort of having once intro in the middle we have to centroid.

74

00:05:12,390  -->  00:05:17,850
So each one of these points no longer has to reach all the way to the middle or the distance doesn't

75

00:05:17,850  -->  00:05:17,910
.

76

00:05:17,910  -->  00:05:19,100
Isn't that great.

77

00:05:19,110  -->  00:05:24,540
All you have to do is just calculate distance to this centroid as it gets less and then for the Central

78

00:05:24,540  -->  00:05:29,970
is for all of them here as well the distance to this centroid is less They don't have to reach all the

79

00:05:29,970  -->  00:05:33,300
way to the middle when you're calculating a distance.

80

00:05:33,300  -->  00:05:34,110
So there we go.

81

00:05:34,110  -->  00:05:41,790
That means that the total distance or the total WCA says that we see here is going to be less than when

82

00:05:41,790  -->  00:05:43,030
we had one central.

83

00:05:43,050  -->  00:05:46,290
Now once again we're going to increase the number of clusters this time to three.

84

00:05:46,290  -->  00:05:50,290
So just remember visually what two clusters looks like.

85

00:05:50,520  -->  00:05:53,300
And then we'll compare to the next image.

86

00:05:53,310  -->  00:05:54,060
So there we go.

87

00:05:54,090  -->  00:05:56,550
Now we have three clusters.

88

00:05:56,790  -->  00:06:02,170
And as you can see nothing change in close one so this does this some is going to be the same.

89

00:06:02,220  -->  00:06:06,400
These two sums have changed so now it's sort of a one cluster.

90

00:06:06,450  -->  00:06:11,620
These two groups of points are recognized as separate clusters and therefore they have their own centroid

91

00:06:11,670  -->  00:06:17,220
and the distance has again decreased because you can see now all these points are closer to their own

92

00:06:17,220  -->  00:06:20,020
centroid than they were to the century which is in the middle.

93

00:06:20,010  -->  00:06:25,560
And again these points are closer to this centroid overall than they were to the centroid here in the

94

00:06:25,560  -->  00:06:26,100
middle.

95

00:06:26,250  -->  00:06:30,240
So therefore as you can see that WCA says distance is decreasing.

96

00:06:30,450  -->  00:06:32,080
And what is the limit of that.

97

00:06:32,100  -->  00:06:34,870
How far will it keep decrease decreasing.

98

00:06:35,060  -->  00:06:40,010
Well let's think about it let's say we increase the number of clusters to 4 5 6 and so on.

99

00:06:40,050  -->  00:06:43,340
How many clusters maximum Can we have.

100

00:06:43,560  -->  00:06:48,840
Well we can have as many clusters as there are points or elements in our data set.

101

00:06:48,840  -->  00:06:53,400
So as many points as we see on our chart that's how many cluster we have we can have so if we are 50

102

00:06:53,400  -->  00:06:59,610
points we can have up to 50 clusters because after all we're 50 or after you go over the number of points

103

00:07:00,030  -->  00:07:04,690
there's no more points to actually cluster every single point has its own cluster.

104

00:07:04,890  -->  00:07:09,090
So and in that case what will the WC assess equate to.

105

00:07:09,270  -->  00:07:10,930
I'll give you a second if you wanted.

106

00:07:10,920  -->  00:07:16,560
You can pose this video just to think about that for a second if if we've reached the number of Klosters

107

00:07:16,890  -->  00:07:22,560
equivalent to the number of points in our chart or the number of which is the same thing as the number

108

00:07:22,560  -->  00:07:26,830
of elements and our daughter said then what does WCA says equate to.

109

00:07:27,210  -->  00:07:28,680
And exactly right.

110

00:07:28,680  -->  00:07:35,040
The WC assessed will equate to zero because every single point has its own cluster and therefore has

111

00:07:35,040  -->  00:07:40,470
its own centroid and that centroid is going to be exactly where that point is and therefore the distance

112

00:07:40,470  -->  00:07:42,450
between the point and centroid is going to be zero.

113

00:07:42,520  -->  00:07:46,910
If you square that is going to be zero and if you add up all the squares is still going to be 0.

114

00:07:47,040  -->  00:07:54,690
So as we can see the WC SS will decrease from a substantial value when we have one closer all the way

115

00:07:54,690  -->  00:07:57,300
down to zero as we increase the number of clusters.

116

00:07:57,330  -->  00:07:59,120
So it is a good metric.

117

00:07:59,130  -->  00:08:04,530
But at the same time it's constantly decreasing right so it's constantly getting better and better and

118

00:08:04,530  -->  00:08:04,850
better.

119

00:08:04,870  -->  00:08:10,390
And that's because as you can see the less the WCR says or the higher the number of close is the better

120

00:08:10,380  -->  00:08:16,140
the goodness of fit we were fitting our data better and better and better and therefore the lesser the

121

00:08:16,140  -->  00:08:18,000
WCR says the better.

122

00:08:18,030  -->  00:08:20,530
The goodness of fit is deemed to be.

123

00:08:20,670  -->  00:08:23,000
But how do we find the optimal goodness of fit.

124

00:08:23,010  -->  00:08:24,650
Yes it keeps getting better.

125

00:08:24,840  -->  00:08:29,970
But is there a sacrifice that comes with that improvement and that is exactly the case.

126

00:08:29,970  -->  00:08:31,930
Let's have a look at this visual chart.

127

00:08:32,220  -->  00:08:36,330
This charter presents how the WC assessed changes as we increase the number of clusters.

128

00:08:36,390  -->  00:08:40,570
And as you can see at the start the WCA says starts at quite a large number.

129

00:08:40,620  -->  00:08:46,470
It doesn't really matter what this number is measured in what the absolute value is and things like

130

00:08:46,470  -->  00:08:46,870
that.

131

00:08:46,950  -->  00:08:52,980
What matters is how it changes so the relative comparison between different k means clustering methods

132

00:08:52,990  -->  00:08:55,100
with the different number of clusters.

133

00:08:55,140  -->  00:09:01,980
So you can see here that it jump from 8000 down to 3000 that's a massive change of 5000 let's just call

134

00:09:01,990  -->  00:09:07,200
them units 5000 units and then from 3000 as we increase the number of close from two to 3 they jump

135

00:09:07,240  -->  00:09:08,930
from 3000 to 1000.

136

00:09:09,000  -->  00:09:11,080
Again quite a large drop.

137

00:09:11,350  -->  00:09:16,500
And then from three to four what's going to happen is going to jump from 1000 to maybe eight hundred

138

00:09:16,500  -->  00:09:24,270
and from 800 to 600 600 to 500 and so on so as you can see the first two improvements or first two changes

139

00:09:24,270  -->  00:09:32,440
from one cluster to two from two to three created some huge jumps or huge drops in the WTS going forward

140

00:09:32,430  -->  00:09:32,480
.

141

00:09:32,490  -->  00:09:35,530
The WCR says drops not substantially.

142

00:09:35,670  -->  00:09:40,990
And this is our hint at selecting the optimum optimal number of clusters and the method we're going

143

00:09:40,980  -->  00:09:44,690
to use is the elbow method and it is actually very visual.

144

00:09:44,830  -->  00:09:50,260
All you have to do is look at your chart and look for that change or that's kind of like it does look

145

00:09:50,250  -->  00:09:50,940
like an elbow.

146

00:09:50,940  -->  00:09:58,540
Look for that elbow in your chart where the drop goes from being quite substantial to being not as substantial

147

00:09:58,530  -->  00:10:05,160
not as proven is not as great and therefore that point in your chart is going to be the optimal number

148

00:10:05,160  -->  00:10:06,210
of clusters.

149

00:10:06,340  -->  00:10:09,400
In this case it is indeed three clusters.

150

00:10:09,390  -->  00:10:11,320
That is the optimal number.

151

00:10:11,520  -->  00:10:14,140
And as you can imagine this method is quite arbitrary.

152

00:10:14,130  -->  00:10:21,870
So sometimes the situations are not as obvious sometimes the elbow might not be as evident as in this

153

00:10:21,880  -->  00:10:27,330
case and therefore somebody might pick one number of clusters someone else might come along and pick

154

00:10:27,340  -->  00:10:27,720
a number.

155

00:10:27,720  -->  00:10:28,940
Another number of clusters.

156

00:10:29,040  -->  00:10:33,840
But that is a judgment call that you need to make as a data scientist.

157

00:10:33,880  -->  00:10:37,700
Sometimes you need to decide on how your Narses going to be structured.

158

00:10:37,710  -->  00:10:44,040
And this is one of those cases because you are deciding what type of k means clustering algorithm to

159

00:10:44,040  -->  00:10:46,960
run your inputting that value of k.

160

00:10:47,160  -->  00:10:54,210
And yes it can be arbitrary but if you're not really sure then you just need to kind of run the Kamins

161

00:10:54,390  -->  00:10:59,200
for instance with three look at it before look at it refer to and see what the difference is and make

162

00:10:59,190  -->  00:11:06,570
that judgment call on which k you think is optimal for your analysis because ultimately you are the

163

00:11:06,580  -->  00:11:13,350
person creating this analysis and you need to decide which number of clusters optimal so the Elbel method

164

00:11:13,360  -->  00:11:17,620
is just a an approach that can help you make that decision.

165

00:11:17,620  -->  00:11:20,430
But at the end of day it is your decision.

166

00:11:20,430  -->  00:11:21,330
So there we go.

167

00:11:21,340  -->  00:11:30,270
Hopefully you enjoy this tutorial and now your arsenal of k means clustering is quite broad.

168

00:11:30,270  -->  00:11:35,800
You have quite a few tools in there and I can wait for you to jump into the practical application of

169

00:11:35,790  -->  00:11:43,500
this method had the lean has prepared some very interesting code challenges for you and you'll be working

170

00:11:43,530  -->  00:11:47,370
with this method BAHFEN our Python is going to be very exciting.

171

00:11:47,380  -->  00:11:48,290
So good luck with that.

172

00:11:48,340  -->  00:11:49,420
I'll see you next time.

173

00:11:49,410  -->  00:11:51,330
And until then in Germany learning
