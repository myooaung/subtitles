00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,260
Hello and welcome back to the course on machine learning.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,690
Today we're continuing exploring Association rule learning and we're talking about the intuition behind

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,260
the Ekla model.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,270
So the cloud model is very very simple.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:21,150
After we have already studied the a priori model it's kind of like a simplified version.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,550
All right so let's have a look.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,360
It also talks about the and also talks about people who are bored also bored.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:37,150
So it's kind of like a recommender system and similar to what we had in the a priori algorithm.

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,270
Here we've got for instance movies and we've got some potential rules so basically exactly the same

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,680
things.

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:52,550
If you've got your movie lists people the movies that people liked people who like movie 1 or just generally

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,830
looks like if somebody likes movie one they are very like it's like movie too if they like the movie

13
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,520
too.

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,490
They're likely to like me before if they're like movie one they might like movie three.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,120
Again these rules have will have different strengths.

16
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,310
But here we are are actually going to be talking about rules per se because the cloud model is different

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,820
to the a priori model.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,040
In the current model we came up with rules towards and that's output and we based on the lift we could

19
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,400
judge the strength of a tool.

20
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,810
Whereas here we are going to be talking about sets and you'll see why just now.

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,440
So here we've got the market basket as optimization.

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,170
Same thing that people who buy burgers are likely to buy French fries as well.

23
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,330
People who buy vegetables are likely to buy fruits and these are just some potential rules.

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,640
I'm not saying they're strong some potential outcomes that we're looking at we're not saying that they're

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,310
strong when we're not selecting and we're just saying what could potentially be and then the cloud model

26
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,210
is responsible for actually going through all of these combinations and telling us what we should focus

27
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,740
on.

28
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,030
All right.

29
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:12,280
So in the cloud model just like in the a priori model we have the support factor.

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,810
So they're pressing them every model we have or the algorithm we had support we had confidence and we

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,110
had Lyft in their Clamato we only have support.

32
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,380
So we only are looking at OK.

33
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,070
So people who are watching a certain certain combinations of movies.

34
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,780
How often does this happen.

35
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,990
And here just bear in mind that doesn't mean that just one move and this was the same for a priori it

36
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:47,280
was just easier for us to understand intuition based on one movie or one product but actually M and

37
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,750
I what they stand for is a set of items or a set of.

38
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:59,310
So as specifically in the cloud model it's doesn't really make sense to look at you know an item by

39
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,750
itself because we don't have the confidence and the lift factors we're only looking at support so we're

40
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,910
just looking at how frequently does this set of items occur.

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,840
So if we're just going to look at a set of item of items which contains only one item then we just looking

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,720
at the frequency at how what does the popularity of movies and that is very trivial so we're not going

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,270
to be looking at.

44
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:30,360
We're going to be aiming for at least two items in a set and therefore m here stands for a set of two

45
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,680
movies or more.

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,270
And what we're calculating for support we're calculating.

47
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,230
Okay what it is.

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,500
How often does this set off to movies that say interstellar and ex machina.

49
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,280
How often does it occur in all of the watch lists or what percentage of watch lists or what percentage

50
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,460
of

51
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,180
lists of movies that people liked contain.

52
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,670
Those two together not just one of them but those two together.

53
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:11,280
And let's say if if hypothetically if 100 percent of the lists that you had in a large dataset contain

54
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,450
both movies together then that would imply that you know anybody who likes interstellar or ex machina

55
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,370
in real life ex machina Lex and Stella and pretty much so if anybody has seen even one of those movies

56
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,820
that you need to recommend that movie.

57
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:34,350
The other one to them if you or if you had like 80 percent of the list of your lists had those two movies

58
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,720
together that basically mean there's a high likelihood that they come in pairs right.

59
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,550
That if somebody liked one of them then they'll like the same thing.

60
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,750
Fortunes action like if you have chips and burgers in you know 75 percent of all of your orders right

61
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,970
then if somebody is just buying burgers then they're likely to.

62
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,460
Then when you recommend chips to them there's a 75 percent chance that they will also be interested

63
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,110
or will like to buy chips with their burgers.

64
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,520
And that's it's a very very trivial approach.

65
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,020
And that's my shit that's all there is to their Klugh model.

66
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:18,540
It's much faster and the steps involved are set a minimum support so you want to set up a support level

67
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:25,500
at which you want to only offer below which you want to disregard anything.

68
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,510
Then you take all the subsets in transactions having higher support and support.

69
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,370
And then you saw the subset in decreasing support.

70
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:40,470
And basically at the top you will have the most the strongest combinations of items which you should

71
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,430
look at.

72
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,730
Maybe you know you'll look at the top 10 or top five or something like that.

73
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,230
So that's pretty much it.

74
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,270
That's all the cloud model is.

75
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,260
And as you can see it's much easier to understand after you're you know a bit about the a priori.

76
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:55,590
All right.

77
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:02,190
Hope you enjoyed this tutorial and off we go to had lunch to implement this in practice and I'll see

78
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:02,960
you here next time.

79
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,350
And so then happy analyzing.
