1

00:00:01,170  -->  00:00:06,510
And finally interpreting coefficients in front of us here we've got the four models that we built in

2

00:00:06,510  -->  00:00:09,200
our backward elimination method.

3

00:00:09,420  -->  00:00:13,810
And as we agreed multiple three is the best one is the best fitted model.

4

00:00:13,890  -->  00:00:17,270
And if we were to deliver a model on our project it would be this one.

5

00:00:17,280  -->  00:00:20,380
So let's go ahead and start in Chippering coefficient by looking at this model.

6

00:00:20,790  -->  00:00:22,350
Here we've got two variables.

7

00:00:22,380  -->  00:00:24,260
R&D spend and marketing spend.

8

00:00:24,260  -->  00:00:29,310
So it's basically how much companies are spending on their research and development and on their marketing

9

00:00:29,320  -->  00:00:29,630
.

10

00:00:29,880  -->  00:00:33,270
And we will also get the constant And we were predicting profit.

11

00:00:33,570  -->  00:00:38,850
So these coefficients here these B 1 and B 2.

12

00:00:39,630  -->  00:00:41,850
What they're telling us is that.

13

00:00:42,190  -->  00:00:44,420
So how how to interpret them.

14

00:00:44,460  -->  00:00:51,840
First of all you look at the sign if the sign is positive that means your variable is correlated with

15

00:00:51,840  -->  00:00:56,820
your independent variable is collated with your dependent variable.

16

00:00:56,820  -->  00:01:05,310
Meaning that if you change the value of your independent variable then the value then you can see that

17

00:01:05,370  -->  00:01:09,350
the dependent variable will be changing in the same direction.

18

00:01:09,390  -->  00:01:14,820
So basically if you'll be increasing spend on R&D then you're profitable be increasing If increasing

19

00:01:14,820  -->  00:01:18,060
spend or marking then your profit is also increasing which makes sense right.

20

00:01:18,060  -->  00:01:24,780
So if you spending more in research and development making a party better than probably your profits

21

00:01:24,780  -->  00:01:26,580
should increase eventually as well.

22

00:01:26,580  -->  00:01:27,480
Same thing with marketing.

23

00:01:27,480  -->  00:01:32,770
The more you spend marketing the more you sell and therefore the profit should also go up.

24

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:38,460
And that's the sign if the sign is negative if the sign were negative then it's the opposite effect

25

00:01:38,460  -->  00:01:38,520
.

26

00:01:38,520  -->  00:01:43,810
So basically increase your depende variable and you depend variable decreases.

27

00:01:43,870  -->  00:01:45,370
And now let's look at the magnitude.

28

00:01:45,390  -->  00:01:52,140
So here you can see right away that magnitude is higher foreign disband and the magnitude is law for

29

00:01:52,320  -->  00:01:56,130
marking spent magnitude is always tricky were regressions.

30

00:01:56,130  -->  00:01:59,760
Be careful of magnitude sign is kind of you know pretty obvious.

31

00:01:59,760  -->  00:02:04,190
It's either it's one way or the other magnitude can really trip you up.

32

00:02:04,200  -->  00:02:07,960
And I can give you an example here so you might think that OK right away.

33

00:02:08,040  -->  00:02:13,920
Magnitude is greater so this this coefficient for R&D spend is bigger than the market spend coefficient

34

00:02:13,920  -->  00:02:16,700
So definitely R&D spend has a bigger impact.

35

00:02:16,980  -->  00:02:22,170
Well what if I tell you that I could easily fall changing anything in the regression.

36

00:02:22,170  -->  00:02:29,690
I could easily make this coefficient bigger by a law by a thousand times bigger than R&D spend.

37

00:02:30,180  -->  00:02:31,410
Well it's easy to do.

38

00:02:31,410  -->  00:02:35,570
All I have to do is say marketing spend instead of looking at it in dollars.

39

00:02:35,570  -->  00:02:43,140
How about I look at it in a fraction of a cent so every market is all of this could incense so marketing

40

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:48,690
spend instead of counting an adult is counted and cents right away because our variable has gone down

41

00:02:48,690  -->  00:02:49,970
a hundred times.

42

00:02:50,130  -->  00:02:55,980
All catfish and will proportionally increase so it'll go up a hundred times and if I change my data

43

00:02:56,010  -->  00:03:02,130
and replace everywhere marketing spend half cents and everything else I will leave the same then run

44

00:03:02,130  -->  00:03:08,220
this model I guarantee you that the coefficient here will actually become 2.9 9.

45

00:03:08,220  -->  00:03:09,650
It'll just increase a 100 times.

46

00:03:09,660  -->  00:03:11,290
Everything else will stay the same.

47

00:03:11,400  -->  00:03:13,600
And that way right away you'll see oh wow.

48

00:03:13,620  -->  00:03:20,820
The market is Benke of sions greater so than market has been has a bigger impact on your dependent Berbel

49

00:03:20,820  -->  00:03:26,670
profit and that's a mistake that a lot of beginners make you should not fall into this trap Magot it

50

00:03:26,670  -->  00:03:34,860
is a tricky thing and the way to think about it is always say magnitude in terms of units of the independent

51

00:03:34,860  -->  00:03:35,400
variable.

52

00:03:35,400  -->  00:03:40,950
So the correct way to analyze this is even if not knowing what they're measured and maybe this was measured

53

00:03:40,950  -->  00:03:43,280
in thousands of dollars and this was measured in dollars.

54

00:03:43,400  -->  00:03:49,320
I don't know for instance although I do I do know of course I've seen the data but if say I don't know

55

00:03:49,450  -->  00:03:59,310
the you can still make a conclusion you just have to say this is R&D spend has a greater impact on profit

56

00:04:00,000  -->  00:04:08,460
per unit of R&D spend then marketing then marketing spend has per unit of marketing spend and that's

57

00:04:08,460  -->  00:04:08,590
all.

58

00:04:08,590  -->  00:04:15,420
So basically even if they're measured in different things by saying per unit of the underlying variable

59

00:04:15,720  -->  00:04:22,320
you are protecting yourself from that error that you know they are they are measured in different things

60

00:04:22,340  -->  00:04:22,700
.

61

00:04:22,950  -->  00:04:30,240
And moreover Imagine if they're measured $100 are the ones measured in kilometers or something that

62

00:04:30,240  -->  00:04:31,800
you can compare dollars in kilometers.

63

00:04:31,800  -->  00:04:32,030
Right.

64

00:04:32,040  -->  00:04:34,300
But you can always say per unit.

65

00:04:34,530  -->  00:04:41,910
And this leads us to the actual interpretation of these variables or these coefficients What does it

66

00:04:41,910  -->  00:04:42,270
mean.

67

00:04:42,360  -->  00:04:50,600
So this means 0.7 9 means that for every unit if you keep all other variables constant so you only have

68

00:04:50,600  -->  00:04:57,450
on a verbal So if you keep everything else constant but you are able to adjust R&D spend for in this

69

00:04:57,450  -->  00:05:05,550
model or for it for a hypothetical company for every dollar for every unit of R&D spend that you increase

70

00:05:05,940  -->  00:05:11,970
your profit will increase according to his model your profit will increase by 79 cents.

71

00:05:12,030  -->  00:05:15,370
Thats exactly what this coefficient is saying.

72

00:05:15,370  -->  00:05:22,140
And so for every unit that you decrease in your R&D spend your profit will decrease by seventy point

73

00:05:22,140  -->  00:05:24,580
seventy nine over unit of profit.

74

00:05:25,050  -->  00:05:31,620
And because R&D spend is mission dollars and profit is also $2 that means so for every unit increase

75

00:05:31,710  -->  00:05:39,360
in for every dollar increase in R&D spend your profit will increase in by 79 cents.

76

00:05:39,870  -->  00:05:47,880
So let let me just repeat that again that you are looking at units increase in R&D spend they translate

77

00:05:47,880  -->  00:05:51,730
through this coefficient into units increase in profit.

78

00:05:51,750  -->  00:05:59,700
So if your profit was measured in apples then a 1 dollar increase of 1 unit increase is always going

79

00:05:59,700  -->  00:06:07,610
to be true one unit increase in R&D spend will drive point seventy nine unit increase in profit and

80

00:06:07,690  -->  00:06:09,990
off of course of the profit units.

81

00:06:09,990  -->  00:06:17,460
So lets turn and turn that into dollars and apples a one dollar increase in R&D spend will drive a point

82

00:06:17,480  -->  00:06:22,040
79 or 80 percent of an apple increase in profits.

83

00:06:22,050  -->  00:06:28,920
So here you are talking about units of R&D spend and profit you are talking about units of profit and

84

00:06:28,980  -->  00:06:30,210
this coefficient.

85

00:06:30,210  -->  00:06:31,650
It links them together.

86

00:06:31,710  -->  00:06:34,430
So as long as you say per unit you're fine.

87

00:06:34,740  -->  00:06:39,870
Once you already know what these variables are measured and then you can start comparing them if they're

88

00:06:39,870  -->  00:06:43,520
on the same scale and in this case they are on the same scale because they measured everything is measured

89

00:06:43,520  -->  00:06:52,260
in dollars here and you can say that a dollar increase in R&D spend drives 79 cents dull 79 cents increase

90

00:06:52,260  -->  00:06:59,670
in profit and mark a dollar increase in marketing spend drives only 3 cents increase in profits so basically

91

00:06:59,850  -->  00:07:04,890
if you're the venture capitalist which companies are going to invest in well from this model you're

92

00:07:04,890  -->  00:07:10,280
going to decide that you should invest into companies that are spending more on their R&D.

93

00:07:10,800  -->  00:07:15,390
There may be lots of reasons behind this and this is not just around the fact this could be true in

94

00:07:15,390  -->  00:07:22,230
reality because profit is revenue minus expenses maybe marketing does drive a lot of revenue to a company

95

00:07:22,230  -->  00:07:28,350
but at the same time maybe for these specific companies that were looking at their expense the cost

96

00:07:28,350  -->  00:07:35,850
of marketing so the prices that they pay for mortgages so high that the increase in profit the net increase

97

00:07:35,850  -->  00:07:37,320
in profit is actually marginal.

98

00:07:37,320  -->  00:07:42,960
So the marketing is eating up a lot of the revenue is creating whereas R&D is you know is creating a

99

00:07:42,960  -->  00:07:47,790
lot of revenue and a lot of it is actually staying in profit something like that but were not worried

100

00:07:47,790  -->  00:07:49,500
about that right now thats more financials.

101

00:07:49,500  -->  00:07:51,770
What we're doing is we're delivering a model.

102

00:07:52,380  -->  00:07:56,100
So that's how you interpret coefficients for linear regression.

103

00:07:56,190  -->  00:07:57,450
Very simple.

104

00:07:57,450  -->  00:08:05,720
Just remember about that per unit trick or tip I guess because if you forget about that you can you

105

00:08:05,710  -->  00:08:08,350
know make the wrong conclusions.

106

00:08:08,380  -->  00:08:10,820
Otherwise it's all pretty simple.

107

00:08:10,830  -->  00:08:15,720
The last thing that I wanted to mention here is that you can see that every time we run a model the

108

00:08:15,720  -->  00:08:17,320
coefficients change.

109

00:08:17,370  -->  00:08:23,730
So what that is telling us is that confession's actually only talk about the additional effect of every

110

00:08:23,730  -->  00:08:28,860
single variable given that the other variables are already in place so for instance in this example

111

00:08:28,980  -->  00:08:38,670
you confession of marketing which is to 0.39 is means that given that R&D spend is already in your model

112

00:08:38,670  -->  00:08:46,470
and it's fixed then marketing spend adds additional you know contributes to the additional effect of

113

00:08:46,490  -->  00:08:48,270
0.0 to 9 9.

114

00:08:48,270  -->  00:08:53,700
Meaning that if you were to ring around a different model and take out R&D spend then the coefficient

115

00:08:53,700  -->  00:08:54,820
would be completely different.

116

00:08:54,900  -->  00:09:00,480
And that's what we see here that when we take our marketing the coefficient for R&D spend is Tichenor

117

00:09:00,480  -->  00:09:00,500
.

118

00:09:00,510  -->  00:09:08,160
So that's another thing you should remember about that coefficients merely portray the additional effect

119

00:09:08,220  -->  00:09:11,030
that every single variable brings into the model.

120

00:09:11,040  -->  00:09:13,830
Hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I look for see you next time.

121

00:09:13,830  -->  00:09:15,540
Until then happy analyzing
