1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,740
And now we're going to tackle very quickly the very first step of this toolkit which is the library's

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,390
how to import the libraries how to have them ready.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,260
Any time we start building new machinery morale will There we go.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,520
I will show you this right away.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,230
It's actually very simple.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,370
We're going to import three libraries now which are named by Matt lib and pandas none by will allow

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,680
us to work with arrays because indeed you will see that your future machinery molds will expect some

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,600
arrays as inputs.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,620
And therefore we need the library to work with these arrays.

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,270
And that's not by then we'll import much plot lib which is the library that will allow us to plot some

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,250
very nice charts you will see that we will plot actually many charts and graphs in this course.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,580
And finally bend us which will allow us to not only import the data set but also create the matrix of

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,380
features and the dependent variable vector.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,980
I will explain of course all these concepts later.

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,370
All right so let us import these libraries in order to import a library in Python.

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,670
It's very simple.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,100
You start with import.

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,960
That's just a command that will allow to import a library or even a function or any type of modules

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,350
by the way a library is an symbol of modules containing functions and classes with which you can perform

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,210
some actions and operations.

21
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,060
For example the most well-known library in data science is cited learn and this is a library that contains

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,270
actually all the missionary morals that you can build by simply creating an object of some classes.

23
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,990
So don't worry about all this now we will see that in great detail.

24
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,890
Each time we build the machinery models.

25
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,220
But there you go you will see that libraries will be super useful for us in order to build our machinery

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,000
models.

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,840
There we go.

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:48,480
Import then you need to follow by the name of the library you want to import and the first one we want

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,760
to import is called Name by.

30
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,420
And then what we usually do is we add a shortcut because each time we will use a function of the number

31
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,440
library.

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,680
Well we'll have to call first number.

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,830
And in order to call it faster.

34
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,010
Well we can add a shortcut here so that each time we want to call them by we will actually call it with

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,380
its shortcut and the shortcut we usually use for known by is empty.

36
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,440
And as you can see to add a shortcut is simply to add as.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,980
And then the shortcut name.

38
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,470
All right so each time we will call them by will actually call MP then next library import.

39
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,890
So that next library is mad plot lib.

40
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,230
And actually as I told you a library is an int symbol of modules.

41
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,990
And here we're interested in a particular module called by plot and that's the module that allows us

42
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,060
to plot very nice charts.

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:44,390
And so here we're not only going to import matte plot lib but particularly well the pie plot module.

44
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,560
And as you can see in order to get this pilot module I added a dot here which allows you to access the

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,240
different modules of the MATLAB library and the module we chose is by plot.

46
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,870
And again we're going to add a little shortcut here which we're gonna call TLT.

47
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,130
That's the usual name for this pilot module.

48
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,460
All right.

49
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:08,100
And finally we're going to import a final library which has defenders library a super useful library

50
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,610
to pre process your data set and mostly to import them.

51
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,640
And same for this library we're going to add the simple shortcut name P G.

52
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,610
And there you go.

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,910
Congratulations.

54
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,960
Now not only you know how to import the libraries but mostly you have your very first data pricing tool

55
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,300
in your toolkit.

56
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,370
So now we're going to move on to the second tool which will be to import the dataset and that's exactly

57
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,990
what we'll do in the next tutorial.
