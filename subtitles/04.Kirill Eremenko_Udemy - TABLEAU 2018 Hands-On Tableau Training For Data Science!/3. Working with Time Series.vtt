00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.280
Hello and welcome back to the course and Tablo in today's tutorial we will learn how to work with time

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.350
series daughter.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.810
But first things first then go ahead and save a workbook.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.830
We've already been to the data source and saving a workbook will prevent from loss of any progress that

5
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.600
we make along the way in the section.

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.660
So let's click save as and give our name.

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.960
In this case will be Section 3 for me.

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.360
Click save and now it's saved and all we have to do when we make changes is just press control s on

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.120
the keyboard and that will save our progress.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.550
All right so now we're trying to visualize times used.

11
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.590
Let's have a look at our daughter first and understand what we're working with.

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:53.100
So for right click on the data source click view data you'll see that as we discussed we've got age

13
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.820
gender so two categories that we've got period and we've got an unemployment value for each row and

14
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.350
that's exactly what we want to visualize.

15
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.200
We want to see how unemployment is changing as period changes so we scroll down and we can see that

16
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.040
we have many months.

17
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.470
We've got a month for every single year or we got 12 months for every single year and we can see how

18
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.560
employment is changing.

19
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.920
So we want to visualize that.

20
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.250
So let's go ahead and do that.

21
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.940
What we're going to do is we're just going to double click on unemployed and then we're going to double

22
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.510
click on period and see how Tablo is very smart there.

23
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:37.840
It's automatically put unemployed into rows and it summed it up and it's put year or it's put period

24
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.290
into columns and it's taken the year of the period.

25
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.780
So what's going on here is there's some aggregation and we'll talk about aggregation more in the next

26
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.440
tutorial but it kind of makes sense already what is happening is tabel is taking all of the data that

27
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.750
it can see save for 2007.

28
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:04.270
And and it's summing it up all the values in all of the rows that have 2007 in them irrespective of

29
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.130
month of gender of age is just summing up and coming up with one single value for 2007.

30
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.410
Then the same thing for 2008 2009 and so on.

31
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.110
So that all makes sense.

32
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.840
But now we've kind of got a bit of a question here.

33
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.430
We know that our daughter has much much more granular than that.

34
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.600
We know that we have here months in every year and we have information for that.

35
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.430
Where how do we get to that level of granularity.

36
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.810
Well let's go ahead and explore that.

37
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.530
If we go to the dropdown here which you can see for this dimension and we click it you'll see that there's

38
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.910
two sections in China which are responsible for time.

39
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.740
There's this section which has Year Quarter month day.

40
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.600
And then there's this section which also has Year Quarter month week and day.

41
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.070
What's the difference between the two.

42
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.860
Well to find that out let's click on month in the first section and right away you can see how we no

43
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.090
longer have years at the bottom instead of that we have instead of that we have months and what happened

44
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.620
there.

45
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.730
Well the other thing that we can also see is that we have only one January and only one February and

46
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.490
only one June.

47
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.770
We know that in our data we have many jeunes and many Februarys we have one in fact we have one for

48
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.730
every single year.

49
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.520
But in this case we were only presented with one of each month.

50
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.500
So we only have 12 points on this chart.

51
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.140
And what is going on.

52
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:49.060
Well what is happening is Tablo is taking all of the data from our data source which has let's say for

53
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.790
instance may for any any roll that has me in it.

54
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.380
It will take it and aggregate it to this value.

55
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.080
So it will add them up irrespective of age gender and even year.

56
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.530
And for that for us that doesn't make any sense what's the point of adding up unemployment for 2005

57
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.920
2006 2007 and so on come out for a number that number has no meaning to us as a why is that happening.

58
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.520
Well the reason is is because in this case Tablo is recognizing recognizing month as a dimension and

59
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.970
how can we tell that well Talos giving us a hint up here you can see that month of period is being highlighted

60
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:31.890
in blue.

61
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.380
So Tablo always highlights dimensions and blue and measures in green.

62
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.830
And so that tells us that trouble is recognizing this new variable because in essence it is a new variable

63
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.760
with our variable in the data source is called period.

64
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.770
We don't have a peer.

65
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.500
We don't have a variable that is called month but tabel is creating a calculation here and you can double

66
00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.990
click on it and see what the formula is so taboo is creating a calculation which is month of period.

67
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.060
And in essence that's the new variable and Tablo is recognizing this new variable as a dimension.

68
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.840
And that means it will treat it just as it would treat age or sorry just as it would treat gender or

69
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.870
in our case age because we have age groups.

70
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.230
But let's let's think of it as a gender so tabel is treating this new variable as a categorical variable.

71
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.780
It only has 12 categories and it's putting the data into those categories.

72
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.850
Well obviously in this case we don't want that we don't want different categories of months.

73
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.210
We actually want a timeline over here at the bottom.

74
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.290
So how do we get that.

75
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.400
Well instead of this month let's go ahead and select the second month over here in this dropdown and

76
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.760
right away you can see that our chart changed.

77
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.870
And also you can see that now month of period is green.

78
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.810
So this variable this time is being recognized as a measure.

79
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.630
So if it were a calculated variable it would be sitting over here.

80
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:10.930
And what then happens now is that we have a timeline at the bottom and we have all of the months we've

81
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.070
all of the data that we are looking for and this is exactly what we wanted.

82
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.580
So just to see the difference.

83
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.870
Let's click again and we'll select year instead of month.

84
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.030
So here you can see a similar chart to what we had before.

85
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.540
So I'll just bring that up here you can see very similar line but here you've got categories of years.

86
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.660
But if we click this year at the bottom here then here you've got these sort of categories of years.

87
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.280
You've got a timeline.

88
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.970
And the only difference with the month timeline is that there's less dots on this timeline.

89
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:50.010
And in fact you can see the dots a few in line if you click on color and you select this option you'll

90
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.600
actually see the dots here.

91
00:06:51.610 --> 00:07:01.090
So you have less dots on this timeline and all we are doing by changing this level here is we're changing

92
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.480
the granularity of this specific timeline so we're just saying we want more dots on the timeline.

93
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.940
We're not changing the category that we're grouping observations into we're changing the granularity

94
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.130
of our timeline or the number of ticks on the timeline.

95
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:23.560
And if we change month there we go so we're also once again we're changing the Iran-Iraq granularity

96
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.920
of our timeline.

97
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.640
So just changes back to normal.

98
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.790
And that's exactly what we want so you have to be careful of that.

99
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:36.670
And that's an important part of working time series data that you need to understand what you want from

100
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:43.660
your time data whether you want it to be a dimension or a category or whether you want it to be a measure.

101
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.640
In this case we wanted obviously to be a measure so we can plot a timeline like this.

102
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.810
So that's pretty much it for today.

103
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.900
But before we go what I wanted to do is I wanted to show you how you can validate this chart.

104
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:02.560
So this is unemployment daughter for the U.S. And obviously it's publicly available so you can just

105
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:11.960
go to Google and look for unemployment and 27 weeks is long term unemployment we're looking at long

106
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.780
term unemployment 27 weeks.

107
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:20.770
And then just type in Fred and Fred stands for Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

108
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.240
So if you go here you'll see a very similar chart.

109
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:35.750
And well here I can change it to 2005 so you can see that looks a lot like our chart.

110
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:41.710
The only question we've got we can just look at the tip here and see six thousand eight hundred.

111
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:49.250
And in our chart it's seven thousand one hundred or seven million 100000 so it's of course you'll have

112
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.700
a bit over a discrepancy if you have data from different data sources.

113
00:08:53.870 --> 00:09:02.990
In this case it's about 300000 but the way you like I look at it if it's statistical data so it's 300000

114
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.810
in divided over 6800.

115
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.120
So that's less than 5 percent difference.

116
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:14.510
And for what we're doing for our purposes that will be a sufficient level of precision and you can see

117
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.310
that the charts are quite similar.

118
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:21.610
So we are working with actual unemployment daughter in the US for this period of time.

119
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:30.140
OK so that's us for today and next time we will be talking about aggregation granularity and level of

120
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.000
detail so I look forward to seeing in the next tutorial will be a very important one.

121
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.950
And until then happy analyzing.
