00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,540
Pillowed Welcome back to the course on Tablo and into this Tauriel we will learn how to make our dashboard

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,490
interactive.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,780
So what do we mean by that.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,420
Well what we want to do is we want to allow the user of this dashboard to drill into certain parts of

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,640
the dashboard by just simply clicking on it.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,170
So for instance if the user wants to drill into a certain state like IL de France for instance he can

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,480
just simply click on this bubble.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:38,340
And then the customer scatterplot will automatically adjust to reflect only the customers that live

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,810
in that state.

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:47,100
And same thing goes for any other state because that will add a lot of value to this dashboard and the

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,640
users who are going to be using it because they'll be able to analyze difference geographical regions

12
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,720
individually and separately.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,820
So let's see how we can do that in order to do that.

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:04,590
We need to add an action and then Tablo there are two main types of actions they're called filtering

15
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,380
and highlighting.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,940
So let's go to the dashboard dropdown here and we'll click action here you can see that if you want

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,810
to add action you can choose between filter highlight.

18
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,180
There's also a third action call your L which will take your turn and link but we won't be looking at

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,880
that for now.

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,620
Instead of adding an action here right now what we will do is we will add an automatic action which

21
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,890
is much easier and that will help us slowly get into this topic of actions.

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:41,860
So what we're going to do is at the top of map of Europe will look click this dropdown and we will select

23
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,490
the menu which is called use filter.

24
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,200
So as soon as you click that it's all done.

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:52,220
So now as soon as I click on IL de France you will see that the scatterplot has been adjusted.

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,970
If I click on England it's also been adjusted.

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,950
I click on Netherlands right away you can see it's just that.

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:09,070
So as you can see I am able to now very easily select different states and see what is going on in each

29
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,290
one of these states.

30
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,450
So that is a very handy way channelised are.

31
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,700
So what exactly happened.

32
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,450
Let's have a look in more detail.

33
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,170
Now if we go to dashboard and we go to actions you will see that there is an action here ready and it's

34
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,380
generated action meaning it was added automatically.

35
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,920
Now let's click on this generated action and we'll click Edit.

36
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,470
So here you can see that there's a few fields.

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:40,280
First of all what is the source of the action dashboard one is our dashboard looking at and in Dashboard

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,010
one it is map of Europe that is the source of the action.

39
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:49,250
The action is around only when you select a certain element.

40
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,890
And once you've selected an element the action is applied to the target shoots the target sheets or

41
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,220
the customer scatterplot and the map of Europe once again.

42
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:04,790
So in this case what is going to do is it's going to filter the customer scatterplot it won't actually

43
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,220
take out the rest of the values from the map of Europe because Tablo smart it knows that if you take

44
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,780
out the rest of the values from the map of Europe then you won't be able to click on something else.

45
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,050
So let's have a look at that again.

46
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,660
I clicked OK and now once I'm selecting as you can see this is the source of the action.

47
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,640
And these two are the targets of the action.

48
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,900
So in this case the customer scatterplot being the new worksheet is being filtered.

49
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:38,900
So when I click through the states these customers are own only the customers that live in that state

50
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,920
are being left.

51
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,210
So now what we're going to do is we're going to go to dashboards.

52
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,790
We go back to actions and we'll adjust the sections to have a play around with it.

53
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:53,870
Now instead of a select Let's choose Hulver what that will do is the action will be applied as soon

54
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,860
as we have over a dot on our map.

55
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,960
So let's see how that works click OK.

56
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,940
OK.

57
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,830
And now this however over some of the states as you can see our dashboard.

58
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,660
I'm not clicking anything and the dashboard is being adjusted right away as we're just hovering over.

59
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,890
And that is another way that you can present your dashboard.

60
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:24,590
It might be more convenient in certain cases for you to be just required to just Hoover over these bubbles

61
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,170
to get the second worksheet to adjust itself.

62
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,820
They'll just look at the last option that we had there.

63
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:39,910
If we go to dashboard actions and we click Edit or we select menu what will happen is instead of adjusting

64
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:48,230
the decimal right away we are presenting a menu where we can toggle the dashboard ourselves manually.

65
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,980
But personally I don't use that often.

66
00:04:52,220 --> 00:05:00,250
So now let's do some more other things so overcoached dashboard actions as it lets leave it at select

67
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,900
and let's explore this part of the dashboard.

68
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,770
So what happens when we clear the selection.

69
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,810
Well we can either show all values which is happening now.

70
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:14,780
So once we click somewhere else on the map all values are returned what we can do is leave the filter

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,320
so let's have a look at that.

72
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,950
So click OK and now if I select a state and then I click somewhere else.

73
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,190
As you can see all the states are shown again but the filter is stays on.

74
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:33,520
So if I click somewhere else and I click back once again the filter does not is not removed which is

75
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,120
probably not a good thing in this case because it is misleading.

76
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,990
It looks like all the sites are selected but in reality not all the customers are shown.

77
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,520
So let's change that.

78
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:50,420
Go to edit and you can also do exclude values so have a look at that in your own time.

79
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,070
It basically just will exclude all the values from your scatterplot.

80
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,180
So we'll just click and leave it back on show values click OK.

81
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,100
And since we select something and unselected we once again have all those.

82
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,090
So two things that I wanted to show you.

83
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,480
The first one is how you can create that specific filter on your own.

84
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,830
So let's go to dashboard actions and we'll delete this filter.

85
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,670
Remove it.

86
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,240
OK.

87
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:21,850
So once again now you can see that once I click and nothing happens the scatterplot is not adjusted

88
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,230
if I go to a dashboard.

89
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,760
I want to add the filter on my own.

90
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,120
I go to actions.

91
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,000
I want to add action filter here.

92
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:41,380
The source of our filter is a map of Europe we can call our filter selects geography because we don't

93
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,790
want to call select state because we might want to change our dashboard and show it at the city level

94
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,110
one day.

95
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:54,070
It'll be a select type of filter national values upon clearing the filter and those who are the target

96
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,460
shooters.

97
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,310
OK.

98
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,310
OK.

99
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,280
And there you go.

100
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,660
Now it's all working.

101
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,650
And we created that filter all on our own.

102
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,010
So that's that's great.

103
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,850
That's how you create actions manually.

104
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:12,490
And the next thing I want to show you is that you can actually select multiple regions so I can select

105
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:19,150
two or three I'm just coding control on my keyboard and I can select many or I can use the multiple

106
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,680
select feature here and Tablo.

107
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:29,200
So say a rectangular selection and here I've got the customers shown for all of those states or I can

108
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:35,760
do a circular selection say I want to select.

109
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:43,750
So here I can select these customers or grade one which I like is this free form selection.

110
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:50,730
So let's say I want to select all the people that are in France in the French States and they go I've

111
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,660
just selected everybody in France as easy as that.

112
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,820
Now I can analyze the customers that live in France.

113
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:06,060
So that is how you create action filters in Tablo dashboards and that is also how you can select many

114
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:12,300
points on your map and in the next tutorial we will talk about the action which is highlighting and

115
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,060
we will look at why highlighting is a bit different to filters and what the intricacies are there.

116
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,210
Have a play around with that and look forward to seeing your next step.

117
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,740
Until then happy analyzing.
