Hello welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.930
And today we will be creating a scatterplot and we will also learn how to apply filters to multiple

3
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.760
worksheets.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.830
And hooray finally we're going to create more than one worksheet in our table of workbook.

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.760
So that's going to be fun.

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.370
Let's get straight at it to start off with.

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.990
We've got this map here in front of us that we worked with last time and as you remember we have this

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:41.090
filter that we were applying to the map so we are looking at one specific year rather than aggregating

9
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.680
across multiple years.

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.980
So let's just remember that.

11
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.090
And let's go ahead and create our second worksheet in this workbook.

12
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.520
So to create another worksheet you got to click.

13
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.720
But in a way here at the bottom which says new worksheets so let's go ahead and do that.

14
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.500
Once you click that it creates a new worksheet and it's a good time now to rename a worksheet so you

15
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.770
just double click on the worksheet name and here will say map of Europe.

16
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:16.350
And now if you double click on the second one you'll say customer scatterplot.

17
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.590
OK.

18
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.190
So let's get ahead with our customer scatterplot.

19
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.590
So as you remember the first thing that we did in the previous tutorial was to make sure we're looking

20
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:37.860
at the right time period of our data because it is important to remember when or know when your daughter

21
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.890
includes multiple years or different time periods that you want to look at individually and because

22
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.430
that's a common mistake some times people create a dashboard and they forget to add the filter and instead

23
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.170
of looking at every single year by itself they're looking at the sum for all of the years and that might

24
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.650
not be what they're intending or to see when they're designing a dashboard.

25
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.980
So once again what we can do is we can drag words of data into filter selects years and you know do

26
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.620
the same thing that we did last time but we're not going to do that because what we want to do is we

27
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.000
want to look at the same year across all of our worksheets.

28
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.940
And this is where we are.

29
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.600
So if we had many many more worksheets we wanted to look at the same year across all of them.

30
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.080
And so this is where we're going to learn how to apply a worksheet across many different Apply Filter

31
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.590
across many different worksheets.

32
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.170
So to start off with what we're going to do is we're going to add some data into this worksheet and

33
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.280
then we'll apply the filter and I'll explain in a minute why we're doing it in that order.

34
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:53.400
So let's say we want to look at some of the sales and columns and we want to look at the sum of profit

35
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.620
in rows.

36
00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.890
And so here what has happened is Tebbel has aggregated the total sum of sales for all of the years all

37
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.560
of the customers all the regions for everything and the sum of profit as well and now is just showing

38
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.460
one dot.

39
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.340
And as you remember if you want to disaggregated we can either go to analysis and we can uncheck aggregate

40
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.000
measures and that will be showing a dot for every single one or let's just leave aggregate measures

41
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.260
on.

42
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.560
We can just add some information into the detail of granularity of the view and that way Tablo will

43
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.860
automatically aggregate at that level of granularity.

44
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.650
So how about we add the customer name into detail and right away we have a dog for every single customer.

45
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.050
So what are we going to do now is we will work with that works to create that filter across multiple

46
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.460
works.

47
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.200
So let's go to a map of Europe.

48
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.470
And as you remember this Filcher that we have here and year what we're going to do now is we're going

49
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.880
to right click it and will say apply to worksheets and we'll say all using this data source.

50
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.580
So that means any worksheet using is not a source will automatically have this filter applied to it.

51
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.740
You can also select worksheets but I kind of recommend doing all using this data source unless you have

52
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.830
a specific case where you need to select specific worksheets.

53
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.280
So go ahead and use it on all the work she started using this data source.

54
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.960
Click that and right away you can see that a database I can has appeared on the left of the filter meaning

55
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.110
that is being applied at the level of the data source.

56
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.230
So basically anywhere sheet that's using this data source will automatically have this filter plug.

57
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.850
And if we go to customer scatterplot you will see right away that this filter has been applied here

58
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.780
already.

59
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.510
And if we're right click and we say that we would like to see a quick filter you will see the quick

60
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.250
filter on the left on the right here.

61
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.910
It hasn't been formatted so that's easy to fix.

62
00:04:51.070 --> 00:05:00.100
Customized show all value will just switch that off and then we'll just change to the single value slider

63
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.100
just like in the case.

64
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.520
So now if I change it if I go from 2014 2012 you'll see that this has changed as well.

65
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.640
Over here is change 2012.

66
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.440
Now if I go 2011 and go back you will see that the filter has changed here as well.

67
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.950
So this is kind of a filter that we apply to all worksheets which are using this data source.

68
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.380
Now you'll find that if I go to these worksheets the new ones that currently are not using any data

69
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.250
source because there's no data on the in the workspace the filter has been applied.

70
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.040
And that's simply because Tablo doesn't know if this worksheet is going to be using this data source

71
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.190
or not because eventually you might add another data source and use that one.

72
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.010
In that case the filter won't be applied.

73
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:46.390
So as soon as you track anything from this work from this data source onto the worksheet let's say a

74
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.420
number of records and just drag it here you will see right away that the filter has been applied and

75
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.530
that's how filters across different worksheets work.

76
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.990
It's a very very handy feature and actually took me some time to find out about it.

77
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.680
And I used to just apply separate were two separate filters so every worksheet and can be a nightmare

78
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:15.520
when you have like 20 or 30 whereas when you have when you use the word filter that is applied across

79
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.790
worksheets it's very easy to make sure you're all of your worksheets are showing the right information

80
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.550
for that specific year or for that specific region or for whatever you're filtering on.

81
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.160
Very good in terms of consistency.

82
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.180
So let's go back to our customers scatterplot and continue creating it.

83
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.440
So what does this scatterplot currently showing us.

84
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.950
It is showing us the profit profitability of customers so basically based on the sales that we made

85
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:49.270
to that customer what is the profit that we received in return from that customer as well.

86
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:56.500
So let's make this scatterplot a little bit prettier because there's a lot of dots here and we really

87
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:05.020
can't really say anything about the ones that are overlapping.

88
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.050
So what are we going to do is we're going to add some color and the color that we're going to add is

89
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.150
we're going to look at our profit margin because in essence if you take profit and divide by cells that

90
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.530
is your profit margin.

91
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:25.370
And so if we take profit margin which calicoes field which we created last time and we take it drag

92
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.760
it onto color you'll see that the shapes have been colored now.

93
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.670
Now we're going to change a type of shape.

94
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:39.580
So we'll just click shape even though we don't have anything on shape right now.

95
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.880
We don't have a variable that controls a shape.

96
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.320
What we can do is we can change the shape ourselves so in this case we want the circles.

97
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:53.880
And like last time what we're going to do is we're going to change the color to red and blue will click

98
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.580
apply.

99
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:05.400
So next what we're going to do is change the size of these bubbles so if we go to size make them a bit

100
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.730
bigger.

101
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:10.330
Well that's obviously too big so maybe some were there.

102
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.950
Yeah that looks OK.

103
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:17.210
Maybe we'll also change the color in terms of levels.

104
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:23.910
So we'll go to Edit colors and we'll say just like we did in the previous tutorial we'll say minus 0.5

105
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:32.410
is opes is already bad so as 0.5 and 0.5 is really good.

106
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.760
So apply.

107
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.710
OK so that's certainly looking better.

108
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.640
And now we've got a map of Europe we've got profitability of our customers.

109
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.970
And oh one more thing is because they do overlap here.

110
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.900
What we can do is we can go to color and change of transparency so let's set it at 75 percent.

111
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.990
So now you can see the times when they overlap and once again this is already quite a good scatterplot

112
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:06.830
that we've created so we can see how the customer profitability changes from customer to customer.

113
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.980
And if we change the years you can see how the profile changes overall So here in 2013 you've got some

114
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:19.430
very profitable customers here you've got a bit of a different profile more scattered.

115
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:27.430
And also if you need to do some investigations you can just put your mouse over a certain dot here and

116
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:33.380
I'll tell you exactly who that customer is what the profit is what the sales was what the profit margin

117
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.760
for that customer is for that given year.

118
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.840
So that is a very handy tool to have.

119
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.170
Right away it can help you like somebody who's analyzing this.

120
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.380
The sales from the shop.

121
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.500
They can just go and see OK.

122
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:50.300
The least profitable customers maybe maybe something needs to be done there is some customer service

123
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:56.930
service or maybe those customers are purchasing Nuro wrong products or something like that.

124
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:02.120
And then you can look at the most profitable customers and maybe they should be included in a loyalty

125
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.280
program or something along those lines.

126
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:11.630
So that's how we create kind of plots in Tablo and in the next tutorial we will finally create our very

127
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.370
first dashboard and that will be super exciting.

128
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.780
So I look forward to seeing you then and until next I'm happy analyzing.
