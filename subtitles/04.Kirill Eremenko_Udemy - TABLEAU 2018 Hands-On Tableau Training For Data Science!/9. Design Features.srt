Hello and welcome back to the course in Tablo.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,440
In today's Tauriel.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,230
We're going to look at more well features of Tablo what we're actually going do is look at all of this

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,220
in practice.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,470
So let's bring up our dashboard.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,490
There have been creating So there are some installations right so let's say we want to create a dashboard.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,830
Let's put some of these visualizations into a dashboard while one of the ones that we had was powerful

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,450
is of course our cluster analysis of some trend lines.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,430
And also let's that map that we created over here.

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,690
So let's say we have this dashboard and now we want to see what it would look like or optimize it for

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,250
different mobile devices.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,200
How would we do it.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,250
Well over here in the top left corner now you have about device preview and you could just click that

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,740
and you can select from a desktop tablet phone.

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,930
So let's keep it on tablets for now.

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:02,580
And you can actually select specific different tablets that you or your managers or people in your company

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,270
might be using.

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,640
So for instance you can set generic tablet or let's say iPad.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,280
That's what it will look like on an iPad iPad mini case and thing.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,280
So Amazon Kindle Fire got more space.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,500
Google Nexus 7.

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,780
OK so it's more stretched out.

23
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:25,710
So it's giving you this box which you can adjust your dashboard to so you can recreate a dashboard in

24
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:32,910
a way that it will actually fit into this type of layout so they can see now it's kind of like just

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,200
show you what it would look like.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,990
You can also flip your flip the device what it would look like and also you can say if you have the

27
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,540
mobile app or not.

28
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:50,310
So say iPad this iPad and then we'll flip it and let's say No this is some some Galaxy Tab.

29
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,290
And then you have the mobile app or not.

30
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,760
It's also different than you can change a phone and you can like let's say iPhone 6 6 apps.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,930
You can also adjust that if you like.

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,000
So it's a very very powerful feature.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,130
And now if you also go into the size of a sort of fixed size you can select automatic and then it will

34
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:18,570
fit your dashboard into the device so let's say for instance you don't need any of these because there

35
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,570
are non-informative then this is what a look like on an iPhone 6.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,840
If you select automatic then let's say if you go back to tablets this is what it look like on a Samsung

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:36,390
Galaxy Tab or HTC nexus so you can see that if you leave it on automatic and adjust to that to the layout.

38
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,260
And that is also a powerful feature just to kind of show you what that would look like.

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,690
But at the same time you can always modify your dashboard and make it look fantastic on the device that

40
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,210
you're targeting or make it so versatile that regardless of the device So for instance if you don't

41
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:00,390
select automatic you set a fixed size or for answers you could even do range right so you could do range

42
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,150
and you could set some different sizes where in between which the dashboard would adjust.

43
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,500
But that's kind of like more of an advanced feature so to start off with you would probably play around

44
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,880
with the fixed size.

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:19,230
Select a look and feel for a dashboard such that it would look good on different types of devices that

46
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,680
potentially can be used in your organization.

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,460
So that would definitely be helpful in terms of just understanding what exactly to expect from the different

48
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,590
devices because a lot of the time you might know that some device is used but you don't have it handy.

49
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,020
You don't have to drive in front of you to test these things out.

50
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,870
And this feature this new feature actually allows you to very quickly assess what exactly is going to

51
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,040
happen if your dashboard is open on this device or on another device.

52
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,070
So hopefully you'll find this feature useful.

53
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,650
And I look for see next time.

54
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,090
Until then happy analyzing.
