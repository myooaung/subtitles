00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.750
Hello and welcome back to the course and Tablo.

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.300
And today we will be looking at the data set for this section of the course.

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.930
So let's get straight to it.

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.380
We're going to need a browser.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:25.930
And here we're going to go to superdog whoops dot science dot com slash Tablo and now we're going to

6
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.640
scroll down find Section 3 so we're looking at time series aggregation and filters.

7
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.190
Interesting.

8
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.590
OK.

9
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.290
So long term unemployment statistics.

10
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.890
That's right click save link as as we usually do into our folder I'm going to bring that folder up Tablo

11
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.410
of course.

12
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.710
There it is long term unemployment statistics and let's open up and have a look.

13
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:59.250
And once again if you if you are if you don't have Microsoft Excel then feel free to install open office.

14
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.290
It's a free piece of software which works on both Windows and Mac and you'll be able to view these files

15
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.740
there.

16
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.450
OK.

17
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.440
So as you can see the format of the file is very different to just going zoom in a bit to what we saw

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.470
in the previous section.

19
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:26.340
So here we have a lot of like duplicate records in each or in many of the columns so for instance the

20
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.060
period here for the period is repeated.

21
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.580
So here we've got January many times and we've got February many times march many times.

22
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.000
Then we've got the generator.

23
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.130
So for January we've got six and seven.

24
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.020
One two three four five six seven rows of four men and seven roles for women.

25
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.240
And then the same thing happens for February 7 and 7 and so on.

26
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.800
And then for men we have the split into the age group 16 to 19 20 24 and so on and all the way up to

27
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.650
65 years and over.

28
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.020
And then for each one of these roles we've got and a number of unemployed people.

29
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:17.460
So in that age group of that gender in that period of time as though this is a very non-human like way

30
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:26.450
to structure daughter it's not something that like you would expect to see if you're given a list.

31
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:36.120
A an Excel spreadsheet to just look at it's not how you take an information very quickly and efficiently.

32
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.180
So what's humans are more used to is looks a bit different and it wouldn't have all these duplicate

33
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.400
records it would look.

34
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.380
This is kind of a pivoted view.

35
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.160
As humans we are more used to unpermitted use and I've got an example of that which I'm just going to

36
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.650
bring up now so that we can compare.

37
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.740
So tell me if this looks a bit better.

38
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.420
So here you can see age.

39
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.190
So the groups the age groups.

40
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.650
And then you've got the year and then you've got men and women.

41
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.160
So if you need to look something up you're going to quickly go OK.

42
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:18.780
So if I need March 2005 men in the age 40 to 45 say March 2005 men age 40 to 45 they are there.

43
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.330
So as easy as that.

44
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.060
And it's kind of more natural for people to look at this.

45
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.410
But for machines for computers it's more natural to look at this because they know exactly where to

46
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.940
find everything and it's just faster.

47
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.670
And it's just more of a machine format.

48
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.340
So this data is already structured in this format which is going to be easy to import into Tablo So

49
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.430
this is easy.

50
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.030
This is going to be would be much harder to import into Tablo.

51
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.430
But don't worry we are not going to focus on that right now.

52
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.280
We will talk about structuring and preparing your data in a separate section of courses.

53
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.970
It's a massive topic and we're going to devote a whole section to it so we'll do that further down in

54
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:03.510
this course.

55
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.160
But for now I'll just work with this data set that we have here which is our unemployment office.

56
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.660
So I've downloaded that let's close the spreadsheets.

57
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.560
Let's open up Tablo.

58
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.890
There we go.

59
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.080
And here you can see our previous two workbooks that we worked on.

60
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.900
So let's connect our data source.

61
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.620
Let's go to excel.

62
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:32.700
Long term unemployment statistics open up and there we go so it's in sheet 1 and there is a preview

63
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.510
of our daughter looks good.

64
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.720
What are we going to do now is we just going to goto work book.

65
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.600
So we've actually connected to the data.

66
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.970
There it is.

67
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.570
However now I will show you one more thing a new new element to work with Dora and that is working with

68
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.620
extracts.

69
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.220
So you see this pattern here.

70
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.090
You can actually connect to this data but extract it right away.

71
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.280
So also you can do that while you're in the workbook and you can do it from the worksheet and we're

72
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.510
going to do that so move back to your worksheet without you know doing any kind of creating a dashboards

73
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.620
just right click on the data and go to extract data.

74
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.690
And so what this does is it creates an extract for Tablo to work from.

75
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.240
So basically instead of connecting lives to a daughter the daughter is going to be extracted into a

76
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.960
separate file and then is going to be kept there.

77
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.490
So we're going to collect extract and here you can choose where to save this file to save it in the

78
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.560
same folder.

79
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.850
Click Save.

80
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.510
And now you can see that the Iken has changed.

81
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.260
It's got this little arrow and if you right click it says use extract.

82
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:55.100
Now if we go to the folder which is here you can see that there's a new file that has been created sheet

83
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.700
one long term unemployment statistics.

84
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:04.360
So this is the extract so our daughter from here is now being kept in here.

85
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.210
So this is like a copy of the data and if you open it up you won't see anything really sickly because

86
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.220
it's Tablo table formats that it keeps in its own way.

87
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:23.500
So what happens now is if you change anything in this file in the file we originally connected to then

88
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.030
nothing will change in your work.

89
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.550
So if you change the data you will still have the old daughter in your extract.

90
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.660
So it might be a good thing might be a bad thing if you don't want your daughter to change after you've

91
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.080
connected for the first time.

92
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.110
That's a good thing.

93
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.040
If you want to keep your data updated to the original data source which doesn't have to be an Excel

94
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.940
spreadsheet could be a database could be a CACP file could be anything.

95
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:54.910
Then you can do that as well so you go to Tablo and right click here you click extract and you refresh.

96
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.500
And then here gives you a question.

97
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.490
You say yes and your daughter is refreshed.

98
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.410
So why would you use extracts.

99
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.630
Well it's quite simple.

100
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.340
We're still working with small data sets.

101
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:12.290
But when you start working with big data sets or dynamic Datta says that often change using the live

102
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:18.710
connection might be slow and it might not be reliable it might it might be constantly changing might

103
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.670
be hard to work with.

104
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:25.130
So that's when you create an extract you do your work and then you decide whether you need to return

105
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.500
to the live connection or keep working with the extra.

106
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.110
And if you want to return to live connection you can always do that just right click and uncheck use

107
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:38.270
extract and then right away you can see now we're using the normal connection again and that's how you

108
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.900
work with extracts and Tablo.

109
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.920
So for us in this particular example doesn't matter.

110
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.070
We're just going to keep using the extract because our daughter is not going to be changing.

111
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.960
We don't really mind what we're going to be using going forward in this tutorial and that's all for

112
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.380
today.

113
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.210
I look forward to seeing you next time when we will be looking at work you have time series.

114
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.050
Until then happy analyzing.
