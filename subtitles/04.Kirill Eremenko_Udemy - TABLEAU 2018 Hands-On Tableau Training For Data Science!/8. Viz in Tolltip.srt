00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,000
Alone Welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,460
In today's tutorial we will create the remainder of the required of Islamization and use two tips in

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,650
solving our business challenge.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,650
Now we need to create two new sheets.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,990
Let's start off with the first one.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:29,880
The first one we will actually call the average annual salary math because that is what we will have

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,430
on the for the counties on the map of New York State.

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:42,330
And to do that we quite simply drag in the Ag County into our map and yours might look different but

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,880
if you're also located outside of the United States you might end up like this having 62 unknown locations.

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,610
Now this normally happens when your regional settings on your machine or you are with regional settings

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,850
of Tablo is different to that of the United States.

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,090
When working with addenda States from the United States to fix that is fairly easy.

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,920
You literally just click on the 62 unknown and edit locations.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,590
You can also exclude the data by using filtered data.

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,060
That doesn't make sense at all.

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,980
In this case but we actually edit locations no then Tablo allows us to change the country which tends

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,510
to focus on others if located in the Netherlands at the moment so we that's why it defaulted and it

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,360
ends but we will just go to United States and we will also change the state and the province because

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,350
we know each of these counties of all each of them are located or related to the state of New York.

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,860
And like magic everything disappears all of the problems and it draws the map properly.

21
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,140
We actually want pay field maps that will just click on map over there.

22
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,060
And these are all of our counties in the state of New York.

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,030
Now we can continue.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,480
We know we want to use the average annual salary as our coloring.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,430
So we can just right click and drag that onto column which will open up fuel way because we don't want

26
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,070
this sum of annual salary because remember we have all of the figures for every year.

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,900
We actually want to then calculate average over all ages so it will just click on average and I think

28
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,980
we can make a few improvements.

29
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,850
Firstly the dog lines seem quite daunting so let's change that to what white borders.

30
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,990
We can change.

31
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:25,110
Also the actual transparency or the Pasotti to 65 to make it a bit more transparent and see what goes

32
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,360
on in the background.

33
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,620
And furthermore let's also change the color to black curial always likes to do this is to change the

34
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,530
color green.

35
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,230
I also prefer it like that.

36
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,250
And as we've done in the previous tutorial we want to see the names of each of the counties and to display

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,290
it in a nice way.

38
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,920
We could obviously see it on the altar.

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,020
But is this better.

40
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,450
I swear we can just go again into map layers and switch on the county names.

41
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,420
We don't need the borders.

42
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,140
We already have the borders but these are the names in the back are on the map and obviously chose it

43
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,280
for the rest of the counties as well but doesn't really matter.

44
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,560
We can actually see it on our map nicely now and that's this visualization done very nice and quick.

45
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,560
Now we can just move that to the first as that's our most important one and we can create our last one.

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,870
So this is the one where we create the top five industries Bauch out the way we look at the average

47
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,150
annual salary range and you show the top five.

48
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,140
So it's quite an easy chart again as well.

49
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,790
We will take the average annual salary.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,950
Put that into columns and the change that to average making sure we use average and then also take the

51
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,480
industry and put that on two rows.

52
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,260
We will also use the industry while holding control down.

53
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,020
Put that into color and I just actually want to change the color and make it something a little bit

54
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,820
different but more not as striking as this on the ballot.

55
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,180
For now we know any showing the top five so we can use that.

56
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,950
So there will be a few repeats now but we will take industry once again and put that into filters because

57
00:03:52,950 --> 00:04:00,720
we know we are only looking for the top five and they just top five of day based on the average annual

58
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,600
salary.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,670
And there we go.

60
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,530
So you can see the repeats are gone repeats of the number of or at least of the industries.

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:14,400
And we can see the top five over all for all the top five industries for all years in all different

62
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,190
counties in the state of New York and we can just rename this as well and just call this our top five

63
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,810
industries.

64
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:23,930
Right.

65
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:31,860
And then we can move on to putting it all together using the our nice intuitive functionality so Tablo

66
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,080
added this for us and I think it is just awesome.

67
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,170
So you will remember that our client specifically asked not to use a dashboard and to combine these

68
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,290
sheets and also not to do different sheets.

69
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,380
And thats why this tip comes in handy.

70
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:54,570
Now to add a to a sheet or a different sheet to your visualization in the tool tip you just click on

71
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:00,190
tool tip and obviously just go to the bottom two two added Badillo the takes we already have.

72
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:06,230
And you would just add it from this insert button over a year and normally we added fields from from

73
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,420
there but we see this new option called cheats.

74
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,160
And that way we can select the sheets that we've just bought.

75
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,100
So let's start with a staple line chart.

76
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,110
So we just click that and automatically Tablo for zero the required information.

77
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,310
So you can see it specifies the Schiedam the max with the max side.

78
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,060
So obviously the space within a tooltip is limited but the space specifies the maximum space that can

79
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,150
be used by default.

80
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:37,740
And then also to make sure that all filters that are applied to our visualization is also then applied

81
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,520
to that specific view or to that specific sheet.

82
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:50,130
So if we hit OK and start dragging a mouse or mouse pointer over the graph you'll see how each county

83
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,100
then updates the chart or gets the chart updated for that specific county.

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,470
Pretty helpful because now we can see specific spikes like that in Fulton County or you know even other

85
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,770
spots in Stephen County so which boy we're not visible at all.

86
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,960
When we looked at them together it's a pretty pretty nice what we can then also do is add more than

87
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,100
one or more than one sheet to this tooltip so we can just click again.

88
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:20,190
Just put it at the bottom over there to same Up same approach and add the top five industries.

89
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,020
You'll see again all the same values are put in there.

90
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,000
Obviously the sheet name will be different.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,680
So if it's OK now you see we've got two over there.

92
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,420
So that is pretty neat.

93
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,490
And that's exactly what we wanted.

94
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,560
But this is obviously not where we'll stop.

95
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,090
We need to make some some fixes on here.

96
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,740
I think the tooltip is way too big.

97
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:44,910
It loses the overall picture and the information on there which we don't need to edit out tilter I think

98
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:50,430
what we can do is we can just change the maximum size and this is obviously we are able to edit this

99
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,250
so the maximum I'm not going to change the maximum.

100
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,360
With apologies we change the maximum height because we want to keep it small and we can also just change

101
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,670
these all these hating so we can make that much bigger.

102
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,990
So let's call that 18 and just give it a different color just to look slightly different and we'll just

103
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:15,520
call this our average annual salary like that and we hit play all week.

104
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,250
OK.

105
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,550
And look at that.

106
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,130
She does.

107
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,040
Our sheets are much smaller.

108
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,880
You can see the spacing used is a little bit less.

109
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,460
And we've got a nice Hading there as well.

110
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,730
So to go in edit the accessories and maybe make the font size a bit smaller also on the smaller and

111
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,680
individual sheets we can just go into each one.

112
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,000
And as we know we've done this before.

113
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,010
We don't need for instance the title.

114
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,130
It's self-explanatory.

115
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,670
And even for you of a year you don't really need that.

116
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,650
So we can just remove all of it and then next we can just also format and take this to the smallest

117
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,060
size possible.

118
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:58,470
And as you can see now it looks way better in terms of the use of space and the same with the top industries.

119
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,100
We don't need that over there.

120
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,480
We can edit the axes as we don't need any need it to live.

121
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,170
And let's just also make sure that we use the smallest size available in this case and voila.

122
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,640
That is our visualization.

123
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,160
And doesn't that look great.

124
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,370
And that also then concludes after Tauriel for the section and in the next the toile we will actually

125
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,530
be doing a recap of the most important features which we've learned during this section.

126
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,550
And I look forward to seeing you.

127
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,100
Until next on happy analyzing.
