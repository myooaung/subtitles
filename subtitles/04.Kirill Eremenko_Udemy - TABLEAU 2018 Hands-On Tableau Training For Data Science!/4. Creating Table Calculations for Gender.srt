00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,340
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:15,960
And today we'll start on the demographical segmentation of our member base on the rest of the bank.

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,660
So what do we mean by that.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:26,390
Well we want to see some visuals representing the gender of the members or the customers of the bank

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,270
the different types of professions they're in.

6
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,680
Different age groups and so on.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,800
So let's get started with that first thing we're going to do is we're going to change the name of this

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
worksheet to map.

9
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,990
And then now we're going to create a new worksheet and let's all forget to constantly save our progress

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,520
by pressing Kontrol S..

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:53,830
So here we're going to just create a very simple visualization which is going to be a pie chart.

12
00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:02,870
So let's take a gender and drag it into Tablo and number of records which we now know how to use do

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,640
I get into trouble as well as you can see now we have female and male and tells us exactly how many

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,320
of each gender they are in total in the bank and now we're going to change this to a pie chart.

15
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,350
Probably not the best way to change a pie chart let's try this way.

16
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,210
So there we go.

17
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,010
If you use a show me functionality you get this pretty cheap pie chart.

18
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,490
Now you can make it a bit bigger if you like maybe change the size.

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,830
Now what we're after is some labels here because we can see what's going on.

20
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:45,350
Wolf first of all probably change the colors will change male to blue and female to pink.

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,850
So they're intuitive.

22
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:55,860
And now we want some overseas some numbers in here and what are we going to do is take this some of

23
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:02,270
a number of records and all this just take number of records from the measures and will drag them into

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:12,390
label and what we can see here is the total number of males and females that were bank with our bank.

25
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:19,590
We can change the format here just to see this little bit better and keep it consistent with this part

26
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,150
of the future dashboard.

27
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,970
So if this worksheet we read everything is 12 and bold so little change out here.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:35,070
But for a pie chart you know you are probably interested in the total number of people males and females

29
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,390
you want the percentages.

30
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,870
So how do we get percentages.

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,550
And this is where we start working with table calculations.

32
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,860
It's a very powerful feature in Tablo and this is the first time we're introducing it.

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:54,420
So it's going to be very helpful going forward for us to add a table calculation.

34
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:01,800
So basically tell us what is this number what percentage is this number of the total of what we see

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,630
here.

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,610
You can you just need to do one simple step.

37
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,620
You click on.

38
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,640
In this case the table self-ish is going to be added to this field so we want to replace this field

39
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,160
with the table calculation.

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,240
So click on this dropdown here and so I'll probably move it a bit.

41
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,950
So yeah we have more space.

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:28,890
So click on the dropdown here and select quick table calculation and here from the quick table calculation

43
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:35,940
select percent of total and you select that these numbers have been replaced and you see this little

44
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,840
triangle up here on the actual measure so on the right there's this triangle it's indicating to you

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,840
that there is a table calculation being performed here.

46
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,500
And if you go here you can see quick table calculation.

47
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,400
It's telling you which one has been selected and it is percent of total as we selected it.

48
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:01,560
So now we want to format this again so we'll go to format and we'll change it from numbers to percentage

49
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,960
and no decimal points.

50
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,700
And there you go.

51
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,970
So now we sort of seeing the total number of males and the total number of fields was females we can

52
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,060
see what percentage the makeup of the total or of the segmentation that we've selected will in this

53
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,930
case the segmentation that selected is the whole population of the bank.

54
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,950
And that's why we can see that it's 54 and 46 percent.

55
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:29,700
And you will see what I mean by selective segmentation when we move on to creating the dashboard.

56
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,570
It will become more clear how by selecting different segments of our bank these percentages will actually

57
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,200
change.

58
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,080
So that is how you perform table calculations.

59
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
This is the most simple one.

60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,560
It is called percentage of total you'll be using it quite a lot.

61
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,270
It's very handy to quickly change from absolute numbers to relative percentages.

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,910
And they are more table calculations and we will explore them further on down the track.

63
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,710
So that's all for today.

64
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,100
I look forward to seeing you next time.

65
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,790
And until then I'll be analyzing.
