00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.490
Welcome back to the course on Tablo in the previous tutorial we created this beautiful viz. in front

2
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.330
of us which allows us to compare the actual sales of the different departments for store to their target

3
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.270
sales.

4
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:25.130
And today we will finish up with blending and what we will do is we will talk about how to create a

5
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.430
calculated field within a plant and what that means is how do we create a calculated field that requires

6
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.800
data elements from both of the tables which are being blended now.

7
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.810
I feel that this is an important topic that I should share with you because you will be creating a lot

8
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.240
of calculated fields along the way.

9
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.790
When you work with Tablo and when it comes to creating calculated fields within a blend it's a bit different.

10
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.410
There are certain specifics that you need to be aware of.

11
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.380
So I just wanted to make sure we cover off this topic so that you're not in for any surprises along

12
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.130
the way when you are working with Tablo in your role.

13
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.060
So let's get ahead let's go ahead and get straight to it.

14
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.780
Here we've got our charts and what we will be looking to do is for each one of the departments we will

15
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.720
want to look at the difference between the actual sales and the target sale so we wanted to create a

16
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.870
chart which will be taking every single bar and subtracting the target and seeing whether basically

17
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.480
the bar the remainder of the bar is above zero or below zero and that will allow us to very quickly

18
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.380
see how the departments are performing now because adding another charge will increase the size of this

19
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.920
worksheet.

20
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.040
We might want to consider taking these departments and looking them at looking at them separately so

21
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.430
that it's not too cluttered because we already have.

22
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.440
Basically right now we have six charts on this worksheet.

23
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.140
We've got the targets which are in grey in the background and we have the actual sales which are these

24
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.180
bars in the front.

25
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.810
So if we add another charge for every single one of the departments I'll take it to nine charts it might

26
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.060
be a bit overwhelming for the user.

27
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.130
So we want to take care of the user and that's why we're going to kind of simplify this chart a little

28
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.040
bit and we can very easily do that by taking the category out of rows and putting it into a filter.

29
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.200
So that's what we're going to do.

30
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.560
We're going to take category and drag it from Rose to filter and right away we've got this filter settings

31
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.180
that come up.

32
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.290
We're going to click OK.

33
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.710
And what that gives us is quite a crazy chart right away because we are looking at everything at the

34
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.130
same time what we will do is we will take this and we'll click Show quick filter.

35
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.520
Now I'm going to reduce the size of the chart a little bit so I can zoom in and so that you can see

36
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.510
the filter at the same time.

37
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.180
And we're going to reduce the size of the bar so that's just for for us.

38
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.680
Okay.

39
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.310
So that's what our chart looks like.

40
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.770
Of course we don't want to see everything at the same time we're trying to get away from that.

41
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.550
So first of all we're going to customize or change this filter to a single value list and then we'll

42
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.290
take out the all value so we'll take a customized show of value take it off.

43
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.890
I know we can simply click through our departments and we'll see the chart for each one of them which

44
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.650
is great.

45
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.120
Now at this point which you might be seeing is something different and not a worry I'll be able to help

46
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.830
out right away so perhaps what you're seeing looks something like this for after you've taken category

47
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.130
out of the rose and you put into filter what's happened is now when you click over from the three different

48
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.590
departments you see the total target for all of the departments of individual targets and that can happen.

49
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:50.160
That just means that what you did by taking category out of Rose is is just a filter now so it's no

50
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.240
longer a level of granularity of The View and Tablo no longer aggregates the data at that level.

51
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.050
It ignores that level of granularity when it's doing this blend and why that happened is because perhaps

52
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.260
in your some of target in this control window when you in the previous tutorial when you removed a category

53
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.000
from color to make the target Gray you didn't put it into detail but you're either just removed it completely.

54
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.450
So right now what's happening is for this chart this great chart in the background here.

55
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.600
If you look at it look at the worksheet right now you will see that category is nowhere to be seen as

56
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.980
a level of granularity.

57
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.940
Ignore it as a filter because a filter just filters data but your target your categories not in columns

58
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.280
it's not in rows.

59
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.040
It's nowhere to be seen in this control panel.

60
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.780
And what that means is right away Tebbel no longer knows or no longer regard category as a level of

61
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.500
detail and will not aggregate at that level it will ignore it.

62
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.150
You can fix that once again by taking category back into the rows right away as you can see now the

63
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.780
categories.

64
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.590
Correct.

65
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.920
And you can click through but we didn't want to do that.

66
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.480
We wanted to keep category just as a level of granularity but before actually being in our chart.

67
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.470
So we'll take category out of here and we'll just try category into the detail.

68
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.680
Just make sure it's there.

69
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.020
It might be there if you if you'll put it there in the Prius to turn might be already there and that

70
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.330
way you're seeing everything correct.

71
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.890
So just make sure that that's the case because this kind of shows that when Tablo aggregates are two

72
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:36.570
separate data sources it only looks at what is what feels are in the view for that specific data source

73
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.550
and you can check that for us through this control panel or here so for sales or for Target and so on.

74
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:51.540
So that's how we get our chart to be Filcher bull by the different department which is good.

75
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.510
And once again we have to make sure that the access is synchronized which which is a great thing.

76
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.290
So we can visually see right away what's happening and now we're going to create our calculated field

77
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.830
which will be working across the two data sources in the blend.

78
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.090
So we're going to go to the primary data source.

79
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:13.740
We're going to find our field that we're going to use which is sales will Right-Click that and we will

80
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.420
choose create a calculated field.

81
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.530
So here we want to take sales and we want to subtract the actual target to see whether the sales are

82
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.920
above or below the target.

83
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:34.410
So we'll call this calculated field what should we call it meets or excess of target let's try that

84
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:43.980
sense of Target and now we will go to sales target so the new data source the second one and we will

85
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.800
take target here and it will subtract.

86
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.570
So we'll actually first of all we'll put a minus sign because we want to subtract and will take target

87
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.440
and all drag it into a calculated field and right away you can see two things happen.

88
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.760
First of all the sales targets are the target.

89
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.460
Has this prefix before it which indicates the data source so it's telling us that this field is coming

90
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.940
from there and it's basically just the way for tablet to know which secondary data sources field is

91
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:17.870
coming from and for you also to be able to tell that very quickly when you look at the calculation next.

92
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.080
You can also see that there is a some here.

93
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.490
So why this sum appeared.

94
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:30.330
Well that is quite it should be intuitive by now because you know that or we know that this blend is

95
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:37.440
happening when by Tablo aggregating the data first so as we discussed Tablo sends separate queries to

96
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.620
these data sources.

97
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:45.380
It aggregates the data to the correct level of granularity then it brings it back and it joins or blends

98
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.570
it here in table.

99
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:54.660
So that basically basically means that there will already be an aggregation when this calculated field

100
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.330
has been performed or been derived.

101
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.970
So that is why the summer is here on this.

102
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.010
Here you can see the calculation contains errors and that is because you're trying to or we're trying

103
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:12.940
to subtract and aggregated field from a non aggregated field that is easily that can be the result which

104
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.530
is going to put a sum around sales here as well.

105
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:18.720
Whoops there we go.

106
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.200
So some sales minus the sum of the target.

107
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.860
And now the field is valid and we click OK which is great.

108
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.940
Now we can start using it.

109
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:35.850
So let's go ahead and drag axis of target onto our Rose right away you can see a new field here excess

110
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:36.750
of target.

111
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:45.900
Now if we go to the control for X of target as you can see here in this hole view for this new field

112
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.890
there is no category where whatsoever except for in the filter.

113
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:56.730
And that means that categories not being considered as a level of granularity for this specific chart.

114
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.620
The one at the bottom.

115
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.790
So we need to fix that and we're going to do that by taking category and just dragging it into detail

116
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.550
right away you can see that the chart has been corrected.

117
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:12.090
And now if you click through it is actually showing you the difference between the charts the bar chart

118
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.050
and the area chart in the background which is correct or is that it's exactly what we wanted to see.

119
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.030
So now we'll just make it look pretty.

120
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:26.910
All we have to do is color it properly and we'll just take excess of Target and drag it into color so

121
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.910
by holding down control and right away you can see table is smart.

122
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.620
It's selected the colors for us so anything above is blue.

123
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.930
Anything below is orange.

124
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.750
And now we can already start doing some analysis around this perhaps before you start doing a loss.

125
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.850
You might want to format it a little bit so you go to format.

126
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:50.880
You changed the worksheet to say a 10 or maybe a 12 depending on how much space you have.

127
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.000
You make a bold as you can see everything has been adjusted.

128
00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:01.480
And once again this is a personal preference you might want to color it a bit differently.

129
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.850
So there we go.

130
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.430
We've got we've got the chart pretty much prepared.

131
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:12.540
Now we can do a bit of analysis so I'll just make this a bit bigger so we can see a bit more the filter

132
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:18.730
here for instance is being cut off a little bit perhaps maybe let's make it a 10.

133
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.670
Yeah that looks better.

134
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.020
So what we want to do is we want to just see how the departments are performing.

135
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:31.920
Right away you can see that the what is this furniture department had a few quite a lot of bad months.

136
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:38.250
If we moved to office supplies you can see that they have much less bad months only one two three four

137
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:45.300
five six seven eight nine 10 11 months below target in the 1 2 3 4 years.

138
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:51.260
And the technology department has quite a few bad months but recently they've been doing a bit better.

139
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:58.260
So based on that information you can already start making some assumptions or preliminary conclusions

140
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:03.930
you might say that the furniture department the way they say set their targets might not be the best

141
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.460
way because they're the they're constantly underperforming and not meeting their targets.

142
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:14.340
Perhaps the US Department Manager should revisit the way they're setting the target so far as being

143
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.880
just constantly increasing month to month.

144
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.130
Over the past four years.

145
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.070
Perhaps it's time for a change.

146
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:28.500
Technology Department is setting the targets once per year and that is perhaps not accounting for some

147
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:35.280
seasonality effects as you can see there's some orange bars clustered together so and here like some

148
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.600
zero bars as well so that basically means maybe there's a seasonality effect that they're not taking

149
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.890
into account and maybe throughout the year the target should change based on how their customers purchasing

150
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:54.240
or how their stock has been adjusted and the behavioral patterns that they're observing and looking

151
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.310
at the office supplies department you can see that they have the least months when they have not met

152
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:05.980
their targets and basically means that their way of setting the targets for the months which are reviewed.

153
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.450
So these targets are reviewed quarterly seems to be the best approach currently and yeah perhaps that

154
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:18.490
manager can explain to other managers how he is doing it and you know what his secret sources.

155
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.340
So that's awesome.

156
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:26.580
One more thing that you might want to do is perhaps because these two axes are aligned you might just

157
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.600
want to right click here and just show Hetter.

158
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:35.120
So get rid of it and that'll save you some space because pretty much it's the same axis.

159
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.680
And here you can just rename it.

160
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.610
So EDID access and just call it sales slash target apply.

161
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.470
OK.

162
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:48.760
And that way you're saving space on the right which was not really being used for anything important.

163
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:54.600
So that's how we create calculated fields across blends.

164
00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:00.660
A very important topic because you will find yourself in situations when you will need it and now you're

165
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.210
totally prepared for it.

166
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.180
I hope you enjoy this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

167
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.710
Until then happy analyzing.
