00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,570
This is Carol and welcome back to the course in Tablo.

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,160
And Congratulations on completing the first section of the course and more importantly and making this

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,240
step into the second section.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,380
I'm super excited that you're here and I hope you are as enthusiastic as I am about the material that

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,260
we have ahead of us in this section we have a real business problem a real challenge ahead of us and

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,440
let's have a look at what it is.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,460
So here's a document that specifies a challenge.

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,300
Let's have a look.

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,920
It's end of financial year and that means it's means it's time for annual bonuses.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,230
The store which we're looking at the store operates in three regions and only the top performing employee

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,540
in each region qualifies for a bonus.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,880
Find out which three employees are eligible to get a bonus to get bonuses for this year.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,590
Employees are measured on the total number a total value of sales and the daughter.

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,410
As we discussed is located at this link.

15
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:14,130
So here's the Web site and you can download the data here so just a quick word of caution if you're

16
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,670
using just a normal windows.

17
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,490
Get this first file.

18
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,470
If you are using a Mac get the second file and if for some reason for whatever reason you will experience

19
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:33,750
problems with either of these three files then just go ahead and download the third file and proceed

20
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,120
as we did in the previous section with an Excel data source.

21
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,860
But do let me know and I will definitely do everything I can to help you out to make sure you're able

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,430
to work as few files as well because they are quite common.

23
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,640
So save link as.

24
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,820
And so to my Tablo of course folder save the file.

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,840
So what is the file.

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,680
It's basically a text file but it's data separated by commas.

27
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,380
And that's what's called a comma separated values file.

28
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,000
That's what CSC stands for.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,870
So let's open that up and have a look.

30
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,770
OK.

31
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,810
So this file contains once again transactions and played by region.

32
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,120
It's got the rep name so the person who conducted that transaction what he sold.

33
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:30,360
So this stationery shop and office supplies shop so they sell pens binders desks sometimes.

34
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,560
And the number of units that were sold and the unit price.

35
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:42,750
So this is a much smaller file only 44 rows including the header so it is a very basic sample file.

36
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:48,440
And but it's good it's good to start with this because it will help us understand exactly how tablet

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,900
works and moreover if you do have anything that you're curious about you can always come back into the

38
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,960
file and have a look for yourself and even just filter out that information that you're looking at in

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,210
Tablo and just compare.

40
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,170
So it's a very good very small very good file to start exploring Tablo with.

41
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,840
That's exactly what we're going to do.

42
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,910
So in this section we've got quite a lot of ahead of us.

43
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:17,980
We're going to be looking at some things like creating all calculated fields we'll be working colors

44
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:26,480
we'll be adding labels will be formatting our chart exporting our work sheets and all of the basics.

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,000
We're going to cover them in this section and that will create a great foundation for us going forward.

46
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:37,310
So we'll get started in the next tutorial and I look forward to them until next time happy analyzing.
