00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:09,190
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo today we're going to start slowly moving into the second

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,730
part of the challenge which is to understand are those 10 new cities into which the company should start

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,270
investing heavily in terms of marketing where the return on that investment will be the highest.

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,320
And secondly we're going to talk about highlighting.

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:31,060
So the heiling feature Tablo which will help us slowly transition into this part of the challenge.

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,100
It's going to be quite an interesting tutorial.

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,140
So let's get straight into it.

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,020
All right I'm going to create a new worksheet and here I'm going to create yet another map and right

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,700
off the bat.

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,350
Here's a quick quiz for you.

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,500
What happens if I just drag a city into the map.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,760
Do I have all a hundred and fifty cities here.

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,560
Is this the correct way to visualize the cities of this company where the company operates just pauses

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,110
video.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,570
Have a think about it for a second.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,480
If you're following along then look around and look for hints.

17
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,830
And in three to one now we're going to have a look at the answer.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,040
The answer is No.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,310
Because we're here at the bottom you can see unknown values.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,330
If we click here you'll see that they are ambiguous locations.

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:22,570
For example Augusta Aurora and so on because they are actually a few of these cities in the U.S..

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,760
So all of these cities are ambiguous and Tablo doesn't know which one to pick out of all of them.

23
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,950
So there we go.

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,040
That is not the proper approach to visualize these cities.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,340
The proper approach is to take this out and we'll track state into here real estate into the map.

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,420
And now if we click the plus now we expand so we have both state and city in the geographies.

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,410
And now you can see that there is no unknowns.

28
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,570
There are known knowns.

29
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:58,480
That is because now Tablo knows exactly which city to pick in case if there is in the US a city with

30
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,410
the same name in several locations it'll just look at the state and then pick the city in that state.

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,900
So that was a quick fun quiz.

32
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,620
And now what we're going to do is we're going to just add up a little bit so we're going to add revenue

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,030
as the size then we're going to add revenue as a color as well.

34
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,240
And as you can see already we are seeing some of these cities pop up.

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,660
So what else we can do to make this more aesthetic transparency Maybe set it at 80 something percent

36
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,580
just a little transparency give it a border.

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,910
So now we can already see where the city is located it's a lot smaller cities have brought less revenue.

38
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,870
Large cities bring more revenue.

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,270
And the question is Where are our 10 new cities.

40
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,540
How do I identify them here.

41
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,260
Well the quickest way is to take our parameter which is a new expansion and just drag it onto color

42
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:58,190
so that way we can see right away whether in 10 cities are located so there is rock Ford there is Patterson

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,940
Joliet.

44
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,700
Chattanooga didn't even know these cities were in the US college station.

45
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,760
So there we go.

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,740
So if you're from one of these cities in a big a huge shout out to you you're a part of our Weasel's

47
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,750
nation.

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,390
All right.

49
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:20,240
But the thing here is that now we've lost that wonderful information where the caller was also linked

50
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,880
to revenue.

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,230
So this is indeed one of the ways to visualize the cities and then you can click here to highlight them

52
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,540
like that as we've discussed.

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,020
But now how do we do the same.

54
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,250
But at the same time don't use this color as the way we are identifying the cities.

55
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,230
Is there a different way to do it.

56
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,810
And there is a way it's called the highlighting feature so let's contrails at that and return back to

57
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,790
the previous version.

58
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,220
Now what we can do is we can take the new expansion parameter and put it into detail a set of color

59
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,380
and notes in detail and it's not really doing anything it is affecting aggregation but it's not adding

60
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,970
much because we already have the CD which is unique for our aggregation.

61
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,240
You could even put store Id into here and won't do anything new because there is no two cities with

62
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,680
the same name in our data set.

63
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,080
That's why store ID and new expansion don't really change aggregation but they are now being taken to

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,760
account.

65
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:20,910
But how do we now use this new expansion in order to quickly identify the new stores.

66
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:27,670
Well if you click drop down here and you select show highlighter Nacho filter but Schoharie letter then

67
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,780
a Heiler will appear here.

68
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,760
Some are actually going to move it over here.

69
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,130
And what I can do now is I can just select if I click here you can either type it up or because we only

70
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,760
have two categories here.

71
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,120
It's very simple just like new as you can see it highlights those when it gets old.

72
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,860
It highlights all the old cities and you can actually just click that way you've highlighted all of

73
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,740
the new cities very easy like that so they can see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,140
cities we've highlighted very easy and very non intrusive.

75
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:05,850
So it's not actually using up any of our other features on causation like color or shape or size we're

76
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,160
not using them we just want to subtly highlight something and then just drag it into detail and then

77
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,870
use the highlighter option very powerful tool for daughter exploration.

78
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,840
So you can very quickly identify those objects that you want to pinpoint.

79
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,710
So there you go.

80
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,490
Hopefully this will be another new tool in your arsenal when you're working with Tablo.

81
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,570
And I can't wait to see the next tutorial where we will dive more into the analysis and understand what's

82
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,560
the difference between these series and what's kind of trends are going on there.

83
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,280
Conway to see there until next time happy analyzing.
