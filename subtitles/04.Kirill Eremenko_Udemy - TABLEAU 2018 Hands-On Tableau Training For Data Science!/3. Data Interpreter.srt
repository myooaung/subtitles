00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,050
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,830
And today we're talking about a new and exciting feature in Table 9 which is called the Dahdah interpreter.

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:19,900
And as we discussed previously we already know that machine and human format for Dadda is a bit different.

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:27,830
So let's go ahead and have a look at how tablet can help us overcome these challenges that occur when

5
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,320
we're trying to import human like data into software like Tablo.

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,870
So first of all we're going to need our browser and in our browser we're going to go to supersize dot

7
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,560
com slash Tablo scroll down to the bottom here at the bottom you can see a file which is called personal

8
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,540
vehicle sales global.

9
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,120
Let's go ahead and download that now right.

10
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,180
Saving that file.

11
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,950
That's good.

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,980
And now I'm going to open the folder.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,180
There it is.

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,400
So where is our file personal vehicle sales.

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,290
Lol we'll just drag out into Excel and there we go.

16
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,300
So this is what our file looks like.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:18,590
It's a report showing how the sales of vehicles personal vehicles have been growing or changing through

18
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,300
the past couple of years.

19
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:27,170
And so having years that we have here 10 years and you can see here these numbers represent the total

20
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,600
number of vehicles sold so these dollars these are actual numbers so for instance in all a strange thousand

21
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,030
fourteen there was about 330000 personal vehicles that were sold.

22
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:46,500
And as you can see the format of the spreadsheet is very much oriented as humans and say humans I'm

23
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,400
not a robot.

24
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,960
It's very much oriented at us humans.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,010
So here are the great great ones.

26
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,970
You can see these are approximate numbers or estimated figures here.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,480
There's like a legend a little bit of a legend up there and right away you can see like there's a header

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,390
as we discussed there's this top row scrolls along top five rows scroll along.

29
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,930
That's because it's easy for us to navigate that way.

30
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,630
What else.

31
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:19,570
So here we've got some totals for instance Europe or let's have a look at this one now.

32
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,530
So the North American Free Trade Agreement that's Canada Mexico the United States so you can see these

33
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,590
totals which will obviously jump into our data and we don't want that than just America.

34
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,880
The totals for the whole of America including nafs and Central and South America.

35
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,820
And then there's like empty rows all over the place.

36
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,860
What else do we have here.

37
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,860
That's they can be a problem here.

38
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,720
All the countries total often immaterial and some comments we hear of stars.

39
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:51,530
You'll also notice it took me it took me a while actually to figure this to see this one is that there's

40
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,750
hidden columns in here and you often forget about those if we hide You'll see that there's actually

41
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:04,160
three hidden columns here and that can also interfere with our daughter import when we do start doing

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,360
it.

43
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,830
So this is quite a challenging file as you can see for a machine to comprehend.

44
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,590
Let's go ahead and see how Tablo is going to handle it.

45
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,850
So I'm just going to close the file for now.

46
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,770
I don't actually I'll keep it open because we might need to have a look at it.

47
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,400
So I'm going to open up Tablo Tablo.

48
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,680
And here we've got a lot of beautiful spreadsheets or tabs and worksheets that we've been working on

49
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,900
so we can go to connect to your file Excel.

50
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,250
Here we've got the file personal vehicle sales global.

51
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:41,780
Open it up and right away we've got this previa at the bottom so that zoomin all that we can see here

52
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,230
that everything is completely mixed up.

53
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:52,310
So instead of the call them names are like random or one of two or three and then this one has a name

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,540
that has some random names and some empty columns estimated figures.

55
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,050
Remember that piece of coal called a legend that we had before.

56
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:06,890
I had him there we've got the region's countries which are actually years or so regions countries in

57
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:13,100
this call them in years and here as part of a dot and so completely messed up daughter it shouldn't

58
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,580
be like that.

59
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,780
So what are we going to look at now.

60
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:23,360
Is it is a Tablo daughter interpret it what it does is it allows tabbouleh to help you kind of understand

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,000
what's going on and done all kind of like it allows Tablo to be smart about what it can see in the data.

62
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,960
So here you can see a common saying that Tablo daughter interpretor might be able to help.

63
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,520
So why don't we go ahead and click turn on for that feature.

64
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,570
And so what happens now is the data is changed.

65
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,900
Now we've got two regions countries as the name of this column which kind of sounds about right.

66
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,260
Names of these columns include both the year which is right.

67
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,410
So if we go back to our data so here you'll see that the names of the columns are actually years but

68
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,490
also include a number which is not correct.

69
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,360
And then we've got some numbers it still has the totals which are which is not good but already a bit

70
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,630
better.

71
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,130
So let's try to understand what happened here.

72
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,920
What are we going to click on this button here.

73
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,500
Review results and then once we click it and new spreadsheet is going to be open for us.

74
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,680
So this spreadsheet pops up basically what it's showing us is it's got some descriptions here but the

75
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,080
main tab that you want to look at is the second tab and it's it's a description of what Tablo saw.

76
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,170
So we're going to zoom in a little bit I'm going to make this a bit wider so.

77
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,440
Oh that's a bit too wide I guess.

78
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,480
So what tablas telling us here is it's telling us what exactly.

79
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,400
So in the data.

80
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:45,470
So tablas saying all right these red ones so I can completely ignore these white collar white cells

81
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,960
then these red cells as you can see here.

82
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,790
Tablo saying that's ahead or I will look at that as if it's a hitter.

83
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,740
And that's why in our data in our preview of our data we can see a combined date and the number because

84
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,530
Tablo said.

85
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,010
OK so that's ahead or that's ahead.

86
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,030
I'll just combine the two combined combined combined combined.

87
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:11,180
And so that's how it created the header and then it's got these green cells which is considered to be

88
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,410
Datto which is clearly correct to some extent some of these do have to be omitted because they're total's

89
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:21,900
and then as you can see it ignore the common at the end of this with this Asterix.

90
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,970
So that's a good start.

91
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,150
So we now know Tablo can do a bit of work for us.

92
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,590
Let's help tabel out a little bit as well.

93
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,570
So I'm going to close that because we don't need that.

94
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,380
Now we're going to close this as well we'll redo that in a second.

95
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:42,200
So what are we going to do now is we going to adjust this file so it can actually work if it's so it

96
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,300
can do all the work for us.

97
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,740
But it can do definitely can do quite a lot of it.

98
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,450
So what we're going to do to start off with is we obviously need to delete these totals because they're

99
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,240
just remaining in our data and they're not being removed which is not good.

100
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,210
But before we delete them as soon as we delete the totals.

101
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,190
As you can imagine we will lose information on.

102
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,670
So if I delete these roles like this we lost information on which region this was.

103
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,700
So this is Europe.

104
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,960
This is Europe new members we want to keep that information.

105
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,870
So we're going to add a column on the left here.

106
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:18,920
So I basically Press Control shift plus or we can just right click and insert.

107
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,090
So what am I going to do is I'm going to copy the region name here.

108
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:31,190
Got a copy it says is just an example of how to quickly fix up your daughter before importing it into

109
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,030
Tablo in Africa.

110
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,880
And then we don't need that.

111
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,350
So next we're going to do is we need to obviously copy down remember we talked about this so we need

112
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:45,650
to copy down the name of the region for these empty cells as well so you can just double click and copy

113
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,880
until the next one.

114
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,590
Or you can drag an old copy.

115
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,880
This is very basic Excel stuff.

116
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,930
I like to do what I like to do is I like to select all myself that I need to copy including the top

117
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,480
one.

118
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,390
And then if you press control g on your keyboard and you go to then you click special and you go to.

119
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,220
OK.

120
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,850
And now you click enter this and then instead of pressing enter your press control enter then I'll do

121
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,230
the whole job for you.

122
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,830
So as you can see Europe Europe Europe new members Russia after and so on.

123
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:23,840
So now we have to do is control copy this and then I'll basically copy paste values.

124
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,500
And now we don't have the formula that is perfect and what that means is now we've got these copied

125
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,510
now we can get rid of these totals so we're going to control minus these.

126
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,410
So I'm basically deleting these rows with the totals.

127
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,340
So be careful here because there's some empty ones here.

128
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:48,650
South America there's another to go destroy everything.

129
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,000
All right.

130
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,510
So that's all deleted.

131
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:56,080
Now we only have our countries and the region that they're from and of course the data over here.

132
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,880
And that's pretty much it.

133
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,650
You just have to obviously give this one a name.

134
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,520
So it's cold regions.

135
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,610
And he'll just leave countries.

136
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,680
All right so that's our file.

137
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,070
We fixed it up.

138
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,510
Doesn't even matter that we've got this empty row here.

139
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,610
Tatel take care of the rest so let's go ahead and save that that's saved.

140
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,000
Now open up Tablo as well.

141
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,560
And we're going to go to excel personal vehicle sales global.

142
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,760
There we go.

143
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,660
And once again problems so tabloids can see these empty empty columns it doesn't have all the names

144
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,290
turn on Dot interpreter and voila.

145
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,370
Much better right away.

146
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,170
So this empty columns still here because I think this is like a value in one of the one of the rows

147
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,600
so we're just going to click it and click hide and perfect.

148
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:53,480
So now we can see the region the country the sales of the number of vehicles sold in that specific year

149
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,020
one second OK.

150
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,690
So that's good.

151
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:05,140
Now what we want to do is we want to review results just have a look at what tablet did exactly.

152
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,490
There it is.

153
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,670
So if you go to to the second tab you'll see that this is the header for tabbouleh which is correct.

154
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,730
Then from here onwards it's the daughter Rose.

155
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,910
So the first thing I was a bit concerned about is did it pick up this empty row as a row of data.

156
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,630
But in reality if we count the rows here there's 144.

157
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,700
Now if we go back to Tablo it will tell us that there's 144 rolls here so it basically picked it up

158
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,360
as a daughter.

159
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,310
But because it was empty it completely ignored.

160
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,790
And so that's how the data interpreted tablet works it can definitely save you some time and because

161
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,540
it cuts out these headers for you I ignore those blank rows and so on.

162
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:49,090
It doesn't do all the work but at the same time it can help you can Nudgee in the right direction if

163
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:56,100
you import daughter you check what that interpreter looked at and saw and then and then you corrected

164
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:03,520
a little bit and then you send it send it back into Tablo again then Tablo can really help you out and

165
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,270
do the remaining groundwork for you so you can import the data into title in the next tutorial we will

166
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,260
look at.

167
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:16,300
Another cool element of importing data and that will be pivoting data.

168
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,080
So that will be fun and I'll look forward you next time.

169
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,720
Until then happy analyzing.
