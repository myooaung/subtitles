00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.540
Hello and welcome back to the course and table previously we learned how to create custom territories

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.980
through the group method.

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.440
Today we'll look at the second method you can use to create custom territories.

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.530
Let's have a quick look.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.290
So I want to create a new map and this time instead of dragging straight away what I'm going to do is

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.750
I'm going to apply the second method instantly so I'm going to select a sales region going to right

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.760
click and what I'm going to do is and which things are graphical.

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.770
Then I'll say I create from and select state here so you can see sales region has now automatically

9
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.180
jumped into this hierarchy of geographic Krall's above state.

10
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.360
So let's quickly discuss what exactly happened there.

11
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.940
So if you go to the data source you'll see that apart from these two new Kaliko fields so this is the

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.410
group and this is the return on marking investment that we calculate previously.

13
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.320
You'll see that here you've got the sales region.

14
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.310
So what Tablo is doing when you're telling it to create a geographic roll for sales region based on

15
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:11.670
state what is it's doing is it's looking at the data set and it's realizing that actually in this data

16
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.400
set even though sales region is not a recognized geographical roll.

17
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.070
There's a geographical roll named state and every sales region is associated with a state or actually

18
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.590
the other way around.

19
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.550
Every state is associated with a sales region.

20
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.980
So tabel can recognize that.

21
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.190
And then when you tell it to create a say a geographical roll for sales region what it basically does

22
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.070
is it aggregates all of the states to the associated sales region.

23
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.380
So does that aggregation for you.

24
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.700
And then from there it will know that region 2 is a combination of Arizona Texas Washington Texas Kansas

25
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.000
and so on and so basically it does that hard calculation or hard work for you and in the end you've

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.510
got two lovely sales regions which you can use as geographical or custom territories and let's have

27
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.560
a look at that some back in the sheet now and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take sales region

28
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.160
and I'm just simply going to drag it onto our map.

29
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.200
And as you can see now if you zoom out you have we have just two dots because those are representing

30
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.460
our two selves regions.

31
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.700
And I can simply now change this to a field map.

32
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.320
Let me just pan this a little bit so that these blocks away or let's zoom back in so you can see that's

33
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.620
our field map.

34
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.940
And again we can just simply take this hold on control drag into color and we've achieved exactly the

35
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.230
same result so we can't take our revenue right click put it in here.

36
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.410
Average revenue average return on market investment.

37
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.600
Our average average marking spend if you right click again and we can also put the sales region into

38
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.010
our label.

39
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.490
There we go.

40
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.710
So as simple as that.

41
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.900
Now this second approach it might've seemed much quicker just that's just because in the first approach

42
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.160
we performed here.

43
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.080
We had to talk through it and it was the first time we're talking about CASM territories.

44
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.670
Now we were pretty used to them and that's why it's so much quicker.

45
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.550
In reality I think that the first approach is simpler because you just select the objects on the map

46
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.830
and you put them into a group.

47
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.450
But the second approach is more versatile and it's kind of like more proper.

48
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.230
So you actually create this geographical role so you can see in this situation we actually puts cells

49
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:35.670
region we created as a lower standard a geographic role so in that sense it's more of a solid process

50
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.890
rather than just picking things out on a map you're actually assigning the geographical role and then

51
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.710
using.

52
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.550
So both approaches are valid and depending on your circumstances and what exactly you're trying to create

53
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.320
you might use one or the other.

54
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.530
Just remember about them and remember that this is a very powerful tool.

55
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.990
So it doesn't have to be states that you can be working with countries and you can put different countries

56
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.700
into geographical regions or he can be working with other existing geographical roles and then assign

57
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.900
their aggregations custom geographical roles so that can be a very very powerful feature as you can

58
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.750
see right away here.

59
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.370
We were able to create this resolution very quickly and perform some analytics around it already.

60
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.980
So there we go.

61
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.520
Hope you enjoyed today's tutorial.

62
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.470
Have a play around with that and I look forward to seeing you next time.

63
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.950
Until then happy analyzing.
