00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.405
The next thing we're going to do is look at changing our fonts.

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:05.910
Now, by default, old-school web design,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.130
you only had some really basic fonts to pick from,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.470
like Arial, and Georgia, and Times.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.710
What we can do now though, is we can pick a huge variety of fonts now.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.360
There's a couple of methods to do it.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.050
Probably the most common one to do is something called Google Fonts

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.045
and that's what we'll do in here because it's quick, it's easy, it's free.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:22.860
You can also use Typekit,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.610
or Adobe Edge Web Fonts, or Squirrel Fonts.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.040
There's a lot of different ways of [inaudible]

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.880
fonts onto both your desktop mock up and through to your website.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.500
The big thing to know then is that not all fonts that you have on

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.220
your machine will convert and be able to be used online.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.245
So the way to check is to use

00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:45.200
a service like Google Fonts to find a font that you want to use.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.585
So let's do that. Let's switch out to Google fonts.

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:50.210
So google.com/fonts.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.680
Google have got a whole lot of commercial use fonts that we get to use.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.215
What I'm going to do is I'm going to look for a font.

00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:59.465
So I'm going to use preview text of BYOL,

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:01.410
because that's the font that I'm looking for.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.900
I'm going to go through and pick a font.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.455
Now, I'm going to use Roboto as my body copy font.

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:09.910
There's another one called Roboto Slab that I'll use for my headings.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.180
To be able to use these web fonts on your desktop via Photoshop,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.550
that they can later then be used on your website,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.250
what you need to do is pick on one of them, click "Add to collection."

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.410
I'm going to use another font.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.195
I'm going to type in Roboto here.

00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:23.940
There is another one of font called

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.310
Roboto Slab that I want to use and I'm going to add that to collection.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.945
So I got two added to my collection,

00:01:27.945 --> 00:01:31.275
the normal one, normal Roboto and this Roboto slab.

00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:33.150
Now, what we're going to do is click "Use."

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.300
Now, let's just pick the basics, the normal version.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.265
What I want is I want a light version and I'd like a bold version.

00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:44.970
I'd like this one here, a light version.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.145
A light version and a bold version.

00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:48.530
Now, the more fonts you add,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.350
you could add all of these and download them.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.645
That's totally fine for while you're working on your Photoshop mock up.

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:56.390
But what will happen is, if they all have to be used on your website,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.025
it's going to make the page load a little slow.

00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:01.440
As you can see over here exactly here, Google is giving me a little speed counter,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.125
knowing that the one's I've got is in the green area,

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:05.610
as in it'll load fast enough.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.125
If you start getting to orange,

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:08.510
it's going to slow it right down,

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.780
and red is way too many fonts downloaded for a page,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.280
and it's going to impact your page load time too much.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.590
Once you've got them, what we're going to do is

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.450
we're going to download them to use on our machine.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.930
To do that, there's this little arrow at the top here.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.715
Here's a little Download button.

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:28.030
I'm going to download this collection as a Zip file,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.615
and I'm going to stick it onto my Desktop.

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:32.555
Now, for you guys, if you want to follow along,

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:37.325
I've already got the fonts ready for you go and downloaded already in the exercise files.

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:40.795
So download the exercise files and you should find them in the fonts folder.

00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:43.370
Now, to install the fonts on your machine,

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.730
it depends if you're on a Mac or PC. Essentially, they're the same.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.205
If you've got a modern PC, or a modern Mac,

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:51.890
you simply just double-click the fonts and they will install.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.545
So this is the font that I just downloaded from Google Fonts.

00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:57.915
If you're looking for the same things, they're all in here,

00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:01.670
in your example files, if you don't want to go through the hassle of downloading these.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.945
I'm going to double-click the Zip file, it opens it up.

00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:08.460
Here's my little fonts folder and here the two groups of fonts.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.690
I'm going to twirl that down.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.315
What I want to do is I'm going to select all of these,

00:03:12.315 --> 00:03:14.770
and I'm going to double-click them.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.165
Then I click "Install." My little Mac is going to

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:21.905
chugs away and install all of these fonts here.

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:25.400
Might have come up with an error now just to say that the already installed,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.800
because I've done it previously before this tutorial.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.860
Yours won't have them. Close down my fonts folder.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.900
I'll have to do the same for Roboto Slab.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.920
Select all of these, double-click them,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.090
and they'll all install.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.040
Now, on a PC, it's a really similar process.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.230
If you're unsure how to install them on your machine,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.270
either drop me a message or have

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.930
a little Google and see how you can install them on your machine.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.955
Now, let's have a look in Photoshop now.

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:53.030
The good thing about Photoshop is you won't have to restart it,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.875
or restart your machine, or anything like that,

00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:56.370
Photoshop will pick up your new fonts.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.280
You can see here is my Roboto fonts,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.610
and they're ready to start being used in my design.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.260
Knowing because we use Google Fonts,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.130
it's a font that we can use online for our website in the end.
