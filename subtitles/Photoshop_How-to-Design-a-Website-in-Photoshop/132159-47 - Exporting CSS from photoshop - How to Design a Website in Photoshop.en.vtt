00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
In this video, we're going to look at how to get

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.365
something called the CSS out of your document.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:06.300
The web developer is going to say, "What color is this?

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.320
What size is this?

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.170
What font is it? What's the spacing between the lines?"

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.700
You could go through with

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.040
the Type Tool and write them all out and explain what they all are.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.310
A nice little helpful thing you can do to make it little

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.920
easier for them is to export the CSS.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.820
Now, let's say that they want to know what font this is and what font size it is.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.485
What we can do with my cursor, there it is, here we are.

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:31.560
What I selected is one here that says Copy CSS.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.855
If I copy CSS, nothing seems to happen.

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:37.945
What it's done is it has copied it and to your clipboard like you've gotten in at copy.

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:42.875
Now you can open up, and [inaudible] at a word or checking at an e-mail and hit paste.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:47.900
What it's done is that it's created this class along the top there,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.155
which we probably don't need.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.630
It's got all the important stuff like font size, font family,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.205
font color, the font weight,

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:58.310
the line heights with the centered.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.440
This type of thing, position,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.250
left, top, send it to develop anyway.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.960
They're probably going to ignore all this.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840
If you are web designer, you'll just know what

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.225
to pick out of this and what you don't need.

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:15.070
Now I can explain to my web developer that the hero heading text is this.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.235
They'll be able to use their magic web design skills to

00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:22.970
style the text to make it match exactly like your Photoshop mockup.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.250
Let's look at doing it full some of the structured parts.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.990
I like this navigation box at the top,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.480
because what we need is maybe the height and we

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.360
need what color it is and what the Alpha transparency is,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.890
or the opacity is.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.200
I'm going to select them as my Nav Bar.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.580
I'm going to go up to Layer,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.185
I'm going to go to Copy CSS,

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:44.890
and I'm going to jump into Notepad. This is going to be my nav bar.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.465
I'm going to hit Paste.

00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:50.685
There's bits they're going to be able to use and bits that's not.

00:01:50.685 --> 00:01:53.420
If you're not a web designer and you have no idea what this junk is,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.660
just send in the whole lot and they can pick through it.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.920
I know that we don't need the class,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.660
and we'll use background color,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.555
we'll use the opacity, but we don't need any of this,

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.705
but we do need the height.

00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:07.160
Those are the things I'm probably looking for as

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.310
a web designer that I need to go and style to make sure it's the same,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.375
and then it does take a lot of the guesswork out of me as a web developer to say,

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:16.820
"It's about that high and it's about that

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.780
transparency," and to send it back to you as the design for you to come back and say,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.010
"Hey, it's not the right one,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.390
and what's it toing and froing?"

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.455
This will help remove a lot of that.

00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:28.445
That's one of the nice new features and Photoshop CC.

00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:30.350
If you're using CS6 or CS5,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.255
unfortunately, it's not a feature for you.

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:34.460
You're going to have to do a lot more of the toing and froing

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.130
and typing out and explaining what the font is,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.480
what the font size is,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.205
color it is, what opacity it is,

00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:41.855
and labeling that out for them,

00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:43.700
or if they have some Photoshop skill themselves,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.840
they can go into it and do it.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.940
That's exploiting CSS from Photoshop.
