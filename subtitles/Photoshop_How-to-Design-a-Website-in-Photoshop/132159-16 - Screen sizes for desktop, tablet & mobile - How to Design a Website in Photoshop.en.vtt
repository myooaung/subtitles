00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.235
Hi. In this video, we're going to look at screen resolution versus our actual pixel size.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.350
This can be a little confusing when you're starting,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.925
you're thinking, "Great, I'm going to do a mock up for an iPhone 6."

00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:14.060
You go off into Photoshop and here is the dimensions.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.360
You Google it, and it says it's this pixel width by this pixel height,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.025
and you decide, "I'm going to make that.

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:20.300
I'm going to go into Photoshop,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.710
I'm going to make a new document that it's going to be 750 by this 1,334."

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.790
You make it and you end up with this size here.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.630
Now, this isn't the true size, it's going to be.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.660
Let's look back at that website here and we'll see that it's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.270
the CSS width that we really need to observe when we are designing for mobile,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.720
because we all know that mobile phones,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.830
apart from a couple of them,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.305
all are very similar in the size.

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:48.020
But what will happen is this pixel ratio here,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.720
you can see when it is one to one,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.270
that whatever physical size that is,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.010
is the actual size of the screen here.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.995
There's no real density, and if you've seen an old iPhone 3,

00:00:57.995 --> 00:00:59.720
you'll notice that the graphics aren't great,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.035
but it's the physical same size as an iPhone 6.

00:01:04.035 --> 00:01:06.870
But what happens is when you get this denser pixel ratio,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.615
the same physical size, we see is doubled here.

00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:11.330
The actual pixels get a lot bigger,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.855
but the actual size of the phone is exactly the same.

00:01:13.855 --> 00:01:16.274
You'll notice say this LG G4,

00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:17.840
this one here has a picture ratio of four,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.580
so it's quite a small phone,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.770
so the size is as the iPhone 6,

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.910
but you can see it's hugely big in terms of its physical width.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.760
But we have a look at it here in comparison with each other,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.150
they're actually not that different.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.480
Slightly bigger, the iPhone 6 is slightly bigger,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.770
but not a huge big jump as in this indication here.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.495
So they can be quite confusing when you're new.

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:41.855
The basics are is that when you're designing a Photoshop,

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:45.800
designing for this physical size will give you the best representation of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.035
the actual phone rather than following

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:52.570
these physical pixel widths over in the slide here.
