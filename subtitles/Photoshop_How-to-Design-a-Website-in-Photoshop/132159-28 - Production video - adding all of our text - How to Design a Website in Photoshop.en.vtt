00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.680
This is a process video, so I'm going to go through and start styling my website.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
First of all, the Bring Your Own Laptop layer here, the logo.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.310
You've got a logo, obviously, you'll be dimming in the company logo.. What I'm going

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.410
to do is I'm going to have this guy sitting next to this column here.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.690
Now, if you are moving things around and it tries to snap to too many things,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.730
it snapped to the other guide there okay,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.000
you can use your left and right arrow keys

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.480
on your keyboard just a tap things along and get them in the right place.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.030
I'm going to pick a font. With the layer selected,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.395
grab the type tool.

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:36.900
I'm going to use my Roboto.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.835
I'm going to use the slab one,

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:40.605
I'll use the bold version for this.

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:42.180
What is the font size?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.470
There's no guaranteed font size.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.680
I'm going to use this one here,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.190
tap it down a little bit using my arrow keys.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.330
Now I'm going to look at adding my navigation panel, which is over here.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.790
I'm going to grab the type tool, I'm going to get it so it spans.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.100
We've got a lot of room to work with,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.950
so I'm going to get it so it spans that column all the way long. How many is that?

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.960
About nine columns. Inside here,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.270
I'm going to zoom in a little bit and I'm going to type in home.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.700
If, like me, you can't see your text and its disappeared,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.290
it's because the font's actually really big.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.465
Remember the font from the last thing we were doing?

00:01:21.465 --> 00:01:24.115
That's why I expand it out here. Here, there he is.

00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:28.230
But if he is small and you can't see him because the text box is too small,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.750
just expand the box out,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.470
select all the text and make it an appropriate size.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.220
I'm going to put mine down to 12, actually,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.025
maybe 16 pixels for the moment,

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:39.205
and then I can move it back up again so I can see it.

00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:40.650
For the text here, I'm going to use capitals.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.395
This first one here is going to be SERVICES,

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.860
then I'm going to put a space between them.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.520
I'm going to put two tabs in between mine.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.040
The next one's going to be PORTFOLIO, two tabs.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.980
Now, in terms of should I be using tabs or spaces or should they be in separate boxes,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.545
it really doesn't matter because this is just a visual.

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:02.090
When it comes to web design,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.430
they'll have to be separated properly,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.990
but for the moment, it's up to you what you use to space them out.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.880
Now maybe lets go 1, 2, 3,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.280
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.960
I'm going to copy that,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.650
select through copy it so I know that the spacing here is exactly 10.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.965
Then I am going to use TEAM,

00:02:17.965 --> 00:02:22.780
put the same spacing in, and then we're going to have a CONTACTUS.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.980
What I also want to do is I'm going to select

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.100
all this text and I'm going to make it up the top here to be

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.345
left aligned so it's always left aligned along that column grid there.

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:34.160
Font size is fine,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.100
but the font style I'm going to switch back to our plain old Roboto.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.480
I'm going to select this text here,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.360
type in Roboto, and now I'm just going to use medium for the moment.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.735
I'm going to turn my grids off using Command, semicolon.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:52.725
To get a sense of it I'm going to zoom out a little bit. I don't like the text.

00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:55.860
Instead of medium, I'm going to pick the light version.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.040
I like that nicer.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.765
Now, next thing we are going to look at,

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:04.780
we're going to put a big headline above this piece of lorem ipsum here.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.950
I'm going to find the lorem ipsum in my menu, drag it down.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.090
I am going to use my type tool.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.785
I am going to draw a fixed width box because I want it to sit inside of here.

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:14.300
Even when you're dragging out text boxes,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.630
you should use the grids to line things up,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.380
using these columns, just that it makes it

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.330
a lot easier when it comes to development time.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.945
What is this one? I'm going to make sure it's centered.

00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:29.580
This one's going to be, Let's Make This Awesome.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.105
Selecting the text, make it a nice size.

00:03:33.105 --> 00:03:35.030
When I say nice, appropriate for this one,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.650
a nice, big, super graphic.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.495
I'm going to pick Roboto,

00:03:38.495 --> 00:03:40.625
and I'll use the slab.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:43.340
I'll use thin for this one here.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.525
In terms of color,

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:47.495
I'm going to use one of my swatches that I use.

00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:49.580
Down the bottom here, I'm going to use this color here.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.659
How to do it, with it selected,

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.780
I've clicked on "Swatch" here and that switched the color out.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.415
I'm going to turn my guides off.

00:03:56.415 --> 00:03:58.770
I'm going to move that down.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.780
This text here, I'd like it to be centered as well.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.320
I'm going go to grab my type tool,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.880
click inside of it, and I'm going to make you centered.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.915
If you're finding problems with this hyphenation,

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:11.990
what you can do is you can click this icon here,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.090
which will bring up your Character panel,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.520
you can switch to Paragraph and turn hyphenate off,

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.215
if you are having trouble with hyphenation.

00:04:18.215 --> 00:04:22.145
I hate hyphenation. Popping back in.

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:24.905
Let's just say, for this bit of text,

00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:27.570
it's actually only going to be three lines.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.710
I'm going to try and get the copywriter to work three lines for this one,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.900
and I'm going to move him up a little bit,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.005
grab "Let's Make" down.

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:38.510
Actually, one little bit I've forgotten is I'm going to add a nice,

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.085
big call-to-action button here.

00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:42.410
I'm going to my type tool and I'm going to click once,

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.145
and this one's going to be called the More,

00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:47.655
I have a plus.

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:49.245
What text am I going to pick?

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:53.360
I'm going to make it a little smaller, maybe about 30.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.210
I'm going to make it a lot heavier, bold.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.350
I'm going to make it white,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.430
place the thing up here.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.255
I'm going to grab my rectangle tool.

00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:03.650
It's going to be above this guy,

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.135
but we can change the layers in a second.

00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:08.420
But what I want to do is turn my guides on, Command, colon.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.330
I'm going to get this one to be snapped between these two center ones.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.295
What color is it going to be?

00:05:15.295 --> 00:05:17.195
I'm going to pick my green.

00:05:17.195 --> 00:05:20.840
I want to make sure More is above that rectangle.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.240
I'm going to give this rectangle a name and call this one BT, so I know it's a button.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.145
This one's going to be the More button.

00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:29.445
I am going to grab my More text,

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:31.320
grab my move tool and move it around.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.450
Remember, if you can't get in the line,

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.740
just use your cursor to move it around.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.125
Everything needs to be moved up a little bit.

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:44.395
To do that, I can hold down my Command key and I've got more selected already.

00:05:44.395 --> 00:05:47.420
Hold down Command key, click button "More".

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.835
Let's make this Awesome and Loren ipsum.

00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:52.360
Those are the four parts I want to move,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.980
and I'm going to click and drag it up.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.820
Remember, if you're unsure about if it snaps to the wrong points,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.240
maybe you can just use your arrow key just to tap it up and tap it down.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.740
Turn my guides off. We're almost there. That More is a bit big.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.540
Let's grab back my More layer,

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.970
grab my type tool, turn it down to 24.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.990
Nice. Move it up a tad, there we go.
