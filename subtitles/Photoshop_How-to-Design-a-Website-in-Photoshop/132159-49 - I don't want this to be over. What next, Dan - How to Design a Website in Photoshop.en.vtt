Where do we go from here? Once you've finished your mock-up,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.125
please send me a screenshot,

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:14.760
or a JPEG version via the forum or the discussion on this page.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.560
I'd love to see what you've made.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.140
Video training can be really one-way traffic.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.170
I get my thrills from seeing what students have made.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.830
To make this course as good as it can be,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.640
please pass on any suggestions and ask any questions.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.425
For any persistent questions,

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:33.185
I'll add new videos to the course to make it even bigger.

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:36.410
Place stay connected via your favorite social media channel.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.885
There are lots of awesome things coming up

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:42.530
in future versions of Photoshop and I'd love to share them with you.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.780
That's it for me. Bye for now.
