00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
This video we're going to look at something called Lorem Ipsum.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.820
All of the time when you are designing a website,

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.090
maybe the text isn't written,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.440
or it's being written at the same time.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.740
It's quite often you have to put in dummy text or place holder text.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.200
What people tend to do is use something called Lorem Ipsum,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.915
and it's built into Photoshop so we can add that.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.510
I'm going to zoom in on my desktop and around.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.340
What I'm going to do is I'm going to put in a fixed width box,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.355
and I want it to match my column song, and I go to "View",

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:30.870
and turn on my "Show", "Guides".

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.930
Zoom out a little bit. I wanted to expand

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.635
across maybe four of these in the middle, maybe six.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.090
I'm going to grab the type tool,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.985
and then click hold and drag.

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:44.710
I'm going to add a type box that spans six of my columns.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.325
I'm going to pick an appropriate font size and maybe 16 pixels.

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:53.475
What I want to do is go to "Type" and I'm going to go to "Paste Lorem Ipsum".

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:57.050
Essentially, what it does is just dumps in a mixed up bit of Latin words.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.000
There are actual Latin words, but they don't mean anything in the flow of texts there.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.710
It's a good quick way to dump in lots of extra texts.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.605
What you will notice though is that the box is over six.

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:08.780
It means that there's more texts is a little kind,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.070
a little plus you can't really see down the bottom corner here.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.680
But know that if I delete this,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.490
can you see there's lots of extra stuff over the edges.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.015
Depending on how much you need, you might have to delete some of them.

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:21.810
You can't really dump in a set amount,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.840
it just dumps in a predefined amount.
