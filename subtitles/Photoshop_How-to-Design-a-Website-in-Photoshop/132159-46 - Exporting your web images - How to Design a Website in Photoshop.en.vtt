00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Now in this video, we're going to look at how to get your images out of Photoshop so

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.510
that you can hand them over to your developer to start building the website.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.465
Now what they're going to want is some web ready images,

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:11.445
not just the big Photoshop file.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.460
If your developer does use Photoshop then potentially you could

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.460
just hand over this PSD and leave them to it.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.000
But often it's the designer's role to get the images out ready for web.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.280
There are pretty much two formats we're going to work with.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.650
There's going to be a JPEG and a PNG.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.410
Now, essentially JPEGs are great for photographs and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.560
PNGs are really great for any kind of linear icons,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.900
logos, ticks, those types of things.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.120
It's reasonably easy to know which one to use because

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.475
it comes down to file size versus quality.

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:40.470
If it looks great and it's small,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.315
then you should be using that format.

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:44.610
You check both of them, JPEG versus PNG,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.940
see which is the smallest, see which looks the best and then use that.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.740
We're using a new feature in Photoshop CC 2015.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.970
If you're using an early version,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.820
you're going to have to use something called the Slice Tool.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.290
But because we're using the newer version,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.815
we're going to use this fancy awesome way called the Export As.

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:03.095
To do it, let's look at doing this image first.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:05.060
So slipped into my Layers,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.280
there's this image sitting on top of the box.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.440
It doesn't really matter which one you export,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.855
whether its the box or the image, it'll work for both of them.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:13.910
What we're going to do is right-click it and we're going

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.070
to go down to this one that says Export As.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.230
When we get on top when we know it's a PNG,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.285
we can use Quick Export but at the moment,

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:22.505
I know because it's an image, it's going to be a JPEG.

00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:24.100
So we're going to get Export As.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.740
So it tells me the size and it tells me that as a PNG,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.295
this one's going to be set at 76 kilobytes and that's pretty big.

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:33.724
So you've got a relative scale.

00:01:33.724 --> 00:01:35.630
Once you start getting close to 100,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.245
that's far too big for an image this size.

00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:40.040
So when you're at 100 kilobytes,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.035
you're way above what it should be.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.940
So, what we can do is switch it to JPEG.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.030
Then you've got this quality slider.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.455
Very rarely does it go out on a 100 percent.

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:50.990
You want to drag it down until you've got this balance

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.990
of it's very small in terms of file sizes,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.035
but there's almost no noticeable degrading of the image.

00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:59.995
So what you do is you drag it right down to something silly.

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:03.180
So we're down at 15 percent and it's hard to know,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.785
is it good? Is it bad?

00:02:04.785 --> 00:02:10.310
What I like to do is click up here and click back down and decide how low can you go.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.405
Now in this case,

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:14.660
it can get quite low because the image itself is quite noisy and it's black and white.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.940
We can get away with quite a lot of low quality,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.980
but you can see the size becoming quite low.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.615
So when it's up at a 100,

00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:23.540
it's at a reasonably good 38 kilobytes,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.620
but I can get it a lot lower.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.045
Now my rules, I hang around in there between 30 and 60 depending on the image.

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:31.130
This one can go quite low because it is quite noisy,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.260
so at 30 percent of its original quality we're at

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.770
12 kilobytes and that's a nice fine size for me. I'm going to hit Export.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.050
The last thing you need to do is when you are exporting this,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.239
I'm going to hit this little option here so I can see,

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.725
I'm going to put it on my Desktop.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:46.085
I'm going to put it in a special folder called Web Ready Images that I've made.

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:49.310
The other thing you need to know that when you are naming your images,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.889
is you need to make sure there's no spaces,

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.390
and you need to make sure you don't use any of

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.760
the crazy characters that are along the top of your keyboard.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.715
So just keep it to numbers and letters,

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:01.010
and make sure there are no spaces.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.590
I'm going to hit Export, and that's my JPEG out.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.910
Now we can move around,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.830
let's say it's my portfolio here.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.060
It doesn't really matter which of these two boxes I select,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.770
but I can right-click it and say

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.995
Export As and hopefully it will remember what I last did, so 30 percent.

00:03:16.995 --> 00:03:19.920
You can see in this case 30 percent is not great for me.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.530
If I drag up to 100,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.565
it might be hard to see on the video that you're watching unless you're in HD.

00:03:25.565 --> 00:03:27.800
But at 30 percent, it's not great.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.170
So different images will allow you go higher and

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.215
lower depending on the quality of them and what stuffs in them.

00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:37.894
So, I told you I go up to about a high of 60,

00:03:37.894 --> 00:03:42.080
in this case I might go just a little bit higher because the trade-off is,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.440
can you see down here [inaudible] at 5 kilobytes is something that's quite small.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.335
So I'm going to hit Export, and that's going to be Portfolio 1.

00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:52.500
It's taken the name of the Layer.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.130
So, when you are naming your Layers and you want to save some time later

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.115
on is to use hyphens instead of spaces.

00:03:58.115 --> 00:03:59.660
I like to use lower case.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.320
It doesn't really matter when it comes to web design but I like to be consistent.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.790
Hit Export. So that's that one and you can move through, export this one.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.415
Now what you can do is you can export lots at the same time.

00:04:10.415 --> 00:04:11.880
So I'm going to click Portfolio 2,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.200
3 and 4, right-click,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.510
go to Export As and what will happen is it'll tile it on this left-hand side here.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.480
So you have this one selected,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.300
70 percent is fine,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.420
it's small, this one here,

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.970
this one ends up at 7 kilobytes. Can you see the difference?

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.600
They're the same size, but there's a lot of different content going along in this image.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.045
A lot more different colors and color variations.

00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:34.280
So, this one's a lot higher and you

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.815
might be able to go a little bit lower in terms of the quality.

00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:38.675
It'll depend on your image,

00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:41.600
so we can wait through them. This one looks great.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.010
This one looks fine.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.865
That one looks fine at 40, maybe not, 60.

00:04:47.865 --> 00:04:51.290
We're going to click Export, and the only problem with this though is that naming them,

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.350
it's going to dump them all in this folder without putting our little hyphens and

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.705
so we can do that later. So it exported them.

00:04:57.705 --> 00:05:02.340
I'm going to go and find it on my Desktop and web ready images,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.260
there is Portfolio 1, 2 and 3.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.030
You'll save yourself a lot of time later

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:16.265
on by using lowercase if you want to and make sure there's hyphens instead of spaces,

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:18.955
or you can use underscores, it doesn't really matter.

00:05:18.955 --> 00:05:21.985
Now the next format we're going to look at is PNG.

00:05:21.985 --> 00:05:26.375
So PNG format gets used when there's one of two things happen,

00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:29.970
that there is really flat graphics like these icons,

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.960
nice things like icons and fonts and logos,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.340
anything that has really aesthetic,

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.800
flat design to it comes out really good as a PNG.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.310
PNGs have a really good way of keeping nice,

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.860
crisp edges at really small file sizes.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.585
The other benefit of a PNG is that it uses transparency whereas a JPEG doesn't.

00:05:47.585 --> 00:05:50.930
So I want these icons here to be see-through so that I can change

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.450
the background color like this and it's still see-through.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.765
So I can go through, change the background color

00:05:56.765 --> 00:05:59.500
and there's holes in the middle of here to show it through.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.725
If I use a JPEG,

00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:02.030
it doesn't allow me to do it,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.390
it has to have a solid background copy changed.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.645
It's the same here for these graphics here.

00:06:06.645 --> 00:06:08.650
Even though there were an image and I said,

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.705
"JPEGs are great for images," in this case,

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.870
I'm going to have to take the hit on file size to be a little bit

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.635
larger because I want transparent background and I'll show you why.

00:06:18.635 --> 00:06:20.180
This is a really good example to show you.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.205
So I'm going to find Team 1,

00:06:23.205 --> 00:06:27.425
I'm going to right-click it and there's Quick Export as PNG.

00:06:27.425 --> 00:06:31.175
Now when you're new, you're not too sure if it should be a PNG or not,

00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:33.845
you can use the Export As which is the slightly long way.

00:06:33.845 --> 00:06:37.085
So I've got the JPEG format and you can see in JPEG that the quality,

00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:39.890
change it up to something like 70, the quality is what,

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.360
10 kilobytes, nice and small,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.665
but it's got this white background.

00:06:42.665 --> 00:06:45.065
The JPEG will not allow transparency,

00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:46.435
it's not in its makeup.

00:06:46.435 --> 00:06:48.900
So we're going to have to do a PNG and we've got two kinds.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.685
There is PNG 8,

00:06:50.685 --> 00:06:54.560
which is fine and this file size is quite small,

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.200
but the actual color palette it can use is actually quite small,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.215
it's only 256 colors.

00:07:00.215 --> 00:07:03.950
So if you want to use a full-color PNG you have to use this one up here,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.755
which is called a PNG 24.

00:07:05.755 --> 00:07:07.320
Even then I write it there.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.855
So PNG 8 versus PNG 4.

00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:13.355
You'll see the file size is substantially different.

00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:17.400
This one here, up to PNG 24.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.320
This is really big.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.970
But this is the trade-off of having transparency,

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.040
JPEGs are really small but graphics they have to have

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.290
transparent backgrounds and have to use full-color,

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.020
have to use this PNG here.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.110
So I'm going to use full-color PNG,

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:38.700
hit Export, and Team 1, click OK.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.360
So I should now work through and do the same

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.015
for the other two heads and the rest of the images here,

00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:46.430
let's look at doing it for this icon along the top,

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.750
and it would be the exact same process of exporting this image along the bottom here.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.905
I've got my icon,

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:55.340
and I know this needs to be a PNG.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.375
Why? Because it needs transparent background which default makes it a PNG,

00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:03.475
and it is a nice flat graphic which means it's going to be nice and small.

00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:07.610
Right-click. I could use my Quick Export as P&G now because I know

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.560
it's going to be a PNG because it's flat graphics

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.660
that needs transparency, it's definitely a PNG.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.920
So I'm going to hit Export as PNG and I'm going to go straight to here and I'm going

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.210
to put it on my desktop under my web ready graphics and I'm going to put it in there.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.020
Now I'll just work through the different icons and to say Export As PNG,

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.985
let's have a quick look at the PNG size.

00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:27.170
So you can see this one here,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.445
90 kilobytes really big because it's PNG trying to do what JPEGs do.

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:35.030
But you can see PNGs with transparency doing what it does well,

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.540
see it's down to 2 kilobytes nice and small.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.160
These are the kinds of graphics that you're going to need to hand

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.270
over to your web developer for your website build.
