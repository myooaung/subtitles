00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
Hi. In this video we're going to look at Artboards.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.705
Artboards is a new feature that came out in Photoshop CC 2015.

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:09.900
Now if you're using later version, it's going to work fine.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.380
If you're using an earlier version though,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.110
there was no such thing as art boards in 2014.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.550
What you're going to have to do is,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.770
you're going to have to use just separate pages.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.675
But if you are using my version or later,

00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:22.930
essentially all they are is a way of having multiple pages on

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.255
the one document rather than separating them into separate Photoshop documents.

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:28.875
To do it, let's go to File,

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:33.285
let's go to New and let's pick Art Board from the New Document window

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:35.395
and let's put in our widths that we discussed

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:38.050
earlier in terms of the physical sizes of our,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.225
let's start with our desktop view.

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:42.850
Our desktop is going to be 960 pixels,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.550
now the height doesn't really matter

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.890
because websites change height depending on what the content is.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.910
I'm going to put in, let's say 1500 and click Okay.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.260
This is my first Artboard.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.915
It's called Artboard one and you can see my layers here.

00:00:57.915 --> 00:01:00.920
It's a slightly new one. If you're used to using Photoshop before,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.815
there's a slightly new grouping system with art boards.

00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:07.010
So I'm going to double-click art board one to rename it.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.155
This one's going to be called desktop,

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:12.080
and it's going to be 960 pixels wide.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.870
Great. You can see the name changes along the top here.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.760
To add another view,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.025
so let's all work on a tablet view next.

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:20.540
There's a couple different ways of doing it.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.565
The easiest way I've found is using Layer,

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:25.355
New, and using this one, that says art board.

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:27.424
This one's going to be called Tablets,

00:01:27.424 --> 00:01:31.495
and it's going to be 720 pixels wide.

00:01:31.495 --> 00:01:35.585
I'm going to make sure it says 720 pixels down here and use the same height.

00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:38.635
Click Okay, and it slips it next to it there.

00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:41.325
The last view we're going to do is the mobile view.

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:43.830
We're going to go along to Layer, New.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.220
We're going to go to art board and we're going to pick mobile and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.790
this one is going to be 360 pixels.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340
That's just the name along the top there.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.650
I need to actually change the pixels down the bottom here

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.925
and we use the same height and we'll click Okay.

00:01:57.925 --> 00:02:00.125
So we've got tablet view,

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:02.450
desktop view, and mobile view all next to each other.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.580
Now, where it becomes quite useful is when you start

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.430
designing across all three and you want to make sure they're all consistent.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.235
Let's say that I'm going to use my rectangle tool.

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:12.170
I'm going to pick a swatch color in here,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.170
any random color and not that color.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.200
One of the big perks for using art boards is the fact that I

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.510
can draw something that's actually quite far over the edge here.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.295
You see it's quite at the edge here and I let go,

00:02:23.295 --> 00:02:25.485
you see it crops it down to my desktop view.

00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:29.460
It's a nice little feature. Now the next thing I'm going to do is I want the same.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.035
Let's say this is my nav bar.

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:34.750
So I'm going to double-click this as my big navigation bar along the top.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.470
I've double-clicked the name down the bottom and renamed it.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.030
I now want to move it across.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.950
Now I'm going to switch back to the Move Tool,

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.555
it defaults to this Artboard tool quite a bit when you're working with Artboards.

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:48.880
I moved the Move Tool and what I'd like to do is I'm going to duplicate nav bar.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.785
I'm going to right-click it and click the one that says duplicate.

00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:55.455
I'm going to call it Nav Bar.

00:02:55.455 --> 00:02:57.920
I've got two of them now, I'm going to use the Move Tool and I'm

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.035
going to click hold and drag it across the tablet.

00:03:00.035 --> 00:03:01.880
What can happen when you're dragging it,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.650
I'll undo that just to show you again,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.135
is I'm going to drag nav bar cross.

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:06.860
Initially, it doesn't actually move across.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.305
Sometimes you got to give them a bit of a wiggle,

00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:12.110
just to get it to appear in the tablet view,

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.135
then I can let go and it's in there.

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:16.745
You can see now that there's nav bar in my desktop view,

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:18.620
and I've got it in my tablet view.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.085
So, the last one, I'm going to duplicate it again.

00:03:21.085 --> 00:03:25.625
Duplicate Layer, I'm going to call it nav bar and in the mobile view,

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:26.900
I'm going to click hold and drag it, and then give it

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.285
a wiggle and it'll appear on my mobile view.

00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:32.100
Now you can see the benefits for this.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.730
I'm going to pop them in there and if you're working on

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.670
a separate documents and you have to switch between them,

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.650
it's really hard to know, is it the same color?

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.210
Is it lined up the same way?

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.015
Is it looking consistent across all the different views

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:47.410
and art boards is a really nice little new perk for Photoshop.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.540
And that is Artboards.
