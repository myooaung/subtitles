00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.525
To be a commercial web designer,

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:09.625
there is more to make than just a thoughtful website mark-up.

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:11.125
There are some final deliverables,

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:14.450
some tangible files and information that you'll

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.930
need to handover before the coding of your website can begin.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.530
Our aim before the end of this course is to have a folder filled with

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.900
web-ready images that follow the Crickweb naming conventions.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.570
You'll also be producing what's called a CSS sheet that

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.110
is used by a developer to know what fonts you were using,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.150
the heights and widths of your navigation box or your photo box.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.060
You'll learn how to pass on the correct color codes, the line height,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.685
spacing for your website so that

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:47.300
the lovely person who's building your website can get to work fast,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.640
and not have to make huge guesses from your mark-up.
