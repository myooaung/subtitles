00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
When we started creating our artboards,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.085
we all made them a height of I think 1500 pixels high.

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:08.550
Now let's look at my final version here and you'll notice that,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.730
say my desktop view here versus my mobile.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.050
My mobile was a lot longer and my desktop view is actually

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.465
longer than what I've originally done now as well.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:17.250
So as you're working along,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.170
you're going to end up changing the height of

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.040
your website quite a bit to accommodate the content that you're going to add in there.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.890
What you don't know yet, so it's going to change as you go along.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.020
Now to change these heights as you go,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.640
you want to use the artboard tool.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.790
To find the artboard told, you click and hold down the move tool and there it is.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.290
There's my artboard tool.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.450
Now to slick to say my desktop to make it

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.805
longer by clicking the middle, it doesn't really work, right?

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.420
I got to click on this edge here and make it a little longer.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.385
So click on the edge, you get the artboard and I can drag it down, and that's it.

00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:49.340
Okay, that's made my desktop view that much longer.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.370
You can obviously contract it as well.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.650
Now these little handles will stay on the outside and until you've

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.160
slick on anything else other than this high level artboard here,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.930
click on my Nav bar and they will disappear.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.270
Obviously, you can do it for any of the pages.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.290
I can then go to my artboard tool,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.430
make sure I click on the edge here of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.755
my mobile device and I can make this say a lot longer as I'm working,

00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:11.900
I'm going to finish, click on anything else inside

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.750
my layers and those little transform windows will be gone.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.380
All right, that's how you resize your webpage using the artboard tool.
