00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
In this video, we're going to look at icons.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.095
Now in this video, we're going to need four icons used for our services.

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:08.520
When looking for icons,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.310
let's say, in this case we're looking for free icons.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.560
There's lots of free icons online.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.150
Quite often though, when you're searching for them,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.250
it's hard to find some good stuff.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.580
I really like this site here called iconfinder.com,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.080
and this site is really good for finding free commercial use,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.105
as well as commercial icons.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:29.460
So I'm going to type in this case art,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.265
what we're looking to do is we're looking to switch it to free,

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.040
and instead of no licensing,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.080
we're going to go back to no back link, okay.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.630
That just means we get to use it and we don't have to add any links to it,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.550
so you can obviously add a back link in,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.800
there's is a bit more to choose from and

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.620
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this one here.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.655
The best thing about icon finder is often when you find one that you do like,

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:52.310
it's part of that larger set that is also free.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.340
I'm going to use this camera one,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.425
this desktop one, and a couple of others.

00:00:57.425 --> 00:00:59.630
Now, if you'd like to, you can skip ahead,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.080
and in the exercise files I've got four icons for you to start with.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.835
If you want to play along with this one,

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:06.050
what you do is you,

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.965
say we pick this camera here.

00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:11.330
Before you download it, what you want to do is pick a size that you want.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.800
Now, I like to pick the largest size I can find.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.430
So that later on if I need to use it for something else,

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.355
or a super graphic or a big tile for something,

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:22.220
I've got a large version of it around.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.900
So and then to download,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.165
we're going to use the PNG version

00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:30.635
and download it to your desktop and then import it into Photoshop.

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:33.370
What's I've done for you though is,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.050
let's go to Photoshop and lets import the images that I've already downloaded.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.465
So we're going to go to File,

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:42.630
Place Embedded, and there's icon 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.295
So we're going to bring in all of these.

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:47.030
So first of all, I'm going to place the first one.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.070
Okay, I'm just going to leave it at the size it came in at and hit Enter.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.030
The reason I do this is I'm going to scale them all down together,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.580
so I want them all on the page,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.820
select them all and scale them all down the exact same size,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.450
and rather than trying to do it separately and trying to match them.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.380
So let's go to File, Place Embedded,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.110
let's bring on icon 2, hit Enter.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.565
File, Place Embedded, icon 3, hit Return.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:15.075
File, Place Embedded, and let's bring in the last one.

00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:17.250
Great, so I've got four icons here.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.570
You can see them all in my layers.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.450
I am going to command,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.610
select all of these or hold down the control key,

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.680
if you are on a PC just click each individually.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.930
Now, they should move along together and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.525
we're going to use our shortcut command T or control T,

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:33.280
and I'm going to scale them down all to be the same type of size.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.615
Now actually before I do that, I'm going to hit Escape,

00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:37.040
and what I want to do is I want to see

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.990
my full com guide just to get a sense of what size they should be.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.355
Guide's on. I've got the four icons selected.

00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:45.345
I'm going to use my transform tool.

00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:48.105
I'm going to scale them down till I fit.

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:51.090
Okay, they fit across 1, 2,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.260
3 columns, so across three columns in four little groups.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.500
All right, so I'm going to zoom out a little bit.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.765
I'm going to distribute them basically just to get them in

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:05.350
a rough position to get started and then the last one.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.960
The way to get a little sense within the guides,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.490
what you'll watch out for is,

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.520
say I select icon 1,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.530
is that you'll notice that when I drag it around,

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.380
can you notice, see that little blue line that appeared?

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.660
Okay. If I moved it across again and back.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.260
We're looking for those, is telling us that it's in the middle of something.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.455
So I'm going to grab icon 2,

00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:29.960
turn it around so it's in the middle there because it has

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.870
a tendency to lock on to loads of different things in the document,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.045
what you can do is if it gets far off,

00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:36.945
just use your arrow keys to tap it

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:39.830
along until you feel like it's pretty close to the end.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.620
Now, what we need to do though is get them to line up center.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.300
So I'm going to select all of these guys,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.160
one, holding down the command key.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.590
There's actually four of these, and I've

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.470
got these options along the top here you can see I can align them along the top,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.770
align them along the bottom or I can align them along their centers,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.720
and that's what I'm going to do, align them along their centers.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.450
The next thing I need to do is color them.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.995
So we're going to color one first so we'll color icon one first.

00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:02.600
Turn off my guide, zoom in a little bit.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.890
I'm going to color this guy.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.680
I'm going to use this option down here called a layer style, okay.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.765
So with icon one selected, click on FX,

00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:11.195
and then go in and pick color overlay.

00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:13.430
Now, color overlay, at the moment,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.665
you can see it's overlaying it with gray.

00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:18.830
What I can do is I am going to click this little color one

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.055
and I am going to pick one of my colors from my color libraries.

00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:24.200
Now this little color picker doesn't have your swatches.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.790
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make sure at

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.680
the top here that I can see my swatches,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.750
especially the three that I've imported.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.895
So the greens and these guys,

00:04:31.895 --> 00:04:33.140
so that when I click gray,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.665
I can use my eyedropper tool to pick the color that I want.

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:37.620
Then I click Okay, click Okay again,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.220
and you can see the color has been overlaid.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.600
Now I want to apply the color effect to all the different icons.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.085
There's a couple of different ways you can right-click it and say copy,

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:48.100
layer style, and then paste it on the different ones.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.610
Or this is a nice easy trick,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.470
is that if you can see your icons,

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.570
which says I can click hold and drag it,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.225
just drag it onto the phone.

00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:57.500
Okay. Drag it onto the camera,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.390
and I click and hold and drag it onto the TV set there.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.470
Great, that's a way to bring in icons for our design.
