00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
In this video, we looked at the basics of

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.280
our rectangle tool to create the structured boxes for our website.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.140
What we're going to do now is do a bit of

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.480
a session where I go through and add all the boxes.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.615
You can watch us at double speed or skip it if you want to.

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:14.880
What I'm going to do is I've got my first box here.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.905
What I'm going to do is just duplicate this box

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:19.110
over and over again for the different areas.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.400
I'm going to use my trick to select it, Hero Graphic.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.010
I'm going to hold down Alt and drag it down.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.540
I'm going to hold Shift at the same time,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.105
and it snaps it all the way underneath.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:31.695
With this graphic here,

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:33.360
I'm going to call this one.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.895
I'm going to open up this tool here, my Properties panel.

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:40.725
I'm going to pick this one. This is kind of peachy color.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:48.960
This one, that's going to be called the Box - Who we are.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.895
I add box to the front just to make it clear from a distance.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:57.210
What. I'm looking at the structured boxes.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.770
I'm going to do the same thing with this one.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm going to drag him underneath,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.795
and he's in Properties panel.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:07.410
Here's the dark purple, and here's box.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.330
Here's the services box.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.430
I'm going to hold him down, drag him down,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.670
and he is going to be the box for our portfolio.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.460
We've run out of the edge of our pages.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.365
Let's change the color of him first actually.

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:25.200
Here's that color. Now, we've run on to the edge.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.400
What we can do, remember,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.150
is grab our Artboard tool,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.100
make sure we select on the desktop version, and I'm going to drag it down.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.845
Now, how far to drag it down. I'll zoom that a little bit.

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:36.630
Who knows at the beginning?

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.590
It's not until you get all your content on it you know how big it's going to be.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.190
I'm going to oversize it for the moment, make it nice and big.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.610
Then going to go back into my Move tool,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.865
I'm going to click on him,

00:01:47.865 --> 00:01:49.215
is the box portfolio,

00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:51.780
and I'm going to hold down the Alt key, drag it underneath.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.620
Actually, this chunk in here is going to be a big white area.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.340
It's got to have my people or team area.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.140
This last bit here is going to be the green.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:10.050
This one here is going to be called my Contact Form.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.670
Then just underneath it, drag it down,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.315
I'm going to have this last one is one of the non-official colors,

00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:18.670
like a dark gray for my footer.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.200
Now, it's a little big,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.085
so what I'm going to use as my Transform tool,

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:23.600
so Command T, remember.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.280
Command T. I'll make it a little smaller.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.645
That's going to be my footer. Now I have a rough idea of the page height.

00:02:33.645 --> 00:02:36.060
I'm going to suck it backup using the Artboard tool,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.815
click on this top one here,

00:02:37.815 --> 00:02:40.520
and it should snap to the bottom there.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.725
Back to the Move tool when you're finished.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:44.270
Now that I've got a desktop done,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.870
I could move everything across to my mobile version and start laying that one up.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.020
What I find, it's a lot easier to work on one and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.120
then once you've completed one and

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.430
finished and looked all the bugs out of one of the views,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.960
is to then start on,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.445
say, the next one,

00:02:58.445 --> 00:02:59.580
and then work in to mobile.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.200
Now, a lot of people who start with mobile first,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.070
if that's the priority for their website,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.110
it's definitely the way to go.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.315
There's definitely a lot more challenges getting everything ready for mobile.

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:11.510
For me, primarily my sites are being used as desktop,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.750
so I start with desktop.
