Photoshop is amazing at many things.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.285
In terms of designing websites,

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.850
it's the most commonly used tool and if you're

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.135
looking for employment in the web design world, it's essential.

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:17.730
Now website builds with mockups.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.390
These are visuals of what you think a website should look like.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.600
You do this before actually coding of the website.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.570
Why? Because it's a lot quicker.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.450
Making changes in Photoshop is only a matter of

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.155
selecting the right layer and dragging the page elements around.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:38.825
In code there can be a lot more implications for simply moving things around.

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:41.455
Photoshop does all the planning and design work.

00:00:41.455 --> 00:00:44.505
Then your mockup is built and coded up as a website.

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:47.120
If you are interested in doing the development work

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.985
yourself and you're unsure about where to get started,

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:52.520
drop me a line in the discussion or the forum,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.130
I'm really happy to help point you in the right direction there.
