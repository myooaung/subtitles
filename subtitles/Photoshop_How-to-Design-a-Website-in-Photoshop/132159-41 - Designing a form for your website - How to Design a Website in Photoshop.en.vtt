00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Hi. In this video, we're going to look at how to start a form.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.555
Forms are essentially just a group of rectangles.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:08.715
In this case, we're going to use a rectangle tool.

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:11.415
We'll pull a fill of white.

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:14.835
Now, the big thing to check with strokes is that,

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:16.875
by default, they're set two points,

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.120
which is more of a printing term.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.810
What we want to do, is we want to do one pixel,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.880
or two pixels, or three pixels.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.120
You can just type it in there over top of whatever is in there.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.980
I'm going to draw my rectangle.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.335
Now, I'm going to turn on my guides to make sure that they

00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:34.620
are within everything and so I have it going from this outer guide,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.330
over across to about the middle.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.430
I'm going to turn my guides off and then take a look

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.450
and see what I think are the edges here.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.980
So you can see here,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.930
it's got a dark gray edge with a white center.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.000
Do I like it? Yeah, it's all right.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.200
I'm going to add some text to it.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.535
So I'm going to grab the type tool.

00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:52.490
Now remember, I'm not going to click inside of

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.700
this because it's going to turn this rectangle into a box,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.030
so that's not really what I want.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.575
What I want to do is click off down here and this one's going to be my name.

00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:03.110
I'll select it all and I'm going to make it Roboto.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.070
I'm going to make it Roboto light and I'll make it a dark gray color here.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.920
Go back to my Move tool, zoom in.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.330
[inaudible] it's actually, he's big so I'm going to turn it down

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.140
to 20 and just have it sitting in about there.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.700
Now, grids are back on,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.920
I'm going to select both the name and the rectangle.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.910
Actually, this is going to be my form name, lower case.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.825
I'm going to select both of these and I'm going to hold down my "Alt key,

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:38.555
my Option key," and I hold and drag it down.

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:41.430
I'm going to give myself three of those.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.300
This one is going to be name,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:54.210
this one is going to be email and this one here is going to be phone number.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.710
Okay. I'm going to get them all to line up on the left-hand side.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.620
So I'm going to have phone, email,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.140
and name selected and I'm going to go

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.810
back to my move tool and then I can use this one here,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.905
which is align left edges, they should line up.

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:11.720
Okay, I'm going to do one of the box.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.190
I'm going to go to the rectangle tool,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.735
make sure everything is still set.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:17.255
I'll get back to my full color of white box,

00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:22.060
it's going to start up here and it's going to go down to the bottom of my phone box.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.110
I'm going to grab one of these guys, maybe phone,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.375
actually name because it's lined up,

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:30.755
hold down my alt key and drag them across holding shift.

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:32.690
This is behind where I need it to be,

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.645
so I'm going to drag it up and drag it back across a little bit.

00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:40.479
Actually, I'm going to change this first and I'm going to call this one message,

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.980
Move tool and move it along so it lines up there. Try to name everything.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.420
So I've got this box which is form email,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.860
this one is form phone and this one here is called form message.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.745
Next I'm going to add a submit button.

00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:03.475
So my submit button is just going to be another little rectangle.

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.365
In this case it goes down here.

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:07.135
It's going to cross three of them.

00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:15.360
I'm going to give it a fill color of dark purple and I'll grab my tab tool,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.535
click once down here.

00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:22.770
I'll call this one submit. I'm going to make it roboto,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.830
but I'll make this one roboto slab bold.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.420
Actually, what did we use up here?

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.495
Here I am going to grab my type tool and just click in here and to check.

00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:32.145
I've grabbed my type tool,

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:36.060
slip inside, this one was roboto slab 24.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.930
So I'm going to do the same with this one.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.570
Grab my type tool, click inside roboto slab bold 24 and I'll make it a color white.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.270
Move tool, drag it up if it's behind it,

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.085
no, it's in the right position.

00:03:50.085 --> 00:03:53.055
Turn my guides off, close that up.

00:03:53.055 --> 00:03:56.690
Great. There's a little contact box and put them all inside their own group.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.470
So remember using our trick, auto select on,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.075
drag a box across all of them,

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.790
move them all inside contact box.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.675
Turn that up, on an off. Here they all are.

00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:13.690
All right, and that's how to mock up a form in Photo-shop.
