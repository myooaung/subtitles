00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Welcome to the image production video,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.570
where I'm going to go through a few of the manual things or monotonous things.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.055
I've got my first circle.

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:10.634
What I want to do is make two other circles

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:12.555
and then I want to get rid of those rounded corners.

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:17.490
First of all, I'll use my trick by Command or Control clicking the layer,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.350
that's my guy here.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.365
What I want to do is I want to bend that layer,

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:25.410
get a rounded corner layer, I've got my team 2.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.545
Now, I want to use the same circle size.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:33.240
If I grab this team circle1 and I right-click it and go to duplicate.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.005
I'm going to call it team circle2, it's going to wreck it.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:43.470
Why? Because this team circle2 has appeared in between that clipping mask that I had.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.390
It's split it apart and wrecked it all.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.660
What I need to do is move that guy back down and join them back up by holding down

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.270
the Alt key on a PC or Option key on

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.700
the Mac and click these two again to get my clipping mask.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.830
Now, this team circle2,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.780
and he is here sitting right over the top.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.235
What I'm going to do is use my Move tool,

00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:04.790
hold down Shift so it drags straight and I'm going to drag it,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.710
so it's about in the center of my document.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.305
With it center, I'm going to turn that layer off,

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:12.450
drag at this center.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.120
Awesome. Great. Now I'm going to turn this guy back

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.420
on and I'm going to make a clipping mask.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.580
Maybe holding down the older Option key.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.980
I'm going to scale this top one using Control

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:32.435
T. I'm going to get it so he's filling up as much as we can with this cropped image.

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:34.550
The same thing to duplicate the circle.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.580
Again, the same problem.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.360
If I duplicate this guy,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.600
right-click, duplicate, I want it to be Team Circle3.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.190
It's split these two apart.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.350
I'm going to drag him back up there.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.405
Drag those two up, Circle3.

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:50.370
Drag them across to the edge.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.140
I'm going to bring in my next image.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.200
I'm going to go to File, Place Embedded.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.830
In my exercise files is one called team-3. Bring this one.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.280
I'm going to scale it down holding Shift, get it lined up.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.850
Hit Enter, pick a clipping mask,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.120
bit round, my keyboard.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.350
That's about right for me.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.480
What you'll notice is these guys aren't lined at all even

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.980
though I thought I was doing it was putting it

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.110
two columns that side, one column that side.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.410
What happens with, I'm trying to break it into threes.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.770
What I'm going to do is I'm going to turn on my helpful, where is it?

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.220
Down here right down the bottom is my helpful column guides.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.660
I'm going to break it into three columns, I'm going to turn that on.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.520
You'll notice that this is an easier way to get

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.320
things lined out rather than trying to count them.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.770
A new, select that layer,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.510
so team-1 and team-1 circle and team-1 is going to go into the center of this.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.695
Let me use this one here.

00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:51.990
Team member 2 and

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.540
I'm going to grab team member 3 and get them in the middle of the layer.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.605
I'm going to do add some type to them.

00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:02.310
Actually, I'm going to select you,

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.070
you, you, you, I'll move them above a little bit.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.365
Add some type, grab the Type tool.

00:03:07.365 --> 00:03:09.480
I'm going to click Escape there,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.340
I click once over here.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.215
I'm going to make sure it's centered and I'm going to type in my name,

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:19.860
Daniel Walter Scott.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.775
I'm going to select the text, make it black,

00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:24.935
click OK, and using the Move tool,

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:28.230
move it in, taking a little bit.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.470
Move it around zoom,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.690
then it's on the center of there,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.710
and that's going to be black. That's right.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.320
The size, I'm going to duplicate that layer.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.950
I'm going to use this tricky way by using my Move tool,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.080
hold down the Alt option key,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.080
click and drag it, and then you'll see it makes a duplicate.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.175
I'll change this one and I am the founder.

00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:56.175
I do caps to the FOUNDER.

00:03:56.175 --> 00:04:00.390
I'm going to make it Roboto.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.510
But I'll use just Regular.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.510
Size-wise, let's make it a little smaller.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.300
Make it down to 17.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.245
A little bit up. Next, put a text and put them on Twitter address.

00:04:15.245 --> 00:04:19.760
@danlovesadobe. Actually, I'm going to do it in caps.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.720
This one here is going to be the bold.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.585
Lovely. I'll want to duplicate these,

00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:29.225
so I use them again and again.

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:31.675
I'm going to grab all three of these.

00:04:31.675 --> 00:04:34.310
I'm going to hold down the Alt key on my keyboard.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.255
I'm on my Move tool and I'm going to drag it across.

00:04:37.255 --> 00:04:38.685
Holding Shift as well,

00:04:38.685 --> 00:04:41.475
Shift danlove but a finger gymnastics.

00:04:41.475 --> 00:04:43.700
What it means it's made duplicate of that whole chunk,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.950
you can see that's original copy, that's the new one.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.830
I'm going to change this one, switch to my Tag tool.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.830
This one here, it's John Smith,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.285
he is going to be, move slight here,

00:04:56.285 --> 00:04:58.235
he is going to be our developer maybe,

00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:05.510
and his Twitter address is going to be @johnsmith.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.425
Again, going to do the same for this lady here.

00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:09.590
I'm going to grab all three of these guys,

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.605
hold down Alt, drag it across, centered.

00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:14.810
She is definitely not John Smith.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.310
She's going to be Jane,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.260
I don't want to call it Doe, means she's dead.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.085
Let's call her Jane Smith, Jane even.

00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:26.310
She's going to be our designer,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:35.969
@janesmith.

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.940
The text for those, I'm going to turn off my, we're done the bottom here,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.980
I'm going to turn off my Helpful Column Guides,

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.195
especially just the third one there.

00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:47.380
Next, we're going to do is there's a bit of portfolio here.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.730
It's going to look like this with lots of different images around this little rectangle.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.545
With my guides on, it's going to help.

00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:55.000
I'm going to grab my Rectangle tool.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.020
I want my portfolio images to be into full columns.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.940
I want to spend just three of them each,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.830
it doesn't really matter what color the rectangles are,

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.560
because you are going to be clipping using Clipping Master the images,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.215
but it's painful when they're the same color as the background.

00:06:08.215 --> 00:06:10.420
I'll switch it to red. Don't move your guides,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.740
I want to edit undo.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.370
If you are finding your guides are moving and they shouldn't,

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.350
it's got a Lock Guides that don't move.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.330
I got my first rectangle.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.410
Instead of doing them one at a time like I did the circles,

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.990
I had the problem with the circles where I keep duplicating

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.810
the ellipses and it broke my clipping mask.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.460
I'm going to do it slightly different this way.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.410
I'm going to duplicate the rectangles before I go through and add my images.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.460
I've got both of these two images.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.755
I'm going to grab both of those.

00:06:36.755 --> 00:06:39.785
I wish they go across there.

00:06:39.785 --> 00:06:41.450
Grab those ones.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.625
Let's grab this one.

00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:46.480
Let's grab this last chunk.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.930
Close it down. I'm going to bring in my images.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.080
Let's name these before we get too far along,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.370
which ones we're dealing with.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.180
That's the number 1 there,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.190
no this was number 1.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.680
This one is going to be called Portfolio 1, copy up.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:10.240
It's going to be Portfolio 2, Portfolio 3,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.274
Portfolio 4, Portfolio 5,

00:07:16.274 --> 00:07:23.490
Portfolio 6, Portfolio 7, and Portfolio 8.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.450
To be honest, when I'm working by myself and I don't do this naming till the end.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.990
I'm doing it now to make a little easier for you to follow along.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.175
But quite often, I left as just a rectangle copy 15 as I'm going along.

00:07:34.175 --> 00:07:35.540
I'm going to bring some images,

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.030
I'm going to go to File and I'm going to go Place Embedded.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.050
I'm going to bring in Thumbnail 1.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.250
This is roughly the right size.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.170
I'm going to scale them down.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:54.495
Enter. I'm going to make sure he's above Portfolio 1 and clip them.

00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:58.500
Same again. Place Embedded.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:04.890
You get down to the right size, roughly.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:13.260
Quite. I'm going to stick them above Portfolio 2,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.560
clip it. Let's bring another one.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.260
If you are finding it's taking forever to do

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.120
things or at least quite monotonous and you want shortcuts.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.185
So Place Embedded is something that I use quite a bit.

00:08:24.185 --> 00:08:26.630
It's going to edit, create shortcuts.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.040
You can't go into here and say,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.580
I'd like this one that says File.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.560
This one in here that says Place Embedded and make a shortcut.

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.495
I'm going to go Command Shift I.

00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:38.640
It's already in use, I Select Inverse.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.490
Actually, I like that one, so I'm not going to do that one.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.390
I'm going to try Command Option Shift E. It's

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.605
already being used by Merge a copy of all visible layers.

00:08:48.605 --> 00:08:49.910
I don't use that shortcuts.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.695
I'm going to accept it.

00:08:51.695 --> 00:08:54.270
Just go with the top of that one.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:00.020
It means that now I can go Command Option Shift E. We'll go to my Place Embedded.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.810
Sum up to what? About the third one.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.200
So that you don't fall asleep and get super board,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.190
this is essentially the same thing over and over eight times.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:15.885
I'm going to skip along until we get to this last one right here. Over here.

00:09:15.885 --> 00:09:19.080
Now, it's here. All right back to regular speed now.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.830
That's the end of this production video where we've gone through,

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.650
we have done some clipping mouse, add some texts and got us up to speed.
