00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.420
In this video, we're going to look at where to get images from.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.950
Now when you're doing you concepts,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.170
you might be say you're working for yourself and you don't have

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.990
a budget for paid imagery or to get a photographer to work,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.550
you can find free images,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.350
commercial use stock images.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.665
This is probably the best site here it's called freeimages.com.

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:20.320
Now, if I want an image say of bricks,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.370
did I spell it right?

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.870
You'll find loads of free images for bricks.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.985
Now you got to be careful that these ones over here,

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:35.160
well, not careful, these ones over here are paid ones.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.880
So these always look very pretty and sexy,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.170
but these ones are downloaded from iStock.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.930
But you've got to pay. The prices are reasonable,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.340
but if you want free,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.510
we need these ones over here.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.490
What I like to do is not relevancy,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.070
but probably most downloaded tends to be

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.250
the ones that come to the top are the ones that are better shot,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.175
better quality, maybe ones that you might want to use more.

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:57.260
You'll have to login to download them and buy them.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.320
Say that you do want this with a brick look.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.435
Okay. You can download them,

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:04.880
and depending on the size that they're originally uploaded,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.960
you can download them.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.070
So you'll have to sign in and download it.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.070
It's free to sign in and it's a great way to get free stock images.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.600
Now if you want paid images,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.570
iStock is probably the best place to go.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.050
There's lots of competitors to iStock.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.090
Adobe have their own one at the moment called adobe.stock,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.150
but this one here is a real typical one to use for lots of people.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.635
So far on bricks in here,

00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:27.475
you'll find the quality is a lot better,

00:01:27.475 --> 00:01:31.655
you will find the resolution is quite higher than the free image.

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:33.620
Now say that I want this brick work here,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.960
I've decided that's the background that I want to use.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.255
It will come up with how many credits is going to take.

00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:40.535
This one here is going to cost me three credits.

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:43.720
Whereas say if I went to something like this one here,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.610
this one here I went to this one is one credit.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.400
Okay. Roughly C3 credits is 24 euros.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.385
Now if you're in the US, the Euro is about the same at the moment,

00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:58.180
not exactly, but close enough for comparison.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.540
There in budget for most small businesses.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.840
So to make it easy, I've downloaded a bunch of

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.650
free images that you can use for this particular tutorial.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.800
So download those if you haven't from the exercise files and we'll get on with importing.
