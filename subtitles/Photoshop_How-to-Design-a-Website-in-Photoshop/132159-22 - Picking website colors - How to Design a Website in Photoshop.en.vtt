00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
In this video, we're going to look at using color.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.205
Now you can attack color from a couple of ways.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.890
When you're drawing your boxes and coloring things in,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.215
you can use this little color panel here.

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:13.680
What you do is you drag this up and down to get the hue.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.000
Then we move this little circle around by clicking and dragging it to pick the color.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.850
You'll notice that in the front here is my foreground color.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.485
There it is down here as well.

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:24.930
If I got my type tool, can see here?

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.310
It'll use the same color.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.650
If I use my rectangle tool,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.230
it'll use whatever's in that foreground color, because watch this,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.900
I can change it and all of these things would change at

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.050
the same time and I can start drawing things and making color.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.864
To get a little bit more technical,

00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:42.590
if you are working on a brand of a company that has specific colors,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.670
you'll need to enter these,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.905
and you can do these by creating what's called a swatch.

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:48.950
To do a swatch, first we'll go a color, and what we're going to do is,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.360
instead of dragging things around,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.085
what we're going to do is double-click the swatch here and we're going to type it in.

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:56.930
If you're working with a brand that has existing colors,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.750
you can type in the details that you know.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.120
If you know the RGB color,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.330
you can type it in, say zero, say it's 200,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.300
and 220, it's going to give me this color,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.885
light blue, so I know exactly that that's the right color.

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:12.680
You might also get this number down here next to the hashes, the hexadecimal number.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.270
So you might get to type this in,

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.655
and it can be three or six digits,

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:18.475
depending on what you're given. Now both work.

00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:19.880
If you're given the CMYK details,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.110
you can pop them in here as well.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.690
To pick this color, say we've got this magic swatch that we need,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.775
we can click this one that says "Add to swatches".

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:33.595
We give it a name and let's call this one the example blue.

00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:36.070
What you'll notice is I'll click "Okay",

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.980
is in my swatches panel right down the bottom of this list here.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.830
Now there is this color here called example blue that I can reuse over and over again.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.960
Say if I switch to another color because I'm using

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.910
it and it's going to this pink, purpley color,

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.640
if I get my type tool now and I need to make some type that is blue,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.700
I just got to make sure that I click on "Blue"

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.160
before I start typing and it will change it.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.300
If I need to change it afterwards,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.135
I can select the type and then pick any swatch in here,

00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:05.140
and it will change once I go back to the move tool.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.965
Great. For the people that aren't following

00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:11.735
a real big guide for colors and you're able to pick your own colors,

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:12.950
you obviously can pick your own,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.070
but sometimes you can get caught up not knowing which color to pick,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.285
what works with what.

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:19.625
So what you can do is use something called Adobe Color.

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:20.750
Now it's built into Photoshop.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.760
Let's go to Window, down to extensions,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.650
and this one called Adobe Color themes.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.840
Open it up, you need to be connected to the net,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.425
and you need to be signed into your Creative Cloud account.

00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:33.175
Once you're in here, and this is one here could explore.

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:36.020
For inspiration, I like to go to this one that says most popular,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.580
and this is the one that's being most used by people through this little system here.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.070
Quite often to the top here is a nice group

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.770
of five colors that you can use to lay out your website.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.270
As part of daily color themes,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.850
you can go and upload your own swatches as well.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.280
So if you've created a corporate theme and you want

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.750
to share it with other designers throughout the business,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.320
what you can do is you can upload them to color themes.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.610
I won't cover it in this tutorial,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.360
but you can upload your own swatches to this Adobe Color themes.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.510
What I've done for you, if you type in B-Y-O-L,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.700
hit "Enter", you'll find the colors that I'm using

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.760
in this tutorial that you can download and use.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.120
Now, to download them and add them to your swatches,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.500
swatches versus Actions here,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.580
drop this down, and said, "Add to my swatches", and you'll see them.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.420
They all appear just from the bottom here of my swatches panel.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.630
What you'll also see is,

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.240
can you see they've been added to my library here?

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.480
If you're using an earlier version of Photoshop,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.800
this first part will work,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.360
but this library's option won't be,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.140
we're in 2015, this library option's a really great way to pick colors.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.575
So I'm going to pop that in and we all should be working off these colors now.

00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:37.610
Obviously through the store,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.720
you can pick your own colors,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.510
but if you want to follow along exactly, that's the way to do it.
