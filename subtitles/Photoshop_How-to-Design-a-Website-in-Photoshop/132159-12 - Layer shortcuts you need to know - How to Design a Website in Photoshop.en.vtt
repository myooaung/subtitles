00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
In this video, we're going to look at some of

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.475
the essential shortcuts you need in terms of dealing with layers.

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.260
Now, with layers panel you see down here,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.900
I'm working on a final image here.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.330
You can see the layers are being built up over time,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.890
and there are hundreds of them now.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.680
So it's not really practical to go through and try and remember the names of them all,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.555
so you'd know which layer you're working on. So you need a trick.

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:25.230
The best one and the one that I use constantly is make sure you're in

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.270
your move tool and make sure that your move tool is set to layer.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.985
Now what will happen is you're going learn a little shortcut.

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:35.295
We're on some random layer at the moment.

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:36.515
I want to click this word.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:40.140
This is More. Now I'm going to zoom a little bit, select More.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.340
What I need to do is hold down the command key on a Mac or the control key on the PC.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.630
What you'll notice is that,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.190
can you see up in the top EPA?

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.840
It changes this thing called auto-select.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.365
It just toggles it on while you need it.

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:56.195
If I hold down the command key and I click the word more,

00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:58.370
can you see in my layers panel, it jumped to the More.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.645
I can move this around.

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:02.090
Then say I want to move the green box as well.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.785
I'll hold down my command key and the little auto-select tool comes on, I click on this.

00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:10.030
Even though it's got some random name called Rectangle 2,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.495
I can still move it around.

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:13.670
Okay, so I can click More and move him across,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.455
click the rectangle, move him across.

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:18.080
Hold down Let's Make Awesome.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.710
It's just a really easy way to pick the layers and move them around

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.735
and really essential when you are working on such a layer heavy document.

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:27.810
I'm going to go to edit.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.300
Step backwards, and a step backwards,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.575
and a step backwards.

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.515
Another useful shortcut is if you've got

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:36.275
a really complex set of layers all on top of each other,

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:37.840
it's really hard to select the one you want.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.040
What you can do is let's pretend for a

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.380
second that we see this image in the background here?

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.660
I want to select using this little area here,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.690
but I can't because there is a black box in front of it.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.000
If I use my command click trick,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.015
it's going to pick this rectangular every time.

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:53.555
Of course, I can pick down here,

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:55.385
but that ruins my example.

00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:56.900
What I can do is if I

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.900
right-click and if you're on a Mac and you don't have a right-click, you control-click.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.120
If you're on a PC, it's easy to right-click and you'll

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.805
notice that it picks everything in my little layer order here.

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:10.325
That is the black rectangle.

00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:14.050
Underneath it there is something called layer 2 and that is my little image.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.830
Another useful shortcut that you're going to need is if you're

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.255
using my template and you're using the column grids.

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:24.440
You need to be able to go to view show guides.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.390
These can be really great when you're

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.340
lining things up but real pain when you're trying to look

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.900
at things visually because it ruins the look of everything with the lines everywhere.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.710
So the shortcut for this, if you're on a Mac,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.605
it's command and use the colon key on your keyboard.

00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:41.405
If you're on a PC, it's control and colon and you toggle these on and off.

00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:44.915
I do this quite a bit when I'm working with these grids when I want to line things up

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:49.500
and then I turn it off again when I'm trying to look at things and see how they line up.
