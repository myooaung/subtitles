00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
One of the rather more useful tools is your 'Transform Tool'.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.645
Now, I use this a lot through this class, and a lot on my own work.

00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:08.895
It's often used as a shortcut.

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:10.395
The long way is under edit,

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.750
and it's this one called free transform tool here.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.870
Now, I'm going to use the shortcut throughout this course,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.000
and it's really good one for you to learn as well.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.695
You can see on a Mac it's Command T,

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:23.760
and on a PC it's Control T. So I'm going to hit Command T on my keyboard.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.730
Watch this, because I've got my grid viewed here, okay?

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.380
If you haven't you're grid showing,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.025
got a view, show and go to guides.

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:38.000
Watch this, because my guides are out it'll snap to it and say I want it to get quite a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.370
bit bigger and I want to snap it out so it expands four columns here for this button.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.800
Great, so it will snap to the guides if it needs to.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.840
You could turn the guides off and it won't.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.175
Now a couple of other handy modifier tools is let's say the escape.

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:55.700
The escape gets rid of our transformation and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.760
let's go to Command T or Control T on a PC and watch this.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.195
If I hold down the Shift key while I'm dragging one of these corners,

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.810
can you see that the height and width is exactly the same?

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.175
So if I undo that,

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:08.675
if I don't hold the Shift key down,

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:11.225
I can move at any old sides I like, which is handy,

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:14.150
but also really good if you hold the Shift key down.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.045
Now I've hit escape again, let's look at one of the modifier key,

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:19.430
so Command T and it's the ALT key.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.720
So if we're holding the ALT key down,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.190
and say I want to make this four columns for holding the ALT key to this one side.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.775
Watch what happens? Can see the opposite side comes along for the ride.

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:28.920
That's the ALT key,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.905
if I hold that down while I'm stretching it out.

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:34.265
When you're finished and you're finished transformation and you like it

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:37.805
hit 'Enter' on your keyboard or 'Return' and that'll commit that.

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:40.980
That'll finish the transformation, you're ready to go.
