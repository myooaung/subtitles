00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.740
Now the most popular solution to handle different browser

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.665
sizes at the moment is the grid system.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:12.435
Of the grid systems,

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:15.510
something called Bootstrap is by far the most common.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.710
Now, whether you are using Bootstrap or any other way to build your website,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.470
you're probably going to be using the grid system.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.940
That's what we'll use in our Photoshop document.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.965
The grid system allows designers to work from a base 12-column grid.

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:32.880
Designers can spend any amount of those columns to suit their website.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.755
Let's take a look at this example of grid system here on Edward Robertson site.

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:40.965
You can see it up here, it's called responsivegridsystem.com.

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:44.435
Now, what you'll see down if I scroll all the way to the bottom here,

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:46.895
it starts at a base columns of 12.

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:50.900
Now, I'm yet to see anybody use exactly all 12 of

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.080
them unless there maybe bullet points or lists or something similar.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.000
What tends to happen is designers end up spending a few of these columns.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.530
Down the bottom here, you'll see that it starts at a base level of 12 columns.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.390
At the top here you can see we can easily span those 12 columns,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.535
say six of them and six again,

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:12.270
to curve our website in half.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.430
This is a really nice way.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.880
Twelve is a really nice number because we can cut it into thirds,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.010
and quarters, and sixs,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.935
all very easily using the 12-column grid.

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:24.555
This is another example here on Edward site.

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:28.770
You can see a couple of example layouts for responsive.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.640
Now, this intro page here,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.230
forget the heights because the heights are really short.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.620
But see the different cut ups in terms of the navigation.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.980
You can see here this is where my logo goes and this other chunk here,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.410
this other two thirds would be where my navigation goes.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.460
This is span at all and this might be say

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.830
a rotating carousel like they've got written here.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.680
These are feature boxes all curved into thirds.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.810
Four columns, four columns, four columns,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.045
and then my footer would be spanning all three.

00:01:56.045 --> 00:02:00.190
You can see here's a couple of different examples of ways of cutting out websites.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.410
I've switched here to the Photoshop file that you can download as

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.350
part of the exercise files and if you haven't done that,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.370
do that from the link below.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.500
Otherwise, you can create your own pages.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.955
Now what I've done is,

00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:13.910
if I go to "View" and I go to "Show", and I go to "Guides",

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.980
you'll see that it's been cut up into

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.710
columns of 12 with a bit of padding and between them all.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.235
I've done it for desktop, tablet and mobile.

00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:22.760
Now you'll notice here on mobile,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.585
the mobile doesn't actually have 12 columns like the tablet and desktop.

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:32.300
We do this because 12 columns on such a small size becomes this dense mass of

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.980
columns and nobody actually cuts a mobile site up into 12 distinct columns.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.350
Now, when deciding what pages and what sizes they should be,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.260
you can see the desktop here is 960 pixels wide.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.540
When you're deciding what size desktop should be,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.340
and tablet to be, and mobile to be,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.125
don't get too caught up on

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:54.964
actual pixel dimensions because there are so many different screen sizes,

00:02:54.964 --> 00:02:58.625
it's impossible to group them all together into one exact pixel size.

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:02.000
You pick a generic size that fits mobile, desktop,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.369
and tablets that are common at the moment,

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:06.790
and that's going to change as time goes along as well.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.930
Be prepared for in a couple of years when screen resolutions are all changed,

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.020
or there's a new feblety, desktopy,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.870
mobile version that you might have to go through and

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.400
design a separate style to accommodate that screen size.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.635
If you are looking for exact dimensions to get started with,

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:28.760
then you can download the Photoshop template that I've got in the resources.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.680
Or if you're using say Bootstrap,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.280
you can go and check Bootstrap to see what the media break star views.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.065
What they consider mobile is,

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:37.910
what they consider tablet is.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.125
If we can have a look.

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:41.780
Now I'm over at Bootstrap, at getbootstrap.com.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.365
I'm on the slightly preview version in version four.

00:03:45.365 --> 00:03:47.300
At the moment, we're up to version three,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.890
but version four will be out really soon,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.890
so we'll be using that for this course.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.340
Click "Documentation" then I go down to "Layout" and pick "Grid."

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.890
Now if I scroll down here,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.055
this one here says grid options.

00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:06.190
You can see here, here's my small case that'd be mobile in portrait.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.685
Then I've got small which is considered phone at landscape, medium tablet,

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:15.670
large is say a laptop screen and extra large is a really big say IMAX screen.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.490
You see the sizes here are written in this measurement called REM,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.870
which is a root EM.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.225
If you've never used this measurement before, don't worry.

00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:26.900
Essentially, you take the 45 and you times it by 16.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.475
Sixteen is considered the default size in a browser.

00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:34.465
So 45 times 16 gives us 720 pixels.

00:04:34.465 --> 00:04:36.600
If we go back to Photoshop,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.670
you'll see that I've used 720 pixels for this tablet.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.410
Now when we get up to Bootstrap five and Bootstrap six,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.330
that'll go and adjust these things depending on what the most common sizes are.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.160
They might get bigger, they might get smaller,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.070
whatever is really popular at the time.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.990
That's a good place for us to start for our Photoshop mock up.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.680
Now what I've done for you here as well is that these guides can be a

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.460
little hard to work with as well because they stretch past the pages.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.720
What I've done in here is,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.220
say you're working on your desktop view,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.430
you can toggle this layers down,

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.745
and you'll notice in here,

00:05:07.745 --> 00:05:09.890
I've got this one called helpful column guides.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.180
If I toggle that down,

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.395
I've laid out a couple of basic column grids. Watch this.

00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:17.380
I'm going to turn my View,

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.045
Show, Guides off and I prefer to work this way.

00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:23.480
If I'm doing something that is meant to be three columns,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.720
I'm going to click this on my three columns and it's just the transparent background,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.365
so that I know when I'm working with my document.

00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:35.260
I am dragging it around and I know I'm working within these three columns here.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.710
When you finish using the column,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.500
you can turn the eyeball on and turn off on another one to

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.640
work on a slightly different layout or a different grid system.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.100
Now you'll notice in this tutorial that we're using only three of the sizes.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.660
We're using the small,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.655
the less than 34ems for portrait mobile,

00:05:53.655 --> 00:05:54.855
the tablet and desktop.

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:57.260
Now we haven't done this one that's in-between here,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.510
which is our landscape phone.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.870
We haven't done the really large or extra large desktop as well.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.610
It's mainly just to keep the time down from this tutorial,

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.160
and it depends on I guess the level of complexity your website has.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.690
If it's a quick throw out website,

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.860
you might not spend as much time with the Excel or the small version,

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.575
which is the small landscape phone version,

00:06:18.575 --> 00:06:21.140
and until maybe the site is a little bit more mature.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.210
If you are working on a bigger project,

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.740
then definitely you're going to be looking at

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.380
all five media queries and all five sizes here in Photoshop.
