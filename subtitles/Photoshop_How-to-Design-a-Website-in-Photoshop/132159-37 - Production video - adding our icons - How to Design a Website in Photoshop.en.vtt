00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.280
It's going to be a production video.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.085
We're just going to add some text underneath our icons.

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:06.435
I'm going to grab my type tool,

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:09.075
click once and make sure it's at the center.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.745
I'm going to pick a color of white.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.805
I'm going to pick font or Roboto bold,

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:17.115
and the size wise, I'm going to bump it up to,

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:18.780
I'll show you, about 30 maybe.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.985
The first service is going to print,

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:23.170
it's going to be all caps.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.030
The next bit is I'm going grab my type tool.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.535
I'm going to put a little bit of body copy underneath it.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:33.940
I'm going to open up my guides to make sure I go over the top.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.300
It's going to be patterned and a little bit extra,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.325
and I'm going to add some text.

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:43.105
Remember, we going to go to type, Paste Lorem Ipsum.

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.410
It's going to put loads of Lorem Ipsum in there.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.965
Now, if I want to select all the Lorem Ipsum and change the size of it,

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.270
if I drag a box, unfortunately,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.345
if I change the size of this one down to something like 12,

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:54.785
you've only selected that part.

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:56.990
What you want to do is triple-click,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.220
so 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.565
When I said triple-click, I mean four clicks, so 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:05.580
it grabs every bit of text and it will grab the text that you cant see well.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.420
I'm going to bump this down to, say 14 pixels.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.120
We'll move it to, say the regular.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.970
How many lines do I want in this case?

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.915
I'm going to bump it up because I like the look of three lines.

00:01:16.915 --> 00:01:19.790
Remember also if I click in here with my type tool,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.750
I will turn my hyphenation off.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.065
To do it, click this little box here.

00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:27.020
Click Paragraph, turn Hyphenate off,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.675
and we'll get rid of that hyphenation that I don't like.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:31.790
What I like to do is these two text boxes here,].

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.890
I've going print and Lorem ipsum selected.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.230
I'm going to hold down the Alt key,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.550
actually turn my guides on first,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.150
holding my Alt key and use the move tool to drag out a copy.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.940
I'm holding down the Shift key while I'm dragging it,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.010
to make sure it comes perfectly to the side here.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.580
I'm going to do that for all of these.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.900
I'm going to drag them across.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.690
I've got four sets,

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.400
and I'm going to go in and change it.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.540
This one's called App Dev.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.920
This one here is going to be Photography, this is going to be Video.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.745
I'm going to leave the Lorem ipsum because it doesn't mean anything anyway.

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:07.025
Turn off my guards, make sure everything lines up.

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:08.880
Lines up okay, lines are okay.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.265
What I might do is I'm going to grab

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:14.850
all the Lorem ipsums and just bump them up a little bit. There you go.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.530
There's all four of them, and use my arrow keys

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.735
just to type them up so they join that bit a little bit.

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:21.250
What I also might do is grab my icons,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.055
I've icon 1, 2 and this other guy,

00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:25.690
there he is underneath my text.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.400
I like it along the base.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.560
Happy enough. That's the end of the production video.
