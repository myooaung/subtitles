00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
In this video, we're going to show you how to use layers a little bit more.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.510
Now, there's going to be times where you work on a document and you really

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.900
want to find something particularly on the document.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.170
Rather than going through and trying to find it through the search items,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.960
what you can do is you can use some of these search filters.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.080
Some of these layer filters along the top here.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.030
What you can do is say you want to find everything in this document that's typed,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.100
because say you've changed the body could be font

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.890
from Roboto back to Arial for some reason.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.440
What you can do is filter just the layers,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.785
you see these just have the type, and what I could do.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:33.270
Click the top one, hold Shift,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.550
click the last one and go up here into my type tool and change them all to Arial.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.855
I'll pick Arial bold.

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:45.300
Now you see everything is now Arial.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.615
That's an nice easy way to do that.

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:49.790
I'm going to undo that because I don't like Arial.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.860
So you want to go through and start playing with the colors.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.510
What you can do is you can click on this one here,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.920
it's just a shapes layers.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.785
All our rectangles appear.

00:00:56.785 --> 00:01:00.610
Say you've got a group of things that have a drop shadow on it,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.400
and you want to go and change the drop shadow.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.910
What you could do is you can go to this one, go to a fix,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.880
and use this drop down here and say everything that's got a drop shadow appeared.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.860
I got a thing using drop shadow in this case.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.290
I got nothing show in my last panel here.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.800
If you get to a point where you didn't realize you changed this

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.160
or you've opened up another document and it's got this layer effect applied too,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.970
what you can do is just flip the switch there to off.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.830
It goes back to normal, and you can turn on and off to toggle

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.070
between the last search and everything back on.
