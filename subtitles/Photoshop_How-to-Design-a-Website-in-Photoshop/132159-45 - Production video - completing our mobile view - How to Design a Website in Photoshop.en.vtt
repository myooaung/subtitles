00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
In this video, we're going to be at this one for a little while,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.120
because we're going to translate everything from our desktop to our mobile.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.980
You might be building mobile first,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.465
you might be doing the opposite,

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:12.900
unpacking it, giving it space to work,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.900
and use on a desktop. We're doing it the other way around.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.790
I've moved my first block along,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.260
which is called box navigation and box hero.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.860
I'm going to get rid of copy,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.355
and I'm going to start working on this one here.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.110
There's lots of elongation that's going to happen,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.300
there's some font sizes that I'm going to have to play around with,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.105
and some alignment to do. Let's get into it.

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:35.430
I'm going to zoom in, "Control Plus",

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.960
use my Spacebar to move around,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.400
maybe I zoomed in a little bit too much.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.510
Great. First thing is,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.905
I'm going to use let's make this happen,

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:42.675
grab the font size and drag it down.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.500
This is all right. What I might do is get it to break onto two lines actually,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.700
because it's getting quite small there.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.915
I'm going to select it,

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.675
bring it back up to our font size,

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:52.625
it's going to break down to that when it's on mobile.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:56.960
This bit of Lorem ipsum needs to come down and needs to get a lot.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.440
The box needs to get a lot smaller to fit in this impeding on the sides here.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.310
It's going to break to five lines, that's okay.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.050
Font sizing, I'll leave as is,

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.370
it's set to 16 pixels,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.190
which is a big enough font.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.600
When you're dealing with font size on mobile,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.830
you need to really test.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.210
But as a guess,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.380
their is about as small as I want to go,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.245
and 16 is quite a big font, but quite legible.

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.565
Because this is more kind of sales takes,

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:23.930
it's happy to be that little size,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.275
so I'm going make it just a tiny bit small.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:28.550
My more box is going to have to come down and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.535
this whole container is going to have to get bigger.

00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:33.545
I've got two parts to do.

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:35.825
I've got my box,

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:38.915
which is the underlying underneath my clipping pass there.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:41.135
I close it down, to make it easier.

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:43.945
I'm going to make this bigger first.

00:01:43.945 --> 00:01:47.840
You'll see that it's actually way off the sides of the pages. Is up to you.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.790
It doesn't really matter for our mock up,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.780
but just to make everything but more usable,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.295
I'm going to drag it in and it's going to be about that much bigger.

00:01:56.295 --> 00:01:59.180
You might have to resize the bricks image as well or

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.480
reposition it depending on where you want it to be or scale it down.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.965
I've used "Control T" and I'm going to scale it down to fit.

00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:09.455
You can see a bit more.

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:11.420
You'll notice that the blur has disappeared,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.420
but when I click "Enter" the blur will come back,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.530
eventually. I'm zoom in.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.815
I'm going to move both of these,

00:02:22.815 --> 00:02:25.530
I'm holding "Shift" to click both of them all, and move them around.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.240
That's going to be the hero box moved across.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.200
Next one is to do with the Hair box.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.105
I'm going to grab him,

00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:38.335
hold down "Alt" while I'm dragging it across, move it across.

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:40.610
Where am I going to position it?

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.935
I'm going to start so I can see it at all.

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:47.115
I'm going to butt it up the bottom,

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:50.080
the hero box, I'm going zoom in. How am I going to do this?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.020
What you're going to have to do is make some tough decisions when it comes to mobile.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.520
What's going to make for great experience?

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.560
For me I've decided that I'm going to get rid of

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.370
the copy and I'm going to decide that actually these two are gone,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.130
which is the rectangle and the image that sits at the top of it.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.445
I'm just going to use who we are and the Lorem ipsum there.

00:03:08.445 --> 00:03:09.960
Who we are needs to get smaller,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.285
grab my type tool click in here,

00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:14.355
I'm going to select it all, and bring it down,

00:03:14.355 --> 00:03:16.080
this one, grab this one.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.470
Move it in and I grab the "Lorem Ipsum" move it in,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.875
use my type tool to shrink the sides in.

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.040
How close to the edge you want to get?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.375
Just doing about I,

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:29.565
who we are, that padding.

00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:31.430
It's going work for me. Now this box is going to have

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.635
to get a little smaller or is he there.

00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:37.850
Here's my transform tool and what I might do is do what I did on the other box.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.850
Zoom out and just shrink it down so it's bit more appropriate.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.810
Next one we're going to do is the services box.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.000
I'm going to find my services box, there it's there.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.625
I'm going to zoom out and I'm going to "Alt",

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:53.140
drag it across. My muzzle start.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.600
Doesn't really matter where you start.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.460
Here we go. We've got lots to do in this one here.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.340
I'm going to grab that purple box.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.715
So it's called box services and a transform. It's great.

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:05.450
We're going to have to do some stuff for these icon.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.795
First of all, I want to get the icons to stack above each other,

00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:10.565
then I work on the text.

00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:12.200
All my icons, there they are.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.400
Now, these little boxes here,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.315
I'm going to twill down just to make them tidy up.

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:18.840
It's the color overlay, so I'm just going twill it up still.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.730
Just means, it looks a little prettier all my layers.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.465
I'm going to select all of them.

00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:27.200
What I might first do is actually just scale it down a little bit.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.650
I'm going to use my transform tool. How big?

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.435
It's probably very small, because I want to stack them on top of each other.

00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:36.085
In order to be roughly right there. Click "Enter".

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:37.755
Now what I'll do is,

00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:41.535
you can see my words are flown all around the place in terms of my document.

00:04:41.535 --> 00:04:43.965
Where are they all? There's one there, there's one there.

00:04:43.965 --> 00:04:45.090
It's because I was dragging them,

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.060
rounded up on different artboards and that's one

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.295
of the common problems with his new artboard systems.

00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:51.980
Caution on what you have to do is redrag them,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.805
just get them back to the same place. Watch this.

00:04:53.805 --> 00:04:58.615
I'm just going to drag them back to where it was and they all group back.

00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:01.310
I've got my print,

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.935
I've got my app there and my photography minute video.

00:05:03.935 --> 00:05:06.950
So the up one is going to go there, then the underneath,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.530
and the photography one, where is he?

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.200
There he is, over there.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.210
Come back, and then the video one,

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.430
where's he? There he is there.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.870
It's quite good to be out this far when you are dragging icons that I can a little bit

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.820
lost in the artboard because you notice before if I undo that,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.940
when I started dragging it,

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.290
it appeared up there and if you zoomed into close,

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.510
you'll never see it and you'll never know which way to drag it to.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.255
Just lining them up, I'm going to go print is going to be about

00:05:35.255 --> 00:05:37.745
there and I'll grab all of these guys and there's

00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:40.735
an option here that says align, all line up.

00:05:40.735 --> 00:05:43.375
Change the distribute centers, there's this option here.

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:46.750
Now, it never works perfectly distribute centers.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.250
You You feel if I zoom in,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.320
for me it feels like those gaps are even,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.835
but this one here is a lot bigger.

00:05:51.835 --> 00:05:53.455
Even though you have done that,

00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:55.045
I'm going to just make them a little bit bigger.

00:05:55.045 --> 00:05:57.665
I'm going to make video, take him down.

00:05:57.665 --> 00:06:01.065
I'm going to go to Photography, take him down.

00:06:01.065 --> 00:06:05.460
I'm taking him down using my keyboard and the app using the tap-down as well.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.535
Now comes the tick. I'm going to keep print.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:12.030
I've decided in this case that the Lorem ipsum down here,

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.400
the text is actually going to be too small to be usable in this field.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.940
I'm going to use the high level bits of text,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.920
so Lorem Ipsum, Lorem Ipsum,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.015
Lorem Ipsum, I'm going to bin.

00:06:25.015 --> 00:06:30.495
So I'm just going to use these four and trying get them all on screen,

00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:32.305
I'm going to left align them.

00:06:32.305 --> 00:06:34.265
What I'll do is print,

00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:38.115
move up, up, move to over there.

00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:43.470
Photography, move down, video move down, and change the size.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.290
They are pretty much determined by this photography one,

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.740
that's the largest of the gang and he hangs off the side.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.275
I'm going to do a couple of things. I'm going to select them all.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:58.270
Then across a bit, I want to grab all my icons. Pushing them across a bit.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.215
Back to my print,

00:07:01.215 --> 00:07:05.670
these guys, across, and I'm going to now grabbed my type tool.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.100
Because I have the most selected,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.705
I'm going to be able to change them all the same.

00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:10.910
I'm going to click and "Hold and drag"

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.670
and I'm going to make sure they're all left aligned.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.330
Go back to my Move Tool,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.730
align them all again on the left.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.065
I'll go back to my Type Tool and choose a font sizes.

00:07:24.065 --> 00:07:26.000
Actually back to my Move Tool, move him across.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.550
That's about me for the sizes.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.810
I'm happy with that.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.235
It's at what?

00:07:31.235 --> 00:07:34.565
Twenty three point and it all lines up.

00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:36.110
It all fits, is nice,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.620
clear distances between them to be able to tap them,

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.350
to jump to the services pages.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.700
Next, is going to be portfolio.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.375
Now, you'll notice in my desktop view,

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:47.450
I've got quite a big set of portfolios.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.905
We've got eight different blocks.

00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:51.680
What I'm going to do is I'm going to hide half of

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.710
them when it's done to mobile to give a good sense of what we do,

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.740
but not have this apically scrolling page because I'm

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.990
going to have one box on stacked on top of each other.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.610
You could try and do two.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.330
They can be quite small, I prefer in this case to do one.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.365
I'm just going to be four on top of each other and exclude the other four.

00:08:09.365 --> 00:08:11.610
What we're going to do is move them across to here.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.360
First of all, what I'm going to do is,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.960
instead of dragging the whole bunch of them across,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.450
I'm going to drag one at a time to make it a little bit easier on myself.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.870
This one here is, up on my desktop view,

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.865
this is under my portfolio.

00:08:22.865 --> 00:08:25.055
First thing I'm going to do is, I'm just right down the bottom here.

00:08:25.055 --> 00:08:26.870
It's this here, the box portfolio which is

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.760
this colored box in the background on hold "Alt",

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.535
I drag it across, get it lined up,

00:08:32.535 --> 00:08:34.365
transform to get him in there.

00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:38.105
You'll notice that my mobile view is too short,

00:08:38.105 --> 00:08:41.020
so I'm going to grab my Artboard Tool, click on it once.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.785
If that doesn't work, you've got to get the edge.

00:08:43.785 --> 00:08:48.335
If that doesn't work though, you just click the "High-level list" here on the navigation,

00:08:48.335 --> 00:08:51.600
drag it right down, because how big is this going to be?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.370
It's probably going to be a little longer than my actual desktop view.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.210
When you've finished, just got back to the Move Tool.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.935
How big should this colored box be? Probably quite long.

00:09:00.935 --> 00:09:02.825
It's going to fit all my portfolios in there.

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:06.590
Let's go up, what we do is portfolio 1,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.180
I'm going to drag him across, so I've selected

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.615
the box underneath and the image that is clipped to it.

00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:12.130
I'm going to hold down my "Alt key",

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.735
drag it across. That's that guy.

00:09:13.735 --> 00:09:17.190
I'm going to grab two and I'm going to hold "Alt", drag it across.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.580
I'm not scaled them yet, I'll try and do them all at the same time.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.790
Grab three, I'll drag it across and then four,

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.465
I'll drag him across.

00:09:24.465 --> 00:09:25.805
They're all in here.

00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:28.850
Now what we need to do is transform them all to be about the same size.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.490
I have selected them all in here and I click the "Bottom one" and

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.265
I hold "Shift: and click the "Top one" and it stacks everything in between.

00:09:34.265 --> 00:09:38.290
Let's use the transform tool and hold I "Shift" to make sure it's all perfect.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:39.550
I'm going to get them up to a size.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.505
It looks like it's going to fit, about there.

00:09:42.505 --> 00:09:46.765
Around. Okay. Nice and big to fit in the mobile view.

00:09:46.765 --> 00:09:48.130
So now I just need to line them all up.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.320
So I'm going to grab number two,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:57.280
and zoom in, and hopefully get in to snap together or at least line centered.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.365
I grab portfolio 3,

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:03.680
about to be centered, and the same thing with portfolio 4.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:10.225
Great, I'm going to make sure that this is a little bit shorter so it fits everything.

00:10:10.225 --> 00:10:11.860
I've been moving them around quite mechanically.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.280
If you want to join them up so that you can do things like distribute centers,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.590
because if I select all of these and do distribute centers,

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.735
it's not going to do what we want.

00:10:19.735 --> 00:10:22.690
It shifts the boxes separate from the images.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:26.425
So what you need to do is select each of them, right-click them,

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:29.095
or if you're on a Mac or a MacBook Pro with no right-click,

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:30.700
whole Control in your keyboard and then click them,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.290
and go to Convert to Smart Object,

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.505
and sticks them together.

00:10:33.505 --> 00:10:36.850
It's like grouping, but what you can do later on if you want to

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.285
get them apart again you right-click and there's one that says Edit Contents,

00:10:40.285 --> 00:10:42.535
and what happens is watch Photoshop, edit it.

00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:46.165
It opens up a separate tab with these little two guys by themselves.

00:10:46.165 --> 00:10:47.890
That can be a little confusing when you're new,

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.990
so only maybe you only use smart objects

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.285
when you're a little bit more experienced with Photoshop.

00:10:52.285 --> 00:10:55.135
Convert to Smart Object and these guys,

00:10:55.135 --> 00:10:57.355
Convert to Smart Object,

00:10:57.355 --> 00:11:01.615
and next step, great.

00:11:01.615 --> 00:11:02.830
Now they're core locked together,

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.765
I can now use that distribute centers.

00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:06.280
Let's look at the next bit,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.095
which is our teams.

00:11:08.095 --> 00:11:09.550
So I'm going to bring these across.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.895
I'm going to actually bring the whole thing across the teams box,

00:11:12.895 --> 00:11:15.685
and I'm going to drag it across,

00:11:15.685 --> 00:11:19.555
holding Alt and bring it all the way across to Mobile View.

00:11:19.555 --> 00:11:21.940
I'll start with this first one.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.549
Then in our team box,

00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:26.800
what I might do is group all of these guys.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.630
So I select them all, I'm going to go to Group,

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:35.095
and this one here is my Box Portfolio.

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:38.155
Okay, Box Team copy.

00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:41.244
Get rid of team with the OCD,

00:11:41.244 --> 00:11:48.340
and in here we've got and we'll grab Developer John Smith and his face.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.560
So there's our circle team,

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.540
Circle 2. I think that's all the guy.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.150
Great, I'm not going to resize this because it fits nicely in

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.375
Mobile and though I'm going to have to make the page even longer,

00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:03.445
but remember clicking the edge and then zoom out and I'm going to make it really big.

00:12:03.445 --> 00:12:09.925
I get back to the Move tool and what I want to do now is find Jane,

00:12:09.925 --> 00:12:11.710
the designer, Jane Smith,

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.570
and she was team three.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.775
Bring her across, and there she goes,

00:12:15.775 --> 00:12:21.475
zoom in, and make her in the middle.

00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:25.120
Okay, it looks like I've left off the bit of text for our man here,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.505
so where is he, he is John Smith.

00:12:27.505 --> 00:12:29.425
Where is that text, bring him in.

00:12:29.425 --> 00:12:31.240
What I might do is make the text little bit I guess.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.555
So we're stuck with Daniel being the longest one.

00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:37.765
Then you, Jane Smith and John Smith,

00:12:37.765 --> 00:12:41.545
and I grab my Tag tool and drag them a little bigger.

00:12:41.545 --> 00:12:44.590
That works, Daniel still fits in there.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.360
Then let's go to Designer, Developer,

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.925
Founder, let's maybe make it up to 20,

00:12:48.925 --> 00:12:51.100
just make it a little more legible in mobile,

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.085
and then grab all the Twitter handles,

00:12:54.085 --> 00:12:57.860
let's grab him from 17, let's put it up.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.800
Not 204 let's just do 24.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.110
Correct Move Tool, tap him down a little bit,

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.760
just make it a little easier for mobile.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.710
Great, everything's in its little boxes.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.750
Let's have a look at our Contact Form.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:16.195
So I'm going to select Contact Form in this top view,

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:19.405
and zoom out, hold on Alt, drag it across.

00:13:19.405 --> 00:13:22.480
I'll start with all of these guys.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.490
Grab the green box.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.700
Green box needs to get bigger and this wide.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.450
Now all of these guys,

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.030
so there is Form Name,

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.505
Form Email, Form iPhone,

00:13:36.505 --> 00:13:40.190
I'm going to transform them and zoom them in a little bit.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:45.205
What I might do is bump them across just so we'll use as much space as we can.

00:13:45.205 --> 00:13:47.410
I've selected them all, I've transferred them all in one in big go,

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.085
it means that all are going to line up and then worry up to Form Message.

00:13:51.085 --> 00:13:55.040
So I'm going to have to grab Form Message, drag him down.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:01.195
Okay, Transform him, get him to line up with these guys, grab Message.

00:14:01.195 --> 00:14:02.875
He's around there somewhere and there he is,

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:04.300
get him to line up with these guys.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.910
These are all probably a little too far to the left now.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.850
So I'm going to grab you, Email, Name,

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:14.410
Phone and drop you across. There you go.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.615
Last thing is this Submit button,

00:14:16.615 --> 00:14:18.985
I forgot to name it and this is going to be my Button,

00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:25.310
I grab the Submit, and what I might do for this one is just make it the full width.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:31.400
So selecting just the button, make it wider.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:39.535
Submit button across, shrink down the green bit, awesome.

00:14:39.535 --> 00:14:42.265
That's going to be my Form. Last bit is the Footer.

00:14:42.265 --> 00:14:44.185
When I zoom out I got my Footer here.

00:14:44.185 --> 00:14:46.075
So I'm going to grab the Footer,

00:14:46.075 --> 00:14:47.845
where is he, there it is there.

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:49.870
Alt, drag it across.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.970
I'll start with that side,

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.750
because there's little icons there.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.820
Grab these icons, move them across, great.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.920
Make the Footer a little bit taller,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.915
bring in that so it's not so wide.

00:15:01.915 --> 00:15:05.620
Whatever else, we've got Social icons and there was something else there it is there

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.925
the privacy and pieces.

00:15:09.925 --> 00:15:11.965
So I zoom in, great.

00:15:11.965 --> 00:15:15.850
So I might break that into two lines,

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:21.850
and make the font a little bit more legible on mobile.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.055
That's probably too big, let's just make it 16,

00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:25.645
it's not super important.

00:15:25.645 --> 00:15:28.570
Let's get it down to a nicer size.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.930
Transform my Footer and make him in the right size.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.150
Now let's get my Artboard in,

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:38.125
come on Artboard, and just get him to snap to the bottom there.

00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:41.365
Back to the Move Tool, click off somewhere else.

00:15:41.365 --> 00:15:43.210
See see the little bit of white line there,

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.980
I'm going to tap that up, excellent.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.065
That is my mobile version.

00:15:47.065 --> 00:15:50.140
Now this is a pretty quick mock up of our mobile layout.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.755
Now this video is really a how to make a mobile version.

00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:58.330
Now if you want to look at why you build different things on mobile versus desktop,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.440
you want to start looking into Dev world of user experience or UX design.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.990
You also have to start working with the website and

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.500
prototyping it so that you can see what it actually looks like in a website.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.390
It's one thing to design in Photoshop,

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.040
and it's another to see it working on

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.770
a mobile device and the different kinds of mobile devices.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.560
Whether it's a really big Huawei G7 like I've got,

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.305
or one of the little mini Samsung's that are around.

00:16:20.305 --> 00:16:22.540
You'll need to play around with both of them to make sure

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.835
that your site is actually usable.

00:16:24.835 --> 00:16:27.370
Last things I'll do before I leave this version is,

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.575
I'm going to tidy up my folders.

00:16:29.575 --> 00:16:32.425
So I've got my Footer, he should be in there.

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:36.580
My Submit button should be in that,

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.975
that should all be inside my Contact Form,

00:16:40.975 --> 00:16:43.090
and there's all my buttons with

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:47.750
my mobile Dropdown that can be turned on and off. All right, that's it for this video.
