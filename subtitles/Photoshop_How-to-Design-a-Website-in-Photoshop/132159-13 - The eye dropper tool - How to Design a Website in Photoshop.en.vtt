00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.925
Now the next tool in your web designer toolkit is going to be eye dropper tool.

00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:06.895
That's an easy tool for knowing which color that you're working with.

00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:09.285
It's hiding underneath the ruler tool

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.580
and it should be set to the eyedropper tool by default,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.800
but we were using this earlier, remember?

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.755
I'm going to use eyedropper tool and it's just really good for picking color.

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:18.435
I want to know what color this green is.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.700
I'm going to click on it and you'll notice that up here,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.780
my color swatches that points to it and here my foreground color it selects it.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.985
Let's double click the foreground color down here

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.560
and you'll notice that we get our hexadecimal number,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.465
and this is the number that generally gets used in web design to establish color.

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:38.260
There are some other ways to deal with RGBA which we'll look at later on,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.560
but you can use these RGB colors as well if you need to. Let's click "Okay".

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.005
That is the eyedropper tool for picking color.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.560
Let's say we want to use that color over and over again in our document.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.810
What you can do is you can create what's called a swatch.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.990
Now, to do a swatch, let's say I want this peach color here.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.030
If I select it, I can move it in

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.690
my swatch panels and I can use this little flag here that says "New Swatch"

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.000
and it uses my foreground color that was picked with

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.985
the algebra tool and I can call this BYOL Peach.

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:07.430
Click "Okay".

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.230
Now, what you'll do is you'll see him just appear

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.060
in the end of my little swatch panel here.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.460
That means that I get to reuse that when I need to.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.790
Let say that I want to switch it back to black and white,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.830
I'm going to use my rectangle tool and I'm going to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.930
draw a rectangle and it's going to be black.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.240
But what I can do is I can use this little drop-down and you'll

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.940
see there's my peach color at the end of my swatches,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.370
and I can reuse that color over and over.
